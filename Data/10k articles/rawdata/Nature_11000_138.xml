'''{{mp|2012 TC|4}}''' is a tumbling micro-[[asteroid]] classified as a bright [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="2017RadarUpdate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD-Phys-Properties" /&gt; It was first observed by [[Pan-STARRS]] at [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the Hawaiian island of [[Maui]], in the United States. As of 1 October 2017, it had a small Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert|0.000149|AU|km|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 12 October 2017, it passed Earth at {{convert|0.00033524|AU|km|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

Data from JPL 60 solution date 3 November 2017&lt;ref name="jpldata-CAD" /&gt;

=== 2012 Earth encounter ===
[[File:2012 TC4 observed (annotated).jpg|left|thumb|{{mp|2012 TC|4}} appears as a dot of this composite of 37 individual 50-second exposures.&lt;ref name="ESO" /&gt;]]

{{mp|2012 TC|4}} was discovered on 4 October 2012 at apparent i-band magnitude 20.1 while the asteroid was {{convert|0.03|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="MPEC2012-T18" /&gt; It came within 0.000634&amp;nbsp;AU (0.247 LD, 94,800&amp;nbsp;km, 58,900&amp;nbsp;mi) from Earth on 12 October 2012.&lt;ref name="jpldata-CAD" /&gt;

During the 2012 close approach, the asteroid only had an [[observation arc]] of 7 days, between 4 and 11 October 2012, so the exact distance of the 2017 closest approach was poorly constrained. With the 7 day observation arc, the asteroid had a [[3-sigma]] chance of passing between 0.00008818 and 0.002896 AU (0.034 to 1.127 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|LD]], 13,200–433,200&amp;nbsp;km, 8,200–269,200&amp;nbsp;mi) from Earth on 12 October 2017.&lt;ref name=CAD2012/&gt; Astronomers were certain that it would not pass closer than 6,800&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of Earth, ruling out any possibility that it could hit the Earth in 2017.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

On 12 October 2017 at 5:42 UT, the asteroid passed {{convert|0.00033524|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata-CAD" /&gt; Observations between July and October reduced the uncertainty region from several hundred thousand kilometers&lt;ref name=CAD2012/&gt; to about ±140 meters.&lt;ref name=Newsweek20171006/&gt;&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The asteroid was removed from the [[Sentry Risk Table]] on 16 October 2017 using JPL solution #56.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt; Prior to the encounter, it was rated −4.11 on the [[Palermo scale]], with a 1 in 1,000 chance of impact over the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt;

Paul Chodas of [[NASA|NASA's]] Center for near-Earth Object Studies, and [[Vishnu Vardhan Reddy|Vishnu Reddy]] of the University of Arizona's [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]], viewed the 2017 flyby (inside of the orbit of the Moon) as a way to test and refine the global asteroid detection and tracking network designed to give warning of objects heading toward Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt; Reddy coordinated the effort, involving over a dozen institutions worldwide.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UMD-2017-Campaign" /&gt; In addition to the observation campaign, NASA used this exercise to test communications between the many observers and also to test internal U.S. government messaging and communications up through the executive branch and across government agencies, as it would during an actual predicted impact emergency. Results of the campaign were published on 3 November 2017.&lt;ref name="Radar news"/&gt;

The asteroid remained too faint to be recovered with automated [[astronomical survey]]s until early September,&lt;ref name=possible/&gt; but a more targeted observation with the [[Very Large Telescope]] recovered it on 27 July 2017 at [[apparent magnitude]] 26.8, while the asteroid was {{convert|0.4|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth, making it one of the dimmest asteroid recoveries ever. As such, {{mp|2012 TC|4}} has become the first known asteroid ever to be observed passing less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar distance]] from Earth twice in a row.&lt;ref name=MPEC2017-P26/&gt; At the time of recovery the asteroid was about 100 million times fainter than what can be seen with the [[naked eye]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Apparent magnitude#Calculations|Math]]: &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt[5]{100})^{26.8-6.5}\approx 131800000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 times fainter than when it was discovered in 2012. As a result of the 2017 recovery observations, it was known that on 12 October 2017 at 5:42 UT, the asteroid would pass {{convert|0.0003352|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata-CAD" /&gt; Then at 19:19 UT, the asteroid would pass {{convert|0.001856|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Moon.&lt;ref name="jpldata-CAD" /&gt; {{mp|2012 TC|4}} peaked at about apparent magnitude 12.9,&lt;ref name="NEODyS20171012" /&gt; and was too faint to be seen without a telescope. The Earth approach of 2017 increased the asteroid's orbital period from 1.67 years to 2.06 years.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

{{mp|2012 TC|4}} reached a maximum apparent magnitude of 12.9 just prior to its closest approach, soon after which it came too close to the Sun to be seen with telescopes.&lt;ref name="NEODyS20171012" /&gt; It was last seen from [[Mauna Kea Observatories]] on 21 October 2017 at an apparent magnitude of 24,&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt; when the asteroid was 57° from the Sun.&lt;ref name=NEODyS/&gt;

=== Fast rotator and tumbler ===
Studies of the asteroid's [[light curve]] in October 2012, found it to have a [[rotation period]] of 0.2038 hours (or 12 minutes and 14 seconds) with a brightness variation of 0.93 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3-]]}}), which is indicative for a non-spherical shape.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot}} {{mp|2012 TC|4}} is a [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], which is rather typical for its small size. The fastest rotator currently known is [[2014 RC]], a similarly-sized NEO, with a period of only 16 seconds.
Lightcurves obtained during the 2017 encounter confirmed that {{mp|2012 TC|4}} is in a non-principal axis rotation, commonly known as [[List of tumblers (small Solar System bodies)|tumbling]].&lt;ref name="Ryan-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radar news"/&gt; The spin axis varies on timescales of minutes, with a second period of 0.142 hours (or 8.5 minutes).&lt;ref name="UMD-Phys-Properties" /&gt; The lightcurve amplitude suggests a ratio of largest to smallest axis of at least 2.3.&lt;ref name="Ryan-2017" /&gt;

=== Radar observations ===
Radar images were taken from [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone Observatory]] and [[Green Bank Telescope]] on 12 October 2017. The delay-doppler images had a range resolution of 1.9 meters/pixel, the highest resolution ever obtained using Goldstone transmissions.&lt;ref name="2017RadarUpdate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017RadarAnimations"/&gt; The images showed that {{mp|2012 TC|4}} was a very elongated object about 50 feet (15 meters) long and roughly 25 feet (8 meters) wide.&lt;ref name="Radar news"/&gt; The high circular polarization ratio found for {{mp|2012 TC|4}} is consistent with results seen from [[E-type asteroid|E-]] and [[V-type asteroid|V-type]] NEAs previously.&lt;ref name="2017RadarUpdate"/&gt; Observations from [[Arecibo Observatory]] were planned, but had to be cancelled due to damage to the observatory as a result of [[Hurricane Maria]].&lt;ref name="Radar planning"/&gt;

=== Composition ===
The spectrum of {{mp|2012 TC|4}} is that of an [[E-type asteroid|E-]] or [[X-type asteroid|Xe-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Ryan-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017RadarUpdate"/&gt; E-type asteroids tend to have a high albedo (&gt;0.30). This agrees with the albedo of 0.35 found for {{mp|2012 TC|4}}.&lt;ref name="2017RadarAnimations"/&gt; This type of asteroids is commonly found in the [[Kirkwood gaps|inner Main Belt]].&lt;ref name="Fornasier-2011a"/&gt;

{{mp|2012 TC|4}} is composed of [[igneous rock|igneous material]].&lt;ref name="Radar news"/&gt; The short rotation period of {{mp|2012 TC|4}} implies that it is not a [[rubble pile]] but rather a monolithic object of non-negligible strength, which is typical for very small asteroids.&lt;ref name="Ryan-2017" /&gt;

== Orbit change ==
As a result of {{mp|2012 TC|4}}'s frequent approaches to Earth, its orbit changes significantly over short periods of only decades. Its two observed close approaches and their effects are shown below:

Between 2012 and 2017, {{mp|2012 TC|4}}'s average distance from the sun increased by almost 0.4 AU, with the time it takes to orbit the sun increasing by 250 days. Its closest approach to the Sun also increased significantly, from 90% of the Earth's distance to the Sun to 97%, and its inclination lowered slightly, going from 1.4 degrees to less than 1/2 a degree relative to Earth's orbit.

As a result of non-gravitational forces such as the [[Yarkovsky effect]] on small bodies, it is difficult to constrain its orbit more than a few decades into the past or future.

'''2014 AA''' was a small [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] [[near-Earth asteroid]] roughly 2–4 meters in diameter that [[Impact event|struck]] Earth on 2 January 2014.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt; It was discovered on 1 January 2014 by [[Richard Kowalski]] at the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19 using a {{convert|1.52|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt; 2014 AA was only observed over a short observation arc of about 70 minutes,&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt; and entered Earth's atmosphere about 21 hours after discovery.&lt;ref name="news182a"/&gt; Nonetheless it remains one of only a few asteroids observed before impact (see [[Asteroid impact prediction]]).&lt;ref name="JPL-new-discovery-2018-LA"&gt;{{cite news

==Entry==
Using a [[Uncertainty Parameter U|poorly determined orbit]], the [[JPL Small-Body Database]] listed a [[3-sigma]] solution with impact occurring around 2 January 2014 02:33 [[Universal Time|UT]] ± 1 hour and 5 minutes.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The [[Minor Planet Center]] listed impact as occurring around 2 January 2014 05:00 UT ± 10 hours.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt; Independent calculations by Bill Gray, the Minor Planet Center and Steve Chesley at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] verified that impact was virtually certain.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt;

The impactor would have been roughly the size of {{mpl|2008 TC|3}}, which exploded above the [[Nubian Desert]] in Sudan on 7 October 2008. Calculations by Chesley suggest the impactor fell somewhere on an arc extending from Central America to East Africa, with a best-fit location just off the coast of West Africa.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-A02"/&gt; Calculations by Pasquale Tricarico using the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit show that 2014&amp;nbsp;AA entered Earth's [[Umbra|shadow cone]] approximately 40 minutes before entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Remanzacco"/&gt;

[[Infrasound]] was detected by three stations of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T140102"/&gt; Peter Brown and [[Peter Jenniskens|Petrus Jenniskens]] located weak signals from infrasound stations in Bolivia, Brazil and Bermuda.&lt;ref name="news182a"/&gt; 2014 AA entered Earth's atmosphere around 03:06 ± 5 min UT&lt;ref name="Farnocchia2016"/&gt;, 3,000&amp;nbsp;km from [[Caracas]], Venezuela, far from any landmass.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T140102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnocchia2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The trajectory and atmospheric impact of asteroid 2014 AA|first1=Davide|last1=Farnocchia|first2=Steven R.|last2=Chesley|first3=Peter G.|last3=Brown|first4=Paul W.|last4=Chodas|date=1 August 2016|journal=[[Icarus]]|volume=274|issue=|pages=327–333|arxiv=|bibcode=2016Icar..274..327F|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2016.02.056 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516001354}}&lt;/ref&gt; No ships or planes reported witnessing the event.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T140102"/&gt; A recalculation of the impact parameters of this meteor based on infrasound recordings gives a longitude of impact of nearly 44º West and a latitude of 11º North, the impact time being 2456659.618 JD UTC.&lt;ref name="Marcos2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homing in for New Year: impact parameters and pre-impact orbital evolution of meteoroid 2014 AA|first1=C.|last1=de la Fuente Marcos|first2=R.|last2=de la Fuente Marcos|first3=P.|last3=Mialle|date=13 October 2016|journal=[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]|volume=361|issue=11|pages=358 (33 pp.)|arxiv=1610.01055|bibcode=2016Ap&amp;SS.361..358D |doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2945-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10509-016-2945-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive numerical simulations indicate that, prior to impact, 2014 AA was subjected to a number of secular resonances and it may have followed a path similar to those of the [[Near-Earth object|NEOs]] {{mpl|2011 GJ|3}}, {{mpl|2011 JV|10}}, {{mpl|2012 DJ|54}}, and {{mpl|2013 NJ|4}}; NEOs in this transient group experience close encounters with the Earth-Moon system at perihelion and Mars at aphelion and could be a dynamical family.&lt;ref name="Marcos2016"/&gt;

== Other discoveries ==
Kowalski previously discovered {{mpl|2008 TC|3}}, the first asteroid discovered before Earth impact, using the same telescope in October 2008.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T140102"/&gt; There are about a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] near-Earth objects in the size range of 2014 AA, and impacts of comparably-sized objects occur several times each year.&lt;ref name="news182a"/&gt;

Several years later, [[2018 LA]] was also discovered by the Mount Lemmon Survey, and ended up impacting Earth in southern [[Botswana]] in June 2018.

Programs concentrate on science, education and adventure (research expeditions for citizen-scientists). Since 2017, 5 Gyres has been in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The organization's 2015 Expedition was featured in the 2017 documentary "[https://www.thesmogofthesea.com/ Smog of the Sea]," produced by Jack Johnson, who participated in the voyage.

5 Gyres was founded by Anna Cummins and Marcus Eriksen.

In 2012, 5 Gyres was first to discover that plastic microbeads (commonly found in personal care products like toothpaste and exfoliating soaps) were polluting our waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Sherri A.|last2=Kammin|first2=Laura|last3=Eriksen|first3=Marcus|last4=Aleid|first4=Ghadah|last5=Wilson|first5=Stiv|last6=Box|first6=Carolyn|last7=Williamson|first7=Nick|last8=Riley|first8=Anjanette|date=2016-08-01|title=Pelagic plastic pollution within the surface waters of Lake Michigan, USA|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133016300922|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|volume=42|issue=4|pages=753–759|doi=10.1016/j.jglr.2016.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 Gyres used that study to help forge a coalition that convinced companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson and L’Oreal to phase out plastic microbeads. After only two years, the campaign scaled into a national movement, culminating in a watershed victory when President Obama signed the Microbead-Free Waters Act into law at the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/microbead-free-waters-act-president-obama-signs-new-law/|title=Environmentalists applaud new law banning microbeads|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This win underscored 5 Gyres’ model of using science to drive solutions, and informed the organization's approach to raising awareness about polystyrene and Styrofoam plastic pollution through their 2017 {{Not a typo|&lt;nowiki&gt;#foamfree&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} Action Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5gyres.org/styrofoam/|title=Styrofoam|website=5Gyres.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which:

* Encourages a pledge to refuse single-use polystyrene and expanded polystyrene foam (better known as Styrofoam) products.
* Connects visitors with local bans (or the resources to start one).
* Gives them the ability to tweet, email or call their representatives for support.
* Informs supporters about preemptive “ban on bans” developments.
* Commissions the first-ever study to assess the toxicity of ''hard'' polystyrene plastic.

With more than 100 communities in California recently enacting polystyrene bans, and a statewide ban on the ballot for 2018, 5 Gyres sees polystyrene as a natural extension of the momentum that began with microbeads.

[[Image:Glacial-abrasion-ss-2006.jpg|thumb|[[Glacier|Glacially]] abraded [[rock (geology)|rocks]] in western [[Norway]] near [[Jostedalsbreen]] gntration]]

'''Abrasion''' is a process of [[erosion]] which occurs when material being transported wears away at a surface over time. It is the process of [[friction]] caused by scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, and rubbing away of materials. The intensity of abrasion depends on the [[hardness]], [[concentration]], [[velocity]] and [[mass]] of the moving particles. Abrasion generally occurs four ways.&lt;ref&gt;Westgate, L. G. (1907). Abrasion by Glaciers, Rivers, and Waves. The Journal of Geology, 15(2), 113-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, James Stewart, Reed Wicander, &amp; Richard W. Hazlett. (2011) Physical Geology: Exploring the Earth. Cengage Learning {{ISBN|9781111795658}}. pg 465,591&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glaciation]] slowly grinds rocks picked up by ice against rock surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Matthew M., &amp; Neil F. Glasser. Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms. (2011) Ch. 5 Glacial abrasion. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781119966692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid objects transported in river channels make abrasive surface contact with the bed and walls. Objects transported in waves breaking on coastlines cause abrasion. And, finally, abrasion can be caused by wind transporting [[sand]] or small stones against surface rocks.

Abrasion, under its strictest definition, is commonly confused with [[attrition (erosion)|attrition]]. Both abrasion and attrition refer to the wearing down of an object. Abrasion occurs as a result of two surfaces rubbing against each other resulting in the wearing down of one or both of the surfaces. However, attrition refers to the breaking off of particles (erosion) which occurs as a result of objects hitting against each other. Abrasion leads to surface-level destruction over time, whereas attrition results in more change at a faster rate. Today, the [[geomorphology]] community uses the term "abrasion" in a looser way, often interchangeably with the term "wear".&lt;ref&gt;Chatanantavet, P., &amp; Parker, G. (2009). Physically based modeling of bedrock incision by abrasion, plucking, and macroabrasion. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 114(F4). http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008JF001044/full&lt;/ref&gt;

==In channel transport==
Abrasion in a stream or river channel occurs when the sediment carried by a river scours the bed and banks, contributing significantly to erosion. In addition to [[chemical weathering]] and the [[physical weathering]] of [[hydraulic action]], freeze-thaw cycles (see [[frost weathering]]), and more, there is a suite of processes which have long been considered to contribute significantly to [[bedrock]] channel erosion include [[plucking (glaciation)|plucking]], abrasion (due to both [[bedload]] and [[suspended load]]), [[solution]], and [[cavitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Whipple, K. X., Hancock, G. S., &amp; Anderson, R. S. (2000). River incision into bedrock: Mechanics and relative efficacy of plucking, abrasion, and cavitation. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 112(3), 490-503. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c264/c8e0d4cdef47279e585c5a7c09d409c67f52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, J. D. &amp; Castillo, M. M. (2007). Stream ecology: structure and function of running waters. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-5582-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedload transport consists of mostly larger [[clasts]], which cannot be picked up by the velocity of the stream flow, rolling, sliding, and/or [[Saltation (geology)|saltating]] (bouncing) downstream along the bed. Suspended load typically refers to smaller particles, such as silt, clay, and finer grain sands uplifted by processes of [[sediment transport]]. Grains of various sizes and composition are transported differently in terms of the threshold flow velocities required to dislodge and deposit them, as is modeled in the [[Hjulström curve]]. These grains polish and scour the bedrock and banks when they make abrasive contact.

==In coastal erosion==
Coastal abrasion occurs as breaking [[Wind wave|ocean waves]] containing sand and larger fragments erode the [[shoreline]] or headland. The [[hydraulic action]] of waves contributes heavily. This removes material, resulting in undercutting and possible collapse of unsupported overhanging cliffs. This erosion can threaten structure or infrastructure on coastlines, and the impact will very likely increase as [[global warming]] increases [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, K., Douglas, B. C., &amp; Leatherman, S. P. (2004). Global warming and coastal erosion. Climatic Change, 64(1-2), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seawalls]] are sometimes built in defense, but in many locations, conventional coastal engineering solutions such as sea walls are increasingly challenged and their maintenance may become unsustainable due to changes in climate conditions, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and sediment supply.&lt;ref&gt;Temmerman, S., Meire, P., Bouma, T. J., Herman, P. M., Ysebaert, T., &amp; De Vriend, H. J. (2013). Ecosystem-based coastal defence in the face of global change. Nature, 504(7478), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrasion platforms are shore platforms where wave action abrasion is a prominent process. If it is currently being fashioned, it will be exposed only at low tide, but there is a possibility that the wave-cut platform will be hidden sporadically by a mantle of beach shingle (the abrading agent). If the platform is permanently exposed above the high-water mark, it is probably a [[raised beach]] platform (aka, marine terrace), which is not considered a product of abrasion, but may be undercut by abrasion as sea level rises.

==From glaciation==
Glacial abrasion is the surface wear achieved by individual clasts, or rocks of various sizes, contained within ice or by subglacial sediment as the glacier slides over bedrock (Krabbendam &amp; Glasser 2011). Abrasion can crush smaller grains or particles and remove grains or multigrain fragments, but the removal of larger fragments is classified as [[plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] (or quarrying), the other major erosion source from glaciers. Plucking creates the debris at the base or sides of the glacier that causes abrasion. While plucking has generally been thought of as a greater force of geomorphological change, there is evidence that in softer rocks with wide joint spacing that abrasion can be just as efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Krabbendam, M., &amp; Glasser, N. F. (2011). Glacial erosion and bedrock properties in NW Scotland: abrasion and plucking, hardness and joint spacing. Geomorphology, 130(3-4), 374-383.&lt;/ref&gt; A smooth, polished surface is left behind by glacial abrasion, sometimes with [[glacial striations]], which provide information about the mechanics of abrasion under temperate glaciers&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, N. R. (1991). Morphology of glacial striae: implications for abrasion of glacier beds and fault surfaces. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 103(10), 1308-1316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From wind==
Much consideration has been given to the role of wind as an agent of geomorphological change on Earth and other planets (Greely &amp; Iversen 1987). [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] processes involve wind eroding materials, such as exposed rock, and moving particles through the air to contact other materials and deposit them elsewhere. [[Mathematical models]] of these forces are notably similar to models in [[fluvial]] environments. Aeolian processes demonstrate their most notable consequences in [[arid]] regions of sparse [[vegetation]] and abundant unconsolidated sediments, such as sand. There is now evidence that bedrock canyons, landforms traditionally thought to evolve only from the fluvial forces of flowing water, may indeed be extended by the aeolian forces of wind, perhaps even amplifying bedrock canyon incision rates by an order of magnitude above fluvial abrasion rates.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, J. P., Finnegan, N. J., &amp; De Silva, S. L. (2015). Amplification of bedrock canyon incision by wind. Nature Geoscience, 8(4), 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Redistribution of materials by wind occurs at multiple geographic scales and can have important consequences for regional [[ecology]] and landscape evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Okin, G. S., D. A. Gillette, and J. E. Herrick. (2006). "Multi-scale controls on and consequences of aeolian processes in landscape change in arid and semi-arid environments." Journal of Arid Environments 65.2: 253-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amy C. Clement''' is an atmospheric and marine scientist studying and modeling [[Climate change|global climate change]]. Her research focuses on cloud albedo feedbacks, ocean circulation patterns, and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). She is currently a professor at University of Miami's  Rosenfield School.

== Early life and education ==
Clement was born in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] but moved to Long Island, New York shortly after, where she spent most of her adolescent life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forecastpod.org/index.php/2016/01/14/amy-clement-questions-the-core-ideas-of-climate-dynamics/|title=Amy Clement questions the core ideas of climate dynamics|date=2016-01-14|work=Forecast: a podcast about climate science and climate scientists|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement attended [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]] where she received a B.A. in Physics. She received her Ph.D from the Earth and Environmental Science program at [[Columbia University]]. Her studies continued at the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|University of Pierre and Marie Currie]] in Paris, France where she conducted her postdoctoral work.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://people.miami.edu/profile/a.clement@miami.edu#panelCareer|title=Amy Clement|website=people.miami.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, Clement's parents, who worked as an engineer and a writer respectively, held high expectations for their children to do something important.  She was therefore drawn to science as a young child, volunteering in labs to extend her curiosity of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career and research ==
Clement is a climate scientist studying atmospheric and oceanic interactions related to climate change. She studies the physics of climate modeling, and strives to understand the mechanisms of climate change to refine a global climate model. Clement is currently a professor at [[University of Miami|University of Miami's]] Rosenfield School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She is involved in a long term project focused on understanding the importance of tropical regions in [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] for her global climate model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of Clements primary research topics focuses on the role of the cloud [[albedo]] feedback in a warming climate. Her studies examine low-altitude clouds, which are capable of reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space. She studies the relationship between the cover of these clouds and the rate of warming to examine the role of clouds. Clements findings support this theory in that as climate and oceans warm, low laying clouds form less frequently, which lowers the albedo of the earth (more infrared radiation is absorbed rather than reflected), leading to a warmer climate with less clouds. As most in of her research, these findings support a [[positive feedback]] warming cycle in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1912448,00.html|title=In a Warming World, Cloudy Days Are a Boon|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=2009-07-24|work=Time|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Clement has conducted significant research on the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO), which is known to play a large role in the climate system. Clement and her researchers somewhat controversially suggest that atmospheric and ocean dynamics need not be connected in order to understand tropical climate and their associated global patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanleadership.org/university-of-miami-sstudy-rethinks-the-oceans-role-in-pacific-climate/|title=University of Miami Sstudy Rethinks the Ocean's Role in Pacific Climate {{!}} Ocean Leadership|website=oceanleadership.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was awarded the James B Macelwane Medal in 2007.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://honors.agu.org/winners/amy-c-clement/|title=Amy C. Clement - Honors Program|work=Honors Program|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macelwane Medal is presented to young scientists who has made significant contributions in the realm of [[Geophysical Sciences|geophysical sciences]]. Clement was nominated for this award because of her research in tropical atmospheric and ocean dynamics. In conducting this research, she focused on how the atmosphere and ocean interact with both orbital changes and the [[thermohaline circulation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://honors.agu.org/winners/amy-c-clement/|title=Amy C.

'''Aspen parkland''' refers to a very large area of [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between [[prairie]] and [[boreal forest]] in two sections, namely the [[Peace River Country]] of northwestern [[Alberta]] crossing the border into [[British Columbia]], and a much larger area stretching from central [[Alberta]], all across central [[Saskatchewan]] to south central [[Manitoba]] and continuing into a small part of the US state of [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dnr.state.mn.us/ecs/223/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aspen parkland consists of groves of [[aspen]] poplars and spruce interspersed with areas of prairie grasslands, also intersected by large stream and river valleys lined with aspen-spruce forests and dense shrubbery. This is the largest boreal-grassland transition zone in the world and is a zone of constant competition and tension as prairie and woodlands struggle to overtake each other within the parkland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900 |author= Sarah Carter |year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7995-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhjguytskOkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Aspen+parkland%22| page=19| accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article focuses on this biome in North America. Similar biomes also exist in [[Russia]] north of the [[steppes]] ([[forest steppe]]) and in northern [[Europe]].

== Definitions ==
According to the [[Ecological Framework of Canada]], published in 1999, the '''Aspen Parkland ecoregion''' (#156) is the largest and northernmost section of [[Prairies Ecozone]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/Prairies/ecoregions.html&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is the arc-shaped region (i.e. including the WWF's central and foothills parkland but excluding the Peace River region). Partly defined by climate, it had a mean annual temperature of approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C circa 1999, and rainfall varied from 400–500&amp;nbsp;mm/annum. It was thought to include the communities of [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton]] in Alberta; [[Lloydminster]] on the Alberta–Saskatchewan border; [[North Battleford]], [[Humboldt, Saskatchewan|Humboldt]], and [[Yorkton]] in Saskatchewan; and [[Brandon, Manitoba]] as its major population centres and have a total population of 1.689 million. By this definition, there are approximately {{convert|5500000|ha}} of this ecoregion in the province of Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag1497&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] the '''Canadian Aspen forests and parklands''' (NA0802) encompass eight ecoregions as used in the Ecological Framework of Canada: the [[Peace Lowland]], [[Western Boreal]], [[Boreal Transition]], [[Interlake Plain]], '''Aspen Parkland''', and [[Southwest Manitoba Uplands]] (TEC 138, 143, 149, 155, 156, 161, 163, and 164). These ecoregions lie in both the [[Boreal Plains Ecozone]] and the [[Prairies Ecozone]] (Ecological Stratification Working Group 1995). The Boreal sections are [[Manitoba Lowlands]], [[Aspen-Oak]], [[Aspen Grove]], [[Mixedwood]], and [[Lower Foothills]] (15-17, 18a and 19a).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na0802&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The aspen parkland biome runs in a thin band no wider than 500&amp;nbsp;km through the [[Prairie Provinces]], although it gets broader to the west, especially in [[Alberta]]. This is a hilly landscape with many small lakes and ponds. The cities of [[Edmonton]] and [[Saskatoon]] are the largest cities completely in this biome while Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass [[prairie]] to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, and [[Calgary]] is bordered by [[prairie]] to the east and the Foothills Parkland to the west.

There are three main sections of aspen parkland: Peace River, Central, and Foothills. The Central Parkland is the largest section and is part of main band of aspen parkland extending across [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]], bordered by [[prairie]] to the south and the [[boreal forest]] to the north. The [[Peace River Country]] is located along the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] region of the province, extending across the border into northeastern [[British Columbia]], and is completely surrounded by boreal forest, cutting it off from the Central Parkland, it extends as far north as [[Fort Vermilion]] at 58°N 116°W. The Foothills parkland covers the [[Foothills of the Rocky Mountain]]s as far south as Waterton Lakes National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raysweb.net/specialplaces/pages/parkland.html|title=Alberta's Parkland Region|work=raysweb.net|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pc.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/waterton/natcul/natcul1/g.aspx |title=Parks Canada - Waterton Lakes National Park - Green Scene - From Bottom To Top |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The region has a [[Humid continental climate]] accompanied by a subhumid low boreal transitional grassland ecoclimate.&lt;ref name="WWFinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Aspen forests and parklands|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na0802|website=WWF|publisher=World Wildlife Foundation|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are warm and short and winters can be long and cold. The Mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|0.5|to|2.5|C}}, with Summers ranging {{convert|13|to|16|C}}, and winters ranging {{convert|-14.5|to|-12.5|C}}. The [[Peace River Country]] in [[Northern Alberta|northwestern Alberta]] and northeastern areas of the [[British Columbia Interior#Northern Interior|North Interior]] in [[British Columbia]] has the coolest climate, but still supports extensive farmland. [[Southern Manitoba|Southwest Manitoba]] sees the warmest. Annual precipitation is usually between {{Convert|375|to|700|mm}}.&lt;ref name="WWFinfo"/&gt; [[Chinook winds]] off the foothills also occur in winter, mainly affecting [[Alberta]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[File:QuakingAspenSK.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' ("trembling" or "quaking" aspen) is the dominant tree species of the parkland belt. Shown here in fall colours in west of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.]]
Four significantly different habitats are common in the aspen parklands: The [[fescue]] prairie, the woodlands, the ravines and the wetlands and lakes. A rarer habitat type, [[Tallgrass Aspen Parkland|tallgrass aspen parkland]], occurs only in the extreme southeastern corner of the aspen parklands biome (southeastern Manitoba/northwestern Minnesota). The fescue prairie is a meadowland rich in vegetation variety which forms the cover for the development of the richer soils that underlie the parklands. The close association with woodlands and wetlands makes this a choice location for many plants and a preferred range or home site for a wide diversity of wildlife. The richer soil and increased precipitation favours the natural growth of fescue grass, but varying conditions such as moisture level and grazing pressures allow for the invasion of secondary plant species.

There are numerous grasses and sedges in the fescue prairie. Gravelly and rocky terrain is a good location for parry oat grass. Dry areas favour June, porcupine and spear grass. Wet areas are often covered with slender wheat grass and timber oat grass. Prairie rose and snowberry are common shrubs found in these grasslands.

The forested, or woodlands area is dominated by trembling aspen ''([[Populus tremuloides]])'', balsam poplar ''([[Populus balsamifera]])'', other poplars and [[spruce]]s, although other species of trees do occur. Pines, mostly [[jack pine]] and [[lodgepole pine]] will often grow in areas that have sandy soil conditions. Other native species may include [[box elder]], [[tamarack]] and [[willow]], while the foothills area in the southeast of the region, such as [[Turtle Mountain (plateau)|Turtle Mountain]] or [[Spruce Woods Provincial Park]], have woodland of [[white spruce]] and [[balsam fir]] but quaking aspen will domninate where the woodland has been cleared by fire. The proportion of forests to grasslands has increased somewhat over the prairie in areas not affected by agriculture in the last 100 years. This increase is partly due to the reduction of prairie fires which used to destroy the new saplings on the fringes of the aspen groves. Also, it was a common practice for farmers to plant stands of trees as windbreaks.

Aspen woodlands support an extensive [[understory]] consisting of mid-sized and small shrubs, some herbs and ground cover. Spruce-dominated woodlands usually do not support a dense understory due to more acidic and nutrient-poor soils and a denser canopy, which reduces sunlight reaching the forest floor below. However, in areas where a mixture of aspen and spruce occur, a fairly dense understory can still thrive. The mixed wood understory, as it is called, supports the greatest diversity of forest wildlife in the aspen parkland.

Large shrubs such as [[red-osier dogwood]], [[beaked willow]], [[juneberry|saskatoon]], [[chokecherry]] and [[pincherry]], along with the smaller shrubs including [[prickly rose]], [[snowberry]], [[beaked hazelnut]] and [[Viburnum trilobum|high bush cranberry]], form a dense entangled understory. Dense shrubbery is a typical feature in aspen-dominated forests. Common herbs found in the woodlands include: [[Lindley's aster]] ''(Aster ciliolatus)'', [[northern bedstraw]] ''(Galium boreale)'', [[pea vine]], [[Western Canada violet]] ''(Viola canadensis)'', [[dewberry]] and [[Cornus canadensis|bunchberry]]. Mosses appear at the base of trees and on the ground.

Wetlands are very common in this biome, including lakes, shallow open water, marshes, and grassy wetlands. Glacial erosion has contributed to such features by creating depressions in which standing water can collect. In the larger depressions, permanent lakes or ponds of water remain. Many of the lakes have a saline character, thus most shore vegetation has a high tolerance of [[salty soil]]s. These lakes are known as [[Soda lake|alkali lake]]s. Wet meadows are flooded in the spring and dry by fall. They contain [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and grasses and provide excellent opportunities to study the similarities and differences of these forms of vegetation.

Rivers and streams erode valleys throughout the parkland ecoregion. Steep hills and ravines result in a unique topography. Southwest slopes with increased exposure to the sun are dry and often more grass covered, while the shaded north and east exposures retain more moisture and tend to have greater forest cover. Some forms of vegetation unique to the ravines include: [[Populus|poplar]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], [[willow]], and [[river alder]].

[[Wildflower]]s are an important component of the grassland association of the parkland. Look for common [[yarrow]], cut-leaf [[anemone]], [[rock cress]], [[creeping white prairie aster]], [[milk vetch]], [[late yellow loco weed]], [[goldenrod]], [[Wild Prairie Rose|prairie rose]], [[prairie crocus]], and [[lilium columbianum|tiger lily]].

===The aspen understory===
There are three main factors which influence the understory vegetation in the aspen stands of the mixed wood forest.

1. Good sun exposure encourages a dense vegetation growth below the canopy. This is of particular importance in the early spring before the trees are in leaf.

2. Warm soil and air temperature at the base level result in rapid melting process in spring which favours the growth of shrubs.

3. A large percentage of precipitation passes through the canopy. This provides a protective snow cover in winter and in warm seasons precipitation percolates through the leaf cover to nourish plants which require surface soil moisture.

The result of the above factors is an extensive understory of vegetation in the aspen forest. Common shrubs and herbs are: [[juneberry|saskatoon]], [[red-osier dogwood]], [[raspberry]], [[Rosa acicularis|wild rose]], [[Ribes|currants]] and [[bracted honeysuckle]], [[wild sarsaparilla]], [[hairy lungwort]], [[asters]], and [[Lathyrus|peavine]]. [[Twinflower]], [[strawberries]], bunchberries, [[horsetail]]s and [[wintergreen]] form an attractive grown cover.

The mineral soil is covered by a decaying cover of organic matter.  Numerous [[consumer]]s and [[decomposer]]s create [[humus]] materials. Burrowing animals mix the new fertile materials with the soil to form a rich rooting compound.

===The spruce forest understory===
Factors which influence the understory vegetation of spruce stands in the [[boreal forest]] association include:

1. Year round reduced sun exposure below the canopy restricts the forest undergrowth to shade tolerant species.

2. A large percentage of the precipitation is trapped in the upper tree boughs of the spruce forest and is released through evaporation. The ground cover of [[feather moss]] quickly absorbs most of the moisture which does penetrate the canopy. These factors combine to cause drier conditions in the underlying mineral soils.

3. The fallen [[acidic spruce]] needles are not fully decomposed and combine with the moss base. Water held in the moss carries the acid from the spruce needles into the mineral soil and leaches out soil nutrients – leaving a highly acidic, low nutrient soil base which is unsuitable for most boreal vegetation.

As a result of the above factors the forest floor ranges from nearly devoid of vegetation to a dense carpet of feather moss. A sparse community of shade tolerant shrubs exists in this environment. Some species of plants in the understory are [[Green Alder]], low bush [[cranberry]], prickly rose, bunchberry, [[twinflower]], wild [[lily-of-the-valley]], [[northern Comandra]] and wintergreens.

===The mixedwood stands understory===

There are several factors which influence the [[mixedwood stand]]s in the boreal forest.

Where there are stands of aspen and spruce forests in close association with each other, a mixed wood forest occurs. Each group forms its own microassociation as described previously.

When the spruce and aspen forest types are mixed, the result can be quite different from the aspen or spruce stands. Animal and vegetation associations from each type combine to create considerable diversity of habitat which is typical of either spruce or aspen stands. The mixture of the [[transition soil]]s provides an attractive environment with either pure spruce or pure aspen woodlands. An example of a bird which prefers a mixed wood habitat is the [[yellow-rumped warbler]].

The mixedwood forest wetlands consist mainly of [[bog]]s, [[fen]]s and marshes. [[Black spruce]], [[tamarack]], [[willow]] and bog and [[sphagnum moss]]es are the major vegetation types found in these lowlands. [[Dwarf birch]] and sedges cover large, wet areas with [[jack pine]] occurring on the sandy ridges.

For boreal [[aspen]] stands less than 40 years old, Comeau (2002)&lt;ref name="com"&gt;Comeau, P.G. 2002. Relationships between stand parameters and understory light in boreal aspen stands. B.C. Journal of Ecosystems and Management 1(2) Available at http://jem.forrex.org/index.php/jem/article/view/240/159&lt;/ref&gt; found that basal area provided a useful general predictor of understorey light levels, but, on the basis of light measurements in one 80-year-old stand, cautioned that relationships between understorey light and basal area may not hold in older stands. The literature indicates that the height growth of understorey spruce should be maximized when light levels exceed 40% or when aspen basal area is  &lt; 14 m²/ha. Models developed by Wright et al. (1998)&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;Wright, E.F.; Coates, K.D.; Canham, C.D.; Bartemucci, P. 1998. Species variability in growth response to light across climatic regions in northwestern British Columbia. Can. J. For. Res. 28:871–886.&lt;/ref&gt; show radial growth of understorey white spruce increasing almost linearly with increasing light and a continuous decline in radial increment with increasing aspen basal area. When applied to Comeau's (2002)&lt;ref name="com" /&gt; data, the Wright et al. (1998)&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt; models suggest that spruce mortality will remain very low until aspen basal area exceeds 20 m²/ha, above which mortality will increase rapidly.

==Fauna==
Wildlife in the parklands include [[moose]] ''(Alces alces)'', [[white-tailed deer]] ''(Odocoileus virginianus)'', [[American black bear|black bear]] ''(Ursus americanus)'', [[coyote]] ''(Canis latrans)'', [[Northern Pocket Gopher|northern pocket gopher]]s ''(Thomomys talpoides)'', [[thirteen-lined ground squirrel]]s, [[Richardson's ground squirrel]]s, [[North American beaver]] ''(Castor canadensis)'', [[snowshoe hare]] ''(Lepus americanus)'', [[weasel]]s and [[gray wolf]] ''(canis lupus)''. Bear, moose, foxes, coyotes, beaver, snowshoe hare and red squirrels are found most often in the mixedwood stands compared to the aspen forests and spruce forests.

Burrowing rodents such as Richardson's ground squirrels, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, and pocket gophers play a major role in the balance between the aspen groves and the grassland. These excavators make mounds of fresh soil which are ideal locations for the germination of poplar seeds. Once established, these trees spread by suckering, thus creating a new aspen groves.

[[White-tailed deer]] finds shelter in the aspen and graze on the grasslands; [[coyote]]s and [[fox]]es hunt the resident rodents. Historically, [[bison]] grazed on the grassland and helped to prevent the spread of aspen groves. However, bison are now mostly absent due to over hunting during settlement in the 19th Century and extensive loss of habitat due to agriculture. Bison, however, can still be seen in protected areas such as [[Elk Island National Park]] east of [[Edmonton]] and in farms, where they are raised for meat.

Wildlife in the woodlands is varied and abundant. The varying hare, weasel, fox, coyote, and white-tailed deer make their homes in this region, while water dependent mammals who make the ravines and wetland areas of the ecoregion their home are beaver, [[muskrat]]s, otters and mink.

Birds of the aspen parkland include [[kingfisher]]s, [[ruffed grouse]], [[magpie]]s and [[northern oriole]]s. and in particular several species of warblers find this a preferred habitat.

Extensive cultivation has disturbed the habitats of some birds which nest and feed on the fescue grassland. However, the [[horned lark]] and [[meadowlark]] have managed to adapt to the new conditions. [[Song sparrow]], [[vesper sparrow]], and [[American goldfinch]] can often be seen in open areas.

The woodlands meanwhile are abundant with a variety of bird species. [[Black-capped chickadee]], [[hairy woodpecker]]s, [[ruffed grouse]], [[magpie]]s, and [[great horned owl]]s can be observed in all seasons. Summer residents include: [[red-eyed vireo]], [[least flycatcher]] and northern oriole.

Birds which prefer the wetland habitat include [[kingfisher]]s and [[bank swallow]]s. Finally there is an abundance of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and [[Canada geese]] nest in the more remote marshes. Blackbirds, [[marsh wren]]s and [[black tern]]s nest in the reeds. [[Franklin gull]]s nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: [[avocet]], [[piping plover]], [[spotted sandpiper]], [[willet]], [[common snipe]] and [[killdeer]].

The invertebrate population in the woodland is enormous.  Some of the most common invertebrates are roundworms, snails, segmented worms, centipedes, mites, spiders and mosquitoes. Poplar [[gore beetle]]s and [[forest tent caterpillar]]s are destructive to the [[tree cover]]. Insects of the wetlands in this region include [[caddis fly|caddis flies]], [[mayfly|mayflies]] and [[black fly|black flies]].

==Human use, threats and conservation==
[[File:Flying over a branch of the Saskatchewan River in Alberta.jpg|thumb|right|The mixture of small patches of trees near rivers and patchworks of farm fields are typical of parkland.  Shown here is the [[North Saskatchewan River]] in Alberta circa 2008.]]
Before European colonization, there were large areas of western aspen and aspen parkland in the west of what would become Canada and the United States.  This was maintained by light to moderate fires with a frequency of 3 to 15 years.  Fire also swept the [[Rocky Mountains]] aspen as frequently as every ten years, creating large areas of parkland.  Settlement increased fire frequency in the late 19th century until fire suppression became popular.&lt;ref name="Brown2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/4554|title=Wildland fire in ecosystems: effects of fire on flora|last=Brown|first=James K.|author2=Smith, Jane Kapler|year=2000|work=Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 2|publisher=Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station|page=40|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the aspen parkland, like the [[prairie]] biome, has been extensively altered by agriculture over the last 100 years since settlement first began in the late 19th Century. While the climate is generally cooler than in the [[prairie]]s, the climate is still mild and dry enough to support large-scale farming of crops such as [[canola]] (Brassica napsus), [[alfalfa]] (Medicago sativa) and [[wheat]] (Triticum aestivum), and livestock grazing. The soils in the aspen parkland biome are also quite fertile, especially around [[Edmonton]] and [[Saskatoon]]. Oil and natural gas exploration and drilling have also disturbed the natural habitat, especially in Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. As a result, less than 10% of the original habitat remains.

The largest blocks of intact parkland can be found in [[Moose Mountain Provincial Park]] north of [[Carlyle, Saskatchewan]] and [[Bronson Forest]] in Saskatchewan, and [[Elk Island National Park]] and [[CFB Wainwright|Canadian Forces Base Wainwright]] in Alberta. The rest of the parkland area does contain fragments of original habitat, some in protected areas such as [[Spruce Woods Provincial Park]] and [[Turtle Mountain Provincial Park]] in Manitoba, and [[Porcupine Provincial Forest (Saskatchewan)|Porcupine Provincial Forest]] in Saskatchewan.

==Human cultures==
The First Nations of this region were not solely [[buffalo-hunting]] [[nomads]], as were tribes to the south. They also relied to a great extent on trapping (rabbits, etc.) [[fishing]], and deer and moose hunting, as well as gathering parkland berries, such as the [[Saskatoon berry]] or the [[Viburnum edule|high bush cranberry]].

This area was one of the most important regions of the [[fur trade in North America]].  Both the [[Assiniboine River fur trade|Assiniboine]] and [[Saskatchewan River fur trade|North Saskatchewan]] rivers were major fur trade routes, with a number of fur trade posts, much more so than rivers to the prairie south. The [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] were formed around these posts from the intermarriage of white fur traders and native trappers.

Once European settlement began, this region was desired by the peasant farmers of [[Eastern Europe]] and the smallholders of [[Quebec diaspora|Quebec]] for its wooded land, so that they could build and heat their own homes. This is as opposed to the primarily British and American settlers, who desired grasslands that were easier to break and plough. At the time, people of similar backgrounds were allowed to concentrate into [[block settlements]] by the federal government: for example the [[Edna-Star colony]] in Alberta, the largest concentration of Ukrainians on the prairies.

As a result of these different styles of indigenous hunting agricultural settlement, the ethnic makeup of the [[Prairie Provinces]] is somewhat divided north and south. [[Cree people|Cree]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], [[French Canadians|French]], and [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian]] Canadians are concentrated in the parkland belt, and in parkland cities such as [[Edmonton]], [[Saskatoon]], and [[Winnipeg]] as opposed to prairie cities like [[Calgary]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], which were settled more so by people of Blackfoot, Sioux, American, English, and German backgrounds.

The '''baptism of Jesus''' is described in the [[gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. [[Gospel of John|John's gospel]] does not directly describe [[Jesus]]' baptism.

Most modern theologians view the [[baptism]] of Jesus by [[John the Baptist]] as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.&lt;ref name=Harring63/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopez95/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chilton187/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell47/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whois31/&gt; Along with the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], most biblical scholars view it as one of the two historically certain [[fact]]s about him, and often use it as the starting point for the study of the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt;

The baptism is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name="digby"&gt;''Essays in New Testament Interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 {{ISBN|0-521-23783-1}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 {{ISBN|0-8028-6496-1}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Christian denominations]] view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian rite of [[baptism]] (see also {{Bibleref2|Acts|19:1–7}}). In [[Eastern Christianity]], Jesus' baptism is commemorated on 6 January (the [[Julian calendar]] date of which corresponds to 19 January on the [[Gregorian calendar]]), the feast of [[Epiphany (Christian)#Eastern Christian Churches|Epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/calendar/feasts/01.06_Bogojavlenie/istoria.htm Богоявление и Рождество Христово]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Lutheran]] Churches and some other [[Western Christianity|Western denominations]], it is recalled on a day within the following week, the feast of the [[baptism of the Lord]]. In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the [[Rosary#Luminous Mysteries|Luminous Mysteries]] sometimes added to the [[Rosary]]. It is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Trinitarian feast]] in the Eastern Orthodox Churches.

==In the Synoptic Gospels==
Mark, Matthew, and Luke depict the baptism in parallel passages.  In all three gospels, the [[Holy spirit]] is depicted as descending upon Jesus immediately after his baptism accompanied by a voice from Heaven, but the accounts of Luke and Mark record the voice as addressing Jesus by saying "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased", while in Matthew the voice addresses the crowd "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" ({{bibleref2|Matthew.3:13-17;Mark.1:9-11;Luke.3:21-23||NIV|Matthew 3:13–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–23}}).&lt;ref name="Zanzig118" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EerRoger"&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' by James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3711-5}} p. 1010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponessa27"&gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} pp.&amp;nbsp;27–31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the baptism, the [[Synoptic gospels]] describe the [[temptation of Jesus]], where Jesus withdrew to the Judean desert to fast for forty days and nights.

; Matthew
In {{bibleref|Matthew|3:14|NIV}}, upon meeting Jesus, John said: "I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?" However, Jesus convinces John to baptize him nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Ponessa27" /&gt;   Matthew uniquely records that the voice from heaven addresses the crowd, rather than addressing Jesus himself as in Mark and Luke.

; Mark
Mark's account is roughly parallel to that of Matthew, except for {{bibleref2|Matthew|3:14-15|NIV}} describing John's initial reluctance and eventual consent to baptize Jesus, which is not described by Mark.

; Luke
{{see also|Nativity of St. John the Baptist}}
Luke 1 begins with the birth of John the Baptist, heralded to his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]] by the angel [[Gabriel]]. Six months later Gabriel appears to the [[Virgin Mary]] with an announcement of the birth of Jesus, at the [[Annunciation]]. At the same, Gabriel also announces to Mary the coming birth of John the Baptist, to her kinswoman Elizabeth, who is the wife of Zacharias. Mary immediately sets out to visit her kinswoman Elizabeth, and stays with her until John's birth. Luke strongly contrasts the reactions of Zacharias and Mary to these two respective births; and the lives of John and Jesus are intertwined.

Luke uniquely depicts John as showing public kindness to tax collectors and encouraging the giving of [[alms]] to the poor (as in {{bibleref2|Luke|3:11|NIV}}). Luke records that Jesus was praying when Heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him. Luke clarifies that the spirit descended in the "bodily form" of a dove, as opposed to merely "descending like" a dove.  In {{bibleref2|Acts|10:37-38|NIV|Acts 10:37–38}}, the ministry of Jesus is described as following "the baptism which John preached".&lt;ref name="Who77" /&gt;

==In the Gospel of John==
[[File:Ottavio vannini, san giovanni che indica il Cristo a Sant'Andrea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jesus (left) is being identified by [[John the Baptist]] in {{bibleref2|John|1:29|NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lamb of God'' by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ottavio Vannini|Vannini]], 17th century.]]
In {{bibleref2|John|1:29-33|NIV|John 1:29–33}} rather than a direct narrative, John the Baptist bears witness to the spirit descending like a dove.&lt;ref name="Zanzig118"&gt;''Jesus of History, Christ of Faith'' by Thomas Zanzig 2000 {{ISBN|0-88489-530-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QMyiWpV-dx8C&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20the%20Baptist%22&amp;f=false p. 118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnEBrown25" /&gt;

The [[Gospel of John]] ({{bibleref2|John|1:28|9}}) specifies "Bethabara beyond Jordan", i.e., [[Bethabara|Bethany]] in Perea as the location where John was baptizing when Jesus began choosing disciples, and in {{bibleref2|John|3:23|9}} there is mention of further baptisms in [[Ænon]] "because there was much water there".&lt;ref name="BigPic"&gt;''Big Picture of the Bible – New Testament'' by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 {{ISBN|1-57921-928-4}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sloyan11"&gt;''John'' by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 {{ISBN|0-8042-3125-7}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleref2|John|1:35-37|9|John 1:35–37}} narrates an encounter, between Jesus and two of his future disciples, who were then disciples of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Boring292"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0VC1rzAtgFsC&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;pg=PA291#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20the%20Baptist%22&amp;f=false The People's New Testament Commentary]'' by Eugene M.

== In the Gospel of the Nazarenes ==
According to the non-canonical [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]], the idea of being baptized by John came from the mother and brothers of Jesus, and Jesus himself, originally opposed, reluctantly accepted it.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, quoting "The Gospel According to the Hebrews" in ''Dialogue Against Pelagius'' III:2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Urrutia]] avers that this version is supported by the [[Criterion of Embarrassment]], since followers of Jesus would not have invented an episode in which Jesus changes his mind and comes to accept someone else's plan. Plus, the story came from the community that included the family of Jesus, who would have guaranteed the authenticity of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, ''The Logia of Yeshua / The Sayings of Jesus'' (1996), {{ISBN|1-887178-70-8}}  p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|thumb|right|[[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the [[Jordan]]ian side of the [[Jordan River]] are the location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]].]]

The Gospel of John ({{bibleref|John|3:23|9}}) refers to [[Ænon|Enon near Salim]] as one place where [[John the Baptist]] baptized people, "because there was much water there".&lt;ref name="BigPic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sloyan11" /&gt; Separately, {{bibleref2|John|1:28|NIV}} states that John the Baptist was baptizing in "Bethany beyond the Jordan".&lt;ref name="BigPic" /&gt; This is not the village [[Bethany]] just east of Jerusalem, but is generally considered to be the town Bethany, also called [[Bethabara]] in [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] on the Eastern bank of the Jordan near [[Jericho]].&lt;ref name="Sloyan11" /&gt; In the 3rd century [[Origen]], who moved to the area from [[Alexandria]], suggested Bethabara as the location.&lt;ref name="Charles437"&gt;''Jesus and Archaeology'' by James H. Charlesworth 2006, Eedrsmans {{ISBN|0-8028-4880-X}} pp.&amp;nbsp;437–39&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] stated that the location was on the west bank of the Jordan, and following him, the [[Byzantine architecture|early Byzantine]] [[Madaba Map]] shows Bethabara as (Βέθαβαρά).&lt;ref name="Charles437" /&gt;

The biblical baptising is related to springs and a Wadi (al-Kharrar) close to the Eastern site of the [[Jordan River]],&lt;ref name="Synop29"&gt;''The Synoptics'' by Jan Majernik, Joseph Ponessa and Laurie Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  not the Jordan itself.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wo Johannes taufte|url = http://www.zeit.de/1999/52/199952.jordanien_.xml|website = ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate = 2015-12-09|date = 22 December 1999|publisher = Rosemarie Noack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage sites, important for both Christians and Jews have shifted place during history.

== Chronology ==
{{Main|Chronology of Jesus}}
The baptism of Jesus is generally considered as the start of [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]], shortly after the start of the ministry of John the Baptist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg224"&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pp.&amp;nbsp;224–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alister16"&gt;''Christianity: An Introduction'' by Alister E.

Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pp.&amp;nbsp;67–69&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea&amp;nbsp;... , the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two approaches to determining when the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]] started.&lt;ref name="art201" /&gt; The traditional approach is that of assuming that the reign of Tiberius started when he became co-regent in 11 AD, placing the start of the ministry of John the Baptist around 26 AD. However, some scholars assume it to be upon the death of his predecessor [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in 29 AD.&lt;ref name="art201"&gt;''Luke 1–5: New Testament Commentary'' by John MacArthur 2009 {{ISBN|0-8024-0871-0}} p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

The generally assumed dates for the start of the ministry of John the Baptist based on this reference in the Gospel of Luke are about 28–29 AD, with the ministry of Jesus with his baptism following it shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Eerdmans246" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CEvans67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostenberger140"&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J.

[[File:Baptism of Christ by Tiffany.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Stained glass window]] of Jesus' baptism by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]].]]

Most modern scholars believe that [[John the Baptist]] performed a baptism on Jesus, and view it as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.&lt;ref name="Harring63"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bNf13S3k2w0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Harrington+Gospel+of+Matthew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAkdqJ_4zZAhVGtlkKHZxoBJQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=63&amp;f=false The Gospel of Matthew]'' by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-5803-2}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez95"&gt;''Christianity: A Biblical, Historical, and Theological Guide'' by Glenn Jonas, Kathryn Muller Lopez 2010, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chilton187"&gt;''Studying the Historical Jesus: Evaluations of the State of Current Research'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 {{ISBN|90-04-11142-5}} pp. 187–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell47" /&gt; [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] states that the historicity of the baptism and [[crucifixion of Jesus]] "command almost universal assent".&lt;ref name="JDunn339"&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn states that these two facts "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name="JDunn339" /&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] states that it is historically certain that Jesus was baptised by John in the Jordan.&lt;ref name="Whois31"&gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by John Dominic Crossan, Richard G. Watts 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25842-5}} pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (18.5.2) 1st-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]] also wrote about John the Baptist and his eventual death in Perea.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Behold the Man: The Real Life of the Historical Jesus'' by Kirk Kimball 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-58112-633-4}} p. 654&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by [[Herod Antipas]] is attested to by 1st-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]] and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus' accounts]] of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic.&lt;ref name="AmyJill55"&gt;Craig Evans, 2006 "Josephus on John the Baptist" in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al. Princeton Univ Press {{ISBN|978-0-691-00992-6}} pp.&amp;nbsp;55–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Complete Works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus'', William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}} pp.&amp;nbsp;662–63&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus establishes a key connection between the historical events he recorded and specific episodes that appear in the gospels.&lt;ref name="AmyJill55" /&gt; The reference in the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' by Josephus to John's popularity among the crowds ([[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2]]) and how he preached his baptism is considered a reliable historical datum.&lt;ref name="JBP"&gt;''John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age'' by Catherine M. Murphy 2003 {{ISBN|0-8146-5933-0}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett122" /&gt; Unlike the gospels, Josephus does not relate John and Jesus, and does not state that John's baptisms were for the remission of sins.&lt;ref name="JBP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett122"&gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'' by Paul Barnett 2009 {{ISBN|0-8308-2699-8}} p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Setzer, "Jewish Responses to Believers in Jesus", in Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Z. Brettler (editors), The Jewish Annotated New Testament, p. 576 (New Revised Standard Version, Oxford University Press, 2011). {{ISBN|978-0-19-529770-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost all modern scholars consider the [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus passage on John]] to be authentic in its entirety and view the variations between Josephus and the gospels as indications that the Josephus passages are authentic, for a Christian interpolator would have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A. (2006). "Josephus on John the Baptist". In Levine, Amy-Jill. The Historical Jesus in Context. Princeton Univ Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-00992-6}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;55–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}}. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the arguments in favour of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John is that it is a story which the [[early Christianity|early Christian Church]] would have never wanted to invent, typically referred to as the [[criterion of embarrassment]] in historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Powell47" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whois31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey35"&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' by Maurice Casey 2010 {{ISBN|0-567-64517-7}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of [[sin]]s, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.&lt;ref name="Powell47"&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Jesus: a Comprehensive Guide'' by Gerd Theissen, Annette Merz 1998 {{ISBN|0-8006-3122-6}} p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Matthew attempts to offset this problem by having John feel unworthy to baptise Jesus and Jesus giving him permission to do so in {{bibleref2|Matthew|3:14-15|NIV|Matthew 3:14–15}}.&lt;ref name="Murphy29" /&gt;

The gospels are not the only references to the baptisms performed by John and in {{bibleref2|Acts|10:37-38|NIV|Acts 10:37–38}}, the [[apostle Peter]] refers to how the [[ministry of Jesus]] followed "the baptism which John preached".&lt;ref&gt;''Who is Jesus?: An Introduction to Christology'' by Thomas P. Rausch 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5078-3}} p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of [[multiple attestation]].&lt;ref name="Murphy29"&gt;''John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age'' by Catherine M. Murphy 2003 {{ISBN|0-8146-5933-0}} pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A. Evans 2001 {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.&lt;ref name="Murphy29" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the New Testament and the Origins of Christianity'' by Delbert Royce Burkett 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-00720-8}} pp.&amp;nbsp;247–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who is Jesus?'' by Thomas P. Rausch 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5078-3}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth: A Critical Study'' by Daniel S. Dapaah 2005 {{ISBN|0-7618-3109-6}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic depictions ==

While the gospel of Luke is explicit about the ''Spirit of God'' descending in the shape of a dove, the wording of Matthew is vague enough that it could be interpreted only to suggest that the descent was in the style of a dove. Although a variety of symbolisms were attached to doves at the time these passages were written, the dove imagery has become a well known symbol for the [[Holy Spirit]] in [[Christian art]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, Howard W. ''The Gospel of Matthew and its Readers: A Historical Introduction to the First Gospel.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew". ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of the baptismal scene typical show the sky opening and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] descending as a dove towards Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ross30"&gt;''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-313-29329-0}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==

The reformer [[Martin Luther]] wrote a [[hymn]] about baptism, based on biblical accounts about the baptism of Jesus, "{{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam]]}}" (1541). It is the basis for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, {{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam, BWV 7|''Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam'', BWV 7]] |italic=unset}}, first performed on 24 June 1724.

A '''bog pond''' ({{lang-de|Moorauge}}) is a waterbody in the middle of a [[raised bog|raised]] or [[kettle bog]], formerly also in percolating [[mire]]s (''Durchströmungsmooren''). It is also called a '''bog eye''', '''raised bog kolk''', '''bog kolk''' or just '''kolk'''. Bog ponds owe their existence to the growth of the bog body and are thus of biogenic origin. Brown bog ponds are surrounded by peat and receive their water exclusively from precipitation or from the large rain storage capacity of raised bogs. Such kolks generally represent the non-evaporating excess water of a bog. The central waterbody of these bogs exhibit almost no [[sedimentation]].

The accumulation of nutrients can lead to the formation of [[floating mat]]s. Their vegetation differs from that of other structures in the bog. Usually the edges of the kolk are more nutrient-rich as a result of [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralisation]] processes caused by wave and wind action. Here, woody plants such as [[downy birch]] (''Betula pubescens'') and other species of plant e.g. [[purple moor grass]] (''Molinia caerulea'') may establish that otherwise are missing on the central areas of intact bogs. The bog water is brown, nutrient-poor, [[humic acid]] rich and lime-free ([[dystrophic]]).

The '''Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum''' (CIM) is a not-for-profit [[Engineering society|technical society]] of professionals in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mining|minerals]], metals, materials and [[Energy industry|energy industries]]. CIM has over 11,000 members, convened from industry, academia and government.

==History==
In March 1898, the Canadian Mining Institute was founded in [[Montreal]] at the second annual meeting of the Federated Canadian Mining Institute, which was dissolved. The Institute was incorporated by Act of Parliament to include all former provincial groups except The Mining Society of [[Nova Scotia]], which remained a separate body.

In 1902, The Institute formed its first Branches in [[Sherbrooke|Sherbrooke, Quebec]], [[Kingston, Ontario]], and [[Nelson, British Columbia]]. In 1918, the Mining Society of Nova Scotia formally became affiliated with the Canadian Mining Institute.

In 1920, [[Metallurgy]] was added to the name to recognize the inclusion of this discipline.

In 1942, the Institute made CIM its official abbreviation.

In 1990, "Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum" became the official name of the Institute by Act of Parliament.

1998 was CIM's Centennial Year. A book entitled "Pride and Vision" by E. Tina Crossfield was published in commemoration of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crossfield |first1=E. Tina |title=Pride and Vision |date=1998 |publisher=Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum |location=Montreal |isbn=0-919086-98-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, CIM celebrated its [https://120.cim.org/ 120th anniversary].

==Publications==
* ''[http://magazine.cim.org/en/ CIM Magazine]'', mineral industry publication for information on technology and operations, published 8 times a year

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Canens''' was the personification of song.  A [[nymph]] from [[Latium]], she was the daughter of [[Janus]] and [[Venilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses Book XIV (A. S. Kline's Version)|url=http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph14.htm|website=The Ovid Collection|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Canens' husband [[Picus]] scorned the love of the witch [[Circe]], she turned him into a woodpecker. Canens searched for her husband for six days and then threw herself into the [[Tiber]] river.  She sang one final song and then died.  They had one son, [[Faunus]].

'''Clipperton Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de Clipperton}} or {{lang-fr|Île de la Passion}}; {{lang-es|Isla de la Pasión}}) is an uninhabited {{cvt|6|km2|sqmi}} coral [[atoll]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[Central America]]. It is 10,677 kilometres away from [[Paris]], France, 5,400 km from [[Papeete]], Tahiti, and 1,081 km from [[Mexico]]. It is an [[Overseas departments and territories of France#Minor territories|overseas minor territory of France]], under direct authority of the [[Minister of Overseas France]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 — {{cite web |website=LegiFrance |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=2E14855B772D504D6D56073B3A3BFDAD.tpdjo13v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000879815&amp;categorieLien=cid&amp;dateTexte= |title=Loi n° 55-1052 du 6 août 1955 modifiée portant statut des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises et de l'île de Clipperton |language=fr |trans-title=Law No. 55-1052 of 6&amp;nbsp;August 1955 on the status of French Southern and Antarctic Lands and Clipperton Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018048991&amp;fastPos=1&amp;fastReqId=2007253908&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;oldAction=rechTexte |title=Décret du 31 janvier 2008 relatif à l'administration de l'île de Clipperton |language=fr |trans-title=31&amp;nbsp;January 2008 Order Respecting the Administration of Clipperton Island |website=LegiFrance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atoll is {{cvt|1080|km|0}} south-west of [[Mexico]], {{cvt|2424|km|0}} west of [[Nicaragua]], {{cvt|2545|km|0}} west of [[Costa Rica]] and {{cvt|2260|km|0}} north-west of the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Ecuador]], at {{Coord|10|18|N|109|13|W|name=Clipperton Island|type:isle_region:FR-CP|display=inline}}. Clipperton is about {{cvt|945|km|mi nmi}} south-east of [[Socorro Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]], which is the nearest land. 

It is low-lying and largely barren, with some scattered grasses and a few clumps of [[Cocos nucifera|coconut palms (''Cocos nucifera'')]]. Land elevations average {{cvt|2|m|ft}}, though a small [[volcano|volcanic]] outcrop rising to {{cvt|29|m|ft}} on its south-east side is considerably higher and is referred to as "Clipperton Rock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/history.html |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |title=Clipperton Island Pictures and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding reef is exposed at low tide.&lt;ref name="ClippertonIsland"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0705 |name=Eastern Pacific Ocean, southeast of Mexico |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this rock means that technically Clipperton is not an atoll but an island with a barrier reef.

Clipperton has had no permanent inhabitants since 1945. It is visited on occasion by fishermen, [[French Navy]] patrols, scientific researchers, film crews, and shipwreck survivors. It has become a popular site for transmissions by [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/index.html |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |title=QSLs and Stories from Previous DXpeditions |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==

===Lagoon and climate===

Clipperton has a ring-shaped atoll which completely encloses a [[water stagnation|stagnant]] [[freshwater]] [[lagoon]], and is {{cvt|12|km|mi}} in circumference. The lagoon is devoid of fish, and contains some deep basins with depths of {{cvt|43|and|72|m|ft}}, including a spot known as Trou-Sans-Fond, or "the bottomless hole", with acidic water at its base. The water is described as being almost fresh at the surface, and highly [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]]. Seaweed beds cover approximately 45 percent of the lagoon's surface. The rim averages {{cvt|150|m|ft}} in width, reaching {{cvt|400|m|ft}} in the west and narrows to {{cvt|45|m|ft}} in the north-east, where sea waves occasionally spill over into the lagoon.&lt;ref name="ClippertonIsland"/&gt;

While some sources have rated the lagoon water as [[potable|non-potable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm |title=Clipperton Island |website=Travel Tips 24 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102070144/http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm |archive-date=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clipperton Journal: The Daily Record of Life on a Pacific Atoll |website=National Geographic News |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0828_030829_milbrandjournal1.html |author=Lance Milbrand |date=August 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; testimony from the crew of the tuna clipper M/V ''Monarch,'' stranded for 23 days in 1962 after their boat sank, indicates otherwise. Their report reveals that the lagoon water, while not tasting very good, was drinkable, though "muddy and dirty". Several of the castaways drank it, with no apparent ill effects.&lt;ref name=No94&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf |title=Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, D.C. |date=December 15, 1962 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of an ill-fated Mexican military colony in 1917 (see below) indicated that they were dependent upon [[rain]] for their water supply, catching it in old boats they used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=No94 /&gt; Aside from the lagoon and water caught from rain, no other freshwater sources are known to exist.

It has a tropical oceanic climate, with average temperatures of {{convert|20|–|32|C|F}}. The rainy season occurs from May to October, when it is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Surrounding ocean waters are warm, pushed by equatorial and counter-equatorial currents. It has no known natural resources (its [[guano]] having been depleted early in the 20th century). Although 115 species of fish have been identified in nearby waters the only economic activity in the area is tuna fishing.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Clippertonisland.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut]] palms on Clipperton. The lagoon is visible beyond the trees.]]
When Snodgrass and Heller visited in 1898, they reported that "no land plant is native to the island".{{sfnp|Snodgrass|Heller|1902}} Historical accounts from 1711, 1825 and 1839 show a low grassy or suffrutescent (partially woody) flora. During Sachet's visit in 1958, the vegetation was found to consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a creeping plant (''[[Ipomoea]]'' sp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be pioneer in nature, and most of it is believed to be composed of recently introduced species. Sachet suspected that ''[[Heliotropium curassavicum]]'' and possibly ''[[Portulaca oleracea]]'' were native. [[Coconut|Coconut palm]]s and pigs were introduced in the 1890s by [[guano]] miners. The pigs reduced the crab population, which in turn allowed [[grassland]] to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface.{{sfnp|Sachet|1962}} The elimination of these pigs in 1958—the result of a personal project by [[Kenneth E. Stager]]&lt;ref name="Pitman et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert L. |first2=Lisa T. |last2=Ballance |first3=Charly |last3=Bost |year=2005 |title=Clipperton Island: pig sty, rat hole and booby prize |journal=Marine Ornithology |url=http://mundo.cabrillo.edu/~ncrane/Clipperton/ratsandpigs.pdf |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=193–194 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—has caused most of this vegetation to disappear as millions of land crabs (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'') have returned.&lt;ref name=WoRMS&gt;{{cite WoRMS |author=Davie, P. |year=2015 |title=''Johngarthia planata'' (Stimpson, 1860) |id=444454 |accessdate=22 February 2017 |db=Marine Mollusca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is virtually a sandy desert, with only 674 palms counted by [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] during the "Passion 2001" French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that the terrestrial crabs cannot reach.

[[File:Jielbeaumadier crabe de clipperton mjp paris 2014.jpeg|thumb|left|A bright-orange Clipperton crab (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'')]]
On the north-west side the most abundant plant species are ''[[Cenchrus echinatus]]'', ''[[Sida rhombifolia]]'', and ''[[Corchorus aestuans]]''. These plants compose a shrub cover up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in height and are intermixed with ''[[Eclipta]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', and ''[[Solanum]]'', as well as a taller plant, ''[[Brassica juncea]]''. A unique feature is that the vegetation is arranged in parallel rows of species, with dense rows of taller species alternating with lower, more open vegetation. This was assumed to be a result of the [[phosphate]] mining method of trench-digging.&lt;ref name="ClippertonIsland" /&gt;

[[File:Brown booby.jpg|thumb|A [[brown booby]]]]
The only land animals known to exist are two species of reptiles (''[[Gehyra insulensis]]'', a gecko, and ''[[Emoia cyanura]],'' a skink),&lt;ref name="Zug2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zug |first=George R. |title=Reptiles and Amphibians of the Pacific Islands: A Comprehensive Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpts77fVJ94C&amp;pg=PP45 |year=2013 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-95540-0 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; bright-orange land crabs (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'', sometimes known as the 'Clipperton Crab', although it is also found on other islands in the eastern Pacific), birds, and rats, the rats probably arriving from large fishing boats that were wrecked on the island in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref name="Pitman et al. 2005" /&gt; Bird species include [[white tern]]s, [[masked booby|masked boobies]], [[sooty tern]]s, [[brown booby|brown boobies]], [[brown noddy|brown noddies]], [[black noddy|black noddies]], [[greater frigatebird|great frigatebirds]], [[coot]]s, [[Swallow|martins]] (swallows), [[cuckoo]]s and [[yellow warbler]]s. [[Duck]]s have been reported in the lagoon.&lt;ref name="ClippertonIsland" /&gt; The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because of the large breeding colony of masked boobies, with 110,000 individual birds recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BirdLife International |title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Clipperton |website=BirdLife International |year=2018 |url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/clipperton-iba-french-polynesia/details |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lagoon harbours millions of [[isopod]]s, which swimmers say can deliver a painful sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Goode |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/n9ns-1992.html |title=1992 Clipperton Island Expedition |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 report by the [[NOAA]]'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in [[La Jolla]], [[California]], USA indicates that the increased rat presence has led to a decline in both crab and bird populations, causing a corresponding increase in both vegetation and coconut palms. This report urgently recommended eradication of rats so that vegetation might be reduced and the island might return to its "pre-human" state.&lt;ref name="Pitman et al. 2005"/&gt;

==History==

===Discovery and early claims===

The island was discovered on [[Good Friday]], 3 April 1711  by Frenchmen [[Martin de Chassiron]] and [[Michel Du Bocage]], commanding the French ships ''[[La Princesse]]'' and ''[[La Découverte]]''. It was given the name ''Île de la Passion'' ({{lang-en|Passion Island}}). They drew up the first map and claimed the island for France. The first scientific expedition took place in 1725 under Frenchman [[M. Bocage]], who lived on the island for several months. In 1858, France formally laid claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/oceania/cp.htm|title=Clipperton / Ile de la Passion|last=Pike|first=John|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name comes from [[John Clipperton]], an English [[pirate]] and [[privateer]] who fought the Spanish during the early 18th century, and who is said to have passed by the island. Some sources say he used it as a base for his raids on shipping, but there is no documentary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Büch, Boudewijn |title=Eilanden |language=nl |trans-title=Islands |year=2003 |location=Netherlands |publisher=Singel Pockets |isbn=978-9-04-133086-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other claimants included the United States, whose [[American Guano Mining Company]] claimed it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856; Mexico also claimed it due to activities undertaken there as early as 1848–1849. On 17 November 1858 Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] annexed it as part of the French colony of [[Tahiti]]. This did not settle the ownership question. On 24 November 1897, French naval authorities found three Americans working for the [[American Guano Company]], who had raised the [[American flag]]. U.S. authorities denounced their act, assuring the French that they did not intend to assert American sovereignty.&lt;ref name=AJIL26&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emmanuel, V. |year=1932 |url=https://www.ilsa.org/Jessup/Jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf |title=Arbitral Award on the Subject of the Difference Relative to the Sovereignty over Clipperton Island |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=390–394 |jstor=2189369 |doi=10.2307/2189369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico reasserted its claim late in the 19th century, and on 13 December 1897 sent the gunboat ''[[La Demócrata]]'' to occupy and annex it. A colony was established, and a series of military governors was posted, the last one being [[Ramón Arnaud]] (1906–1916). France insisted on its ownership, and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence between the two nations led to the conclusion of a treaty on March 2, 1909, to seek the arbitration of King [[Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;III of Italy]], with each nation promising to abide by his determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Original treaty between Mexico and France |language=fr |work=French Foreign Ministry Archives: |url=https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725105321/https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision was not rendered until 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dickinson, E. |date=1933 |title=The Clipperton Island Case |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=130–133 |jstor=2189797 |doi=10.2307/2189797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guano mining, Mexican colony, and evacuation of 1917===
[[File:SobrevivientesClipperton.jpg|thumb|Mexican survivors from Clipperton Island, 1917]]

The [[British Pacific Island Company]] acquired the rights to guano deposits in 1906 and built a mining settlement in conjunction with the Mexican government. That same year, a lighthouse was erected under the orders of [[List of Presidents of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. By 1914 around 100 people&amp;mdash;men, women, and children&amp;mdash;were living there, resupplied every two months by a ship from [[Acapulco]]. With the escalation of fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the regular resupply visits ceased and the inhabitants were left to their own devices.&lt;ref name="clippertonproject"&gt;{{cite web |website=The Clipperton Project |date=2014 |access-date=2018-01-11 |url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/expeditions/clipperton-island-2012/about-clipperton-island/ |title=About Clipperton Island |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117040649/http://www.clippertonproject.com/expeditions/clipperton-island-2012/about-clipperton-island/ |archive-date=2014-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1917 all but one of the male inhabitants had died. Many had perished from [[scurvy]], while others (including Captain Arnaud) died during an attempt to sail after a passing ship to fetch help. Lighthouse keeper Victoriano Álvarez was the last man on the island, together with 15 women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |title=Trip Report and Photos: Clipperton Island – April 10–25, 2010 |author=Elaine Jobin |website=ElaineJobin.com |accessdate=2012-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427135659/http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Álvarez proclaimed himself "king" and began an orgy of rape and murder, before being killed by Tirza Rendon, who was the recipient of his unwanted attention. Almost immediately after Álvarez's death four women and seven children, the last survivors, were picked up by the US Navy gunship {{USS|Yorktown|PG-1|2}} on 18 July 1917.&lt;ref name="clippertonproject" /&gt; No more attempts were made to colonize it, though it was briefly occupied during the 1930s and 1940s.

The story of the Mexican colony has been the subject of several novels, including [[Ivo Mansmann]]'s ''Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel'' ("Clipperton, Destinies on a Forgotten Island") in German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansmann |first=Ivo |title=Clipperton : Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel : Roman |language=de |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/clipperton-schicksale-auf-einer-vergessenen-insel-roman/oclc/31495383 |trans-title=Clipperton: Destinies on a Forgotten Island: Roman |year=1990 |publisher=Mitteldeutscher Verlag |location=Halle |isbn=978-3-35-400709-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombian writer [[Laura Restrepo]]'s ''La Isla de la Pasión'' ("Passion Island") in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Restrepo |first=Laura |title=La Isla de la Pasión |language=es |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/isla-de-la-pasion/oclc/21335043 |trans-title=Passion Island |year=1989 |publisher=Planeta |location=Bogotá, Colombia |isbn=978-0-06-081620-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ana Garcia Bergua]]'s ''Isla de Bobos'' ("Island of Fools"), also in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergua |first=Ana Garcia |title=Isla de Bobos |language=es |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/isla-de-bobos/oclc/180756453 |trans-title=Booby Island |year=2007 |publisher=Planeta Editorial |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-9-70-749064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final arbitration of ownership===
Mexico and France signed a [[compromise]] in 1909, agreeing to submit the dispute over sovereignty over Clipperton Island to binding [[international arbitration]] by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel]] of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. In 1931 Victor Emanuel issued his arbitral decision in the ''Clipperton Island Case'', declaring Clipperton to be a French possession.&lt;ref name=AJIL26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=Reports of International Arbitral Awards |title=Recueil des Sentences Arbitrales |chapter=Affaire de l’île de Clipperton (Mexique contre France) |chapter-url=http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_II/1105-1111.pdf |trans-chapter=Case of Clipperton Island (Mexico v.

===Post-World War II developments===
The island was abandoned by the end of World War II after being briefly occupied by the US from 1944–45. Since then it has been visited by sport fishermen, patrols of the French Navy, and by Mexican tuna and shark fishermen. There have been infrequent scientific and amateur radio expeditions, and in 1978 [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] visited with his team of divers and a survivor from the 1917 evacuation to film a [[television]] special called ''Clipperton: The Island that Time Forgot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Simon Rogerson |url=http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&amp;v=5&amp;sp=332382698484330872538 |title=Cousteau and the Pit |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415195236/http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&amp;v=5&amp;sp=332382698484330872538 |archive-date=2009-04-15 |magazine=Dive magazine |date=July 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was visited by ornithologist [[Kenneth E. Stager|Ken Stager]] of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]] in 1958. Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's [[brown booby]] and [[masked booby]] colonies (reduced to 500 and 150 birds, respectively), Stager procured a [[shotgun]] and killed all 58 pigs. By 2003, the booby colonies had 25,000 brown boobies and 112,000 masked boobies, the world's second-largest brown booby colony and its largest masked booby colony.&lt;ref name="Pitman et al. 2005"/&gt;

When the [[independence of Algeria]] in 1962 threatened [[French nuclear testing]] sites in the African nation, the French Ministry of Defence considered Clipperton Island as a possible replacement. This was eventually ruled out due to the hostile climate and remote location. The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbour for trade and tourism during the 1970s but this idea was abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on 7 April 1980, with data collected by this station being transmitted by satellite to [[Brittany]].

In 1981, the [[Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories]] recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby the island became French state property. In 1986 a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing, between the High Commissioner and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was undertaken. All plans for development were abandoned.

===Castaways===
In early 1962 the island provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper MV ''Monarch'', stranded for 23 days from 6 February to 1 March. They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found. Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military 20 years earlier. Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel to augment the meagre supply of coconuts. The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a "little black bird" that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile. Pigs had been eradicated, though the crewmen reported seeing their skeletons around the atoll. The crewmen were eventually discovered by another fishing boat and rescued by the United States Navy destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].&lt;ref name=No94/&gt;

In 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. They drifted within sight of the island but were unable to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arias, Ron |title=Five against the sea: A true story of courage and survival |date=1990 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-67-083092-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Longbaugh and David Heritage, two American deckhands from a [[fishing boat]] based in [[California]], were stranded for three weeks in 1998. They were rescued after rebuilding a survival radio and using distress flares to signal for help.&lt;ref&gt;LaJoie, John. ''American Maritime Accident Report'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn |date=January 2018}}

===21st century===
[[File:Clipperton Waves.jpg|thumb|Surf on Clipperton Island]]

The Mexican and French oceanographic expedition SURPACLIP (UNAM Mexico and UNC Nouméa) made extensive studies in 1997. In 2001, French geographer [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] extended the 1997 studies through his French "Passion 2001" expedition, explaining the evolution of the ecosystem, and releasing several papers, a video film, and a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=C.

Clipperton! |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Lance Milbrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Milbrand Cinema |url=http://www.milbrandcinema.com/ |title=Lance Milbrand |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed for 41 days on a [[National Geographic Society]] expedition, recording his adventure in video, photos, and a written diary (see links below).

In 2005, the [[ecosystem]] was extensively studied for four months by a scientific mission organized by Jean-Louis Étienne, which made a complete inventory of mineral, plant, and animal species, studied algae as deep as 100&amp;nbsp;m (330&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level, and examined the effects of pollution. A 2008 expedition from the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography collected sediment cores from the lagoon to study climate change over the last millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Dan Nelson &amp; Julian Sachs |date=April 2, 2008 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jsachs/lab/www/Research/Clipperton_2008/Clipperton_2008.html |title=Clipperton Atoll Expedition – 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2007, administration was transferred from the [[High Commissioner]] of the Republic in [[French Polynesia]] to the Minister of Overseas France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |website=World Statesmen.org |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_minor.html |title=French Minor Dependencies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a recreational scuba diving expedition explored the reefs surrounding Clipperton, and compared the marine life with the reports of the Connie Limbaugh (Scripps) expeditions in 1956 and 1958. Recreational scuba diving expeditions are now made every spring.

During the night of 10 February  2010, the ''Sichem Osprey'', a [[Malta|Maltese]] [[chemical tanker]], ran aground on its way from the [[Panama Canal]] to [[South Korea]]. The {{convert|170|m|adj=on}} ship contained [[xylene]], a clear, flammable volatile liquid. All 19 crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml |title=Re: Probe into Sichem Osprey grounding |website=Diver.net |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Xylene Tanker Runs Aground on Clipperton Island |url=http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ |website=Reeftools |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was refloated on March 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL105629/Eitzen-tanker-Sichem-Osprey-refloated |title=Eitzen tanker Sichem Osprey refloated |publisher=Lloydslist.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 |title=Sichem Osprey |website=MarineTraffic |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-March 2012, the crew from The Clipperton Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |website=The Clipperton Project |date=2012-03-12 |title=Plastic Surveying and Collection |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502053953/http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |archivedate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted the widespread presence of refuse, particularly on the northeast shore and around the Rock. Debris including plastic bottles and containers create a potentially harmful environment to its flora and fauna. This trash is common to only two beaches (North East and South West) and the rest of the island is fairly clean. Other refuse has been left over after the occupation by the Americans in 1944–45, the French in 1966–69 and the 2008 scientific expedition.

===Amateur radio DX-peditions===
The island has long been an attractive destination for amateur radio groups, due to its remoteness, difficulty of landing, permit requirements, romantic history, and interesting environment. While some radio operation was done ancillary to other expeditions, major DX-peditions include FO0XB (1978), FO0XX (1985), FO0CI (1992), FO0AAA (2000), and TX5C (2008).

One [[DX-pedition]] was the Cordell Expedition in March 2013 using the callsign TX5K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tx5k.org |title=Clipperton Island — The 2013 Cordell Expedition |website=TX5K.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized and led by [[Robert Schmieder]]. The project combined radio operations with selected scientific investigations. The team of 24 radio operators made more than 114,000 contacts, breaking the previous record of 75,000. The activity included extensive operation on 6 metres, including EME ([[Earth–Moon–Earth communication]] or 'moonbounce') contacts. A notable accomplishment was the use of DXA, a real-time satellite-based online graphic radio log web page that allowed anyone anywhere with a browser to see the radio activity. Scientific work carried out during the expedition included the first collection and identification of [[foraminifera]], and extensive aerial imaging of the island using kite-borne cameras. The team included two scientists from the French-Polynesian [[University of Tahiti]] and a TV crew from the French documentary television series [[Thalassa (TV series)|THALASSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cordell.org/CI/CI_Documents/TX5K_Project_Report_1.0.pdf |title=Report of the Expedition Leader — The 2013 Cordell Expedition to Clipperton Island |author=Robert W. Schmieder |website=cordell.org |date=15 June 2013 |access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2015 DX-pedition using callsign TX5P was conducted by Alain Duchauchoy, F6BFH, concurrent with the Passion 2015 scientific expedition to Clipperton Island, and engaging in research of Mexican use of the island during the early 1900s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18910">The '''convection–diffusion equation''' is a combination of the [[diffusion equation|diffusion]] and convection ([[advection equation|advection]]) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: [[diffusion]] and [[convection]]. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the '''[[advection]]–diffusion equation''', '''[[drift velocity|drift]]–diffusion equation''',&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar/&gt; or '''(generic) scalar transport equation'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Computational Fluid Dynamics in Industrial Combustion'' by Baukal and Gershtein, p67, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlSbCgjjLrcC&amp;pg=PA67 google books link].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equation==

===General===
The general equation is&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Climate Modelling'', by Thomas Stocker, p57, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D4zulgFb5JwC&amp;pg=PA57 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolofsky&gt;''Advective Diffusion Equation'', lecture notes by Scott A. Socolofsky and Gerhard H. Jirka, [https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ssocolofsky/cven489/downloads/book/ch2.pdf web link]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}  = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c) - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v} c) + R&lt;/math&gt;
where
*{{mvar|c}} is the variable of interest (species concentration for [[mass transfer]], temperature for [[heat transfer]]),
*{{mvar|D}} is the diffusivity (also called [[diffusion coefficient]]), such as [[mass diffusivity]] for particle motion or [[thermal diffusivity]] for heat transport,
*{{math|'''v'''}} is the [[velocity]] field that the quantity is moving with. It is function of time and space. For example, in [[advection]], {{mvar|c}} might be the concentration of salt in a river, and then {{math|'''v'''}} would be the velocity of the water flow as a function of time and location. Another example, {{mvar|c}} might be the concentration of small bubbles in a calm lake, and then {{math|'''v'''}} would be the velocity of bubbles rising towards the surface by [[buoyancy]] (see [[Convection–diffusion equation#Velocity in response to a force|below]]) depending on time and location of the bubble. For [[multiphase flow]]s and flows in [[porous media]], {{math|'''v'''}} is the (hypothetical) [[superficial velocity]]. 
*{{mvar|R}} describes [[Current sources and sinks|sources or sinks]] of the quantity {{mvar|c}}. For example, for a chemical species, {{math|''R'' &gt; 0}} means that a [[chemical reaction]] is creating more of the species, and {{math|''R'' &lt; 0}} means that a chemical reaction is destroying the species. For heat transport, {{math|''R'' &gt; 0}} might occur if thermal energy is being generated by [[friction]].
*{{math|∇}} represents [[gradient]] and {{math|∇ ⋅}} represents [[divergence]]. In this equation, {{math|∇''c''}} represents concentration gradient.

===Understanding the terms involved===
The right-hand side of the equation is the sum of three contributions.
* The first, {{math|∇ ⋅ (''D''∇''c'')}}, describes [[diffusion equation|diffusion]]. Imagine that {{mvar|c}} is the concentration of a chemical. When concentration is low somewhere compared to the surrounding areas (e.g. a [[local minimum]] of concentration), the substance will diffuse in from the surroundings, so the concentration will increase. Conversely, if concentration is high compared to the surroundings (e.g. a [[local maximum]] of concentration), then the substance will diffuse out and the concentration will decrease. The net diffusion is proportional to the [[Laplacian]] (or [[second derivative]]) of concentration if the diffusivity {{mvar|D}} is a constant.
* The second contribution, {{math|−∇ ⋅ ('''v'''''c'')}}, describes [[advection equation|convection]] (or advection). Imagine standing on the bank of a river, measuring the water's salinity (amount of salt) each second. Upstream, somebody dumps a bucket of salt into the river. A while later, you would see the salinity suddenly rise, then fall, as the zone of salty water passes by. Thus, the concentration ''at a given location'' can change because of the flow.
* The final contribution, {{mvar|R}}, describes the creation or destruction of the quantity. For example, if {{mvar|c}} is the concentration of a molecule, then {{mvar|R}} describes how the molecule can be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. {{mvar|R}} may be a function of {{mvar|c}} and of other parameters. Often there are several quantities, each with its own convection–diffusion equation, where the destruction of one quantity entails the creation of another. For example, when methane burns, it involves not only the destruction of methane and oxygen but also the creation of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, while each of these chemicals has its own convection–diffusion equation, they are coupled together and must be solved as a system of ''simultaneous'' differential equations.

===Common simplifications===
In a common situation, the diffusion coefficient is constant, there are no sources or sinks, and the velocity field describes an [[incompressible flow]] (i.e., it has [[Solenoidal vector field|zero divergence]]). Then the formula simplifies to:&lt;ref name=Bejan&gt;{{cite book | author=Bejan A | title=Convection Heat Transfer | 
year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite book | author=Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot | title=Transport Phenomena | 
year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Probstein&gt;{{cite book | author=Probstein R | title=Physicochemical Hydrodynamics | 
year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}  = D \nabla^2 c - \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla c. &lt;/math&gt;

In this form, the convection–diffusion equation combines both [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]] and [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] [[partial differential equations]].

===Stationary version===
The '''stationary convection–diffusion equation''' describes the [[steady-state]] behavior of a convective-diffusive system. In a steady state, {{math|{{sfrac|∂''c''|∂''t''}} {{=}} 0}}, so the formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;0  = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c) - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v} c) + R.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation ==

The convection–diffusion equation can be derived in a straightforward way&lt;ref name=Socolofsky/&gt; from the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]], which states that the rate of change for a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]] in a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] [[control volume]] is given by flow and diffusion into and out of that part of the system along with any generation or consumption inside the control volume:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{j} = R, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''j'''}} is the total [[flux]] and {{mvar|R}} is a net volumetric source for {{mvar|c}}. There are two sources of flux in this situation. First, '''diffusive flux''' arises due to [[diffusion]]. This is typically approximated by [[Fick's law|Fick's first law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_\text{diff} = -D \nabla c&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., the flux of the diffusing material (relative to the bulk motion) in any part of the system is proportional to the local concentration [[gradient]]. Second, when there is overall convection or flow, there is an associated flux called '''[[advection|advective flux]]''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_\text{adv} = \mathbf{v} c&lt;/math&gt;
The total flux (in a stationary coordinate system) is given by the sum of these two:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j} = \mathbf{j}_\text{diff} + \mathbf{j}_\text{adv} = -D \nabla c + \mathbf{v} c.&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging into the continuity equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \left(-D \nabla c + \mathbf{v} c \right) = R. &lt;/math&gt;

==Complex mixing phenomena==
In general, {{mvar|D}}, {{math|'''v'''}}, and {{mvar|R}} may vary with space and time. In cases in which they depend on concentration as well, the equation becomes nonlinear, giving rise to many distinctive mixing phenomena such as [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] when {{math|'''v'''}} depends on temperature in the heat transfer formulation and [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] pattern formation when {{mvar|R}} depends on concentration in the mass transfer formulation.

==Velocity in response to a force==

In some cases, the average velocity field {{math|'''v'''}} exists because of a force; for example, the equation might describe the flow of ions dissolved in a liquid, with an [[electric field]] pulling the ions in some direction (as in [[gel electrophoresis]]). In this situation, it is usually called the '''drift–diffusion equation''' or the '''Smoluchowski equation''',&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chandrasekhar |year=1943 |title=Stochastic Problems in Physics and Astronomy |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=1 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.15.1|bibcode = 1943RvMP...15....1C }} See equation (312)&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Marian Smoluchowski]] who described it in 1915&lt;ref&gt;
M. v. Smoluchowski, ''Über Brownsche Molekularbewegung unter Einwirkung äußerer Kräfte und den Zusammenhang mit der verallgemeinerten Diffusionsgleichung, Ann. Phys. 353 (4. Folge 48), 1103–1112 (1915), [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/pms/pms2/pms2132.pdf PDF link]&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein–Smoluchowski relation]] or [[Smoluchowski coagulation equation]]).

Typically, the average velocity is directly proportional to the applied force, giving the equation:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~kosztin/PHYCS498NSM/LectureNotes/chp4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doi&gt;''The Theory of Polymer Dynamics'' by Doi and Edwards, pp 46–52, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dMzGyWs3GKcC&amp;pg=PA46 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}  = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c) - \nabla \cdot \left( \zeta^{-1} \mathbf{F} c \right) + R&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''F'''}} is the force, and {{mvar|ζ}} characterizes the friction or [[Drag (physics)|viscous drag]]. (The inverse {{math|''ζ''{{isup|−1}}}} is called [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|mobility]].)

===Derivation of Einstein relation===
{{main|Einstein relation (kinetic theory)}}

When the force is associated with a [[potential energy]] {{math|'''F''' {{=}} −∇''U''}} (see [[conservative force]]), a [[steady-state]] solution to the above equation (i.e. {{math|0 {{=}} ''R'' {{=}} {{sfrac|∂''c''|∂''t''}}}}) is:
:&lt;math&gt;c \propto \exp \left( -D^{-1} \zeta^{-1} U \right)&lt;/math&gt;
(assuming {{mvar|D}} and {{mvar|ζ}} are constant). In other words, there are more particles where the energy is lower. This concentration profile is expected to agree with the [[Boltzmann distribution]] (more precisely, the [[Gibbs measure]]). From this assumption, the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation]] can be proven:&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D \zeta = k_\mathrm{B} T.&lt;/math&gt;

==As a stochastic differential equation==
The convection–diffusion equation (with no sources or drains, {{math|''R'' {{=}} 0}}) can be viewed as a [[stochastic differential equation]], describing random motion with diffusivity {{mvar|D}} and bias {{math|'''v'''}}. For example, the equation can describe the Brownian motion of a single particle, where the variable {{mvar|c}} describes the [[probability distribution]] for the particle to be in a given position at a given time. The reason the equation can be used that way is because there is no mathematical difference between the probability distribution of a single particle, and the concentration profile of a collection of infinitely many particles (as long as the particles do not interact with each other).

The ''[[Langevin equation]]'' describes advection, diffusion, and other phenomena in an explicitly stochastic way. One of the simplest forms of the Langevin equation is when its "noise term" is [[Gaussian noise|Gaussian]]; in this case, the Langevin equation is exactly equivalent to the convection–diffusion equation.&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt; However, the Langevin equation is more general.&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;

==Numerical solution==
{{main|Numerical solution of the convection–diffusion equation}}
The convection–diffusion equation can only rarely be solved with a pen and paper. More often, computers are used to numerically approximate the solution to the equation, typically using the [[finite element method]]. For more details and algorithms see: [[Numerical solution of the convection–diffusion equation]].

==Similar equations in other contexts==
The convection–diffusion equation is a relatively simple equation describing flows, or alternatively, describing a stochastically-changing system. Therefore, the same or similar equation arises in many contexts unrelated to flows through space.
*It is formally identical to the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] for the velocity of a particle.
*It is closely related to the [[Black–Scholes equation]] and other equations in financial mathematics.
*It is closely related to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], because the flow of [[momentum]] in a fluid is mathematically similar to the flow of mass or energy. The correspondence is clearest in the case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid, in which case the Navier–Stokes equation is:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial t} = \frac{\mu}{\rho} \nabla^2 \mathbf{M} -\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{M} + (\mathbf{f}-\nabla P)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''M'''}} is the momentum of the fluid (per unit volume) at each point (equal to the density {{mvar|ρ}} multiplied by the velocity {{math|'''v'''}}), {{mvar|μ}} is viscosity, {{mvar|P}} is fluid pressure, and {{math|'''f'''}} is any other [[body force]] such as [[gravity]]. In this equation, the term on the left-hand side describes the change in momentum at a given point; the first term on the right describes [[viscosity]], which is really the diffusion of momentum; the second term on the right describes the advective flow of momentum; and the last two terms on the right describes the external and internal forces which can act as sources or sinks of momentum.

== In biology ==
In biology, the reaction–diffusion–advection equation is used to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular species, most notably in [[morphogenesis]]. An example is a study of [[Vascular endothelial growth factor C|VEGFC]] patterning in the context of [[lymphangiogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wertheim|first=Kenneth Y.|last2=Roose|first2=Tiina|date=2017|title=A Mathematical Model of Lymphangiogenesis in a Zebrafish Embryo|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=693–737|doi=10.1007/s11538-017-0248-7|issn=1522-9602|pmc=5501200|pmid=28233173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In semiconductor physics==

[[File:diffusion_center.gif|thumb|350px|right|As carriers are generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) due to light shining at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor, they diffuse towards two ends. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.]]

In [[semiconductor physics]], this equation is called the '''drift–diffusion equation'''. The word "drift" is related to [[drift current]] and [[drift velocity]]. The equation is normally written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Yue|title=Simulation of a partially depleted absorber (PDA) photodetector|journal=Optics Express|volume=23|issue=16|pages=20402–20417|doi=10.1364/OE.23.020402|pmid=26367895|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-16-20402|bibcode=2015OExpr..2320402H|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\mathbf{J}_n}{-q} &amp;= - D_n \nabla n - n \mu_n \mathbf{E} \\
\frac{\mathbf{J}_p}{q} &amp;= - D_p \nabla p + p \mu_p \mathbf{E} \\
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} &amp;= -\nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{J}_n}{-q} + R \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &amp;= -\nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{J}_p}{q} + R
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*{{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|p}} are the concentrations (densities) of electrons and [[electron hole|holes]], respectively,
*{{math|''q'' &gt; 0}} is the [[elementary charge]],
*{{mvar|J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|J&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[electric current]]s due to electrons and holes respectively,
*{{math|{{sfrac|''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|−''q''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''J&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|''q''}}}} are the corresponding "particle currents" of electrons and holes respectively,
*{{mvar|R}} represents [[carrier generation and recombination]] ({{math|''R'' &gt; 0}} for generation of electron-hole pairs, {{math|''R'' &lt; 0}} for recombination.)
*{{math|'''E'''}} is the [[electric field]] vector
*&lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; are [[electron mobility|electron and hole mobility]].

The diffusion coefficient and mobility are related by the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation]] as above:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_n &amp;= \frac{\mu_n k_\mathrm{B} T}{q}, \\
D_p &amp;= \frac{\mu_p k_\mathrm{B} T}{q},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and {{mvar|T}} is [[absolute temperature]]. The '''[[drift current]]''' and '''[[diffusion current]]''' refer separately to the two terms in the expressions for {{math|'''J'''}}, namely:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\mathbf{J}_{n,\text{drift}}}{-q} &amp;= - n \mu_n \mathbf{E}, \\
\frac{\mathbf{J}_{p,\text{drift}}}{q} &amp;= p \mu_p \mathbf{E}, \\
\frac{\mathbf{J}_{n,\text{diff}}}{-q} &amp;= - D_n \nabla n, \\
\frac{\mathbf{J}_{p,\text{diff}}}{q} &amp;= - D_p \nabla p.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved together with [[Poisson's equation]] numerically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Yue|title=Modeling sources of nonlinearity in a simple pin photodetector|journal=Journal of Lightwave Technology|volume=32|issue=20|pages=3710–3720|doi=10.1109/JLT.2014.2315740|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/jlt/abstract.cfm?uri=jlt-32-20-3710|bibcode=2014JLwT...32.3710H|year=2014|citeseerx=10.1.1.670.2359}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An example of results of solving the drift diffusion equation is shown on the right. When light shines on the center of semiconductor, carriers are generated in the middle and diffuse towards two ends. The drift–diffusion equation is solved in this structure and electron density distribution is displayed in the figure. One can see the gradient of carrier from center towards two ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5098">An '''ENGO''' ('''environmental non-governmental organization''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) in the field of [[environmentalism]].  Examples of ENGOs include the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Conservation International]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Friends of the Earth]] and the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]].

==Goals==
The goals of environmental NGOs include but are not limited to: creating relationships with the government and other organizations, offering training and assistance in agricultural [[Soil conservation|conservation]] to maximize the use of local resources, establishing environmental solutions, and managing projects implemented to address issues affecting a particular area.&lt;ref name="Keese"&gt;{{cite journal | title=International NGOs and Land Use Change in Southern Highland Region of Ecuador | author=Keese, James R. | journal=[[Human Ecology (journal)|Human Ecology]] | year=1998 | volume=26 | pages=451–468 | doi=10.1023/A:1018708300053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental NGOs are organizations that are not run by federal or state governments but rather have funds issued to them by governments, private donors, [[corporations]], and other institutions.&lt;ref name="chasek"&gt;[[Pamela Chasek]], ed. 2000 ''The Global Environment in the Twenty-First Century: Prospects for International Cooperation''. 
[[United Nations University]]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to fully understand the social, [[economic]], and environmental effects an organization can have on a region, it is important to note that the organization can act outside the formal processes that state governments and other government institutions must comply with.

==Funding==
The funds issued by various parties inevitably influence the way their efforts will be put out, the different kinds of environmental policy-making, and the activities pursued to challenge and put pressure on the states to cooperate in environmental protection.&lt;ref name="chasek"/&gt; It is clear that private and non-private [[funding]] influences and affects the way environmental [[NGOs]] view and report environmental conditions.

==Approaches==
The concept of what is [[Local community|local]] is crucial to the kinds of efforts and [[Goal|objectives]] environmental NGOs will carry out.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fisher, W. 1997 Doing Good? The Politics and Antipolitics of NGO Practices | author=Fisher, William F. | journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] | year=1997 | volume=26 | pages=439–464 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.439}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aim will aid how environmental NGOs will “facilitate, fund, promote, and provide planning and organizational assistance to so called grass roots organizations".&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt; Their efforts come in many forms such as: launching campaigns against [[nuclear weapons]] testing, protesting whale hunting, and "international campaigns against the degradation of environmental goods caused by practices like "clearing of timber, and criticize states for their ineffective policies or transnational corporations for environmentally damaging production".&lt;ref name="chasek"/&gt;

With political backup, environmental NGOs receive considerable amounts of assets and [[resources]] through [[government]] sponsors such as the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] (CSD) among many others, who supersede environmental policies.

===African biodiversity===
Environmental NGOs have become increasingly aware of the loss of [[biodiversity]] in [[Africa]] and operate on conserving wild and domesticated animals and plants.

By the 1980s, most of [[Zimbabwe]]'s best land had been taken control of by European settlers which have been divided into categories of "(1) large-scale commercial farm land. (2) resettlement areas, (3) communal lands, (4) national parks and safari areas, (5) forest lands, and (6) urban land" which (with the exception of communal land) is owned and operated by the state.&lt;ref name="Parks and Peoples"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://danbrockingtoncv.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/annurev-anthro-35-2006.pdf | title=Parks and Peoples: The Social Impact of Protected Areas | author1=Paige West | author2=James Igoe | author3=Dan Brockington | journal=Annual Review of Anthropology | date=October 2006 | volume=35 | pages=251–77 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123308 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems are defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a change in the physical environment brought about by human interferences which are perceived by people to be unacceptable with respect to a particular set of commonly shared norms".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David, ed. 1996 ''NGOs and Environmental Policies: Asia and Africa''.

'''Endelave''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Kattegat]], north of [[Odense]], off the coast of [[Funen]], and west of [[Samsø]]. The island covers an area of {{convert|13.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has 185 inhabitants.

== Nature and Protected areas ==
Endelave and its surrounding seaside is important for many birds, both on domestic and international levels and it is therefore a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] area. The Ramsar protection is part of the Ramsar protection in [[Horsens Fjord]] and has number 152. The total area of the entire protection encompass 42,737 ha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list-anno-denmark/main/ramsar/1-31-218%5E16427_4000_0__ The Annotated Ramsar List: Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170305/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list-anno-denmark/main/ramsar/1-31-218%5E16427_4000_0__ |date=2014-02-22 }} Ramsar, 05.08.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The reef 'Møllegrunden' Northwest of the island is an important resting and breeding site for many [[Pinniped|seal]]s in the [[Kattegat]] sea. The bay of Endelave is comprised by a large [[intertidal zone]] similar to the [[Wadden Sea|wadden sea]] area. About ⅓ of the island itself is protected under the [[Natura 2000]] plan, housing vulnerable and outstanding nature-types such as a heather [[moorland]] thicket, a beach-[[meadow]] and [[oak]] forests for example.

Endelave is home to a population of [[European rabbit|wild rabbit]]s of variable size. It is a locally distributed animal in Denmark, but where it is found the population is usually large. The rabbits on Endelave are hunted when in season and in the last few years, more than half of the total rabbit [[Bag (fishing &amp; hunting)|bag]] in Denmark (a stable level of 5000 animal pro anno), was from Endelave.

Electricity consumption in 2010 was 64.52 TWh, of which almost two-thirds came from fossil fuels, 21% from [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]], and 13% from other renewable sources. The total generating capacity was 16.36 GW.&lt;ref name=ciawf&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |work=World Factbook |publisher=CIA - Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070218/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the Philippines is over 101 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/philippines-population/|title=Philippines Population (2016) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rapidly developing nation, has seen a rapid increase in GDP, averaging  6.1% from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG|title=GDP growth (annual %) {{!}} Data {{!}} Table|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its large population and rapidly growing economy, the country's energy needs are significant and growing rapidly. According to the Philippines [[Department of Energy (Philippines)|Department of Energy]], the Philippines consumed 75,266 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.ph/electric-power-statistics/philippine-power-statistics/2498-2013-philippine-power-statistics |title=2013 Philippine Power Statistics |last=Membrere |first=Leah N. |website=www.doe.gov.ph |access-date=2016-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410230734/http://www.doe.gov.ph/electric-power-statistics/philippine-power-statistics/2498-2013-philippine-power-statistics |archivedate=2016-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Of this, 27.39% went to powering residential areas, 24.31% to commercial establishments and 27.46% to the industrial sector. With 72.84% of electrical energy being consumed by [[Luzon]], 14.75% by Visayas, and 12.41% by Mindanao in 2013.

The Philippines’ demand for electrical energy in 2013 represents a 42.17% increase from 2012{{fact|date=May 2017}}, when the demand for energy was at 52,941 GWh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is expected that the country’s demand for power will increase as the Philippines’ population and economy continue to grow.

The Philippines’ current energy mix highly favors fossil fuels, with [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and [[oil]], accounting for 73.56% of the country's total electrical energy needs,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; primarily due to their low cost.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World energy Perspective: Cost of energy Technologies|last=|first=|publisher=World energy Council|year=2013|isbn=978 0 94612 130 4|location=|pages=4–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines's most heavily used energy source is coal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Of the country’s 75,266 GWh electrical energy demand in 2013, 32,081 GWh or approximately 42.62% was sourced from coal. This heavy dependence on coal is further apparent by the high number of coal-fired power plants in the country. As of March 2016, there were 32 coal-fired power generation facilities connected to the energy grid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_Energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_luzon_december_2015.pdf |title=List of Existing Plants (Luzon) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Department of Energy |publisher=Department of Energy |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418192407/http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_Energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_luzon_december_2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_Energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_visayas_december_2015.pdf |title=List of Existing Plants (Visayas) |last= |first= |date= |website=Department of Energy |publisher=Department of Energy |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610233915/http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_visayas_december_2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_Energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_mindanao_december_2015.pdf |title=List of Existing Plants (Mindanao) |last= |first= |date= |website=Department of Energy |publisher=Department of Energy |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610235053/http://www.doe.gov.ph/doe_files/pdf/01_energy_Situationer/2015_existing_power_plants_mindanao_december_2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities are spread throughout the country, although most of them are in Luzon and Visayas. The number of coal-fired power plants in the country is set to increase by 25 by the year 2030 to keep up with the Philippines’ growing energy demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/773681/why-is-ph-building-25-more-coal-powered-plants|title=Why is PH building 25 more coal-powered plants?|last=Quismundo|first=Tarra|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides coal, the Philippines is also heavily dependent on natural gas{{fact|date=May 2017}}. The Philippines produced 18,791 GWh of electricity from natural gas in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This corresponded to 24.97% of the Philippines’ electrical energy needs during this period. As of March 2016, there were a total of 13 natural gas generation facilities connected to the energy grid,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 12 of which are in [[Luzon]] and one of which is in [[Cebu]] on Visayas.

The Philippines also generates a significant amount of electrical energy from oil, albeit to a lesser degree than compared to coal and natural gas. In 2013, the Philippines sourced 5.97% of its energy from oil-based sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of March 2016, there were a total of 212 gas and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]-powered facilities in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The large number of oil-powered power plants is a result of a lower per plant output compared to coal and natural gas. Oil-powered power plants can be found dispersed across several provinces in Luzon, [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]].

== Renewable energy ==
The Government of the Philippines has introduced various policies to foster renewable energy. Some of the policies provide an income tax holiday up to seven years, duty-free import of equipment for renewable energy technologies, etc. In 2012, the government launched the new feed-in tariff (FIT).{{Explain|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2376">'''Gans theory''' or Mie-Gans theory is the extension of [[Mie theory]] for the case of spheroidal particles. It gives the scattering characteristics of both [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] and [[prolate]] spheroidal particles much smaller than the excitation wavelength.
Since it is a solution of the [[Maxwell equations]] it should technically not be called a theory.

The theory is named after [[Richard Gans]] who first published the solution for gold particles in 1912 in an article entitled "Über die Form ultramikroskopischer Goldteilchen".&lt;ref&gt;Gans, R. Ann. Phys. 1912, 342, 881&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent article in 1915 discussed the case of silver particles.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, R. Ann. Phys. 1915, 352, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gans theory, the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is only dependent on the aspect ratio of the particles and not on the absolute dimensions. This dependence is introduced through so called polarization- or shape factors related to the three dimensions of the particle. For the case of spheroids, this reduces to only two different factors since the particle is [[rotational symmetry|rotational symmetric]] around one axis.

It is currently being applied in the field of [[nanotechnology]] to characterize silver and gold [[nanorod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eustis, S., El-Sayed, M.A. J. Appl. Phys., 2006, 100, 044324 {{Cite journal | last1 = Eustis | first1 = S. | last2 = El-Sayed | first2 = M. A. | doi = 10.1063/1.2244520 | title = Determination of the aspect ratio statistical distribution of gold nanorods in solution from a theoretical fit of the observed inhomogeneously broadened longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption spectrum | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 044324 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2006JAP...100d4324E }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular alternative for this is the [[Discrete dipole approximation]] (DDA) method. Gans theory gives the exact solution for spheroidal particles; real nanorods, however, have a more cylindrical shape. Using DDA, it is possible to better model the exact shape of the particles. As the name suggests, this will only give an approximation.

The '''global storm activity of 2010''' includes major [[meteorological]] events in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] during the year, including [[winter storm]]s ([[blizzard]]s, [[ice storm]]s, [[European windstorm]]s), [[hail]]storms, out of season [[monsoon]] rain storms, [[extratropical cyclone]]s, [[gale]]s, [[microburst]]s, [[flooding]], [[rainstorm]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, and other [[severe weather]] events.

The thunderstorm season for the Northern Hemisphere began near spring, beginning on March 1, and ending on August 31.

===January 1–3===
{{main|2010 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides}}

Fresh overnight snowfall on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day caused disruption in north east England, with roads across [[Northumberland]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[County Durham]] and [[Teesside]] affected. Snow also fell in parts of East [[Cumbria]]. In places it was as deep as {{convert|10|cm}} and motorists were warned not to travel unless their journey was absolutely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8436969.stm |title=Heavy snow prompts travel warning in North East |publisher=BBC News |date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 2009 through early 2010, a series of massive snow and ice storms that swept the [[Dakotas]] caused a number of [[Indian Reservation]]s to lose power, heat, and running water for an extended period of time. The storms were most severe in both [[Ziebach County|Ziebach]] and [[Dewey County, South Dakota|Dewey]] counties, [[South Dakota]]. The heavy snow, ice storms and low temperatures of January 26 led to [[Interstate 90]] being closed from [[Chamberlain, South Dakota|Chamberlain]] to the [[Minnesota]] border.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_6dd91054-09fb-11df-8bdc-001cc4c03286.html |title=Power and water shortages cripple reservation |publisher=Rapidcityjournal.com |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At nightfall on Monday the 25th, [[Interstate 29]] was closed from [[Sioux Falls]] to the [[North Dakota]] border.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal.com"/&gt;

Power company officials estimated that about 7,600 customers in [[South Dakota]] and 100 in [[North Dakota]] did not have power on Monday. Some phone systems have also experienced brief [[telecommunications outages]].&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal.com"/&gt; Kristi Truman, director of the [[North Dakota Office of Emergency Management]] was concerned about failing water and power supplies.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal.com"/&gt;

Power outages began with a storm in December knocking down around 5,000 power poles, and has been accelerated by an ice storm on January 22 knocking down another 3,000 power lines on the reservation. Among the tribes of South Dakota said to be suffering from the multiple storms are the [[Cheyenne River Sioux]], [[Crow Creek Sioux]] Tribe, Flandreau-Santee Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Rosebud Sioux Tribe, [[Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate]] and [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baumgart |first=Don |url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/national/plains/83646472.html |title=Major storm recovery effort underway for SD reservations &amp;#124; Indian Country Today &amp;#124; Plains |publisher=Indian Country Today |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reservations were further buffeted by the [[February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard]], which further depleted foodstocks and exacerbated the power problems.

25 Nepalese people, mostly children, died as a blizzard swept over most of [[Nepal]] on January 7.&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="无标题文档"/&gt; Snowstorms probably also occurred in mountainous [[Bhutan]] and [[Sikkim]], but no reports were forthcoming.

On January 28 floods tore through the [[Dnieper River|River Dnieper]]'s and [[Prypiat River]]'s [[floodplains]]. [[Climatologist]]s from the Ukrainian Hydro-meteorological Centre warned that the 2010 spring flood could be most severe in the past 10 years and that snow packs in some regions are more than usual.&lt;ref name="forua.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forua.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/ukraine-faces-worst-flood-in-10-years/ |title=Ukraine faces worst flood in 10 years Alternative Review |publisher=For-UA (Ukraine English News) |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifrc.org/where/country/cn6.asp?countryid=1 |title=Red Cross Red Crescent - Field operations in Ukraine |publisher=Ifrc.org |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also told the Ukrainian news agency [[UKRINFORM]] that February would bring more snow.&lt;ref name="forua.wordpress.com"/&gt; Weather forecasters said that the abnormal winter in Ukraine has seen severe snowfalls being replaced with long-lasting frosts and temperatures as low as −30&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name="forua.wordpress.com"/&gt; and the predicted flooding was an inevitability, both along the Prypiat River in the [[Volyn Oblast]] and in [[Ternopil Oblast]] and the River Dnieper in [[Kiev]] as the snow layer is twice as high than in recent years.&lt;ref name="forua.wordpress.com"/&gt;

A stiff [[frost]], temperatures of −2&amp;nbsp;°C to −3&amp;nbsp;°C and a light mist occurred in [[Oxfordshire]] and western [[Northamptonshire]], during the night as a [[cold front]] crossed the UK. Several cars crashed due to skidding on [[black ice]].

A powerful [[Alberta clipper]]-type storm came from the north and headed towards an area of moist air left over from the previous day's thunderstorm over the [[Midwest]] on February 1, and was merging over central North America. It was estimated that it could potentially drop up to 6&amp;nbsp;inches on the [[Canadian Prairies]] and [[North Dakota]] initially and eventually add 2 more inches as it hung around overnight.

February 1 saw the earlier [[California]]n storm track its way through northern Mexico and [[New Mexico]]. It would shortly hit the east coast and cause chaos in the Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland areas by the February 6.

A cyclone and heavy rain-induced floods hit the [[Canary islands]] on February 1 and 2.&lt;ref name="euronews1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/02/02/canary-islands-rocked-by-floods/ |title=Canary Islands rocked by floods - Flood : news, world |publisher=euronews |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual event dropped 82&amp;nbsp;mm of rain and flooded out 27,000 homes over a 24-hour period. Some mobile phones become inoperable due to storm-related interference and power supplies were cut overnight in some places. The average February rainfall is only 36 millimetres.&lt;ref name="euronews1"/&gt;

The snow and frost activity was proving to be exceptionally bad that winter across northern India. Official reports suggest that the states of [[Punjab (Indian state)|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] have borne the brunt of the freezing temperatures in India.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

Officials at Canada's [[Vancouver Games]] were also worried about the lack of snow and frost as the city experienced its warmest January ever as the temperature never went below −2&amp;nbsp;°C. The average daily high and low for January 2010 was 9.7 and 4.3&amp;nbsp;°C at the airport, which was way above the average high of 5&amp;nbsp;°C and the average low of −1&amp;nbsp;°C for January. No snow was also recorded in January compared to an average of about 17&amp;nbsp;cm and an average snow depth of 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

The east coast had records various record low temperatures in southern states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Alabama]] and [[Florida]] in the US.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;
The [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]], had like the [[West Coast of the United States|Western Seaboard]] also suffered one of the worst winters on record.

[[Bermuda]] closed government-run schools for September 20 and 21 in anticipation of [[Hurricane Igor]]. In addition to school closures, the [[Bermuda International Airport|Bermuda International Airport (BDA)]] was shut down in advance of the storm.

Not much happened in Pakistan on September 19, but the victims of the [[2010 Pakistan floods|Pakistan flood]] struggled to rebuild on their own. People swarmed around any cars, begging for help: their homes and everything were completely destroyed; their fields were turned into rubbish. One villager said "[n]obody has visited our village. Nobody has helped us. My house, my furniture &amp; and everything else was destroyed. We had no support from the government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715051646/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/144650 DAWN.COM | Pakistan | Pakistan flood victims struggle to rebuild alone]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its international partners' [[global surveillance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Barton Gellman]] |title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission's accomplished |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html |date=December 24, 2013 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=December 25, 2013 |quote=Taken together, the revelations have brought to light a global surveillance system...}}&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens. The reports mostly emanate from a cache of [[top secret]] documents [[Leak (news)|leaked]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]], which he obtained whilst working for [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States.&lt;ref name="WP20130610Security"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who holds security clearances? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/who-holds-security-clearances/2013/06/10/983744e4-d232-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_graphic.html |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British and Canadian intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive "[[Five Eyes]]" network. &lt;ref name="WP20130610Security" /&gt; In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'', attracting considerable public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order |work=The Guardian |accessdate=August 16, 2013 |quote=Exclusive: Top secret court order requiring [[Verizon]] to hand over all call data shows scale of domestic surveillance under [[Barack Obama|Obama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably ''[[The New York Times]]'' (United 
States), the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (Germany), ''[[O Globo]]'' (Brazil), ''[[Le Monde]]'' (France), ''[[L'espresso]]'' (Italy), ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' (the Netherlands), ''[[Dagbladet]]'' (Norway), ''[[El País]]'' (Spain), and [[Sveriges Television]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSA Primary Sources |url=https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These media reports have shed light on the implications of several [[Secret treaty|secret treaties]] signed by members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA community]] in their efforts to implement [[global surveillance]]. For example, ''Der Spiegel'' revealed how the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND) transfers "massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA",&lt;ref name="spiegelsendnsa"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Hubert Gude |author2=Laura Poitras |author3=Marcel Rosenbach |title=German intelligence Sends Massive Amounts of Data to the NSA |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Swedish Television revealed the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its [[diplomatic cable|cable collection]], under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gunnar Rensfeldt |title=NSA 'asking for' specific exchanges from FRA – Secret treaty since 1954 |url=http://www.svt.se/ug/nsafra4 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |quote=This document, dated 18 April of this year, clearly shows that the relation is very close indeed, seemingly growing even closer.

The extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light"&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/17/263480199/transcript-of-president-obamas-speech-on-nsa-reforms Transcript Of President Obama's Speech On NSA Reforms] [[NPR]] January 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and critics such as [[Sean Wilentz]] have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com"&gt;[[Sean Wilentz]] (January 19, 2014), [https://newrepublic.com/article/116253/edward-snowden-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-what-they-believe Would You Feel Differently About Snowden, Greenwald, and Assange If You Knew What They Really Thought?] ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The US &amp; UK Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, [[the Pentagon]] concluded that Snowden committed the biggest "theft" of U.S. secrets in the [[history of the United States]].&lt;ref name="mostpentagon" /&gt; Sir [[David Omand]], a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden's disclosure as the "most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever".&lt;ref name="omandsnowden"&gt;{{cite news |title=Snowden leaks 'worst ever loss to British intelligence' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24486649 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=February 4, 2014 |date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Barton Gellman]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist who led ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s coverage of Snowden's disclosures, summarized the leaks as follows:

{{quote|Taken together, the revelations have brought to light a [[global surveillance]] system that cast off many of its historical restraints after the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of Sept. 11, 2001]].

The NSA was also getting data directly from [[telecommunications companies]] codenamed Artifice, Lithium, Serenade, SteelKnight, and X. The real identities of the companies behind these codenames were not included in the Snowden document dump because they were protected as [[Exceptionally Controlled Information]] which prevents wide circulation even to those (like Snowden) who otherwise have the necessary security clearance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecisnowden&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=Dominic Rushe |title=Snowden document reveals key role of companies in NSA data collection |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-data-collection-tech-firms |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclosures ===
Although the exact size of Snowden's disclosure remains unknown, the following estimates have been put up by various government officials:
* At least 15,000 [[Australian Intelligence Community|Australian intelligence]] files, according to Australian officials&lt;ref name="australian20k"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Cameron Stewart |author2=Paul Maley |title=Edward Snowden stole up to 20,000 Aussie files |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/edward-snowden-stole-up-to-20000-aussie-files/story-fn59nm2j-1226775491490# |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an NSA document dated April 2013, Germany has now become the NSA's "most prolific partner".&lt;ref name=spiegelbnd500meta /&gt; Under a section of a separate document leaked by Snowden titled "Success Stories", the NSA acknowledged the efforts of the German government to expand the BND's international data sharing with partners:

In addition, the German government was well aware of the PRISM surveillance program long before Edward Snowden made details public.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden that were seen by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' (SZ) and ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' revealed that several [[Telecommunication|telecom]] operators have played a key role in helping the British intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) tap into worldwide [[fiber-optic communication]]s. The telecom operators are:

Each of them were assigned a particular area of the international [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic network]] for which they were individually responsible. The following networks have been infiltrated by GCHQ: [[TAT-14]] (Europe-USA), [[Atlantic Crossing 1]] (Europe-USA), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe South]] (France-UK), [[Circe (cable system)|Circe North]] (The Netherlands-UK), [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Atlantic 1 (FA-1)|Flag Atlantic-1]], [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe#Segment FLAG Europe Asia (FEA)|Flag Europa-Asia]], [[SEA-ME-WE 3]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), [[SEA-ME-WE 4]] (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), Solas (Ireland-UK), UK-France 3, UK-Netherlands 14, [[ULYSSES (cable system)|ULYSSES]] (Europe-UK), [[AC-2|Yellow]] (UK-USA) and [[PEC (cable system)|Pan European Crossing]].&lt;ref name="SZAug28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/59603415442/british-officials-have-far-reaching-access-to-internet |title=British Officials Have Far-Reaching Access To Internet And Telephone Communications |author1=John Goetz |author2=Hans Leyendecker |author3=Frederik Obermaier |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telecommunication companies who participated were "forced" to do so and had "no choice in the matter".&lt;ref name=SZAug28 /&gt; Some of the companies were subsequently paid by GCHQ for their participation in the infiltration of the cables.&lt;ref name="SZAug28" /&gt; According to the SZ, GCHQ has access to the majority of internet and telephone communications flowing throughout Europe, can listen to phone calls, read emails and text messages, see which websites internet users from all around the world are visiting. It can also retain and analyse nearly the entire European internet traffic.&lt;ref name="SZAug28" /&gt;

GCHQ is collecting all data transmitted to and from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe via the undersea fibre optic telecommunications cable [[SEA-ME-WE 3]]. The [[Security and Intelligence Division]] (SID) of Singapore co-operates with Australia in accessing and sharing communications carried by the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable. The [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD) is also in a partnership with British, American and Singaporean intelligence agencies to tap undersea fibre optic telecommunications cables that link Asia, the Middle East and Europe and carry much of Australia's international phone and internet traffic.&lt;ref name="smhaug28"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dorling |first=Philip |title=Australian spies in global deal to tap undersea cables |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/australian-spies-in-global-deal-to-tap-undersea-cables-20130828-2sr58.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency's use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans' communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner "reasonably believed" to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or "foreign powers." The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as [[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]] involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "[[Special Collection Service]]" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered.

''The New York Times'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the Iranian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/no-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html?pagewanted=all |title=No Morsel Too Minuscule for All-Consuming N.S.A. |work=The New York Times |date=November 2, 2013 |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |author=Shane, Scott |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F11%2F03%2Fworld%2Fno-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html%3Fpagewanted%3D7%26_r%3D2%26pagewanted%3Dall&amp;date=2013-11-25 |archivedate=November 25, 2013 |quote=This "communications fingerprinting," as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does.

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary".

According to the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin|British Embassy in Berlin]] that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] (seat of the German parliament) and the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |title=Revealed: Britain's 'secret listening post in the heart of Berlin' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-britains-secret-listening-post-in-the-heart-of-berlin-8921548.html |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |date=November 5, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (DSD) had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the [[president of Indonesia]] and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, [[Marty Natalegawa]], confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians' personal phones "violates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of—national in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-ambassador-yudhoyono-phone-tapping-australia Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife] The Guardian November 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=James |title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of November, ''The New York Times'' released an internal NSA report outlining the agency's efforts to expand its surveillance abilities.&lt;ref name="nytimessignt2016"&gt;{{cite news |author1=JAMES RISEN |author2=LAURA POITRAS |title=N.S.A.

{{quote|The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |date=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report, titled "[[signals intelligence|SIGINT]] Strategy 2012–2016", also said that the U.S. will try to influence the "global commercial encryption market" through "commercial relationships", and emphasized the need to "revolutionize" the analysis of its vast data collection to "radically increase operational impact".&lt;ref name="nytimessignt2016" /&gt;

On November 23, 2013, the Dutch newspaper ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' reported that the Netherlands was targeted by U.S. intelligence agencies in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]].

==== December ====
According to the classified documents leaked by Snowden, the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD), formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate, had offered to share intelligence information it had collected with the other intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. Data shared with foreign countries include "bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata" it had collected. The ASD provided such information on the condition that no Australian citizens were targeted. At the time the ASD assessed that "unintentional collection [of metadata of Australian nationals] is not viewed as a significant issue". If a target was later identified as being an Australian national, the ASD was required to be contacted to ensure that a warrant could be sought. Consideration was given as to whether "medical, legal or religious information" would be automatically treated differently to other types of data, however a decision was made that each agency would make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=guardian031213&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=James Ball |author3=Katharine Murphy |title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked material does not specify where the ASD had collected the intelligence information from, however Section 7(a) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (Commonwealth) states that the ASD's role is "...to obtain intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligence Services Act 2001 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00114/Html/Text#_Toc442430744 |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is possible ASD's metadata intelligence holdings was focused on foreign intelligence collection and was within the bounds of Australian law.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than five billion records of phone locations on a daily basis.

U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment.

According to ''The New York Times'', the NSA is monitoring approximately 100,000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand, and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physical insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

[[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed the existence of [[Dishfire]], a massive [[database]] of the NSA that collects hundreds of millions of text messages on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA 'collected 200&amp;nbsp;m texts per day' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25770313 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCHQ has been given full access to the database, which it uses to obtain personal information of Britons by exploiting a legal loophole.&lt;ref name="c4database"&gt;{{cite web |last=Geoff White |title=Revealed: UK and US spied on text messages of Brits |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/intercept-text-messages-spy-nsa-gchq-british-phone |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each day, the database receives and stores the following amounts of data:
* [[Geolocation]] data of more than 76,000 text messages and other travel information&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;
* Over 110,000 names, gathered from electronic [[business card]]s&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;

In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, GCHQ cited the popular smartphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], income, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ball |first=James |title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=James Glanz |author2=Jeff Larson |author3=Andrew W.

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the National Sigint Requirement List (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004 |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=February 4, 2014 |author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ottermann |first=Philip |title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 4, 2014 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |date=February 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smale |first=Alison |title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian reported that Britain's surveillance agency GCHQ, with aid from the National Security Agency, intercepted and stored the webcam images of millions of internet users not suspected of wrongdoing. The surveillance program codenamed [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)|Optic Nerve]] collected still images of Yahoo webcam chats (one image every five minutes) in bulk and saved them to agency databases. The agency discovered "that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person", estimating that between 3% and 11% of the Yahoo webcam imagery harvested by GCHQ contains "undesirable nudity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Spencer Ackerman and James Ball |title=UK spy agency intercepted webcam images of millions of Yahoo users |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== March ====
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news |title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014 |author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Ryan |title=Compare the NSA's Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |publisher=Ars Technica |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quantum Insert Diagrams |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TURBINE and TURMOIL |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The NSA and GCHQ's QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selector Types |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Intercept'' and [[WikiLeaks]] revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]] surveillance program. On May 19, ''The Intercept'' reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]].

In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said "the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false."&lt;ref name="data pirates" /&gt;

Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition programs]] to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Risen |first1=James |last2=Poitras |first2=Laura |title=N.S.A.

Above-[[Top Secret|top-secret]] documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed "CIRCUIT") by [[GCHQ]] was published by ''[[The Register]]''. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and Yemen. [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Vodafone]] are implicated.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base/ "Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base"], ''[[The Register]]'', June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper ''Dagbladet Information'' and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA 'third party' partners tap the Internet backbone in global surveillance program |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |work=Dagbladet Information |date=June 19, 2014 |url=http://www.information.dk/501280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jensen |first1=Kristian |title=Documentation: The Snowden files |url=http://www.information.dk/databloggen/501278 |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |work=Dagbladet Information |date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gallagher |first1=Ryan |title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |work=The Intercept |date=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NSA official and whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] spoke at a [[Centre for Investigative Journalism]] conference in London. According to Binney, "at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores." He also stated that the majority of [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cables]] run through the U.S., which "is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lowenstein |first1=Antony |title=The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control |journal=The Guardian |date=July 10, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency "were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else." In its analysis, ''The Post'' also noted that many of the account holders were Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |last2=Tate |first2=Julie |last3=Soltani |first3=Ashkan |title=In NSA-intercepted data, those not targeted far outnumber the foreigners who are |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-nsa-intercepted-data-those-not-targeted-far-outnumber-the-foreigners-who-are/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html |work=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 2014 |accessdate=Feb 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
In December 2013, the Canadian government announced an extensive review of Canada's intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart Bell |title=Review underway into allegations that national intelligence agency illegally spied on Canadians |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/09/review-underway-into-allegations-that-national-intelligence-agency-illegally-spied-on-canadians/ |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and Alternative Views===
In January 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light"&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; and critics such as [[Sean Wilentz]] claimed that "the NSA has acted far more responsibly than the claims made by the leakers and publicized by the press."  In Wilentz' view "The leakers have gone far beyond justifiably blowing the whistle on abusive programs. In addition to their alarmism about [U.S.] domestic surveillance, many of the Snowden documents released thus far have had nothing whatsoever to do with domestic surveillance."&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com" /&gt; [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], former Moscow bureau chief for ''[[The Economist]]'', agreed, asserting that "Snowden's revelations neatly and suspiciously fits the interests of one country: Russia" and citing [[Masha Gessen]]'s statement that "The Russian propaganda machine has not gotten this much mileage out of a US citizen since [[Angela Davis]]'s murder trial in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] (January 23, 2014), [https://www.amazon.com/The-Snowden-Operation-Greatest-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B00I0W61OY The Snowden Operation: Inside the West's Greatest Intelligence Disaster] ASIN:B00I0W61OY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Cesca]] objected to ''[[The New York Times]]'' failing to redact the name of an NSA employee and the specific location where an [[al Qaeda]] group was being targeted in a series of slides the paper made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Cesca]] (January 27, 2014), [http://thedailybanter.com/2014/01/the-name-of-an-nsa-agent-exposed-in-poorly-redacted-snowden-document/ NSA Agent’s Identity Exposed in {{Sic|hide=y|Poorly|-}}Redacted Snowden Document] ''The Daily Banter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]] argued that Snowden's revelations had had negative consequences for internet freedom in Russia, as Russian authorities increased their own surveillance and regulation on the pretext of protecting the privacy of Russian users.   Snowden's name was invoked by Russian legislators who supported measures forcing platforms such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Gmail]] and [[YouTube]] to locate their servers on Russian soil or install [[SORM]] black boxes on their servers so that Russian authorities could control them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Soldatov |first1=Andrei |last2=Borogan |first2=Irina |title=The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-61039-573-1 |chapter=The Snowden Affair |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=onIuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195 |pages=195&amp;ndash;222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soldatov also contended that as a result of the disclosures, international support for having national governments take over the powers of the organizations involved in coordinating the Internet's global architectures had grown, which could lead to a Balkanization of the Internet that restricted free access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Soldatov]] (January 8, 2014), [http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=24044 ИТОГИ ГОДА. СПЕЦСЛУЖБЫ] ''ежедневный журнал'' (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation]] issued in October 2013, by [[ICANN]] and other organizations warned against "Internet fragmentation at a national level" and expressed "strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation] ''[[ICANN]]'' October 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, [[Freedom House]] said "[s]ome states are using the revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an excuse to augment their own monitoring capabilities, frequently with little or no oversight, and often aimed at the political opposition and human rights activists."&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2014/tightening-net-governments Tightening the Net: Governments Expand Online Controls] ''[[Freedom House]]'' Freedom on the Net 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''' is an internationally recognised centre for dry land training and research in Namibia. It is located in the [[Namib Desert]], 120&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Walvis Bay]]. 
[[Image:gobabeb from air.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Gobabeb Training and Research Centre]]
Gobabeb was founded by the Austrian [[entomologist]] Dr. Charles Koch in 1962. Since 1998 Gobabeb has been a joint Venture between the ''Ministry of Environment and Tourism'' (MET) and the ''Desert Research Foundation Namibia'' (DRFN). Gobabeb conducts research in the fields of [[climate]], ecology and [[geomorphology]]. Further it tests, demonstrates and promotes [[Appropriate technology|Appropriate Technologies]]. By conducting training courses Gobabeb aims to improve the public awareness and knowledge of dry land ecology and environmental issues. The station consists of permanent researchers, students, and interns, as well as short time visitors such as school and university groups, and tourists. Gobabeb also hosts film crews, journalists and artists.

== Station ==
[[File:Gobabeb Watertower.jpg|thumb|The iconic watertower of Gobabeb]]
The Station is located 120&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Walvis Bay]] in Namibia's largest nature reserve ''Namib Naukluft Park''. Gobabeb lies at the meeting point of three different ecosystems: the ephemeral [[Kuiseb River]], the [[Sand dune|Sand Dunes Sea]] to the south and the [[Gravel|gravel plains]] to the north. This offers an excellent diversity of environments in which to conduct research.

=== Climate ===

As the station is located in the [[Namib desert]], the climate is [[hyperarid]] with an average annual precipitation of 23.8&amp;nbsp;mm, about 65% during the summer months (December to May). In 2010/2011 an extreme rainfall of about 165 millimetres was measured during rainy season. With each average monthly temperature above 18&amp;nbsp;°C, in [[Köppen climate classification]], the climate is considered as [[Tropical_climate|tropical]]. With an average annual temperature of 21.4&amp;nbsp;°C, the climate is nearly 6&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than the temperate coast (15.5&amp;nbsp;°C at Walvis Bay) though at about 400 m above sea level : given that Gobabeb is at about 60&amp;nbsp;km from the coast it is much less under the influence of the cold coastal ocean Benguela current than coastal areas such as Walvis Bay. A cold coastal ocean current cools the above oceanic air. The latter being cooled, water vapour in that air may become liquid water. Therefore, clouds and particularly fogs may appear, hugely diminishing insolation and thus temperature. Thus cold ocean currents along western coast of continents doubly cool these coasts : by their own cold and by the nebulosity (due to clouds including fogs and mists) they bring. For instance Walvis Bay has 140 days of fog per year while Gobabeb has "only" 94 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raison.com.na/Pages%2020%20to%2045.pdf| page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Gobabeb's remoteness from the Atlantic explains why it is significantly warmer than the Namibian coast ''(Walvis Bay average temperature is only 15.4&amp;nbsp;°C)'' despite being at a greater altitude.

The Station consists of the Community Research – Center, a library, laboratories, an office block, a meeting hall, the iconic water tower, staff houses and accommodations for visitors.

== History ==
[[File:Dr. Charles Koch on fieldtrip in gravel plains.jpg|thumb|Dr. Charles Koch, Gobabeb's first director (at right), on a field trip in the gravel plains]]
[[File:Gobabeb Gedenktafel Koch.jpg|thumb|The plaque on the wall pays tribute to Dr. Charles Koch]]
Gobabeb was formerly a Topnaar community called ''!Nomabeb'', which means ''place of the figtree''. In 1958 the Austrian [[entomologist]] Dr. Charles Koch did an expedition in the [[Namib Desert]], focused on the large diversity of beetles found in the area. One year later the South African [[Transvaal Museum]] decided to found a research station in, what was at the time known as, [[South West Africa]] (today called [[Namibia]]). In 1962 the ''Namib Desert Research Station'' (''NDSR'') was founded, with Dr. Charles Koch appointed as the first director of the station. The government of South Africa, which controlled South West Africa, supported Gobabeb by giving the ground on leasehold for 50 years and financial support of R2,000 per year.

In 1963 the construction of the staff houses, laboratory, office block, garages and a small water tower was completed. In 1965 a partnership between Gobabeb and the ''[[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|South African Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]'' (''CSIR'') led to the foundation of the ''Desert Ecological Research Unit'' (''DERU''). The partnership provided R25,000 for the station which was invested in additional buildings.

Five years later, in 1970, the director Dr. Charles Koch died and the biologist Dr. Mary Seely took over the directorship. In 1983, the first Open Weekend was held at Gobabeb, beginning a tradition that continues to this day. In 1989 the first course for Namibian university students in ''Ecology Methods'' was held at Gobabeb.

With the Independence of Namibia in 1990 the ''DERU'' became the ''Desert Research Foundation of Namibia'' (DRFN). The main seat of the DRFN moved to [[Windhoek]], but the research station remained in Gobabeb. In March 1998 ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center'' (''GTRC'') was founded as a [[Joint venture|joint venture agreement]] between the ''DRFN'' and the ''Ministry of Environment and Tourism'' (''MET'').  Additionally, the German ''Ministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung'' (''Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development'') has been a great supporter of GTRC.

Since the formation of the joint venture, Gobabeb has operated as a research, training and education centre. Researchers from all over the world study subjects including [[desertification]], water procurement, and the [[adaption]] of animals and plants to the desert environment. In 2002, after 32 years directorship at Gababeb, Dr. Mary Seely passed the position on to Dr. Joh Henschel. The new director arranged the building of several new accommodations for visitors as well as the building of the Community Resource – Center at Gobabeb.

From 2002 to 2004 Gobabeb's energy system was overhauled as a part of the ''Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency'' (DeGREEE). In May 2005 Prime Minister [[Nahas Angula|Angula]] officially inaugurated of the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''.
In March 2011 Joh Henschel resigned his position as director, ushering in a period of transition at Gobabeb lasting from March to August 2011, when the station's affairs were handled by a management committee and an overseer. In January 2013 Gillian Maggs-Kölling was appointed Executive Director of GTRC.

==Research==
The overall goal of research at Gobabeb is to '''improve the understanding of arid land ecosystems, particularly their variability,''' with a focus on supporting well-trained specialists and decision-makers in southern Africa and the world. Gobabeb has been the locus of much of the basic research on Namib desert [[organism]]s and, more broadly, into the ecology of southern African [[desert]]s and [[Arid|arid land]]. Every year over 100 scientists visit Gobabeb to undertake research and in the past 50 years, over 1900 publications has been produced at Gobabeb. As a result of such research, the worldwide knowledge about animals and plants coping with the extreme conditions of the desert has vastly improved.
[[Image:Onymacris unguicularis.jpg|thumb|One of Gobabebs greatest discoveries: The beetle Onymacris unguicularis]]

The fields of research at Gobabeb include: 
*Desert [[organism]]s and their [[biodiversity]]
*Arid land ecosystems and geo-processes
*Preventing [[desertification]]
*[[Climate]] and [[climate change]]
*[[Restoration Ecology]] of [[degraded land]]s
*[[Appropriate Technology]]
*[[Alternative Livelihood]]s within the limits of arid environments

The results of this research contribute to many other projects. In particular, long term ecological monitoring of [[climate]] and [[biodiversity]], which in some cases has been collected continuously for almost 50 years, represents a valuable contribution to global scientific knowledge. Additionally, research results from Gobabeb support the ''Kuiseb Basin Management Committee'' to undertake its integrated land and water management program. 
In 2010, the ''Namib Ecological Restoration and Monitoring Unit'' (''NERMU'') was established at Gobabeb to address the issue of expanding [[uranium mining]] and [[prospecting]] within the Namib desert. To date, ''NERMU'' has researched or is researching the impact of mining and prospecting on the ''Hartmann's Mountain Zebra'', the ''Husab Sand Lizard'', ''hypolithic cyanobacteria'' and other organisms.

== Training ==
Training is a '''primary function''' of the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center''. Over 1.000 learners come to Gobabeb each year, receiving training in various fields.

Most of the participants are students from primary, secondary and tertiary school. However, farmers, private persons, community representatives and interested groups are also trained. The training is broad-based and concentrates on using participatory methods and hands-on approaches. The Programs are provided by Gobabeb staff, visiting trainers and local, regional and international expert. Training is offered in the fields of community based [[natural resource management]], arid land management, [[desertification]], ecology and [[appropriate technology]].

In addition to short training courses, Gobabeb has offered long-term tertiary training to over 180 students at the centre.
The ''Summer Desertification Programme'' (''SDP'') ran from 1993 to 2005. Participants were presented with a real-life research problem concerning [[land degradation]], and involving bio-physical and socio-economic factors.

Following the end of funding of ''SDP'', the Gobabeb ''In-Service Training Programme'' (''GIST'')began in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Polytechnic of Namibia]] and Gobabeb. ''GIST'' research projects included one term of study (approximately 3-month) and covered a wide variety of topics related to the ecology of the Namib Desert.

In 2009, the ''GIST Program'' transformed into the ''Gobabeb Training and Research Internship Program'' (''GTRIP''), opening the course to all Namibian university students and recent graduates. Since 2010, research in the ''GTRIP'' course has focused on [[restoration ecology]] in the Namib Desert, contributing to the goals of ''NERMU''.

Gobabeb hosts also national and international interns and volunteers

== Appropriate technology ==

The ''Gobabeb Training and Research Center'' has been built as an example of [[appropriate technology]], which shows how appropriate technology and [[sustainable development]] can be used in daily life. It demonstrates techniques that are applicable at community and commercial/industrial levels.
[[File:Gobabeb solar panels.jpg|thumb|A part of the "Demonstration Project at Gobabeb of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency" (DeGREEE) Project: The solar panels]]

Following systems at Gobabeb are installed under the heading of Appropriate Technology:

*A solar-diesel hybrid energy system, consisting of 370 [[solar panels]], 60 [[lead acid batteries]] and two [[diesel generator]]s. Through this system, more than 90% of all energy used at Gobabeb, mainly for electricity and water heating, is provided by the sun.
*A water recycling system. All sewage water from the station goes into a [[trickle filter|trickling filter]] system and gets used again.
*[[Fog]] harvesting. With the help of different kinds of nets, fog water is harvested at Gobabeb. One net can gather up to 3.3 litres of water per square meter on a foggy night. This method might have practical application in the Topnaar settlements along the [[Kuiseb River]].
*Appropriate Buildings.  New buildings are made of clay bricks which are made from silt of the Kuiseb River. The thick walls of these bricks are thermally ideal for the desert, being warm in winter and cool in summer.
*Waste management. All organic waste is fed to goats belonging to the Topnaar community. [[Recycling|Recyclable]] waste like glass, metals, plastics and paper are taken to [[Walvis Bay]] where they are handed to recycling agencies linked to the Walvis Bay Municipality.
*[[Solar energy|Solar]] Cooking. Gobabeb uses two different kind of [[solar cooker]]s, box cookers and a parabolic cooker, all of which do not require any electricity.

==Library==
[[File:Gobabeb Library.jpg|thumb|The Gobabeb Centre Library]]
The '''Gobabeb Centre Library''' is built for researchers, students and staff, working in and around Gobabeb, as well being open to interested visitors. The library provides access to information and works done in and around Gobabeb and in the [[Namib Desert]].  
The Library started in 1963 with its first in-house publications ''Scientific Papers of the Namib Desert Research Station'' by Gobabeb's first Director Dr. Charles Koch. Since then the library has grown to house the most extensive collection on arid zone research in ecology and [[biology]] in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  It is certainly the leading information centre on the Namib Desert and also includes information on deserts of the world.  This information is stored in ''books (1780''), ''journal offprint publications (18790'') and in ''30 journal holdings''.  
To offer easier access to library for our users, Gobabeb is in the process of digitising information stored in the library. With the help of D-LIB it soon will be possible to get information from the ''Gobabeb Centre Library'' via Internet.

'''Gregory Macalister Mathews''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[FRSE]] FZS FLS (10 September 1876 – 27 March 1949) was an [[Australia]]n-born amateur [[ornithologist]] who spent most of his later life in [[England]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Biamble]] in [[New South Wales]] the son of Robert H. Mathews. He was educated at [[The King's School, Parramatta]].

Mathews made his fortune in [[mining]] shares, and moved to [[England]] in 1902. In 1910 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Eagle Clarke]], [[Ramsay Heatley Traquair]], [[John Alexander Harvie-Brown]] and [[William Evans (naturalist)|William Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ornithology==
Mathews was a controversial figure in Australian ornithology. He was responsible for bringing [[trinomial nomenclature]] into local taxonomy, however he was regarded as an extreme splitter. He recognised large numbers of subspecies on scant evidence and few notes. In particular, this drew a hostile response from [[Archibald James Campbell]], a leading Australian figure in birds at the time. He later began splitting genera. [[Dominic Serventy]] foretold that although a great many of these subspecies ceased to be recognised, future research would have to resort to the use of some of them if and when evidence supported their distinct status.&lt;ref name=serventy50&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serventy|first1=Dominic|title=Taxonomic Trends in Australian Ornithology—with Special Reference to the Work of Gregory Mathews President's Address to the Annual Congress, Hobart, 1949|journal=Emu|date=1950|volume=49|issue=4|pages=257-67|doi=10.1071/MU949257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Chairman of the [[British Ornithologists' Club]] from 1935 to 1938.&lt;ref name="Bull.B.O.C.-58"&gt;Bull. B.O.C. Vol. 58&lt;/ref&gt; He was made CBE in 1939 for his services to ornithology.&lt;ref name="Bull.B.O.C.-59"&gt;Bull. B.O.C. Vol. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews described ''M. s. musgravei'', currently recognized as a subspecies of the [[splendid fairy-wren]], in 1922 as a new species of bird.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, G.M. (1922). The Birds of Australia.  London: Witherby Vol. 10 [62].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 he was elected a [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union Fellows|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]], and served as its president 1946–1947. He donated his ornithological library to the [[National Library of Australia]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Bull.B.O.C.-59" /&gt;

==Family==

He married Mrs Marian Wynne, a widow.

He died in [[Winchester]] on 27 March 1949.&lt;ref name=serventy50/&gt;

==Publications==
Mathews contributed numerous papers to the ornithological literature, especially on avian [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[nomenclature]], as well as founding, funding, editing and being the principal contributor to the [[scientific journal|journal]] ''[[The Austral Avian Record]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">'''Ground resonance''' is an imbalance in the rotation of a [[helicopter]]  [[helicopter rotor|rotor]] when the blades become bunched up on one side of their rotational plane and cause an oscillation in phase with the frequency of the rocking of the helicopter on its landing gear. The effect is similar to the behavior of a [[washing machine]] when the clothes are concentrated in one place during the [[Washing machine#Wash cycles|spin cycle]]. It occurs when the landing gear is prevented from freely moving about on the horizontal plane, typically when the aircraft is on the ground.

==Causes and consequences==
[[Helicopter rotor#Fully articulated|Articulated rotor systems]] with [[drag hinges]] allow each individual blade to advance or lag in its rotation to compensate for stress on the blade caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the rotor hub (due to [[momentum conservation]]). When the spacing of the blades becomes irregular, it shifts the rotor's [[center of gravity]] from the [[axis of rotation]], which causes an oscillation. When the [[airframe]] begins to rock back and forth from the oscillation, the oscillations can reinforce each other and cause the rotor's center of gravity to spiral away from the axis of rotation to a point beyond the compensating ability of the damping system.&lt;ref name=helis&gt;http://www.helis.com/howflies/groures.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground resonance is usually precipitated by a hard landing or an asymmetrical ground contact, and is more likely to occur when components of the landing gear or damping system are improperly maintained, such as the drag hinge dampers, [[oleo strut]]s, or wheel tire pressure. Under extreme conditions, the initial shock can cause violent oscillations that quickly build and result in catastrophic damage of the entire airframe. In some cases, complete destruction occurs, e.g. body panels, fuel tanks, and engines are torn away, even at normal rotor speed.

==Mitigation==
Proper maintenance of the helicopter's damping system components can prevent ground resonance from taking hold. When it does occur, recovery is often possible if action is taken quickly. If sufficient rotor RPM exists, immediate takeoff can restore rotor balance by allowing the airframe to freely move and help damp the oscillation.&lt;ref name=helis/&gt; If rotor RPM is very low during a ground resonance incident, complete shutdown may be sufficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4433">In [[mass spectrometry]], '''liquid junction interface''' is an [[ion source]] or set-up that couples peripheric devices, such as [[capillary electrophoresis]], to mass spectrometry.

See the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommendation&lt;ref name="MurrayBoyd2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Kermit K.|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert K.|last3=Eberlin|first3=Marcos N.|last4=Langley|first4=G. John|last5=Li|first5=Liang|last6=Naito|first6=Yasuhide|title=Definitions of terms relating to mass spectrometry (IUPAC Recommendations 2013)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=2013|pages=1|issn=0033-4545|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-06-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; definition as a means of coupling capillary electrophoresis to mass spectrometry in which a [[liquid]] reservoir surrounds the separation capillary and transfer capillary to the mass spectrometer. The reservoir provides [[electrical contact]] for the capillary electrophoresis.

The term liquid junction interface has also been used by [[Henry M. Fales]] and coworkers for ion sources where the analyte is in direct contact with the high voltage supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]] | volume = 70 | issue = 20 | title = Comment on the Cylindrical Capacitor Electrospray Interface | first3 = Klaus D. | last3 = Haegele | first2 = Henry M. | pages = 4453–4455 | last2 = Fales | first  = Simone | date = 1998| last = König |doi=10.1021/ac980169j}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes in particular nanospray ion sources where a wire made of stainless steel, gold or other conducting material makes contact with the sample solution inside uncoated spray capillaries. The principle is also applied when a stainless steel union connects a [[chromatography]] outlet to a spray capillary. Its use has a number of advantages with respect to simplification of interface or source design, easy handling and cost. [[Electrolysis]] effects have to be controlled.

Liquid junction interfaces have been used for on-line desalting in conjunction with [[mass spectrometry]]. Thereby, chromatographic material such as C18 phase was directly placed in the flow path coming from a pump or an [[HPLC]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]] | volume = 12 | issue = 20 | title = Identification of the Oxidation States of the Active Site Cysteine in a Recombinant Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase by Electrospray Mass Spectrometry Using On-line Desalting | first5 = Henry M. | last5 = Fales | first4 = P. Boon | last4 = Chock | first3 = William C. | last3 = Barrett | first2 = Simone | last2 = König | pages = 1457–1462 | first  = Jon | date = 1998 | last = DeGnore | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(19981030)12:20&lt;1457::AID-RCM346&gt;3.0.CO;2-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of the method, fine capillaries were densely packed with chromatographic phase to form separation columns and act as electrospray capillaries at the same time. This method is commonly employed in many proteomics laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date = 2009 | publisher = [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] | first  = Andrew| last = Link | isbn=978-0-87969-793-8 | work = Proteomics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of note that experimental designs where the direct application of high voltages to liquids to form [[aerosols]] and [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]]s has been described as early as 1917 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Instability of Electrified Liquid Sources  | first  = John | last = Zeleny | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = 1917 | doi =  10.1103/PhysRev.10.1 | bibcode=1917PhRv...10....1Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the context of not ionization, but atomization of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications]] | volume = IA-22 | issue = 3 | title = The Electrohydrodynamic Atomization of Liquids  | pages = 527–535 | first  = David P.

hold the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]. Camellias are popular shrubs of medium to large size (typically 1 to 4 cubic metres), originating in China and the far east. Best seen in a dappled woodland setting, they thrive in acid soil, like other [[calcifuge]]s such as [[rhododendron]]s. They are especially valued for their glossy evergreen foliage and large showy blooms, in shades of red, pink and white. These can appear as early as November in favoured locations in the temperate Northern Hemisphere; but the main flowering season is early to mid spring (February to May).&lt;ref name=MIKCAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Camellias: an illustrated guide to varieties, cultivation and care|author=Mikolajski, Andrew|year=2014|publisher=Southwater|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1780193130|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximum dimensions are shown in metres, after 10–20 years.

[[File:Cattle poison.jpg|thumb|280px|Australia, 1907: cattlemen survey 700 carcasses of cattle that were killed overnight by a poisonous plant]]

Poisonous plants are those plants that produce toxins that deter herbivores from consuming them. Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as [[thorns, spines and prickles]], but by far the most common type of protection is chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over millennia, through the process of [[natural selection]], plants have [[evolution of plants|evolved]] the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds in order to deter herbivores. [[Tannin]], for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as [[polyyne|polyacetylenes]] are found in younger groups of plants such as the [[Asterales]]. Many of the known [[Plant defense against herbivory|plant defense compounds]] primarily defend against consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.

Many of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.H. and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis. 1977. Medical Botany. Plants Affecting Man's Health. Wiley, New York. 515 p. p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties of [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] defenses in plants are so numerous that many questions about them remain unanswered, including:

# Which plants have which types of defense?
# Which herbivores, specifically, are the plants defended against?
# What chemical structures and mechanisms of toxicity are involved in the compounds that provide defense?
# What are the potential medical uses of these compounds?

These questions and others constitute an active area of research in modern [[botany]], with important implications for understanding plant evolution and for medical science.

Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of [[plant]]s containing [[poison]]ous parts that pose a serious risk of [[disease|illness]], injury, or [[death]] to [[human]]s or [[animal]]s. There is significant overlap between plants considered poisonous and those with [[psychedelic plants|psychotropic properties]], some of which are toxic enough to present serious health risks at recreational doses. It is also important to remember that there is a distinction between plants that are poisonous because they naturally produce dangerous phytochemicals, and those that may become dangerous for other reasons, including but not limited to infection by bacterial, viral, or fungal parasites, the uptake of [[phytotoxin|toxic compounds]] through contaminated soil or groundwater, and/or the ordinary processes of decay after the plant has died; this list deals exclusively with the former. Many plants, such as [[peanut]]s, also produce compounds that are only dangerous to people who have developed an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to them, and with a few exceptions, those plants are not included on this list (see [[list of allergens]] instead). Human fatalities caused by poisonous plants – especially resulting from accidental ingestion – are rare in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Krenzelok EP, Mrvos R.,"Friends and foes in the plant world: A profile of plant ingestions and fatalities."  Clin Toxicol. 2011 Mar;49(3):142-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poisonous food plants ==

Many plants commonly used as food possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their lives. Some only pose a serious threat to certain animals (such as cats, dogs, or livestock) or certain types of people (such as infants, the elderly, or individuals with pathological vulnerabilities). Most of these food plants are safe for the average adult to eat in modest quantities. Notable examples include:

| Several species including ''[[Asparagus officinalis]]'' and ''[[Asparagus densiflorus]]''. Though asparagus plants cultivated for food are typically harvested before they reach reproductive maturity, the berries of the mature plant are poisonous, containing furostanol and spirostanol [[saponin]]s. Rapid ingestion of more than five to seven ripe berries can induce abdominal pain and vomiting. Sulfur compounds in the young shoots are also considered at least partially responsible for mild skin reactions in some people who handle the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardengrow.co.nz/plant/Asparagus |title=Growing Asparagus |publisher=gardengrow.co.nz |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asparagus-friends.com/asparagus-knowledge/poisonous-asparagus/ |title=Poisonous Asparagus |publisher=asparagus-friends.com |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Cassava]]
| ''[[Manihot esculenta]]''
| Roots and leaves contain two [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s, [[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]].

It can also cause severe calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) of cassava root is necessary to remove the toxins and avoid getting sick. In the tropics, where cassava farming is a major industry, "Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of [[goiter]] and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called [[konzo]] and, in some cases, death. The incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3 percent in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| [[Potato]]
| ''[[Solanum tuberosum]]''
| Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as [[glycoalkaloid]]s, of which the most prevalent are [[solanine]] and [[chaconine]]. Solanine is also found in other members of the [[Solanaceae]] plant family, which includes ''Atropa belladonna'' ("deadly nightshade") and ''Hyoscyamus niger'' ("henbane") (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing [[headache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and intense digestive disturbances, [[cramps]], weakness and confusion, and in severe cases [[coma]] and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely, however, as toxic compounds in the potato plant are generally concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits, and cultivated varieties contain smaller concentrations than wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Glycoalkaloid and calystegine contents of eight potato cultivars''[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 J-Agric-Food-Chem. 2003 May 7; 51(10): 2964–73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211003132/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking at high temperatures (over 170&amp;nbsp;°C or 340&amp;nbsp;°F) also partly destroys the toxin.

Tubers that are exposed to light turn green from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others; breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]]. Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The [[U.S. National Toxicology Program]] suggests that the average American consume no more than 12.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending on body weight).

| Commonly known as '''autumn crocus''' and '''meadow saffron'''. The bulbs contain [[colchicine]]. Colchicine poisoning has been compared to [[arsenic]] poisoning; symptoms typically start 2 to 5 hours after a toxic dose has been ingested but may take up to 24 hours to appear, and include burning in the mouth and throat, [[fever]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]] and [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes [[hypovolemic shock]] due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the [[GI tract]], which may result in death. Additionally, sufferers may experience kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), [[anemia]], muscular weakness, and [[respiratory failure]].

Ingestion causes abnormal thirst, [[hyperthermia]], severe delirium and incoherence, visual distortions, bizarre and possibly violent behavior, memory loss, coma, and often death; it is a significant poison to grazing livestock in North America. ''Datura'' has been used as an [[entheogen]]ic drug by the indigenous peoples of the Americas and others for centuries, though the extreme variability in a given plant's toxicity depending on its age and growing environment make such usage an exceptionally hazardous practice; the difference between a recreational dose and a lethal dose is minuscule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml |title=Erowid Datura Vault |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorrect dosage often results in death. For this same reason, ''Datura'' has also been a popular poison for suicide and murder, particularly in parts of Europe and India. Reports of recreational usage are overwhelmingly negative; the majority of those who describe their use of ''Datura'' find their experiences extremely unpleasant and often physically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Freye | first = E. | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | chapter = Toxicity of Datura Stramonium | publisher = Springer | year = 2010 | location = Netherlands | pages = 217–218 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 | doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses do not normally eat fresh ragwort due to its bitter taste, however it loses this taste when dried, and becomes dangerous in hay. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. The danger is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect; the alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage [[DNA]] and progressively kills cells. ''Jacobaea vulgaris'' is also theoretically poisonous to humans, although poisoning is unlikely as it is distasteful and not used as a food. However, some sensitive individuals can suffer from an allergic skin reaction after handling the plant because, like many members of the family Compositae, it contains sesquiterpine [[lactone]]s (which are different from the [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]] responsible for the toxic effects), which can cause compositae dermatitis.

All parts of these plants contain a highly irritating oil with [[urushiol]]. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. The oil spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. Despite the common names, urushiol is actually not a poison but an [[allergen]], and because of this it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning poison ivy can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal. The [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis|allergic reaction]] caused by contact with [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]] afflicts more than 70% of the human population, with as many as 350,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone

Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, [[nausea]] and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. ''Xanthium'' has also been used for its medicinal properties and for making yellow dye, as indicated by its name (Greek ''xanthos'' = 'yellow').

'''2-Mercaptobenzothiazole''' (MBT) is an [[organosulfur compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NSCSH. The molecule consists of a benzene ring fused to a 2-mercapto[[thiazole]] ring. It is used in the [[sulfur vulcanization]] of rubber.&lt;ref name=rubberchem&gt;Hans-Wilhelm Engels, Herrmann-Josef Weidenhaupt, Manfred Pieroth, Werner Hofmann, Karl-Hans Menting, Thomas Mergenhagen, Ralf Schmoll, Stefan Uhrlandt "Rubber, 4. Chemicals and Additives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_365.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis and reactions==
It is produced by the reaction of [[2-Aminothiophenol|2-aminothiophenol]] and [[carbon disulfide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)SH  +  CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    →    C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NSCSH  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S
This method was developed by the discoverer of the compound.  Other routes developed by Hoffmann included the reactions of carbon disulfide with 2-aminophenol&lt;!--not entirely logical--&gt; and of [[sodium hydrosulfide]] with chlorobenzothiazole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zur Kenntniss des o-Amidophenylmercaptans |pages=1788–1797|journal=Chem. Ber.|year=1887|volume=20|author=A. W. Hofmann|doi=10.1002/cber.188702001402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further synthetic advances were reported in the 1920s that included demonstration that phenyl[[dithiocarbamate]]s pyrolyze to benzothiazole derivative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Sebrell, L. B.; Boord, C. E.|title=Preparation and properties of 1-mercaptobenzothiazole, its homologs and derivatives|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=1923|volume=45|pages=2390–2399|doi=10.1021/ja01663a023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It oxidizes to give the disulfide, which is called MBTS.  Upon oxidation in the presence of [[secondary amine]]s, it gives [[sulfenamide]] derivatives.  One commercially useful example is 2-morpholinodithiobenzothiazole (MBSS), which is used as an accelerator in the vulcanization of rubber.


[[File:Di(benzothiazool-2-yl)disulfide.svg|200px|center|thumb|Mercaptobenzothiazole [[disulphide]] (MBTS)]]

==Uses==
Using MBT, rubber vulcanizes with less sulfur and at milder temperatures, both factors give a stronger product.  This effect was reported in 1921 by workers at Pirelli and in 1920 by [[Lorin B. Sebrell]] at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber.&lt;ref name=rubberchem/&gt;

This compound is used as cooling tower biocide.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The compound has also been used in the past in the gold-mining industry to "float" the gold from ore residue as part of the extraction process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= CABASSI, PAJ ''et. al''|title=The improved flotation of gold from the residues of Orange Free State ores|journal=Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |volume=83 |issue=11|pages=270–276|date=November–December 1983|issn=0038-223X|url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/journal_archive/0038223X/1417.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pillan''' (of [[Mapudungun]] origin; singular ''pillán'' and plural ''pillanes'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a powerful and respected male [[spirit]] in [[Mapuche mythology]]. 

According to legend, the Pillan are good spirits, but they can also cause disasters, since they also punish (or they allow the ''[[wekufe]]'' to punish) with drought or flood, earthquakes, or diseases. The ''[[Antu (mapuche mythology)|A&lt;u&gt;nt&lt;/u&gt;ü]]'' is the most powerful Pillan, who governs the others. In the [[Mapuche]] tradition, a man that follows the laws of the ''[[admapu]]'' can also become a Pillan after death. The Mapuche perform a ''ngillatun'' ceremony for the Pillan, for the latter to grant benefits to the people, and to thank them for their gifts.

The Pillan have been described as spirits that live in the ''[[Wenumapu]]'' (a spiritual world of good), and those that inhabit the earth generally live inside the volcanoes. (Example: [[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno]] and [[Quetrupillán Volcano]]). The accompanying female spirits of the Pillan are the [[Wangulén|Wangulen]] spirits. 

The name Pillan was used by [[Chile|Chilean]] [[ENAER]] to name their 2-seat trainer aircraft, the [[T-35 Pillan]].

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the smallest mainland state in [[Australia]]. {{asof|2008}} it contained {{formatnum:2850}} separate protected areas with a total land area of {{convert|39273|km2|abbr=on}} (17.26% of the state's area). Of these, 45 were [[national park]]s, totalling {{convert|28023|km2|abbr=on}} (11.32% of the state's area).&lt;ref name=CAPAD08&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database CAPAD08|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/land/nrs/science-maps-and-data/capad|work=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populations and Communities|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2008|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parks are managed by [[Parks Victoria]], a [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|state government]] [[government agency|agency]]. There are also many smaller state areas which are subject to commercial activity such as logging.

==Coastal and marine parks==
The state of Victoria has protected approximately 5.3% of coastal waters. In June 2002, legislation was passed to establish 13 [[marine park|marine national parks]] and 11 [[marine sanctuary|marine sanctuaries]]. Victoria is the first jurisdiction in the world to create an entire system of highly protected marine national parks at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Victoria's System of Marine National Parks and Marine Sanctuaries.

The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s. '''''Qiūfēn''''', ''Shūbun'', ''Chubun'', or ''Thu phân'' is the 16th solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 180° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 195°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 180°. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around September 23 and ends around October 8.

A '''ring ground''' is a type of [[Ground (electricity)|electrical ground]] that is used to protect buildings and equipment from damage due to electrical surges. Ring grounds are typically used as protection against lightning strikes. They are also known as '''ground rings''', although this term may also be applied to grounding rings that are installed in metal pipe systems to protect electrical devices such as flow meters.

==Construction==

A ring ground is typically constructed from a fairly large wire that is buried at least a few feet underground. The ring ground will usually encircle the entire building that it is trying to protect. The ring ground is used as the base of the entire building's ground system, and all components of the building's ground system, including the building structure, are connected to the ground ring. In the U.S., the National Electrical Code specifies that ring grounds must be constructed from #2 or thicker wire, must be buried at least 2 1/2 feet underground, and must have at least 20 feet of exposed copper to ensure good electrical contact with the earth.&lt;ref&gt;The National electrical code handbook, 1993, by Mark W. Earley, Richard H. Murray, John M. Caloggero&lt;/ref&gt; Ring grounds should be installed beyond the building's drip line to prevent corrosion of the ring's metal.

Ring grounds are very commonly used around communications equipment such as cell phone towers, police radio towers, and other types of radio towers and equipment buildings. They are also often used to protect computer data centers.

==Halo Ground==

A '''halo ground''' is a type of ring ground that, instead of being installed outside and underground, is installed inside, near the top of a building or structure. The ground reference for all equipment inside the area being protected is separate from the halo. The halo is connected to the main building ground, which may include an underground ring ground outside the building, with vertical conductors especially in the corners of the building. Electrical equipment is also often placed in fully enclosed metal cabinets, which function as [[Faraday cage]]s to further protect the equipment. The halo may be connected to structural metallic elements such as door frames, building steel, window frames, and air conditioning vents.

A typical halo ground is constructed of #2 insulated copper wire and is installed six inches below the ceiling, and entirely encircles the area that it is protecting.

==Theory of Operation==

When an electrical conductor moves through a magnetic field, an electric current is induced into the conductor.  The same thing also happens when the electrical conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is moving. This is known as [[electromagnetic induction]], and is the underlying principle used in the construction of electrical generators.

When lightning strikes a metal tower or strikes near a building containing electrical equipment, a large, rapidly changing magnetic field is generated. This magnetic field induces current onto power lines, often disrupting electrical service, and also induces current into other electrical conductors such as electrical equipment and even structural metal used in construction, such as [[rebar]] used to reinforce concrete. These induced currents can easily damage electronic equipment.

Halo grounds and ring grounds are placed around the areas to be protected so that the magnetic field will encounter these conductors first. Energy from the magnetic field creates currents in the halo and ring ground, and this current is then safely shunted into the earth so that it does not harm equipment inside the protected building. Since most of the energy in the magnetic field is used up in the creation of these currents, very little energy is left over to create damaging currents inside the protected building.

The  '''Simmersberg''' is a mountain, {{Höhe|780.8|DE-NHN|link=true}},{{GeoQuelle|DE|BFN-Karten}}  near [[Schnett]] in the municipality of [[Masserberg]]) in the county of [[Landkreis Hildburghausen|Hildburghausen]] in Germany. It is the main summit of a forked [[mountain chain]], which runs along the boundary between the [[Thuringian Forest]] and the [[Thuringian Highland]] from [[Masserberg]] towards the southwest and is bounded by the valleys of the [[Schleuse (river)|Schleuse]] (in the northwest) and its tributary, the [[Biber (Schleuse)|Biber]] (in the south).

Other [[subpeak]]s of the ridge are the ''Hohe Warth (718&amp;nbsp;m)'' in the west, the ''Kohlberg (718&amp;nbsp;m)'' in the southwest, the ''Schnetter Berg (757&amp;nbsp;m)'' in the north and the ''Höheberg (780&amp;nbsp;m)'' in the northeast. The volcanic origins within the otherwise non-volcanic mountain ridge can be recognised especially well near the Simmersberg and its two 718&amp;nbsp;metre-high pre-summits.

The 740-metre-high ''Holzberg'', which is 2&amp;nbsp;km northeast and adjacent to the Schnetter Berg and north of the Höheberg, separated by a deep valley from the Simmersberg peaks, must be considered as an independent mountain.

== Views ==
Because the summit of the Simmersberg, on which there used to be an inn, but now has a [[youth hostel]], is largely treeless, the mountain has an extensive view in all directions of the compasse without the need for climbing a tower.
In good visibility the outline of the [[Rhön]] in the west may be seen as well as the less high [[Haßberge]] hills to the south.

Still clearly outside the Thuringian Forest, but somewhat closer is the [[Dolmar]] near [[Meiningen]] (740&amp;nbsp;m) over 30&amp;nbsp;km away to the west, and the [[Gleichberge]] (642 and 679&amp;nbsp;m)  to the southwest, 25&amp;nbsp;km distant – all three are clearly of volcanic origin.
To the left and east of them are the ruins of [[Straufhain Castle]] (449&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Coburg Fortress]] (464&amp;nbsp;m).

North (right) of the Dolmar in clear weather can be seen the [[Pleß (Rhön)|Pleß]] (645&amp;nbsp;m), 52&amp;nbsp;km away to the northwest and, in the extreme northeast the Anterior Rhön can be made out.
Immediately right of that and about 14 to 20&amp;nbsp;km distant – and visible in even moderately good conditions – are the highest points of the [[Thuringian Forest]]:

In the east lies the nearby [[Rennsteigwarte]] watchtower on the [[Eselsberg (Thuringian Highland)|Eselsberg]] (841.5&amp;nbsp;m) near Masserberg, to the southeast just 3&amp;nbsp;km away, but separated by the deep valley of the Biber, is the mining village of [[Waffenrod/Hinterrod]] with the mountains of Klingeberg (677.2&amp;nbsp;m), Eckartsberg (760.4&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Grendel (mountain)|Grendel]] (787.2&amp;nbsp;m).

      <comment>Adding local [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "A disproportionately large coastal wave" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">{{short description|A disproportionately large coastal wave}}
A '''sneaker wave''', '''sleeper wave''', or in Australia a '''king wave''' is a disproportionately large coastal wave that can sometimes appear in a [[wave train]] without warning. The terminology is popular rather than scientific: there is no scientific coverage (or evidence) of the phenomenon as a distinct sort of wave with respect to height or predictability—as there is on other extreme wave events such as [[rogue wave]]s. One American oceanographer distinguishes "rogue waves" as occurring on the ocean and sneaker waves as occurring at the shore.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2013/10/22/what-makes-sneaker-waves-so-sneaky-and-dangerous/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they are much larger than preceding waves, sneaker waves can catch unwary [[human swimming|swimmers]], washing them out to sea. It is not uncommon for people walking or standing on beaches and ocean jetties to also be washed into the sea. Sneaker waves are mainly referred to in warnings and reports of incidents for the coasts of Northern [[California]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in the [[United States]]. These sneaker waves also occur on the west coast of Canada, they are commonly seen in [[Tofino]] and [[Ucluelet]]. Sneaker waves are common on the southern coast of Iceland, and warning signs have been erected at Reynisfjara and Kirkufjara beaches, following three unrelated tourist deaths in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Terrible situation" at Iceland's Reynisfjara beach - security to be improved|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2017/01/12/terrible_situation_at_iceland_s_reynisfjara_beach_s/|website=Iceland Monitor|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; King waves occur especially in [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[#External links|external links]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh wave==
In many parts of the world, local [[folklore]] predicts that out of a certain number of waves, one will be much larger than the rest. "Every seventh wave" or "every [[The Ninth Wave|ninth wave]]" are examples of such common beliefs that have wide circulation and have entered popular culture through music, literature and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author= Kinsman, Blair | coauthors= | title= Wind waves : their generation and propagation on the ocean surface | date=1984 | publisher=Dover Publications | isbn=0-486-49511-6 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Pennington. [http://framing.indiana.edu/2015/01/05/debating-globalization-ninth-wave/ Debating Globalization and the Ninth Wave]. University of Indiana, "Framing the Global" program debate&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have some scientific merit, due to the occurrence of [[wave group]]s at sea,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Cite book | author=Massel, Stanislaw R. | title=Ocean surface waves: their physics and prediction | date=1996 | publisher=World Scientific | location=Singapore  | isbn=981-02-2109-6 }} §4.6, pp. 192–200.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no explicit evidence for this specific phenomenon, or that these wave groups are related to sneaker waves. The saying is likely derived more from a cultural fascination with certain numbers, and it may also be designed to educate shore-dwellers about the necessity of remaining vigilant when near the ocean.

'''Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy''' is a research and learning facility located in northern [[Leon County, Florida]], just off [[County Road 12 (Florida)|County Road 12]] on the north side of [[Lake Iamonia, Florida|Lake Iamonia]]. Occupying the same acreage and location and operating from the old Beadel House, Tall Timbers researches the areas of [[fire ecology]], [[resource management]], [[forestry]], game bird management, and [[vertebrate]] [[ecology]].

The Research Station was formerly a [[quail hunting plantation]] of [[Tall Timbers Plantation (Florida)|Tall Timbers Plantation]] built in 1895 by Edward Beadel.

==Fire Ecology Program==

The Fire Ecology Program is designed to provide the public with applicable, science-based information on [[prescribed fire]] and vegetation dynamics in the southern pine [[ecosystem]], specifically in the [[Red Hills Region]].

==Resource Management Program==
The Resource Management Program's responsibility is to manage the land so that the upland forests are maintained in an open, park-like condition using prescribed fire, mechanical tools, and chemical techniques to accomplish land management goals.

The Forestry Program is designed to meet the ecological forestry research needs of the [[Red Hills Region]] between [[Tallahassee, Florida]] and [[Thomasville, Georgia]].

==Game Bird Program==
[[Image:Tall Timbers Diagram.png|thumb|right|260px|Diagram of Tall Timbers layout.]]

The Game Bird Program is studying the [[bobwhite quail|northern bobwhite quail]] (''Colinus virginianus'') and its habitats.

==Vertebrate Ecology Lab==
The Vertebrate Ecology Lab is studying [[Bachman's sparrow]]s, [[brown-headed nuthatch]]es, and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s.

[[File:Corn Stover Tar from Pyrolysis by Microwave Heating.jpg|right|thumb|A tar-like substance can be produced from corn stalks by heating in a microwave. This process is known as [[pyrolysis]].]]

'''Tar''' is a dark brown or black [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid of [[hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] and free [[carbon]], obtained from a wide variety of [[organic matter|organic materials]] through [[destructive distillation]]. Tar can be produced from [[coal]], [[wood]], [[petroleum]], or [[peat]].&lt;ref name=Definition&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daintith|first=John|title=tar|journal=Oxford University Press|edition=6th|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199204632.001.0001|year=2008|isbn=9780199204632}}
{{cite web|title=Tar: Definition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tar|publisher=Miriam Webster|accessdate=14 March 2013}} "a dark brown or black bituminous usually odorous viscous liquid obtained by destructive distillation of organic material (such as wood, coal, or peat)".
{{cite web|title=tar and pitch|url=https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science-and-technology/chemistry/organic-chemistry/tar-and-pitch|publisher=[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]|edition=6th|accessdate=14 March 2013}} "tar and pitch, viscous, dark-brown to black substances obtained by the destructive distillation of coal, wood, petroleum, peat, and certain other organic materials. "&lt;/ref&gt;
Production and trade in [[Pine tar|pine-derived tar]] was a major contributor in the economies of [[Northern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burger|first=Pauline|title=Ancient maritime  pitch and tar a multi-disciplinary study of sources, technology and preservation|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/ancient_maritime_pitch_and_tar.aspx|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colonial America]]. Its main use was in preserving wooden sailing vessels against rot. The largest user was the [[Royal Navy]]. Demand for tar declined with the advent of iron and steel ships.

Tar-like products can also be produced from other forms of [[organic matter]], such as [[peat]]. Mineral products resembling tar can be produced from [[fossil fuel|fossil hydrocarbon]]s, such as petroleum. [[Coal tar]] is produced from coal as a byproduct of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production.

==Terminology==
"Tar" and "[[pitch (resin)|pitch]]" can be used interchangeably; [[asphalt]] (naturally occurring pitch) may also be called either "mineral tar" or "mineral pitch".
There is a tendency to use "tar" for more liquid substances and "pitch" for more solid ([[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]]) substances.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=tar and pitch|url=https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science-and-technology/chemistry/organic-chemistry/tar-and-pitch|publisher=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|edition=6th|accessdate=14 March 2013}} 
"The terms tar and pitch are loosely applied to the many varieties of the two substances, sometimes interchangeably. For example, asphalt, which is naturally occurring pitch, is called mineral tar and mineral pitch. Tar is more or less fluid, depending upon its origin and the temperature to which it is exposed. Pitch tends to be more solid."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Both "tar" and "pitch" are applied to viscous forms of [[petroleum]]  or [[heavy crude oil]], technically better described as [[asphalt|asphalt or bitumen]], such as the asphalt found in naturally occurring "[[tar pit]]s" (e.g., the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in Los Angeles) and [[oil sands]] deposits (sometimes called "tar sands")  (e.g., the [[Tar Tunnel]] in Shropshire). 
"Rangoon tar", also known as "Burmese Oil" or "Burmese Naphtha", is also a form of petroleum.

== Wood tar ==
{{see|Pine tar|Birch tar}}
[[File:Tjärdal 092.jpg|thumb|200px|Tar kiln at Trollskogen in [[Öland]], Sweden.]]
In [[Northern Europe]], the word "tar" refers primarily to a substance that is [[pyrolysis|derived]] from the wood and roots of [[pine]]. In earlier times it was often used as a water repellent coating for [[boat]]s, [[ship]]s, and [[roof]]s. It is still used as an additive in the flavoring of [[candy]], [[Ethanol|alcohol]], and other foods. Wood tar is [[Microbicide|microbicidal]]. Producing tar from wood was known in [[ancient Greece]] and has probably been used in [[Scandinavia]] since the [[Iron Age]]. For centuries, dating back at least to the 14th century, tar was among [[Sweden]]'s most important exports. Sweden exported 13,000 barrels of tar in 1615 and 227,000 barrels in the peak year of 1863. Production nearly stopped in the early 20th century, when other chemicals replaced tar, and wooden ships were replaced by steel ships. Traditional wooden boats are still sometimes tarred.

The heating ([[dry distillation|dry distilling]]) of [[pine]] wood causes [[Pine tar|tar]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. [[Birch bark]] is used to make particularly fine tar, known as "[[Russia]]n oil", suitable for [[leather]] protection. The by-products of wood tar are [[turpentine]] and [[charcoal]]. When [[deciduous]] tree woods are subjected to destructive distillation, the products are [[methanol]] (wood alcohol) and [[charcoal]].

'''Tar kilns''' ({{lang-sv|tjärdal}}, {{lang-da|tjæremile}}, {{lang-no|tjæremile}}, {{lang-fi|tervahauta}}) are dry distillation ovens, historically used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from [[limestone]] or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split into dimensions of a finger, stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss. If oxygen can enter, the wood might catch fire, and the production would be ruined. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days.

===Uses===
[[File:Birkenpech.JPG|thumb|[[Birch-tar]]]]
[[File:Terva-leijona-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tar-flavored candy, [[Terva Leijona]].]]
Tar was used as seal for roofing [[Roof shingle|shingles]] and [[tar paper]] and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, wood tar was used to waterproof [[sail]]s and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. Tar is also a general disinfectant. Pine tar oil, or wood tar oil, is used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries. Pine tar has good penetration on the rough wood. An old wood tar oil recipe for the treatment of wood is one-third each genuine wood tar, balsam turpentine, and boiled or raw linseed oil or Chinese tung oil.

In [[Finland]], wood tar was once considered a [[panacea (medicine)|panacea]] reputed to heal "even those cut in twain through their midriff". A Finnish proverb states that "if [[sauna]], [[vodka]] and tar won't help, the disease is fatal." Wood tar is used in traditional Finnish medicine because of its microbicidal properties.

Wood tar is also available diluted as [[tar water]], which has numerous uses:
*As a flavoring for candies (e.g., [[Terva Leijona]]) and alcohol (Terva Viina)
*As a spice for food, like meat
*As a scent for [[sauna]]s. Tar water is mixed into water, which is turned into steam in the sauna
*As an anti-[[dandruff]] agent in [[shampoo]]
*As a component of cosmetics

Mixing tar with [[linseed oil]] [[varnish]] produces tar paint. Tar paint has a translucent brownish hue and can be used to saturate and tone wood and protect it from weather. Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments, producing translucent colors and preserving the wood texture.

==Coal tar==
{{Main|Coal tar}}
In English, German, and French, "tar" is a substance primarily derived from coal. It was formerly one of the products of [[gasworks]]. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] because of its high [[benzene]] content, though [[coal tar]] in low concentrations is used as a [[topical]] medicine. Coal and petroleum tar has a pungent odour.

Coal tar is listed at [[List of UN Numbers 1901 to 2000|number 1999]] in the United Nations list of [[dangerous goods]].

'''''The Ants''''' is a zoology textbook by the German entomologist [[Bert Hölldobler]] and the American entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]], first published in 1990. It won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674040755|title=The Ants — Bert Hölldobler, Edward O.

==Contents==
This book is primarily aimed at academics as a reference work, detailing the [[ant]]s' [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], social organization including their [[caste (biology)|caste system]],  [[altruism (biology)|altruistic behaviour]], and chemical communication with [[pheromone]]s, their [[ecology]] (vital for turning the [[soil]] and controlling [[insect pest]]s), and [[natural history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Drexel InterView - Archives|title=episode 75 - E.

An account of some of Hölldobler and Wilson's most interesting findings, popularized for the layman, can be found in their 1994 book ''[[Journey to the Ants]]''.

==Reception==

The ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine reviewer described the book as a "mighty tome" and commented that it would "surely take its place among the greatest of all [[entomology]] books", as it was "a wonderful exploration of almost every ramification of [[evolutionary biology]], from developmental biology to the structure of ecological communities". The illustrations are praised as lavish and extremely detailed, with monochrome drawings and 24 colour plates. All the 297 extant genera are illustrated and identifiable with the supplied keys. But "''The Ants'', like every great book and every ant colony, is much more than the sum of its parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Reviews The Ants. Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson.|journal=Science|date=18 May 1990|volume=248|issue=4957|pages=897–898|doi=10.1126/science.248.4957.897|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/248/4957/897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Wheeler, reviewing the book in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'', comments that [[William Morton Wheeler]] thought his book not practical to revise as it would require too much work and would make the book too expensive, and that it was fortunate that the authors "did not flinch" at the challenge. They had produced a massive but affordable volume, and it was accessible to the public as well as to entomologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=Diana|date=1991|title=The Ants.

{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Topics}}

In [[quantum field theory]], the '''quantum vacuum state''' (also called the '''quantum vacuum''' or '''vacuum state''') is the [[quantum state]] with the lowest possible [[energy]]. Generally, it contains no physical particles. '''Zero-point field''' is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of an individual quantized field.

According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is "by no means a simple empty space".&lt;ref name=Lambrecht&gt;

The [[QED vacuum]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (or QED) was the first vacuum of [[quantum field theory]] to be developed. QED originated in the 1930s, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was reformulated by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] and [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], who jointly received the Nobel prize for this work in 1965.&lt;ref name=history&gt;

For an historical discussion, see for example {{cite book |title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences |volume=1 |editor=Ari Ben-Menaḥem |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;pg=PA4892 |chapter=Quantum electrodynamics (QED) |pages=4892 ''ff'' |isbn=3-540-68831-5 |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |edition=5th}} For the Nobel prize details and the Nobel lectures by these authors see {{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/ |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2012-02-06}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]s and the [[weak interaction]]s are unified in the theory of the [[electroweak interaction]].

The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of the QED work to include all the known [[elementary particle]]s and their interactions (except gravity). [[Quantum chromodynamics]] is the portion of the Standard Model that deals with [[strong interaction]]s, and [[QCD vacuum]] is the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. It is the object of study in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]], and is related to the so-called ''vacuum structure of [[strong interactions]]''.&lt;ref name= Letessier&gt;{{cite book |title=Hadrons and Quark-Gluon Plasma |author=Jean Letessier |author2=Johann Rafelski |page=37 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSnFPyQaSTsC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;vq=Qgp+state&amp;dq=weinberg+%22symmetry+%22 |isbn=0-521-38536-9 |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-zero expectation value==
{{main|Vacuum expectation value}}
[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|right|350px| The video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]]. ]]

If the quantum field theory can be accurately described through [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], then the properties of the vacuum are analogous to the properties of the [[ground state]] of a quantum mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]], or more accurately, the [[ground state]] of a [[measurement problem]]. In this case the [[vacuum expectation value]] (VEV) of any [[quantum field theory#Field operators|field operator]] vanishes. For quantum field theories in which perturbation theory breaks down at low energies (for example, [[Quantum chromodynamics]] or the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]) field operators may have non-vanishing [[vacuum expectation value]]s called [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s. In the [[Standard Model]], the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[Higgs field]], arising from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], is the mechanism by which the other fields in the theory acquire mass.

==Energy==
{{main|Vacuum energy}}
In many situations, the vacuum state can be defined to have zero energy, although the actual situation is considerably more subtle. The vacuum state is associated with a [[zero-point energy]], and this zero-point energy has measurable effects. In the laboratory, it may be detected as the [[Casimir effect]]. In [[physical cosmology]], the energy of the cosmological vacuum appears as the [[cosmological constant]]. In fact, the energy of a cubic centimeter of empty space has been calculated figuratively to be one trillionth of an [[erg]] (or 0.6 eV).&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carroll, Sr Research Associate - Physics, [[California Institute of Technology]], June 22, 2006 [[C-SPAN]] broadcast of Cosmology at Yearly Kos Science Panel, Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding requirement imposed on a potential [[Theory of Everything]] is that the energy of the quantum vacuum state must explain the physically observed cosmological constant.

==Symmetry==
For a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] field theory, the vacuum is [[Poincaré symmetry|Poincaré invariant]], which follows from
[[Wightman axioms]] but can be also proved directly without these axioms.&lt;ref name=proof-vac&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bednorz|first=Adam|title=Relativistic invariance of the vacuum|journal=The European Physical Journal C|date=November 2013|volume=73|issue=12|pages=2654|doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2654-9|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2654-9|accessdate=26 November 2013|arxiv = 1209.0209 |bibcode = 2013EPJC...73.2654B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré invariance implies that only [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] combinations of field operators have non-vanishing [[vacuum expectation value|VEV's]]. The [[vacuum expectation value|VEV]] may break some of the [[internal symmetries]] of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of the field theory. In this case the vacuum has less symmetry than the theory allows, and one says that ''[[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]'' has occurred. See [[Higgs mechanism]], [[standard model]].

==Electrical permittivity==
In principle, quantum corrections to Maxwell's equations can cause the experimental electrical permittivity ε of the vacuum state to deviate from the defined scalar value ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[electric constant]].&lt;ref name=Delphenich&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=Nonlinear Electrodynamics and QED |author=David Delphenich |date=2006 |eprint=hep-th/0610088}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments are described, for example, in Dittrich and Gies.&lt;ref name=Dittrich/&gt;
In particular, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] predicts that the [[QED vacuum]] should exhibit [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear effects]] that will make it behave like a [[birefringent]] material with ε slightly greater than ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for extremely strong electric fields.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, James J. and B. P. Nigam, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v135/i5B/pB1279_1 ''Birefringence of the vacuum''], ''Physical Review'' vol. '''135''', p. B1279-B1280 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mourou&gt;Mourou, G.

==Virtual particles==
{{main|Virtual particle}}
The presence of virtual particles can be rigorously based upon the [[commutator|non-commutation]] of the [[Quantization of the electromagnetic field|quantized electromagnetic field]]s. Non-commutation means that although the [[average]] values of the fields vanish in a quantum vacuum, their [[variance|variances]] do not.&lt;ref name=commutator&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s" refers to the variance of the field strength in the minimal energy state,&lt;ref name=Klyshko&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles, or variances, based upon the Heisenberg [[Uncertainty principle#Energy.E2.80.93time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(with ''ΔE'' and ''Δt'' being the [[energy]] and [[time]] variations respectively; ''ΔE'' is the accuracy in the measurement of energy and ''Δt'' is the time taken in the measurement, and {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[Reduced Planck constant]]) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the "borrowing" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Although the phenomenon of virtual particles is accepted, this interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universal.&lt;ref name=Allday/&gt;&lt;ref name=King/&gt; One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty ''Δt'' determines a "budget" for borrowing energy ''ΔE''. Another issue is the meaning of "time" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position {{math|''q''}} and momentum {{math|''p''}}, for example) do not satisfy a [[canonical commutation relation]] (such as {{math|[''q'', ''p''] {{=}} i&amp;thinsp;''ħ''}}).&lt;ref name=commutation/&gt; Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy.&lt;ref name=Busch0/&gt;&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt; The very many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a long and continuing subject.&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt;

==Physical nature of the quantum vacuum==
According to Astrid Lambrecht (2002): "When one empties out a space of all matter and lowers the temperature to absolute zero, one produces in a ''Gedankenexperiment'' [mental experiment] the quantum vacuum state."&lt;ref name=Lambrecht/&gt; According to [[Ralph Fowler|Fowler]] &amp; [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim]] (1939/1965), the [[third law of thermodynamics]] may be precisely enunciated as follows:
&lt;Blockquote&gt;''It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any assembly to the absolute zero in a finite number of operations.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Fowler|Fowler, R.]], [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1965). ''Statistical Thermodynamics. A Version of Statistical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Chemistry'', reprinted with corrections, Cambridge University Press, London, page 224.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also.&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949). ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'', volume 1, ''Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases'', Longmans, Green and Co., London, page 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, J. (1971). The Third Law of Thermodynamics, Chapter 6 in ''Thermodynamics'', volume 1, ed. W. Jost, of H. Eyring, D. Henderson, W. Jost, ''Physical Chemistry. An Advanced Treatise'', Academic Press, New York, page 477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, New York, {{ISBN|0-88318-797-3}}, page 342.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

Photon-photon interaction can occur only through interaction with the vacuum state of some other field, for example through the Dirac electron-positron vacuum field; this is associated with the concept of [[vacuum polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;Jauch, J.M., Rohrlich, F. (1955/1980). ''The Theory of Photons and Electrons. The Relativistic Quantum Field Theory of Charged Particles with Spin One-half'', second expanded edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, {{ISBN|0-387-07295-0}}, pages 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter W. Milonni|Milonni]] (1994): "... ''all quantum fields have zero-point energies and vacuum fluctuations.''"&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page xv.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is a component of the quantum vacuum respectively for each component field (considered in the conceptual absence of the other fields), such as the electromagnetic field, the Dirac electron-positron field, and so on. According to Milonni (1994), some of the effects attributed to the [[QED vacuum|vacuum electromagnetic field]] can have several physical interpretations, some more conventional than others. The [[Casimir effect|Casimir attraction]] between uncharged conductive plates is often proposed as an example of an effect of the vacuum electromagnetic field. Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978) are cited by Milonni (1994) as validly, though unconventionally, explaining the Casimir effect with a model in which "the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero."&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwinger | first1 = J. | last2 = DeRaad | first2 = L.L. | last3 = Milton | first3 = K.A. | year = 1978 | title = Casimir effect in dielectrics | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0| bibcode = 1978AnPhy.115....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the observed phenomena are explained as the effects of the electron motions on the electromagnetic field, called the source field effect. Milonni writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic idea here will be that the Casimir force may be derived from the source fields alone even in completely conventional QED, ... Milonni provides detailed argument that the measurable physical effects usually attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field cannot be explained by that field alone, but require in addition a contribution from the self-energy of the electrons, or their radiation reaction. He writes: "The radiation reaction and the vacuum fields are two aspects of the same thing when it comes to physical interpretations of various QED processes including the [[Lamb shift]], [[van der Waals forces]], and Casimir effects.&lt;ref&gt;Milonni, P.W. (1994). ''The Quantum Vacuum. An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics'', Academic Press, Inc., Boston, {{ISBN|0-12-498080-5}}, page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This point of view is also stated by Jaffe (2005): "The Casimir force can be calculated without reference to vacuum fluctuations, and like all other observable effects in QED, it vanishes as the fine structure constant, {{math|''α''}}, goes to zero."&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, R.L. (2005). Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum, ''Phys. Rev. D'' '''72''': 021301(R), http://1–5.cua.mit.edu/8.422_s07/jaffe2005_casimir.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notations==
The vacuum state is written as &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The [[vacuum expectation value]] (see also [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|Expectation value]]) of any field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; should be written as &lt;math&gt;\langle0|\phi|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=King&gt;
This "borrowing" idea has led to proposals for using the zero-point energy of vacuum as an infinite reservoir and a variety of "camps" about this interpretation.

'''Wiser.org''', formerly WiserEarth.org, was a user-generated online community space for the social and environmental movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/06/wiser_earth_paul_hawken.php|title=WISER Earth: User Created Directory of 'the Largest Movement on Earth'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the social networks for environmental sustainability and social change, Wiser.org was the primary initiative of the non-profit organization WiserEarth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiser.org/|title=WISER {{!}} Workie Institute for Social and Educational Research|website=WISER|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tracks the work of non-profits around the world.&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9801533-2.html] "WiserEarth tracks the work of nonprofits around the world" by Elsa Wenzel ''cnet news,'' October 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The site mapped and connected [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), businesses, governments, groups, and individuals addressing [[global issue]]s such as [[Climate_change#Human_influences|climate change]], [[poverty]], [[Ecology|the environment]], [[peace]], [[Water#Water_politics_and_water_crisis|water]], [[hunger]], [[social justice]], conservation, [[human rights]], and more.

==History==
Wiser.org was launched as WiserEarth.org on Earth Day (April 22) 2007 as an online directory of the 100,000+ organizations touched upon in [[Paul Hawken]]'s book, [[Blessed Unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, P. (2007). ''Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming''. Viking Press. {{ISBN|978-0-670-03852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawken had amassed a collection of business cards from thousands of organizations over the years, but had not found a comprehensive directory listing all non-profit organizations involved in the social justice and environmental sector.  Estimating the total number of non-profit organizations around the world to be well over a million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.metropolismag.com/uncategorized/blessed-unrest/|title=Blessed Unrest - Metropolis|date=2007-04-01|work=Metropolis|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawken launched Wiser.org, which stands for the World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility, as an online directory to help map out the work done by these organizations.  Today, Wiser.org incorporates additional social networking features, such as status updates, likes, walls, groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/07/wiser-earth-a-free-platform-for-networks-of-networks-and-communities-of-action.html] Beth's Blog - How Nonprofits Can Use Social Media&lt;/ref&gt; and email messaging to provide greater possibilities for collaboration.  Wiser.org has expanded its organization directory to include listings of for-profit businesses and government agencies.

On 17 March 2014, it was announced on the Wiser.org website that it would be archived and [[Wiser.org#Shutdown|shutdown]] on 10 April 2014.&lt;ref name=17_Mar_letter /&gt;

==Facts and figures==
As of September 15, 2012, Wiser.org provided a directory of more than 114,000 organizations worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;"Paul Hawken Speaks about Social Change:The New Global Movement" by Felicia M. Tomasko [http://www.independent.com/news/2007/may/10/paul-hawken-speaks-about-social-change/ Santa Barbara Independent, Thursday, May 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/organization|title=http://www.wiserearth.org/organization|website=www.wiserearth.org|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 71,900 registered members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiserearth.org/people Wiser.org Members]&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 2,800 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/groups|title=http://www.wiserearth.org/groups|website=www.wiserearth.org|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured resources and information on various social issues ranging from women's rights to climate change. These resources and information are organized into 47 distinct issue areas and 381 sub-issue areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/issues|title=http://www.wiserearth.org/issues|website=www.wiserearth.org|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiser.org was available in English, Chinese (simplified), French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

==Wiser.org Directory==
The Wiser.org Directory was organized around a master list of issues which are "networked" in such a way that registered users could edit the "connections" of each issue to organizations, resources, jobs, events, and groups. The website featured groupware and social networking components including graphical "Network Maps". A unique "Solution form" allowed any logged in user to state a serious social or environmental problem and propose a way to solve it. The Solution then becomes a named entity that can be shared, modified, and acted upon as the proposed solution is implemented in the real world. The solution form included a place to record results and observations. Each Solution was provided with a publishing and networking page and a discussion forum. Wiser.org also incorporates embedded [[Google Maps]] integrated with the geographical data. The website was a non-profit venture and was free to the public. The data is published under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] 3.0 license.

==Wiser.org API==
As of June 2009, Wiser.org offered a [[Representational State Transfer|RESTful]] [[API]] developed under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] 3.0 license. The Wiser.org API provides access to an extensive database of "entities" such as Organizations, Groups, Jobs, Events, Resources, and Solutions. There is an associated FAQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiser.org/article/7b8548f1433a87584fb80484085a6e92|title=Wiser.org API FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Developer's Documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiser.org/article/d5f9154fa4cc8681fddb44c40bd8f202|title=Wiser.org API Documentation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; page.

== Shutdown ==
On 6 January 2014, Executive Director Peggy Duvette published an open letter on the website beginning "Dear Wiser.org Member,"&lt;ref name=jan_6_letter /&gt; in which she wrote:

{{quotation | '''''Snippet from Peggy Duvette's open letter of 6 Jan 2014:'''''
&lt;br/&gt;
Wiser.org and its community of over 80,000 members will be going through a number of changes over the coming months as we explore a new strategic direction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These changes are happening after gathering extensive feedback and input from editors and active members of our community. It means that my team and I will begin to look for a new home for Wiser.org's community and content. The avenues which we are exploring include:
&lt;br/&gt;
:* working with a partner organization

:* data archiving i.e. preserving a publicly accessible archive of all site content including personal profiles, for example through a service like the [[Wayback Machine]].

:* making Wiser's API data publicly available. 
&lt;br/&gt;
If you might be interested in repurposing any of Wiser.org's content, please let us know. | }}

The letter was subsequently updated on 24 January 2014 to include a "More information about these changes...." section,&lt;ref name=jan_24_letter /&gt; which disclosed that the need for the changes is largely due to the ongoing cost of maintaining the organization's website, and upgrading it as will be needed.

{{quotation | '''''Snippet from Peggy Duvette's open letter of 6 Jan 2014; updated 24 Jan 2014:'''''
&lt;br/&gt;
...maintaining social media platforms and tools comes at a cost. The software technologies that we are using need continual maintenance and upgrades. And to do this, they require constant funding, development and innovation. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
After looking at budget projections, WiserEarth’s board, which helps run Wiser.org, has realized that it is going to have to make some tough choices. Do they compromise their ethics by opening up to advertising? Do they continue to invest resources in fundraising just to keep the technical tools relevant? Or do they instead let go of the constant need to keep up with the latest, shiny new objects? At the same time, the WiserLocal program that was launched in 2009 continues to grow. How can they continue to protect and scale this program?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The technical questions are made all the more challenging as Wiser.org has been fortunate enough to have funds put aside that could help keep the platform running for the next 7 years. However, it does not cover the necessary upgrades that would be needed for maintenance and staff costs. | }}

On 17 March 2014, Duvette published another open letter to "Wiser.org friends, members and supporters,"&lt;ref name=17_Mar_letter /&gt; in which she wrote: "After many months of reflection and extensive feedback from Wiser.org members, editors and our board of directors, we have decided to close and archive the Wiser.org website. The archiving of the site will take place on April 10th 2014."  She continued:

{{quotation | '''''Snippet from Peggy Duvette's open letter of 17 Mar 2014:'''''
&lt;br/&gt;
Our priority now is to ensure that all the hard work over the years is nurtured and continues to thrive in the hands of other community leaders in the field. To this end, we have been working with partners who will help re-purpose parts of Wiser.org's content and support our community. Once our site is closed, the following partners have offered to build upon our data set:
&lt;br/&gt;
:*[[GuideStar|Guidestar]] - "Revolutionize philanthropy by providing information about non-profits"
:*[[TechSoup Global]] - "Leverage technology for social change"
:*Founding Family - "Evolving American democracy"
:* Earth Deeds - "Transforming carbon footprints"
:* Amp - "Find and share best sustainability resources"
&lt;br/&gt;
For members who would like to continue to network, build collaborations and take action on the ground, we are recommending the following networks:
&lt;br/&gt;
:*[[Action Without Borders|Idealist]] - "Connect with 90,000 organizations to help build a better world"
:*[[Bioneers]] - "Revolution from the Heart of Nature"
:* The Pachamama Alliance - "Educates, inspires and empowers committed people everywhere to bring forth a thriving, just and sustainable world"
:* Transition US - "Building Community Resilience through local grassroots actions"
:*[[TechSoup_Global#NetSquared|Netsquared]] - "Connecting People for the Common Good'
:* Women's Earth Alliance - "To invest in grassroots women's leadership to drive solutions to our most pressing ecological concerns? | |source=}}

She concluded with: "We trust that the members of the Wiser.org community will continue to create lasting impact across the many global and local networks that we are part of and through the wonderful organizations and communities we work with." Further information about what will happen to individual and group listings was provided.

The Wiser.org website now contains the words "WiserEarth 2005-2014," as if on a tombstone, in the upper-left corner of the dark brown footer area of each of its website's pages; along with the words "Wiser.org is closing," followed by a "read more" link to the details, just beneath the header of its website's front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiser.org|work=Wiser.org's website's front page|publisher=WiserEarth|accessdate=18 March 2014|title={title}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411035152/http://wiser.org/|archive-date=2014-04-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
