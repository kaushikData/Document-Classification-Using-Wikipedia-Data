      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10332">An '''administrative centre''' is a seat of regional administration or [[local government]], or a [[county town]], or the place where the central administration of a [[Township|commune]] is located.

In countries which have French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate ''capoluogo''), a '''chef-lieu''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛfljø}}, plural form ''chefs-lieux'' (literally "chief place" or "head place"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. 

==Algeria==
The capital of an [[provinces of Algeria|Algerian Province]] is called a '''chef-lieu'''. The capital of a [[districts of Algeria|district]], the next largest division, is also called a '''chef-lieu'''. While the capital of the lowest division, the [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]], is called '''agglomeration de chef-lieu''' (chef-lieu  [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]) and is abbreviated as '''A.C.L.'''

==Belgium==
The '''chef-lieu''' in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium]].  Three of these cities also give their name to their province ([[Antwerp]], [[Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]).

==Luxembourg==

Luxembourg is divided into two judicial [[arrondissement]]s (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]]s and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengen'').

Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a '''chef-lieu''' and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.

==France==
The '''chef-lieu of a [[departments of France|département]]''' is known as the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]''. This is the town or city where the [[prefect]] of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the [[prefecture]]. In every [[French region]], one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of ''Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…'' and the city where the regional prefect is found is known  as ''chef-lieu of the  region'' or,  more commonly, ''Regional prefecture''. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment.  

The '''chef-lieu of an [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]''', commonly known as the ''[[Subprefectures in France|sous-préfecture]]'' is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the [[sub-prefecture]]. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the ''Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture'', who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[cantons of France|canton]]''' is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it.  In past decades, there was always a [[Gendarmerie]], a treasurer and a justice of the peace.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[communes of France|commune]]''' is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.

==Jordan==
In the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the administrative centres are known as "chief towns" or [[Nahias of Jordan|''nahias'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (''qda''), a district (''liwa''), or a [[Governorates of Jordan|governorate]] (''muhafazah'').

==New Caledonia==
The '''chef-lieu''' indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So [[Nouméa]] is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So [[Wé]] is part of the town of [[Lifou]], but is the chef-lieu of Lifou.  In the [[Loyalty Islands]] and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.

==Francophone West Africa==
Many of the West African states which gained independence from [[France]] in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a ''Chief-Lieu''.  States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.‑P. (eds), 1998, "Les arènes locales face à la décentralisation et démocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural béninois", in Bierschenk T. &amp; Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le Bénin rural entre démocratisation et décentralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11‑51.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taking [[Communes of Niger|Niger]] and [[Communes of Mali|Mali]] as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu.  The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of [[French West Africa]], and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fay [La décentralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122].&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, [[Cercles of Mali]]/[[Departments of Niger]], and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bréhima Béridogo, [« Processus de Décentralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalisées », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for Mali, see Bréhima Kassibo, [« La Décentralisation au Mali : État des Lieux », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997  http://apad.revues.org/579]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chefs-lieux'' of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a "High Council of Collectivites" seated at the nation's capital.  Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a ''Place''/''Site'' (''Site'' in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the ''Chief-Place'' even at the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-17%20regime%20financier.pdf REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n° 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 déterminant le régime financier des Régions, des Départements et des Communes]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], the term is applied to the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]], which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the [[republics of Russia|republics]], for which the term "[[capital city|capital]]" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in [[Ukraine]].

==Switzerland==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is applied to the capital of each [[Swiss canton]].  In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.

==Tunisia==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is used to designate the capital of each  '''gouvernorat''' (department).  Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into '''delegations'''  (districts) which each have a central city as '''chef-lieu of delegation'''.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] it is the centre of a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]], which is distinct from a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic county]] with a county town.

==Popular culture==
* ''The Fiancée of the pirate'' (1969) is a film by [[Nelly Kaplan]], where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">'''Benjamin Donn''' or '''Donne''' (1729–1798) was an English mathematician.

==Life==
Donn was born at [[Bideford]], [[Devon]], where his father and brother Abraham (1718–1746) kept a school. Until 1768 he was a ‘teacher of the mathematics and natural philosophy on the Newtonian principles’ in his native town.

In 1768 he was elected librarian of the Bristol Library, and had fruitless plans converting it into a mathematical academy. As his official duties were light, he started an academy at Bristol on his own account, in the park, near St. Michael's Church; and in the year of his election published his ''Young Shopkeeper's &amp;c. Companion'', which was specially compiled for that academy. In addition to his school he gave a course of fourteen lectures in experimental philosophy to subscribers at one guinea each. These lectures he continued to deliver when he left Bristol for [[Kingston, Devon|Kingston]] near [[Taunton]]; but then he delivered them in the Christmas or midsummer vacation. He would travel thirty miles for twenty subscribers, or fifty miles for thirty subscribers. By 1775 he was settled at Kingston.

Towards the end of his life he was appointed master of mechanics to the king, on the death of [[Anthony Shepherd]]. He died in June 1798. Donn mentions in his ''Mathematical Tables'', 1789, that he has added a final e to his name; but on the title-page the name is spelt Donn.

==Works==
[[File:1765 Benjamin Donn Wall Map of Devonshire and Exeter, England - Geographicus - Devon-donn-1765.jpg|thumb|Map of Devonshire by Benjamin Donn (1765)]]
From 1749 to 1756 he contributed to the ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]'', then edited by John Badder and [[Thomas Peat]], but ceased to contribute after 1756, when Peat became sole editor. His contributions were accounts of [[eclipse]]s observed at Bideford, and answers to most of the mathematical questions in it of the period.

Donn published in 1765 a map of Devonshire, from a survey he took himself, for which he received a premium of £100 from the [[Society of Arts]]. He published further maps.&lt;ref&gt;A map of the country eleven miles round Bristol, from an actual survey, 1770; a pocket map of the city of Bristol circa 1775; map of the western coast of England, containing Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall; charts of the Western Ocean;&lt;/ref&gt; and produced mathematical instruments, a list of which is in ''Mathematical Tables'', 1789.

His works are:

*‘A New Introduction to the Mathematics; being Essays on Vulgar and Decimal Arithmetic,’ 1758, 2nd edit., called ‘Mathematical Essays, or a New Introduction,’ &amp;c. 1764. 
* ‘The Geometrician, containing Essays on Plane Geometry and Trigonometry,’ 1759; 2nd edit. 1775; another, called 2nd edit., 1778. 
* ‘The Accountant, containing Essays on Bookkeeping by Single and Double Entry,’ 1759; 2nd edit. 1775.
* ‘Essay on the Doctrine and Application of Circulating or Infinite Decimals,’ 1759; 2nd edit, 1775. 
* ‘The Schoolmaster's Repository, or Pupil's Exercise.’ Intended as a supplement to the ‘Mathematical Essays,’ 1764. 
* ‘Epitome of Natural and Experimental Philosophy,’ 1771. 
* ‘The Young Shopkeeper's, Steward's, and Factor's Companion,’ 1768; 2nd edit. 1773. 
* ‘The British Mariner's Assistant, containing forty tables adapted to the several purposes of Trigonometry and Navigation, to which is added an Essay on Logarithms and Navigation Epitomized,’ 1774. 
* ‘Mathematical Tables, or Tables of Logarithms,’ 1789.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">'''Bolson''', is a [[geographic]] term for a [[desert]] [[valley]] or [[Depression (geology)|depression]], the level of which has been raised by [[aggradation]], usually draining into a [[Sink (geography)|playa]] or salt pan, and entirely surrounded by hills or mountains. It is a type of [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] characteristic of [[basin and range topography]].
 
The term was an [[American English|Americanism]] originating in the 1830s and 1840s during the explorations of the far west of [[North America]], particularly of what became the [[Southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bolson bolson] from dictionary.com accessed July 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  It was derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''bolsón'', (large purse).&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/science/bolson  bolson] from www.britannica.com accessed July 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of this type of formation would be the [[Hueco Bolson]] in the western [[Trans-Pecos]] of [[Texas]], and the [[Mesilla Bolson]] in southern [[New Mexico]] and the northeastern part of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico. 

Bolsons are the locations of large aquifers of waters, accumulated over millennia in their deep layers of sediments, now many are being used to supply water to the populations in those areas.  These are called bolson aquifers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/hueco_bolson.htm The Hueco Bolson: An Aquifer at the Crossroads] from utminers.utep.edu accessed July 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bulgarian toponyms''' in [[Antarctica]] are approved by the [[Antarctic Place-names Commission]] in compliance with its ''[[wikisource:Toponymic Guidelines for Antarctica|Toponymic Guidelines]]'', and formally given by the [[List of Presidents of Bulgaria|President of the Republic]] according to the [[Constitution of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Constitution]] and the established international and Bulgarian practice.  Place naming is confined to nameless geographic features situated in the [[Antarctic Treaty]] area, the region south of the parallel 60 degrees south latitude.

Details of the Bulgarian Antarctic [[toponym]]s are published by the websites of the Commission and the international [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]] maintained by the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]].

A '''campamento''' ("camp" or "tent city") or '''población callampa''' ("mushroom town") are terms given in [[Chile]] to [[shanty towns]]. The term "mushroom town" refers to the speed in which these informal settlements sprung up between the 1960s and the 1980s, literally overnight. Nowadays the term "campamento" has replaced "mushroom town".

==Definition==
[[File:Pobreza Chile AB.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A ''campamento'' in the outskirts of [[Santiago]]]]

According to the NGO [[Un Techo para Chile]] ("A roof for Chile"), a ''campamento'' is defined as a group of crude dwellings of more than eight families, lacking at least one of the following [[basic service]]s: [[drinking water]], [[electricity]] and [[wastewater treatment]], and which are illegally residing on the land.&lt;ref name="untechoparachile"&gt;[http://www.untechoparachile.cl/cis/images/stories/Tesis/Empleo%20y%20Trabajo/El%20mercado%20laboral%20en%20campamentos.pdf El Mercado Laboral en Campamentos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311095729/http://www.untechoparachile.cl/cis/images/stories/Tesis/Empleo%20y%20Trabajo/El%20mercado%20laboral%20en%20campamentos.pdf# |date=2012-03-11 }}, CIS, Un Techo Para Chile. Department of Economy, [[University of Chile]]. December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==

As of 2004, there were 531 ''campamentos'' in Chile. A total of 27,785 houses were home to 32,371 families in these shanty towns. It was estimated that 75% of that population was living below the national [[poverty line]] and 41% living under [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="untechoparachile"/&gt;

The '''Canal des Pangalanes''' is a [[canal]] that consists of a series of natural rivers, waterways and man-made lakes that extends for over {{convert|645|km|mi|-1}} and runs down the east coast of [[Madagascar]] from [[Mahavelona]] to [[Farafangana]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar &amp; Comoros"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt; It is used primarily for transportation and fishing, and it has unspoiled natural beaches that are visited by tourists. An initial area of the canal in [[Toamasina]] (unofficially and in [[French language|French]] referred to as Tamatave) is straight, while subsequent areas have curves, [[lagoon]]s, connected lakes and [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/355562/Madagascar/279544/Trade-and-services Madagascar: Trade and services - Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction efforts began during the era of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina monarchy]], with major expansion during the [[French colonial empire|French colonial period]] between 1896 and 1904, and additional expansion during 1949–1957. Construction has included the manual cutting and removal of [[outcrop]]s to connect previously unconnected areas.

==Construction==
Initial expansion and maintenance of Canal des Pangalanes during the time of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina monarchy]] (c. 1540–1897), involved cutting through [[outcrop]]s to connect areas.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Significant expansions of the canal were undertaken by France with the support of [[Joseph Gallieni]] during the [[French colonial empire|French colonial period]] between 1896 and 1904&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; to increase trade, provide a means to supply troops that were located inland,&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; and to provide a safe route for cargo boats destined for Toamasina compared to traveling along the coast of the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt; By 1901, an uninterrupted canal existed between Toamasina and [[Andevoranto]], which extended {{convert|95|km|mi|-1}}.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt;

Additional construction from 1949 to 1957, cost over 800 million [[CFA franc]]s to complete.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Part of this project included the 570 million CFA franc construction of a river port at Toamasina and improvements to the canal for {{convert|30|km|mi|-1}} from Toamasina to south of [[Ivondro]], which was completed in 1953.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt;

Further work after World War II enabled 30-ton [[barge]]s to travel between [[Tamatave]] and [[Vatomandry]], a distance of {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}}.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;

A study in the 1950s regarding extending the canal for an additional {{convert|30|km|mi|-1}} from Ivondro to [[Manakara]] found that the cost would have been at least 1,400 million CFA francs.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; This proposal was shelved, due to concerns about the high construction costs when the trade between the two areas was low relative to these costs.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Population growth not attaining expected numbers in the areas during this time was a factor in the rejection of this extension.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Additional objections to this expansion came from businesspeople in Toamasina and Manakara, who voiced concerns about the potential to lose trade at the port of Toamasina.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Large navigation companies opposed this extension, to protect the high fees they imposed for cargo loading and unloading at auxiliary ports on the east coast.&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt;

==Use==
Canal des Pangalanes is used by local people: Some of them use [[canoe]]s for travel and make their homes along its banks.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; [[Ferry|Ferries]] run up and down navigable areas transporting items such as wood, charcoal, dried fish and other produce.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMR"/&gt; Many local people rely upon the canal for and, for some of them, it is their only means of travel.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; The canal provides fish for the locals, and cassava is grown along its banks.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; Coffee factories exist along the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/eastern-madagascar/canal-des-pangalanes The Pangalanes Canal - Lonely Planet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas have white, sandy beaches.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt;

A [[floating museum]] comprising a library was established in 1999 with the [[University of Toamasina]] and the [[University of Fianarantsoa]] with the collaboration of the [[University of Madagascar's Museum of Art and Archaeology]] operated by the [[University of Antananarivo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univ-antananarivo.mg/Institut-de-Civilisation-Musee-d Retrieved 27 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s renovations==
After use of the canal decreased, a large project in the 1980s restored and renovated it.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; The rehabilitation project included dredging areas overrun with [[silt]], the operation of a cargo service enabled by the purchase of a fleet of tug barges, and the construction of warehouses.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; By 2011 the tug barges were observed to be no longer in use and the warehouses were empty.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt; The tug barges are stored near the pier in Toamasina, where they are rotting.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;

==Pollution==
An oil refinery south of Toamasina contributes to pollution in that area of the canal, as evidenced by [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]s covered with grey-colored slime.&lt;ref name="Bradt"/&gt;

== Operation ==

It is headed by an executive body, the CASEC (Board of Communal Section) and a deliberative body, ASEC (Assembly of the Communal Section).

These two institutions are aided by CDSC (the Development Council of the Communal Section).

Within each, there are cities or neighborhoods, communities, ''habitations'', and '' lakou '' with sometimes difficult to grasp distinctions.

[[File:Cool tropics paradox.svg|260px|thumb|The cool tropics paradox. The geological evidence appeared to constrain temperatures to the red/blue band, whereas models produced the brown line taking just continental configuration into account, and the blue line when they included increased atmospheric {{co2}}. Vertical axis: Temperature; horizontal:latitude.]]
The '''cool tropics paradox''' refers to an apparent difference between modeled estimates of [[tropics|tropical]] [[temperature]]s during warm, ice-free periods of the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Eocene]], and the colder temperatures which proxies suggested were present. The long-standing paradox was resolved when novel proxy derived temperatures showed significantly warmer tropics during past greenhouse climates. The low-gradient problem, i.e. the very warm polar regions with respect to present day, is still an issue for state-of-the-art climate models.

==Origin of the paradox==
[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]]-based reconstructions of [[paleotemperature]] appeared to predict a low temperature gradient between the tropics and [[polar region|poles]]. Data from surface-dwelling [[foramanifera]] suggested that during the late Cretaceous, an unusually warm period, [[sea surface temperature]]s were cooler than today's.&lt;ref name="D'hondt1996"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = D'hondt, S.
 | author2=Arthur, M.A.
 | year = 1996
 | title = Late Cretaceous Oceans and the Cool Tropic Paradox
 | journal = Science
 | volume = 271
 | issue = 5257
 | pages = 1838
 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5257.1838
|bibcode = 1996Sci...271.1838D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later applied to similar situations, for example during the Eocene.

Climate models which worked during the Tertiary failed to produce this low temperature gradient; in order to match the observed data, they predicted that the tropics should be 40&amp;nbsp;°C or more - much hotter than the proxies said they were, and much hotter than the tropical surface temperatures observed today, which average around 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F). To attempt to match the data, bizarre models involving unreasonable eddies were required.

===Models===
Models were developed to predict and explain the lack of ice during the warm periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene. Models are developed according to the fundamental principle that they should be kept as simple as possible. Consequently, the first models attempted to explain the lack of ice using solely the different continental configuration.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; These could not produce an ice-free state without using an increased atmospheric concentration of {{co2}}; this assumption was checked against the evidence and found to be valid.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; This introduced a new difficulty: more {{co2}} would produce warmer tropical sea temperatures, and the evidence suggested they were the same or even colder than today's.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Data supporting cool tropical oceans===
Foraminiferal data, suggesting tropical temperatures cooler than today's, disagreed with terrestrial proxies, which spoke of warmer temperatures&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; - although most of the terrestrial figures are based on extrapolation of data from outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Lunt, D.J. |author2=Ross, I. |author3=Hopley, P.J. |author4=Valdes, P.J.

 | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.04.004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of error===
Analytical error is around 2−3&amp;nbsp;°C for individual specimens, but this drops to 0.5−1.0&amp;nbsp;°C when a sample is analysed - not enough to explain the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Crowley, T.J.
 | author2 = Zachos, J.C.
 | year = 2000
 | chapter = Comparison of zonal temperature profiles for past warm time periods
 | title = Warm Climates in Earth History

 | isbn = 978-0-521-64142-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors mean that any pristine sample can be considered to have an associated error of up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--page=62--&gt;&lt;ref name=Crowley2000 /&gt; Changes in salinity, kinetic and diagenesis, can also confound analysis: the latter two are each estimated to reduce estimated temperatures by 1−2&amp;nbsp;°C, and are difficult to quantify.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Reconciling the data with the model===
Taking the data to be true, how could they be reconciled with the predictions of the model? The only way the model could be "tweaked" was by fiddling with the parameterisation of clouds, one of the most unpredictable aspects of any model. The model was adjusted to assume that the higher {{co2}} levels produced more tropical cloud, shielding these regions from the sun's heat.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; However, there was no evidence for this behaviour, and still left problems. The poles were still ''warmer'' than the models predicted.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; Further feedbacks, including increased poleward heat transport by the oceans, and vegetational responses at high latitudes, were proposed, but these didn't fully explain behaviour in the southern hemisphere, and winter, respectively.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

==Unravelling the paradox==

===Hints of warmth - terrestrial proxies===
Data from terrestrial proxies suggested that the equator may have reached 30&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; - however, this figure is based upon extrapolation of data found outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; This would imply that the foramaniferal proxies were wrong - the tests may perhaps have been overprinted by [[diagenesis]]. Researchers turned to shallow marine [[Mollusca|molluscs]] as it is easy to determine whether their shells had been altered by diagenesis.

===Detecting diagenesis in molluscs===
Many mollusc shells are constructed from aragonite, a mineral that is quickly replaced by calcite by diagenetic alteration.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Also, near-shore molluscs preserve seasonal variability in their shells, a feature that would be lost in the presence of a diagenetic signal.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Kobashi, T. |author2=Grossman, E.L. |author3=Yancey, T.E. |author4=Dockery, D.T.
 | year = 2001
 | title = Reevaluation of conflicting Eocene tropical temperature estimates: Molluskan oxygen isotope evidence for warm low latitudes
 | journal = Geology
 | volume = 29
 | issue = 11
 | pages = 983–986
 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029&lt;0983:ROCETT&gt;2.0.CO;2
|bibcode = 2001Geo....29..983K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes ambiguity about whether or not a shell has been affected by post-deposition processes.

===Data from molluscs===
Evidence from the molluscs suggested a cooling between the Eocene and Oligocene.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Taken from the Mississippi embayment, they recorded temperatures of around 26&amp;nbsp;°C in the Eocene, and 22&amp;nbsp;°C in the Oligocene; this cooling was markedly seasonal, with reconstructed water temperatures being 5° cooler in the summer, but just 3° cooler in winter.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; This trend fits best if {{co2}} was the dominant force for cooling.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

The winter temperatures of molluscs match well with the foramaniferal temperatures, suggesting that foramanifera predominantly grew during the winter months.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; The overall temperatures corresponded well with terrestrial and modelled estimates of a sea surface temperature around 4–5° warmer than today's.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

===Reassessment of the foraminiferal record===
The magnesium/calcium paleothermometer is a recently developed alternative to the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O method, and avoids many of the uncertainties inherent in the latter method. Use of this technique generates results more consistent with those expected, in contrast to the original δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from the same sites.&lt;ref name=Tripati2003&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Tripati, A.K.

This task, which could seem trivial, is made hugely complex by the number of countries in the world having names which begin with the letter &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;. In September 2006, the proposal of the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian government]] to obtain the code &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; (Republic of Serbia) was accepted by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].

This code, used also as [[Country code top-level domain|Internet TLD]], was a major problem with the ISO's assignment of country codes to Serbia. All combinations of &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; as a first letter and any other letter in word Serbia, or even ''{{lang|sr|Srbija}}'' (in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), are already taken by other states:

The Government of Serbia made an official request that the alpha-2 code for Serbia should be &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; (Republic of Serbia), but there is an ISO recommendation against any reference to the form of government in these codes. &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; could also be an abbreviation for the historical name of today's Serbia, [[Serbian Grand Principality|Raška or Rascia]] which would be in full compliance with this rule (''see [[.ch]]''). The proposal, after an initial rejection by ISO, was accepted in September 2006.&lt;ref name="B92:RS and SRB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=205981 |title=Vlada predlaže skraćenice RS i SRB |trans-title=Government proposes abbreviations RS and SRB |work=[[B92]] |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2012 |language=Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least four examples where the rule against inclusion of government form was broken ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] has the code &lt;code&gt;CD&lt;/code&gt;, [[Federated States of Micronesia]] has the code &lt;code&gt;FM&lt;/code&gt;, [[Switzerland]] has the code &lt;code&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt; that stems from country's official [[Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|Confœderatio Helvetica}}'', and the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] has the code &lt;code&gt;KP&lt;/code&gt;, despite the fact that the codes &lt;code&gt;KO&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KA&lt;/code&gt; are available), and Serbia had good arguments for the use of the &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; code, because not a single one of the free codes beginning with &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; can be associated with it. &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; is also frequently used as an [[acronym]] for ''{{lang|sr|[[Republika Srpska]]}}'', an entity of nearby [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; this is not a conflict but adds the potential for confusion.  Other solutions could have been "generic" &lt;code&gt;SS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SX&lt;/code&gt;, although &lt;code&gt;SS&lt;/code&gt; was likely to be avoided for its association with the Nazi ''{{lang|de|[[Schutzstaffel]]}}''.

As this code is also to be used as Internet top-level domain for the country, there had been rumours of approaching either [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[United Nations]] or one of the countries in the list in order to switch the codes.

Negotiating the purchase or usage of the [[.sj]] Internet domain reserved for [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] was not a plausible option as [[Norway]], which administers this (through [[Norid|UNINETT Norid]]), has a policy of not commercializing or disposing of this domain.&lt;ref name="Norid:BV and SJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/bv-sj.html |title=The .bv and .sj top level domains |publisher=[[Norid|UNINETT Norid]] |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207215311/http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/bv-sj.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt; is a historic code for Serbia, it was hinted that the country could pursue talks with [[Solomon Islands]], the current owner of that code. However, it is worth noting that since ISO 3166-1 requires that a code is unused for five years before it can be re-used, this may not be possible even with the consent of the ISO and the previous holder, as users of the standard may object.

== Three-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 ==
{{see also|ISO 3166-1 alpha-3}}
A choice between the English mnemonic &lt;code&gt;SER&lt;/code&gt; or the Serbian &lt;code&gt;SRB&lt;/code&gt; was the main issue with the alpha-3 code.{{citation needed |date=November 2012}} A possible compromise between the two, &lt;code&gt;SBA&lt;/code&gt;, was also mentioned.{{citation needed |date=November 2012}} (&lt;code&gt;SRB&lt;/code&gt; should be immediately recognizable by speakers of most [[languages of Europe|European languages]], including English, though.)

The Institute for Standardization of Serbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iss.rs/en|title=Institute for Standardization of Serbia|website=www.iss.rs|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/member/2209.html|title=ISS|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the proposed alpha-2 code (&lt;code&gt;SP&lt;/code&gt;), decided that &lt;code&gt;SPA&lt;/code&gt; should be the alpha-3 code for Serbia.&lt;ref name="B92:SP and SPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=22&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=205509 |title=Kodovi Srbije SP i SPA? |trans-title=Serbian codes SP and SPA? |work=[[B92]] |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2012 |language=Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this proposal was unclear, since this decision had not been elaborated by the Institute. However, the decision resulted in a public outcry and was amended by the [[Government of Serbia]], which proposed &lt;code&gt;SRB&lt;/code&gt; for the alpha-3 code.&lt;ref name="B92:RS and SRB"/&gt; This was accepted by the ISO in September 2006.

== International licence plate code ==
{{see also|List of international vehicle registration codes}}
Although one would presume that countries take on the shortest code possible (by rule the same as their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), that is not the case. Thus, the "attractive" &lt;code&gt;SR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt; are available for Serbia, as Suriname uses &lt;code&gt;SME&lt;/code&gt;, while the Solomon Islands are identified by &lt;code&gt;SLB&lt;/code&gt;.

Ironically, &lt;code&gt;SRB&lt;/code&gt; had been advertised by the press as the likely solution — even though the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] used &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt; from 1911 to 1919, when it was replaced by &lt;code&gt;SHS&lt;/code&gt;, followed by &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;YU&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SCG&lt;/code&gt;. Abbreviation &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; was taken by Sweden the same year, making it unavailable for Serbia, despite being one of the first 17 countries in the world to be assigned this code.

Despite that &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SR&lt;/code&gt; are available for this purpose, official government bodies and the media are still maintaining the claim that the international license plate code for Serbia should (and could only) be its ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 code, &lt;code&gt;SRB&lt;/code&gt;.

== Country calling code ==
{{see also|List of country calling codes}}
Serbia will keep the telephone country calling code previously assigned to Serbia and Montenegro, '''+381'''. Following the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the country code '''+38''' was divided amongst the newly independent states:

{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col" | Country
! scope="col" | [[List of country calling codes|Calling code]]
|-
| {{flagcountry|Serbia}}
| +381
|-
| {{flagcountry|Montenegro}}
| +382
|-
| {{flagcountry|Kosovo}}
| +383
|-
| {{flagcountry|Croatia}}
| +385
|-
| {{flagcountry|Slovenia}}
| +386
|-
| {{flagcountry|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
| +387
|-
| {{flagcountry|Macedonia}}
| +389
|}

Two other codes from the 38 sequence have also been assigned:

{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col" | Country
! scope="col" | [[List of country calling codes|Calling code]]
|-
| {{flagcountry|Ukraine}}
| +380
|-
| {{noflag}}[[European Telephony Numbering Space]]
| +388
|}

Montenegro was assigned '''+382''' on 6 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/06/europe/EU_GEN_Montenegro_International_Code.php |title=Montenegro international code |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=6 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211044333/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/06/europe/EU_GEN_Montenegro_International_Code.php |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new code was phased in during 2007.

== ISO 4217 ==
{{see also|ISO 4217}}
This code is used for national currency, in this case the [[Serbian dinar]]. This three-letter code is composed of, by rule, first two letters of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and a third letter is initial of the currency itself: &lt;code&gt;RSD&lt;/code&gt;. Exceptions from the rule are made only in the third letter, if that suits the country better — however that is not the case here.

The '''Djadochta Formation''' (sometimes [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] '''Djadokhta''') is a [[geological formation]] situated in central [[Asia]] ([[Gobi Desert]]), dating from the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. Laid down in the early [[Campanian]], possibly starting in the latest [[Santonian]], it is dated somewhat uncertainly at about 75-71 mya ([[million years ago]]).&lt;ref name=PGetal2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Godefroit |first=Pascal |author2=Currie, Philip J. |author3=Li, Hong |author4=Shang, Chang Yong |author5= Dong, Zhi-ming  |year=2008 |title=A new species of ''Velociraptor'' (Dinosauria: Dromaeosauridae) from the Upper Cretaceous of northern China |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=432–438 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[432:ANSOVD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] are the famous "[[Flaming Cliffs]]", locally known as ''Bayanzag'' ("rich in ''[[Haloxylon]]''") or ''Ulaan-Ereg'' ("red cliffs").

It preserves an [[arid]] habitat of sand [[dune]]s, with little [[freshwater]] apart from [[oases]] and [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]]. In fact, the present-day climate at most Djadochta Formation sites differs little from what it was some 80 mya, except by being somewhat warmer and perhaps a bit less arid then. This is testimony to the fact that the location has long been so far from any major source of [[evaporation]] that little rainfall reached it, even before the [[Himalayas]] were uplifted which bar [[cloud]]s from reaching today's Gobi desert.

Most notable [[fossil]] discoveries have been the first confirmed [[dinosaur]] eggs (a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]], probably of ''[[Oviraptor]]'') and several dinosaur finds, ''[[Protoceratops]]'', ''[[Pinacosaurus]]'' and ''[[Velociraptor]]'' being the most prominent.
[[File:Resized pan-flaming-cropped2.jpg|thumb|right|600px|The [[Flaming Cliffs]], [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] of the Djadochta Formation.]]

==Fauna==
The fauna of the Djadochta Formation is very similar in composition to the nearby [[Bayan Mandahu Formation]]. The two share many of the same genera, but differ in the exact species. For example, the most common mammal in the Djadochta is ''[[Kryptobaatar dashzevegi]]'', while in the Bayan Mandahu, it is the closely related ''[[Kryptobaatar mandahuensis]]''. Similarly, the dinosaur fauna of the Djadochta includes ''[[Protoceratops andrewsi]]'' and ''[[Velociraptor mongoliensis]]'', which the Bayan Mandahu yields ''[[Protoceratops hellenikorhinus]]'' and ''[[Velociraptor osmolskae]]''.&lt;ref name=PGetal2008/&gt; It is likely that the nearby Bayn Mandahu represents a slightly younger, perhaps by 1 million years, assemblage of slightly more derived animals, possibly the direct descendants of their Djadochta counterparts.&lt;ref name="Longrichetal10"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=A new oviraptorid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Upper Cretaceous of Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia |journal=Palaeontology |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=945–960 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.00968.x|author1=Nicholas R.

The Marshalls consist of 29 atolls and five isolated islands, which form two parallel groups—the "Ratak" (sunrise) chain and the "Ralik" (sunset) chain.   The Marshalls share [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with [[Micronesia]] and  [[Kiribati]].  Two-thirds of the nation's population lives in [[Majuro]] and [[Ebeye]]. The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development.

'''Greenmuseum.org''' is a [[nonprofit]] online [[museum]] of [[environmental art]]. Since its launch in 2001, greenmuseum.org has become a source for information about this global art movement, which includes eco-art (or ecological art), [[land art]], art in nature and related terms.

As an online museum it is free to visit and open 24 hours a day throughout the year. It now receives close to 3,000 visitors per day (over one million visitors in 5 years). The website provides a forum for discussion, a toolbox of practical resources for policy makers, scientists, educators and communities, as well as the latest artists, exhibitions and event listings.  

In addition to presenting curated online exhibitions highlighting themes and issues, greenmuseum.org made possible the printed and online catalogue of the [[Contemporary Arts Center|Contemporary Arts Center of Cincinnati]]'s historic "Ecovention: current art to transform ecologies" exhibition in 2002, a collaboration with ecoartspace. In partnership with Amber Lotus Publishers, greenmuseum.org publishes a calendar of environmental art that is distributed internationally. 

Greenmuseum.org highlights developments in the environmental art movement and helps facilitate [[collaborative partnerships]] between a range of people, places and organizations. Its activities are designed to stimulate the diffusion of ecological art aesthetics, ideas and working methods to facilitate the creation of a more sustainable world culture.

The '''Grossglockner''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʀoːsˌɡlɔknɐ|-|De-at Großglockner.ogg}}; {{lang-de|Großglockner}} or just ''Glockner'' is, at 3,798 [[metres above the Adriatic]] (12,461&amp;nbsp;ft), the highest [[mountain]] in [[Austria]] and the highest mountain in the [[Alps]] east of the [[Brenner Pass]]. It is part of the larger [[Glockner Group]] of the [[Hohe Tauern]] range, situated along the main ridge of the [[Central Eastern Alps]] and the [[main chain of the Alps|Alpine divide]]. The [[Pasterze Glacier|Pasterze]], Austria's most extended [[glacier]], lies on the Grossglockner's eastern slope.

The characteristic [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]-shaped peak actually consists of two pinnacles, the ''Grossglockner'' and the [[Kleinglockner]] ({{convert|3770|m|ft|abbr=on}}, from German: ''groß'', "big",  ''klein'', "small"), separated by the ''Glocknerscharte'' [[col]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Glocknerer'' is first documented in a 1561 map designed by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] cartographer [[Wolfgang Lazius]]. The denotation ''Glogger'' is mentioned a 1583 description of the Tyrolean [[Kals am Großglockner|Kals]] legal district, then referring to the whole ridge south of the Alpine main chain. In the 1760s, the ''Atlas Tyrolensis'' listed a ''Glockner Berg'', the prefix ''Gross-'' ("great") is not mentioned before the first expedition in 1799.

According to the scholar [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (1735–1815), ''Glockner'' is possibly derived from German: ''Glocke'' ("[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]"), referring to the mountain's characteristic shape. It may also be a [[Germanisation|Germanised]] version of the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Alpine Slavic]] word ''Klek'' ("mountain"), as maintained in the Slovene name ''Veliki Klek''.

== Geography ==
=== Location and area ===
[[File:Großglockner (Umgebungskarte).png|thumb|left|Grossglockner and surrounding area]]
The Grossglockner lies on the border between the Austrian states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] ([[East Tyrol]]). The peak is part of the ''Glocknerkamm'' [[ridge]] in the [[Glockner Group]] that branches off the main chain of the Alps at Mt. [[Eiskögele (Glockner Group)|Eiskögele]], heading in a southeasterly direction and forming the boundary between the East Tyrolean municipality of Kals am Großglockner, about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the southwest at {{convert|1324|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and Carinthian  [[Heiligenblut]], about {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the northeast at {{convert|1291|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This boundary is also the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between the Kals Valley and its Teischnitz and Ködnitz [[side valley]]s on the Tyrolean side and the [[Möll]] Valley with the Pasterze glacier on the Carinthian side.&lt;ref&gt;Alpenvereinsführer, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grenzberg 25"&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Tiroler Landesarchiv|Periodical=Lebendige Geschichte|Title=Der Tiroler Grenzberg Großglockner in alten Karten und Geschichtsquellen : Zum 175-jährigen Jubiläum der Erstbesteigung des Großglockners am 28.

The Glockner is the highest mountain in the Alps east of the [[Ortler Alps|Ortler]] range, about {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, and, after [[Mont Blanc]], has the second greatest [[topographic isolation]] of all mountains in the Alps. Even its [[topographic prominence]], at {{convert|2424|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the second highest after Mont Blanc in the entire Alps (see the [[list of Alpine peaks by prominence]]). That makes it one of the most independent peaks in the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=433 |publisher=peakbagger.com |title=Core Europe Ultras - Peaks with 1500 meters of Prominence |access-date=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view from the Grossglockner summit is one of the farthest of all mountains in the Eastern Alps. It ranges out to {{convert|220|km|mi|abbr=on}} or, taking account of [[atmospheric refraction]], almost {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Its view over more than {{convert|150000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of the earth's surface reaches as far as the [[Iller-Lech Plateau|Upper Swabian Plateau]] in the northwest, to [[Regensburg]] and the peaks of the [[Bohemian Forest]] in the north, to Mt. [[Ortler]] in the west, to the [[Po Valley|Padan Plain]] in the south, and to [[Mt. Triglav]] and the [[Totes Gebirge]] range in the east.&lt;ref name="AV 262"&gt;Alpenvereinsführer, p. 262.

The Grossglockner rock summit, due to its high Alpine, heavily glaciated appearance, is often compared to the mountains of the [[Western Alps]]. Together with the Kleinglockner to the southeast it forms a distinctive [[double peak]]. There are differing views in the literature as to whether the Kleinglockner is a [[subpeak]] or a separate main summit. Due to its low topographic prominence and isolation as well as its close links in climbing history, it is counted as part of that of the Grossglockner in historic publications; however, in view of its separate [[climbing route]]s it is counted as an independent peak in [[mountaineering]] literature.

The ''Obere Glocknerscharte'' between the two peaks, at {{convert|3766|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest col in Austria, from which a [[couloir]] up to 55° in gradient and {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} in altitude descends down to the ''Glocknerkees'' glacier, called ''Pallavicinirinne'' after the Austrian mountaineer Alfred von Pallavicini (1848–1886). It runs northeastwards and borders on the Northeast and North Faces of the Grossglockner. The latter faces are bounded by the Northwest Ridge, part of the main Glockner crest, which runs over the ''Grögerschneid'', {{convert|3660|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the ridge elevations of [[Glocknerhorn]], {{convert|3680|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and [[Teufelshorn (Glockner Group)|Teufelshorn]], {{convert|3677|m|ft|abbr=on}}, to the ''Untere Glocknerscharte'', {{convert|3598|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which connects to the {{convert|3721|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Glocknerwand]].

A prominent ridge, the ''Stüdlgrat'', named after the [[Prague]] Alpinist Johann Stüdl (1839–1925), runs from the Grossglockner away to the southwest. Together with its extension, the ''Luisengrat'', it separates the West Face and the ''Teischnitzkees'' glacier at its foot from the South Face and its ''Ködnitzkees'' glacier. A couloir known as the ''Pillwaxrinne'' crosses the South Face below the Obere Glocknerscharte; most of the South Face lies east of this gully below the Kleinglockner. The east side of the Kleinglockner, the ''Glocknerleitl'', is glaciated to just below the summit and is continued by the ''Kleinglocknerkees'' and ''Hofmannskees'' before reaching the Pasterze.

== History ==
[[File:Großglockner Hacquet.jpg|thumb|left|''Klokner'', 1782 engraving by Belsazar Hacquet]]
The history of the climbs started with French-born natural scientist [[Belsazar Hacquet]], from 1773 professor of [[anatomy]] at the [[University of Ljubljana|Academy of Ljubljana]]. He travelled the [[Eastern Alps]] from 1779 to 1781 and published an [[travel literature|itinerary]] in 1783, describing the ''Glokner'' mountain and stating that it had not been climbed yet. He estimated the mountain's height with converted {{convert|3793|m|ft|abbr=on}} and left an [[engraving]] illustrating Grossglockner and Pasterze, the first known depiction of the mountain.

===First ascent===
Inspired by Hacquet's book and the [[first ascent]] of the Mont Blanc in 1786, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk|Gurk]] prince-bishop Count Franz Xaver of [[House of Salm|Salm]] (1749–1822) together with his vicar general [[Sigismund Ernst Hohenwart]] (1745–1825) and Baron [[Franz Xaver von Wulfen]] (1728–1805) started efforts for a Grossglockner expedition. They engaged two peasants from Heiligenblut as [[mountain guide]]s to do the first explorations for an ascent through the Leitertal valley, which is the side of Grossglockner with the least ice (people feared glaciers in these times). These valiant men, called "Glockners" in the records, did more than they were ordered to do - and probably reached the Kleinglockner summit on 23 July 1799.

One month later the bishop's expedition started: a [[mountain hut]] (the first Salm Hut) had been built and the path in the Leitertal valley was prepared so that the bishop could use a horse to reach it. 30 people, among them Salm, Hohenwart and Wulfen, were part of the expedition. They suffered with bad weather and a first effort failed, but on 25 August 1799 Hohenwart and at least four other people, including the two "Glockners", reached - again - the Kleinglockner, where they installed one of the first [[summit cross]]es (one of the main goals of the church expedition). Hohenwart's reports did not tell clearly that they had not touched the highest point but Bishop Salm (who had reached the ''Adlersruhe'' rock at {{convert|3454|m|ft|abbr=on}}) was informed. Dissatisfied, he invited another, even bigger expedition the next year.

On 28 July 1800, 62 people, among them the pedagogue [[Franz Michael Vierthaler]] and the botanist [[David Heinrich Hoppe]], started again into the Leitertal valley. Four peasants and carpenters (the "Glockners" and two others who are not known) did a track in the snow, had installed fixed ropes at some steeper sections up to the end of the Glocknerleitl, and even built a second refuge, called Hohenwarte Hut. The vanguard reached the Kleinglockner peak, however, according to the expedition records by the [[Dellach im Drautal|Dellach]] priest Franz Joseph Horasch (Orasch), only the four guides and Mathias Hautzendorfer, the local priest of the [[Rangersdorf]] parish, were able to cross the ''Obere Glocknerscharte'' and climb the Grossglockner summit. Hautzendorfer had to be persuaded to venture the step and administered the last rites in advance.

The two "Glockners" are usually identified as the brothers Joseph (''Sepp'') and Martin Klotz, however, this surname is not listed in the Heiligenblut parish register. A local peasant named Sepp Hoysen is documented as a member of the second Grossglockner expedition in 1802, and the surveyor [[Ulrich Schiegg]] mentioned one Martin Reicher as "Glockner" guide. The peasants and several other members of the expedition (among them Schiegg and his young apprentice [[Valentin Stanič]], who climbed Mt. [[Watzmann]] for the first time some weeks later) did the ascent again the next day and finally installed the summit cross and a [[barometer]] on the Grossglockner summit.

===Development===
Bishop Salm undertook two more ascents in 1802 (with Hohenwart reaching the summit) and in 1806, however, he himself never climbed beyond the ''Adlersruhe'' rock. The climbing of the Grossglockner was also described by the botanist [[Josef August Schultes]], who explored the massif together with Count [[Apponyi]] in 1802. No further ascents were made during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the huts decayed and were plundered by locals. In the following ''[[Vormärz]]'' era, however, the mountain became a popular venue for Alpinists like [[Hermann Schlagintweit|Hermann]] and [[Adolf Schlagintweit]], who all followed the route of the first ascent.

By the mid 19th century, the developing Alpine [[tourism]] began to alter the [[Transhumance in the Alps|traditional agriculture]] economy in the Heiligenblut area. Therefore, the people of Kals tried to lay out a straight ascent from the western side, which however was not reached until [[Julius von Payer]] explored the ridge between ''Glöcknerleitl'' and ''Ködnitzkees'' in 1863. Johann Stüdl had a [[via ferrata]] erected along the southwestern ridge the next year and the ''Stüdlhütte'' erected at its foot in 1868. Already in 1869, most expeditions to the summit started in Kals. The first winter ascent of the Grossglockner was made on January 2, 1875 by [[William Adolf Baillie Grohman]], a member of the [[Alpine Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='''Ascent of the Gross Glockner'''|journal=Alpine Journal| last1=Ballie-Grohmann|first1=W.A.|volume=Vii|page=222|date=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 Count Pallavicini and his guide Hans Tribusser undertook the first expedition up the steep glaciated Northeast Face, chopping 2,500 steps into the ''Pallavicinirinne'' in an [[ice climbing]] master stroke not repeated for 23 years.
[[File:Gipfelkreuz Großglockner.JPG|thumb|Großglockner summit cross, 2006 condition]]
In 1879 Count Pallavicini dedicated a new iron summit cross on the occasion of the [[silver wedding]] of Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]]; both had visited Heiligenblut and walked to the present-day ''Franz-Josefs-Höhe'' viewpoint in 1865. The cross was installed on 2 October 1880. Pallavicini also had the [[Archduke John of Austria|Archduke John]] Hut erected at the former ''Adlersruhe'' resting place of Bishop Salm, today the highest situated mountain hut in Austria. The [[Austrian Alpine Club]] built the new ''Salmhütte'' and the ''Glocknerhaus'' along the [[alpine route]] from Heiligenblut.

A first ascent by [[skiing]] was made in 1909 and the [[circumnavigation]] of the massif soon became a popular [[ski mountaineering]] tour. The Grossglockner became Austria's highest mountain, when the [[South Tyrol]]ean [[Ortler]] region had to be ceded to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] according to the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]], which promoted its reputation as a [[tourist attraction]].

[[Mass tourism]] was decisively promoted by the [[scenic route|scenic]] High Alpine Road (''Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße'') running from Heiligenblut to [[Bruck an der Grossglocknerstrasse|Bruck]] in [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] with a branch-off to the ''Franz-Josefs-Höhe'' viewpoint. It was built across the historic Hochtor [[Mountain pass|Pass]] of the Alpine divide between 1930 and 1935 according to plans designed by engineer [[Franz Wallack]]. The pass road, Austria's highest, reaches {{convert|2576|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country (second after [[Schönbrunn Palace]]) with about 270,000 vehicles and 900,000 visitors every year, about 50 million since its opening.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17769">The '''hide''' was an [[English units|English unit]] of land measurement originally intended to represent the amount of land sufficient to support a household. It was traditionally taken to be {{convert|120|acre|abbr=off}}, but was in fact a measure of value and [[tax assessment]], including obligations for food-rent (''{{lang|ang|feorm}}''), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army (''{{lang|ang|[[fyrd]]}}''), and (eventually) the ''{{lang|ang|geld}}'' [[land tax]]. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]], the hidage assessments were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] and there was a tendency for land producing [[GBP|£]]1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.

The hide was divided into 4 [[yardland]]s or [[virgate]]s. It was hence nominally equivalent in area to a [[carucate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictH.html#hide | title = Hide | website = How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement | author = Russ Rowlett | accessdate = 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a unit used in the [[Danelaw]].

==Original meaning==
The Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was ''hid'' (or its synonym ''hiwisc''). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root ''hiwan'', which meant "family".

[[Bede]] in his [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]] (c.731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, ''terra x familiarum'' meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work ''hid'' or ''hiwan'' is used in place of ''terra ... familiarum''. Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household&lt;ref&gt;Lennard pp.58-60&lt;/ref&gt; or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.&lt;ref&gt;Faith (1997) pp.132-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman,&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards p.5&lt;/ref&gt; to whom Stenton referred as "the independent master of a peasant household".&lt;ref&gt;Stenton p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holy Roman usage==
Hides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (''miles'') of the empire. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half-hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.&lt;ref&gt;Delbrück, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Anglo-Saxon England==
In early Anglo-Saxon England, the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of [[food rent]] (known as ''feorm'') due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the [[burh]]s and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.&lt;ref name=powicke18&gt;Powicke. Military Obligation in Medieval England. pp.18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.&lt;ref name=lipson16&gt;E. Lipson, The Economic History of England, 12th ed., vol. 1 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area,&lt;ref&gt;Faith (1997) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, "It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained."&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between  the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to [[Frank Stenton|Sir Frank Stenton]], "Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton p.287&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): "Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth £1, or, put another way,for land producing £1 of income to be assessed at one hide."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1987) pp.252-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story.

The document known as the [[Tribal Hidage]] is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton p.295.  See also Cyril Hart: The Tribal Hidage in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 5th series  Vol.21 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burghal Hidage]] (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton p.265.  See also David Hill &amp; A.R.Rumble (edd): The Defence of Wessex - The Burghal Hidage (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each [[County#United Kingdom|county]] was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, [[Northamptonshire]] was assigned 3,200 hides, while [[Staffordshire]] was assigned only 500.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt; This number was then divided up between the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]]s in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.

The hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or [[manorialism|manors]], usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, pp.644-6; Darby, pp.1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.

==After the Norman conquest==
The Norman kings, after the Conquest, continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In  1084,  [[William the Conqueror|William I]] laid an exceptionally heavy geld  of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of  the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year,  and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a  tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third  of the annual value of his land.&lt;ref name="lipson16"/&gt; A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide.

[[Domesday Book]], recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I  in 1086, states in hides (or [[carucate]]s or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey.&lt;ref name=darby106 /&gt; Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies.&lt;ref name=darby106&gt;See for example Darby, pp. 106-8, and Bailey.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066  and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1987) pp.257ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the [[demesne]] land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it.  Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey pp.186-189&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pipe Rolls]], where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions.

The last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.&lt;ref&gt;See J.A.Green&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other terms==
A hide was usually made up of four [[virgate]]s although exceptionally [[Sussex]] had eight virgates to the hide.&lt;ref name="brandon198"&gt;Dennis Haselgrove. The domesday record of Sussex ''in'' Brandon's. South Saxons. pp. 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; A similar measure was used in the northern [[Danelaw]], known as a  [[carucate]], consisting of eight [[Oxgang|bovate]]s, and [[Kent]] used a system based on a "sulung", consisting of four [[Yoke (unit of measurement)|yokes]], which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, pp. 281-2, 647&lt;/ref&gt; These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments.

In some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: "The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third ({{frac|40|120}}) of 2 shillings—that is, 8 pence—though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.&lt;ref&gt;Darby (1971) p.274 and see Maitland (1987 edition) p.475&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belém do Pará em mapa de 1629 por Albernaz I.PNG|thumb|left|Detail of "Pequeno atlas do Maranhão e Grão-Pará" showing the city of [[Belém]], Brazil, 1629]]

João Teixeira Albernaz must have learned the craft from his father [[Luís Teixeira]], starting his own work in the seventeenth century. On 29 October 1602 he got his licence as master for "[[Nautical chart]]s, [[astrolabe]]s, [[compass needle]]s and [[cross-staff]]", having been examined by the royal chief-[[cosmographer]], [[João Baptista Lavanha]]. Three years later, in 1605, he was appointed [[cartographer]] for the [[Casa da Índia|Warehouse Guinea and India (Casa da Mina and India?)]], where he worked until the end of his life.

In the [[Archive of the Indies]] in Seville, there is a document recording his presence and also his brother, [[Pedro Teixeira]] in [[Madrid]] in order to design charts of ''Strait of St. Vincent'' and the [[Strait of Magellan]]. In 1622 presented a petition to the post of chief [[cosmographer]], but the post was passed over to Valentim de Sá. In the late seventeenth century, in an opinion issued by Manuel Pimentel about the 1642 Atlas of Brazil, warns that errors in the first chart of this Atlas, which did not respect the boundary agreed between Portugal and Spain, concluding that the book was "no more than good paintings and illuminations".

==Works==
His work is of great interest both for its breadth and variety, and for the record of the progress of discovery and Portuguese maritime and overland exploration, particularly with regard to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. His works amount to nineteen [[atlas]], grouped and loose charts, in a total of two hundred and fifteen charts. Those include:

*c. 1616 - a copy of the codex titled ''"Rezão do Estado do Brasil"''. According to [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]] and Helio Vianna, only the charts of this codex are by João Teixeira.
*1621 - Chart of the Strait of S. Vicente and Strait of Magellan, with his brother Pedro Teixeira de Albernaz
*c. 1626 -"Livro que dá Rezão do Estado do Brasil", containing twenty-two chats, being a larger copy of the earlier 1616
*1630 - ''Atlas Taboas geraes de toda a navegação, divididas e emendadas por Dom Ieronimo de Attayde com todos os portos principaes das conquistas de Portugal delineadas por Ioão Teixeira cosmographo de Sua Magestade, anno de 1630'', manuscript in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=LC&gt;{{cite web|last=Congress|first=Library|title=Taboas geraes de toda a navegação / divididas e emendadas por Dom Ieronimo de Attayde com todos os portos principaes das conquistas de Portugal delineadas por Ioão Teixeira cosmographo de Sua Magestade, anno de 1630.|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/gmd:@field%28NUMBER+@band%28g3200m+gct00052%29%29|work=LC Luso-Hispanic World, 8|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first map, a world map summarizing the geographic knowledge at the time, presents a controversial [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] shifted to the west, incorporating the mouth of the [[Rio de la Plata]] and northeastern North America under Portuguese rule.&lt;ref name=LC1&gt;{{cite web|last=Congress|first=Library|title=Portuguese View of the World at the Beginning of the 17th Century|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/view.html|work=Hispanic Division: Back to Portuguese Role in Exploring and Mapping the New World|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1631 - Atlas of the State of Brazil, available in 1960 in the Map Collection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rio de Janeiro. Covers thirty-six charts displaying frames, legend and shields or grantees of the Crown, are not met. Have been sent by organizing D. Jerónimo de Athayde, the donee Captaincy of Ilhéus. Contains several elements illuminating on the sugar industry, as well as representing the estuaries of the Rio de la Plata and the Amazon River, showing the patterns of demarcation between Spain and Portugal;
*1640 - Atlas of Brazil, composed of thirty-two letters on paper, that there are seven copies, of which the Historical Archives of the Ministry of Finance, Brazil. Has the particularity of each letter is preceded by a sheet with explanatory text. Codex exists in Torre do Tombo (Description of the land around the sea of St. Cross, commonly called Brazil, by John Teixeira, cosmographer of His Majesty the year 1640) is currently editing a full-color facsimile, showing thirty and letters, the first representing the territory of Brazil and the rest of its coast, with details of the final course of rivers, islands, ports and fortifications.
*1643 – ''Atlas Universal'' (''Livro vniversal das navegasões feito em Lisboa por Ioão Teixeira Cosmographo de Sva Magestade, Anno 1643''), "Universal Atlas" with eight charts. Considered an exceptional artistic value, different from other Atlas of the author, because it presents essentially [[hydrography|hydrographic]] information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4657">The '''Khawr Abd Allah''' ({{Lang-ar|خور عبد الله}}, {{IPA-afb|χor ʕɐbdɐɬɬɐ}}) is today an [[estuary]], but once was the point where the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers ([[Shatt al-Arab]]) emptied into the [[Persian Gulf]]. Located in the south of Iraq, the [[Iraq]]-[[Kuwait]]i border divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of [[Umm Qasr]] the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi. The [[Shatt al-Arab]] is now the point where the rivers drain out, east of the Khawr Abd Allah. As it extends northwestward into [[Iraq]], it changes its name to [[Khawr az-Zubayr]], at the location of [[Umm Qasr]]. From this point it links by canal again to the northwest and into the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] proper. It forms the northeast coastline of [[Jazirat Bubiyan]] and the north coastline of [[Warbah Island|Jazirat Warbah]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abd Allah Khawr|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these islands are officially [[Kuwait]], however [[Iraq]] does claim them.

It has also lent its name to the maritime Khawr Abd Allah Protocols, Kor Abd Allah or KAA Interoperability Protocols first developed by the British Royal Navy between March and June 2008 during the British command of [[Combined Task Force 158]] in close co-operation with Kuwaiti and Iraqi senior naval personnel and government advisers.

The non-legally binding KAA Interoperability Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by then, Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the British naval barrister and legal advisor to CTF 158. David Hammond is now the CEO &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/about-us/founder/]&lt;/ref&gt; of the UK charity Human Rights at Sea &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanrightsatsea.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and separately independently practices law as an English barrister.

The Protocols included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]]. On November 11, 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed on board {{HMS|Chatham|F87}} on 8 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/articles/2008/140.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614061202/http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/articles/2008/140.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/9010_Report_to_Congress_Dec_08.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The detail of the text of the KAA Interoperability Protocols has now been made available open source over the internet from leaked US diplomatic documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leakoverflow.com/questions/554987/09kuwait465-protocols-assist-iraqi-and-kuwaiti-navies-in]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the former Head of the Kuwaiti Navy, Major-General Ahmad Yousef Al-Mulla, was invited to speak at the United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Defence Studies]] (RCDS) in London on February 1, 2012 on the topic of the Khor Abdallah waterway as part of a lecture covering Kuwaiti-Iraqi maritime boundary interactions and future relations. The lecture was introduced by Lord Astor of Hever [[John Astor, 3rd Baron Astor of Hever]], the United Kingdom government's Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Ministry of Defense) and the [[Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies]] Vice Admiral [[Charles Style]]. It was also attended by representatives of the Iraqi embassy in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7294">Tradition states that [[Gondar]], the ancient capital of the [[Ethiopian Empire]], had 44 [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches. There are fewer churches in this list – Stuart Munro-Hay provides evidence that shows the number was meant to be taken symbolically, rather than literally – and not all of them are, properly speaking, in Gondar.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, information for this list taken from Munro-Hay, ''Ethiopia, the unknown land: a cultural and historical guide'' (London: I.B. Tauris, 2002), pp. 142-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Guadeloupe]]''', sorted by location.

Guadeloupe is an [[archipelago]] located in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is an [[overseas department]] ({{lang-fr|département d'outre-mer}} or ''DOM'') of [[France]]. Guadeloupe department comprises five islands: [[Basse-Terre Island]] and [[Grande-Terre]] (together forming Guadeloupe island) and the [[Dependencies of Guadeloupe|dependencies]]:  [[La Désirade]], [[Les Saintes]] and [[Marie-Galante]].

Farther to the north, [[Saint-Barthélemy]] and the French part of [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]] once came under the jurisdiction of Guadeloupe, but each is now an [[overseas collectivity]] (''collectivités d'outre-mer'' or ''COM'') of France.

He had no deep bond with Querétaro other than that he married Maria Dolores Najera who had spent much part of his childhood in Querétaro. He was a journalist, editor, playwright and poet Imperial, Ex-Prefect of Querétaro. He died in Mexico on October 20, 1889.

==Biography ==
Manuel Gutiérrez de Salcedo y Gomez was born in Mexico City in 1818&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/sanchiz?lang=es&amp;p=manuel&amp;n=gutierrez+de+salceda+gomez|title=Genealogía de Manuel Gutiérrez de Salceda Gómez|website=Geneanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had no deep bond with deep bond with Querétaro, except, perhaps, having married Dona Maria Dolores Najera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-12338-101866-81?cc=1615259&amp;wc=MC3J-VTL:122580201,140903501|title=Casamiento: "México, Distrito Federal, registros parroquiales y diocesanos, 1514-1970," Database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-12338-101866-81?cc=1615259&amp;wc=MC3J-VTL:122580201,140903501 : accessed 30 June 2015), México, Distrito Federal, registros parroquiales y diocesanos, 1514-1970 &gt; México, Distrito Federal, registros parroquiales y diocesanos, 1514-1970 &gt; Asunción Sagrario Metropolitano (Centro) &gt; Matrimonios 1855-1859, 1864-1867 &gt; image 110 of 636; parroquias Católicas, Distrito Federal (Catholic Church parishes, Distrito Federal).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myheritage.com/FP/genealogy-search-ppc.php?lang=ES&amp;type&amp;action=person&amp;siteId=78625521&amp;indId=3000272&amp;origin=profile|title=Registros disponibles para Manuel Gutierrez de Salceda - MyHeritage|website=www.myheritage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had spent much of his childhood in the Estado. Nevertheless, Don Manuel peacefully ruled the Department for nearly two years.Se was a quiet season: all allowed to assume that the Empire would be strengthened, since the resistance of the Republicans had been relegated to distant regions north of the country. Almost nothing disturbed the peaceful bucolic living queretanos. to the extent that one of the main events of those years was nothing more than a gossip of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omnibiography.com/biografias/biografia.php?id=1759|title=omnibiography.com|website=omnibiography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in any monarchy, the offspring that the emperors could have was a constant concern. Since Maximilian and Carlota had no children, the Emperor decided to consolidate his dynasty through the adoption of a Mexican prince and, with curious logically chose Agustin de Iturbide and Green, grandson of the first Emperor of Mexico. He was son of Don Angel de Iturbide, that child still had taken refuge in Philadelphia after the shooting of his father and an Anglo-Saxon commoner, Alice Green. The only condition put Maximilian for adoption was that the new prince agreed to remove his name that second name, and thereafter the child Iturbide became heir to the throne.

The queretana society seems to have accepted without too much trouble its new status as imperial subject: his daily life continued without major setbacks, the same as its distractions. The famous diva Angela Peralta debuted with great success at the Teatro Iturbide, a function dedicated to Emperador. At the same time, the French officers gave a resounding Spanish dance at the Casino, that would be remembered for many years. Even tranquility became such that queretanos found commenting, as the main event in many months, the fire at the house of Don Timoteo Fernández de Jáuregui, who burned furiously for several hours; the site where he was met since as the Portal Quemado. A most moving event was the execution of General José María Ateaga in Uruapan, on 21 October 1865. The news deeply affected the queretanos, who view it as their lucky paper as governor of his state, and sadness the news deeply affected the queretanos, who view it as their lucky role as governor of his state, and sadness said despite the general died as a guerrilla, pawning their stubborn fight against the Empire.

During the government of Manuel Gutierrez Queretana Society of Geography and Statistics, she was founded on April 23, 1865, with the aim that it studies related to agriculture and the environment in the region were made. This society was, of course, a subsidiary of the Society of Geography and Statistics that worked in Mexico City.

However, the idyllic life of society queretana soon came to an end. Instead of consolidating, the Empire became weaker every day and could not overcome the many problems that acosaban. When the withdrawal of French troops was announced was evident to all that the day was clear to everyone that the days of Maximiliano were contados. Manuel Gutierrez resigned on 3 September 1866 and left the government in charge of his secretary, Jose Antonio Septién and Villaseñor. Years later, his son [[Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera]] become famous as one of the leading modernist poets. Shortly after, 1889 died in Mexico City; his son six years later in 1895 also in Mexico City.

[[Image:Sunflowers in bloom - Maremma Toscana - Italy - 25 June 2005.jpg|thumbnail|A sunflower field in Maremma]]
The '''Maremma''' is a coastal area of western central Italy, bordering the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. It includes much of south-western [[Tuscany]] and part of northern [[Lazio]]. It was formerly mostly [[marsh]]-land, often [[malarial]], but was drained and reclaimed as part of the [[Battle for Land]] under the [[Fascism in Italy|Fascist régime]] of the early twentieth century. Parts were repopulated with people from other [[regions of Italy]], notably the [[Veneto]].

It was traditionally populated by the ''[[Buttero|butteri]]'', mounted cattle herders who rode horses fitted with one of two distinctive styles of saddle, the ''scafarda'' and the ''bardella''.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

== Geography ==

The Maremma has an area of about {{nobreak|5000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The central part corresponds approximately with the [[province of Grosseto]], extending northward to the [[Colline Metallifere]] and the slopes of [[Monte Amiata]], but the region extends northward from [[Piombino]] to the mouth of the {{illm|Cecina (river)|it|Cecina (fiume)|lt=Cecina}}, and southwards into Lazio as far as [[Civitavecchia]].{{r|trecc}}

== Animal breeds ==

The Maremma has given rise to, or given its name to, several breeds of domestic animal. These include two breeds of [[working horse]], the [[Maremmano]] and the [[Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale]], formerly used by ''butteri'' and ''cavalcanti''; the [[Maremmana]] breed of large grey cattle; the [[Maremma Sheepdog|Maremmano]] breed of shepherd's guard-dog; and the [[Macchiaiola Maremmana]] breed of small pig, so named because it was kept [[extensive farming|extensively]], left to roam in the woodland.{{r|trecc}}

A '''mulch''' is a layer of material applied to the surface of [[soil]]. Reasons for applying mulch include conservation of soil moisture, improving fertility and health of the soil, reducing [[Weed control|weed]] growth and enhancing the visual appeal of the area.

A mulch is usually, but not exclusively, organic in nature. It may be permanent (e.g. plastic sheeting) or temporary (e.g. [[barkdust|bark chips]]). It may be applied to bare soil or around existing plants. Mulches of manure or compost will be incorporated naturally into the soil by the activity of worms and other organisms. The process is used both in commercial crop production and in gardening, and when applied correctly, can dramatically improve soil productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A–Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Many materials are used as mulches, which are used to retain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and for aesthetics.&lt;ref name="TurgeonMcCarty2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred J. Turgeon|author2=Lambert Blanchard McCarty|author3=Nick Edward Christians|title=Weed control in turf and ornamentals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-o4AQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-159122-6|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are applied to the soil surface,&lt;ref name="UpadhyayaBlackshaw2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahesh K. Upadhyaya|author2=Robert E. Blackshaw|title=Non-chemical Weed Management: Principles, Concepts and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyBJuCcFNsQC&amp;pg=PA135|year=2007|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-291-6|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; around trees, paths, flower beds, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, and in production areas for flower and vegetable crops. Mulch layers are normally {{convert|2| in|cm}} or more deep when applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegetable Gardening: Growing and Harvesting Vegetables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gvvck6nNNcC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2004|publisher=Murdoch Books|isbn=978-1-74045-519-0|pages=110–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittenger2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis R. Pittenger|title=California Master Gardener Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhWjHB1Zjf8C&amp;pg=PA567|year=2002|publisher=UCANR Publications|isbn=978-1-879906-54-9|pages=567–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are applied at various times of the year depending on the purpose. Towards the beginning of the growing season, mulches serve initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat which is lost during the night. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. As the season progresses, mulch stabilizes the soil temperature and moisture, and prevents the growing of weeds from seeds.&lt;ref name=Louise1996/&gt; In [[temperate climates]], the effect of mulch is dependent upon the time of year they are applied and when applied in fall and winter, are used to delay the growth of perennial plants in the spring or prevent growth in winter during warm spells, which limits freeze thaw damage.&lt;ref name="Snyder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon C. Snyder|title=Gardening in the Upper Midwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yxTnpOgLVMC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3838-3|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of mulch upon soil moisture content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere preventing sunlight from reaching the soil surface, thus reducing [[evaporation]]. However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from light rains.

In order to maximise the benefits of mulch, while minimizing its negative influences, it is often applied in late spring/early summer when soil temperatures have risen sufficiently, but soil moisture content is still relatively high.&lt;ref name="Whitefield" /&gt; However, permanent mulch is also widely used and valued for its simplicity, as popularized by author [[Ruth Stout]], who said, "My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both sides of my vegetable and flower garden all year long. As it decays and enriches the soils, I add more."&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Ruth. ''Gardening Without Work''. Devon-Adair Press, 1961. Reprinted by [http://www.nortoncreekpress.com/gardening_without_work.html Norton Creek Press], 2011, pp. 6-7. {{ISBN|978-0-9819284-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic mulch used in large-scale commercial production is laid down with a [[tractor]]-drawn or standalone layer of [[plastic mulch]]. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where [[raised bed]]s are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and [[seedling]]s are [[transplanting|transplanted]] through it. [[Drip irrigation]] is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water.

}}

Materials used as mulches vary and depend on a number of factors. Use takes into consideration availability, cost, appearance, the effect it has on the soil&amp;mdash;including chemical reactions and pH, durability, combustibility, rate of decomposition, how clean it is&amp;mdash;some can contain weed seeds or plant pathogens.&lt;ref name=Louise1996&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Louise | first1 = | last2 = Bush-Brown | first2 = James| year = 1996| title = America's garden book| pages = 768| isbn = 0-02-860995-6| publisher = Macmillan USA| location = New York| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of materials are used as mulch:
* [[Organic residue]]s: [[grass]] clippings, [[leaf|leaves]], [[hay]], [[straw]], kitchen scraps [[comfrey]], shredded [[Bark (botany)|bark]], whole bark nuggets, [[sawdust]], [[gastropod shell|shell]]s, [[woodchips]], shredded [[newspaper]], [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], [[wool]], animal manure, etc. Many of these materials also act as a direct [[compost]]ing system, such as the mulched clippings of a mulching [[lawn mower]], or other organics applied as [[sheet composting]].
* [[Composting|Compost]]: fully composted materials are used to avoid possible [[phytotoxicity]] problems. Materials that are free of seeds are ideally used, to prevent weeds being introduced by the mulch.
* Old carpet (synthetic or natural): makes a free, readily available mulch.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get Your New Garden Ready for Spring with Old Carpet|url = http://lifehacker.com/5873980/get-your-new-garden-ready-for-spring-with-old-carpet|website = Lifehacker|access-date = 2016-02-19|language = en-US|first = David|last = Galloway}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rubber mulch]]: made from recycled [[tire]] rubber.
* [[Plastic mulch]]: crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. This method is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year (disposal of plastic mulch is cited as an environmental problem).
* Rock and [[gravel]] can also be used as a mulch. In cooler climates the heat retained by rocks may extend the [[growing season]].

In some areas of the United States, such as central [[Pennsylvania]] and northern California, mulch is often referred to as "[[tanbark]]", even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word "mulch" is used specifically to refer to very fine tanbark or [[peat moss]].

===Organic mulches===
[[File:Mulching coconut 01.jpg|thumb|mulching_coconut farm]]
Organic mulches decay over time and are temporary. The way a particular organic mulch decomposes and reacts to wetting by [[rain]] and [[dew]] affects its usefulness.

Some mulches such as straw, peat, sawdust and other wood products may for a while negatively affect plant growth because of their wide carbon to nitrogen ratio,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eau.ee/~agronomy/vol07Spec1/p7sI53.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; because bacteria and fungi that [[decompose]] the materials remove [[nitrogen]] from the surrounding soil for growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&amp;ArticleID=3111&amp;Type=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Gillman|title=The Truth About Organic Gardening: Benefits, Drawnbacks, and the Bottom Line|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAAsf4H8BocC&amp;pg=PA51|date=1 February 2008|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-1-60469-005-7|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether this effect has any practical impact on gardens is disputed by researchers and the experience of gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Ruth. ''Gardening Without Work''. Devon-Adair Press, 1961. Reprinted by [http://www.nortoncreekpress.com/gardening_without_work.html Norton Creek Press], 2011, pp. 192-193. {{ISBN|978-0-9819284-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic mulches can mat down, forming a barrier that blocks water and air flow between the soil and the atmosphere.  Vertically applied organic mulches can wick water from the soil to the surface, which can dry out the soil.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=David A. Bainbridge|title=A Guide for Desert and Dryland Restoration: New Hope for Arid Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1PxyCuOwzwC&amp;pg=PA239|date=11 June 2007|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-61091-082-8|pages=239–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulch made with wood can contain or feed termites, so care must be taken about not placing mulch too close to houses or building that can be damaged by those insects. Some mulch manufacturers recommend putting mulch several inches away from buildings.

Commonly available organic mulches include:&lt;ref name=Louise1996/&gt;

====Leaves====
* ''[[Leaves]]'' from deciduous trees, which drop their foliage in the autumn/fall. They tend to be dry and blow around in the wind, so are often chopped or shredded before application. As they decompose they adhere to each other but also allow water and moisture to seep down to the soil surface. Thick layers of entire leaves, especially of maples and oaks, can form a soggy mat in winter and spring which can impede the new growth lawn grass and other plants. Dry leaves are used as winter mulches to protect plants from freezing and thawing in areas with cold winters, they are normally removed during spring.

====Grass clippings====
* ''[[Grass clipping]]s'', from mowed lawns are sometimes collected and used elsewhere as mulch. Grass clippings are dense and tend to mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction. Rotting fresh grass clippings can damage plants; their rotting often produces a damaging buildup of trapped heat. Grass clippings are often dried thoroughly before application, which mediates against rapid decomposition and excessive heat generation. Fresh green grass clippings are relatively high in nitrate content, and when used as a mulch, much of the nitrate is returned to the soil, conversely the routine removal of grass clippings from the lawn results in [[nitrogen deficiency]] for the lawn.

====Peat moss====
* ''[[Peat moss]]'', or [[sphagnum]] peat, is long lasting and packaged, making it convenient and popular as a mulch. When wetted and dried, it can form a dense crust that does not allow water to soak in. When dry it can also burn, producing a smoldering fire. It is sometimes mixed with pine needles to produce a mulch that is [[friable]]. It can also lower the pH of the soil surface, making it useful as a mulch under acid loving plants.
However peat [[bog]]s are a valuable wildlife [[habitat]], and [[peat]] is also one of the largest [[Carbon cycle#Terrestrial biosphere|stores of carbon]] (in [[Great Britain|Britain]], out of a total estimated  9952 million tonnes of carbon in British vegetation and soils, 6948 million tonnes carbon are estimated to be in [[Scotland|Scottish]], mostly peatland, soils&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milne|first=R.|author2=T. A. Brown|title=Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=1997|volume=49|pages=413–433|doi=10.1006/jema.1995.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so gardeners who wish to protect the environment will choose more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=John|title=How to Create an Eco Garden:  The practical guide to greener, planet-friendly gardening|date=2011|publisher=Aquamarine|location=Wigston, Leicestershire|isbn=9781903141892|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wood chips====
* ''[[Wood chips]]'' are a [[byproduct]] of the pruning of trees by [[arborist]]s, utilities and parks; they are used to dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather coarse after chipping and tend to be used as a mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. The decay of freshly produced chips from recently living woody plants, consumes nitrate; this is often off set with a light application of a high-nitrate fertilizer. Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used to mulch trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors.

====Woodchip mulch====
* ''[[Woodchips|Woodchip mulch]]'' is a [[byproduct]] of reprocessing used (untreated) timber (usually packaging pallets), to dispose of wood waste by creating woodchip mulch. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Woodchip mulch is often used under trees, shrubs or large planting areas and can last much longer than arborist mulch. In addition, many consider woodchip mulch to be visually appealing, as it comes in various colors. Woodchips can also be reprocessed into playground woodchip to be used as an impact-attenuating [[playground surfacing]].

====Bark chips====
[[File:Rindenmulch016.JPG|thumb|right|Bark chips]]
* ''[[Barkdust|Bark chips]]'' of various grades are produced from the outer corky [[Bark (botany)|bark]] layer of timber trees. Sizes vary from thin shredded strands to large coarse blocks. The finer types are very attractive but have a large exposed surface area that leads to quicker decay. Layers two or three inches deep are usually used, bark is relativity inert and its decay does not demand soil nitrates. Bark chips are also available in various colors.

====Straw mulch / field hay / salt hay====
[[File:Permaculture garden with a fruit tree, herbs, flowers and vetetables mulched with hay.JPG|thumb|[[Permaculture]] garden with a fruit tree, herbs, flowers and vegetables mulched with hay]]
* ''[[Straw|Straw mulch]]'' or ''[[Hay|field hay]]'' or ''[[salt hay]]'' are lightweight and normally sold in compressed bales. They have an unkempt look and are used in vegetable gardens and as a winter covering. They are biodegradable and neutral in pH. They have good moisture retention and weed controlling properties but also are more likely to be contaminated with weed seeds. Salt hay is less likely to have weed seeds than field hay. Straw mulch is also available in various colors.

====Cardboard / newspaper====
* ''[[Cardboard (paper product)|Cardboard]]'' or ''[[newspaper]]'' can be used as mulches. These are best used as a base layer upon which a heavier mulch such as compost is placed to prevent the lighter cardboard/newspaper layer from blowing away. By incorporating a layer of cardboard/newspaper into a mulch, the quantity of heavier mulch can be reduced, whilst improving the weed suppressant and moisture retaining properties of the mulch.&lt;ref name="Whitefield"&gt;Patrick Whitefield, 2004, ''The Earth Care Manual'', Permanent Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-85623-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, additional labour is expended when planting through a mulch containing a cardboard/newspaper layer, as holes must be cut for each plant. Sowing seed through mulches containing a cardboard/newspaper layer is impractical. Application of newspaper mulch in windy weather can be facilitated by briefly pre-soaking the newspaper in water to increase its weight.

====Carpet====
* Synthetic carpet that is composed of artificial fibers may be removed after planting to prevent fibers taking a long time to decompose, whereas carpet made from natural fibers may be kept in place, blocking competition from weeds. Rain is absorbed by carpet and then slowly released into the soil, reducing watering needs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Colored mulch==
Some organic mulches are colored red, brown, black, and other colors. [[Isopropanolamine]], specifically [[1-Amino-2-propanol]] or DOW™ monoisopropanolamine, may be used as a pigment dispersant and color fastener in these mulches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b8038004471f.pdf|title=Product Information - DOW™ Monoisopropanolamine (MIPA)|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316010922/http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b8038004471f.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0438/0901b803804389e1.pdf|title=Product Safety Assessment - DOW™ Monoisopropanolamine|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316003547/http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0438/0901b803804389e1.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/1dtko25_b7hmorTf_M3xePqjXXKrThhg0ASCCsLPTYlWdGykijCdPVM_zocI0/edit|title=Mulch_Magic_Red.pdf|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckerunderwood.com/media/products/resources/Mulch_Magic_Red_MSDS_353610CBD5790.pdf|title=Agriculture|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of mulch which can be dyed include: wood chips, bark chips (barkdust) and pine straw. Colored mulch is made by dyeing the mulch in a water-based solution of colorant and chemical binder. When colored mulch first entered the market, most formulas were suspected to contain toxic, heavy metals and other contaminates. Today, “current investigations indicate that mulch colorants pose no threat to people, pets or the environment. The dyes currently used by the mulch and soil industry are similar to those used in the cosmetic and other manufacturing industries (i.e., iron oxide),” as stated by the Mulch and Soil Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mulchandsoilcouncil.org/faqs/mulch.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616074850/http://www.mulchandsoilcouncil.org/faqs/mulch.php |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colored mulch can be applied anywhere non-colored mulch is used (such as large bedded areas or around plants) and features many of the same gardening benefits as traditional mulch, such as improving soil productivity and retaining moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/mulch.html|title=Indiana Yard and Garden – Purdue Consumer Horticulture - Purdue University|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mulch decomposes, just as with non-colored mulch, more mulch may need to be added to continue providing benefits to the soil and plants. However, if mulch is faded, spraying dye to previously spread mulch in order to restore color is an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/there-spray-can-use-renew-mulch-color-64513.html|title=Is There a Spray You Can Use to Renew Your Mulch Color?|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic (sour) mulch==
Mulch normally smells like freshly cut wood, but sometimes develops a [[toxicity]] that causes it to smell like [[vinegar]], [[ammonia]], [[sulfur]] or [[silage]]. This happens when material with ample nitrogen content is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets of increased decomposition. When this occurs, the process may become anaerobic and produce these [[phytotoxic]] materials in small quantities. Once exposed to the air, the process quickly reverts to an aerobic process, but these toxic materials may be present for a period of time. If the mulch is placed around plants before the toxicity has had a chance to dissipate, then the plants could very likely be damaged or killed depending on their hardiness. Plants that are predominantly low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible, and the phytotoxicity may prevent germination of some seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/envirohort/factsheets2/landsmaint/jul94pr5.html|title=Beware of Sour Mulch|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331080829/http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/envirohort/factsheets2/landsmaint/jul94pr5.html|archivedate=31 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If sour mulch is applied and there is plant kill, the best thing to do is to water the mulch heavily. Water dissipates the chemicals faster and refreshes the plants. Removing the offending mulch may have little effect, because by the time plant kill is noticed, most of the toxicity is already dissipated. While testing after plant kill will not likely turn up anything, a simple [[pH]] check may reveal high acidity, in the range of 3.8 to 5.6 instead of the normal range of 6.0 to 7.2. Finally, placing a bit of the offending mulch around another plant to check for plant kill will verify if the toxicity has departed. If the new plant is also killed, then sour mulch is probably not the problem.

==Groundcovers (living mulches)==
{{Main|Groundcovers|Living mulch}}
Groundcovers are plants which grow close to the ground, under the main crop, to slow the development of weeds and provide other benefits of mulch. They are usually fast-growing plants that continue growing with the main crops. By contrast, [[cover crop]]s are incorporated into the soil or killed with [[herbicide]]s. However, live mulches also may need to be mechanically or chemically killed eventually to prevent competition with the main crop.&lt;ref&gt;Brandsaeter et al. 1998, Tharp and Kells, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groundcovers can perform additional roles in the garden such as [[nitrogen fixation]] in the case of [[clovers]], [[dynamic accumulation]] of nutrients from the [[subsoil]] in the case of creeping [[comfrey]] (''Symphytum ibericum''), and even food production in the case of ''[[Rubus]] tricolor''.&lt;ref name = "Jacke"&gt;Jacke and Toensmeier, Edible Forest Gardening, vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-site production==
Owing to the great bulk of mulch which is often required on a site, it is often impractical and expensive to source and import sufficient mulch materials. An alternative to importing mulch materials is to grow them on site in a "mulch garden" - an area of the site dedicated entirely to the production of mulch which is then transferred to the growing area.&lt;ref name="Jacke" /&gt; Mulch gardens should be sited as close as possible to the growing area so as to facilitate transfer of mulch materials.&lt;ref name="Jacke" /&gt;

==Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants==
{{Main|Sheet mulching}}
Sufficient mulch over plants will destroy them, and may be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]], [[string trimmer|cutting]], [[mowing]], pulling, raking, or [[tillage|tilling]]. The higher the temperature that this "mulch" is [[composted]], the quicker the reduction of undesirable materials. "Undesirable materials" may include living seed, plant "[[Biodegradable waste|trash]]", as well as pathogens such as from animal [[feces]], urine (e.g. [[hantavirus]]), fleas, lice, ticks, etc.

In some ways this improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], and adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their feces are among the best [[fertilizer]]s and [[soil conditioner]]s.

Urine may be [[Phytotoxicity|toxic to plants]] if applied to growing areas undiluted. See [[Compost#Human_waste|Compost ingredients: Human Waste]].

==Polypropylene and polyethylene mulch==
Polypropylene mulch is made up of [[polypropylene]] polymers where [[polyethylene]] mulch is made up of polyethylene polymers. These mulches are commonly used in many plastics. Polyethylene is used mainly for weed reduction, where polypropylene is used mainly on [[perennials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dovorak|first1=P|title=BLACK POLYPROPYLENE MULCH TEXTILE IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE|journal=Czech University of Life Science Prague, Kamýcká|volume=52|url=http://orgprints.org/20582/1/článek_Rumunsko,_52_1_116-120.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mulch is placed on top of the soil and can be done by machine or hand with pegs to keep the mulch tight against the soil. This mulch can prevent [[soil erosion]], reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil.&lt;ref name=Shonbeck&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shonbeck|first1=Dr. Mark|title=Synthetic Mulching Materials for Weed Management|journal=Extension|date=12 September 2012|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/65191/synthetic-mulching-materials-for-weed-management#.VHdTd16eduZ|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately this can reduce the amount of work a farmer may have to do, and the amount of herbicides applied during the growing period. The black and clear mulches capture sunlight and warm the soil increasing the growth rate. White and other reflective colours will also warm the soil, but they do not suppress weeds as well.&lt;ref name=Shonbeck/&gt;  This mulch may require other sources of obtaining water such as drip irrigation since it can reduce the amount of water that reaches the soil.&lt;ref name=Shonbeck/&gt;  This mulch needs to be manually removed at the end of the season since when it starts to break down it breaks down into smaller pieces.&lt;ref name=Corbin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=A|title=Using Biodegradable Plastics as Agricultural Mulches.|date=2013|url=http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/FS103E/FS103E.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the mulch is not removed before it starts to break down eventually it will break down into ketones and aldehydes polluting the soil.&lt;ref name=Corbin/&gt;  This mulch is technically biodegradable but does not break down into the same materials the more natural biodegradable mulch does.

==Biodegradable mulch==
Quality biodegradable mulches are made out of plant starches and sugars or polyester fibers. These starches can come from plants such as wheat and corn.&lt;ref name=PennState&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodegradable Mulch Demonstrations|url=https://extension.psu.edu/biodegradable-mulch-demonstrations|website=Penn State Extension|accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mulch films may be a bit more permeable allowing more water into the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil.&lt;ref name=Shonbeck/&gt; Ultimately this can reduce the amount of herbicides used and manual labor farmers may have to do throughout the growing season. At the end of the season these mulches will start to break down from heat. Microorganisms in the soil break down the mulch into two components, water and CO2, leaving no toxic residues behind.&lt;ref name=PennState/&gt;  This source of mulch is even less manual labor since it does not need to be removed at the end of the season and can actually be tilled into the soil.&lt;ref name=PennState/&gt;  With this mulch it is important to take into consideration that it's much more delicate than other kinds. It should be placed on a day which is not too hot and with less tension than other synthetic mulches.&lt;ref name=PennState/&gt;  These also can be placed by machine or hand but it is ideal to have a more starchy mulch that will allow it to stick to the soil better.

'''Municipal associations''' ({{lang-de|Verwaltungsgemeinschaften}}) are [[statutory corporation]]s or [[Public body|public bodies]] created by [[statute]] in the German federal states of [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. In [[Baden-Württemberg]] the term ''stipulated municipal association'' ({{lang-de|vereinbarte Verwaltungsgemeinschaft}}) is used.

== Structure ==
A municipal association normally consists of several adjacent [[Municipality|municipalities]] located in the same [[Districts of Germany|district]]. It is controlled by a political representative, chairperson or executive board. Depending on the state, this person may be officially retained or appointed as [[mayor]]. 
* In Baden-Württemberg this position is held by the mayor of the appropriate [[fulfilling municipality]] ({{lang-de|erfüllende Gemeinde}}).
* In Thuringia there are municipal associations as well as fulfilling municipalities.
* In Bavaria one mayor of a single municipality also acts as municipal chairman ({{lang-de| Gemeinschaftsvorsitzender}}) of the association.

==Tasks==
The duties of a municipal association typically encompass
* Setting up land use plans
* Sewage disposal
* Payment transactions
* Cemetery matters
* Fire brigade provision

[[File:Ritsurin-Garden-M3566.jpg|thumb|300px|Niwaki trees at [[Ritsurin Garden]] in Japan]]

{{nihongo|'''Niwaki'''|庭木}} is the Japanese word for "garden trees". Niwaki is also a descriptive word for highly "sculpting trees".&lt;ref name=Gardens&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Helena |last1=Attlee |others=Photographs by Alex Ramsay |year=2010 |title=The Gardens of Japan |page=136 |location=London |publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited |isbn=978-0-7112-2971-6 |oclc=529674132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most varieties of [[plants]] used in [[Japanese garden]]s are called ''niwaki''. These [[trees]] help to create the structure of the garden. Japanese gardens are not about using large range of plants, rather the objective is creating [[atmosphere]] or [[wikt:ambiance|ambiance]].&lt;ref name=OxfordCompanion&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Patrick |editor1-last=Taylor |year=2006 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Garden |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866255-6 |oclc=63116899}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] of niwaki is more about what to do with a tree than the tree itself. While Western gardeners enjoy [[experimenting]] with a wide range of different plants, Japanese gardeners achieve variety through training and shaping a relatively limited set of plants.

Trees play a key role in the [[gardens]] and [[landscapes]] of Japan as well as being of important [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[cultural]] significance to its people. Fittingly, Japanese gardeners have fine-tuned a distinctive set of [[pruning]] techniques meant to coax out the essential characters of ''niwaki''. ''Niwaki'' are often cultivated to achieve some very striking effects: trees are made to look older than they really are with broad trunks and gnarled branches; trees are made to imitate wind-swept or lightning-struck trees in the wild; ''[[Cryptomeria|Cryptomeria japonica]]'' specimens are often pruned to resemble free-growing trees.

Some designers are using ''[[zoke]]'' (miscellaneous plants) as well as the ''niwaki'' to create a more "[[natural]]" mood to the landscape. Most [[traditional]] garden designers still rely primarily on the rarefied ''niwaki'' palette.&lt;ref name=OxfordCompanion/&gt; The principles of ''niwaki'' may be applied to garden trees all over the world and are not restricted to Japanese Gardens.&lt;ref name=Niwaki&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=Jake |year=2007 |title=Niwaki: Pruning, Training and Shaping Trees the Japanese Way |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Or. |isbn=978-0-88192-835-8 |oclc=73993094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant types==
The plants used most commonly in Japanese gardens today include:

{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* Japanese black pine (''[[Pinus thunbergii]]'')
* Japanese cedar (''[[Cryptomeria japonica]]'')
* Camellias including sasanqua (''[[Camellia sasanqua]]'')
* Many other flowering varieties (''Camellia japonica cvs'')
* Japanese evergreen oaks (''[[Quercus glauca]]'', ''[[Quercus myrsinifolia]]'')
* Gardenia (''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]'')
* Sweet osmanthus (''[[Osmanthus fragrans]]'')
* Japanese maple (''[[Acer palmatum]]'')
* Plum (''[[Prunus mume]]'' and others)
* Yoshino flowering cherry ([[Prunus × yedoensis|''Prunus × yedoensis'' 'Yedoensis']])
* Japanese aucuba (''[[Aucuba japonica]]'')
* Japanese andromeda (''[[Pieris japonica]]'')
* Winter daphne (''[[Daphne odora]]'')
* Japanese enkianthus (''Enkianthus perulatus'')
* Satsuki azalea (''Rhododendron indicum'')&lt;ref name=OxfordCompanion/&gt;

'''Petroleum Sarawak Berhad''' ('''PETROS''') is a [[state-owned]] [[Oil exploration|oil]] and [[gas exploration]] firm established and owned by the State Government of [[Sarawak]].

==Background==
Sarawak's and Sabah's oil and gas rights were lost to the Federal Government after the [[13 May Incident]]. When the Federal Government made a Proclamation of Emergency in response to the unrest, it unilaterally limited the territorial waters of the Borneo states to three nautical miles. The ownership of the remaining territorial waters were transferred to the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="Zainnal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sendou Ringgit|first1=Danielle|title=How the 13 May race riots affected Sabah and Sarawak|url=http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2016/01/08/how-the-13-may-race-riots-affected-sabah-and-sarawak/|accessdate=10 May 2016|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=8 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510112239/http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2016/01/08/how-the-13-may-race-riots-affected-sabah-and-sarawak/|archivedate=10 May 2016|quote=All of these safeguards over territory were suspended on May 13, 1969, ...

The conflict was sorted out as an internal family affair.

In June 2017, the [[List of Chief Ministers of Sarawak|Chief Minister of Sarawak]], [[Abang Johari Openg]], announced that Sarawak will establish a state-owned oil and gas exploration company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/node/291923|title=Sarawak tubuh syarikat minyak sendiri|date=2017-06-11|work=BH Online|access-date=2018-01-18|language=ms}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2017, Abang Johari announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/387409 |title= S'wak forming O&amp;G firm to do own exploration | work=MalaysiaKini |date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the petroleum company would be 100 percent owned by Sarawak and will work with Petronas on an equal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/cm-sarawak-oil-company-equal-with-petronas#61Tvq8FjKbFbYV3C.97 |title=CM: Sarawak oil company equal with Petronas |last=Tawie |first=Sulok |date=9 August 2017 |website=[[Malay Mail Online]] |publisher= |access-date= 30 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually formed in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/08/07/petros-officially-formed-says-sarawak-cm|title=Petros officially formed, says Sarawak CM|last=|first=|date=7 August 2017|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarawak government aimed to have Petros in operation by the first quarter of 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2017/09/05/sarawak-oil-play/|title=Sarawak to set up own oil company amid ongoing talks with Petronas - Business News {{!}} The Star Online|last=|first=|date=5 September 2017|website=The Star Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become an active player in the oil &amp; gas industry by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/01/15/petros-up-and-running-by-2020/|title=Petros up and running by 2020|last=|first=|date=2018-01-14|work=Borneo Post Online|access-date=2018-01-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarawak government then sent a legal team to the United Kingdom to search for additional supporting documents regarding the rights of Sarawak in the Malaysian agreement.

Sarawak was unwilling to resort to court action to nullify the Territorial Sea Act and Petronas dominance on Sarawak waters so as to preserve the good relationship between the federal and state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sharon |first1=Ling |title=Sarawak Assembly approves high-level task force to discuss issues under Malaysia Agreement |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/11/09/sarawak-assembly-approves-high-level-task-force-to-discuss-issues-under-malaysia-agreement/ |accessdate=7 June 2018 |publisher=The Sun Daily |date=9 November 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109143520/https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/11/09/sarawak-assembly-approves-high-level-task-force-to-discuss-issues-under-malaysia-agreement/ |archivedate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Abang Johari questioned the validity of the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. This was because the Act was passed during the Emergency Proclamation period from 1969 to 2011. The Emergency Proclamation was abolished in 2011. This raises questions that whether the Petroleum Development Act would cease to become effective after 2011. He also stated that the Petroleum Development Act does not exclude laws such as Sarawak Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 which stated that only Sarawak has the right to issue mining licenses for oil production.&lt;ref name="Kahirie 2018"/&gt; In April 2018, the chief minister also announced that under Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 and Gas Distribution Ordinance 2016, [[Petronas]] would need to apply mining license from Petros to operate in Sarawak waters by 1 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ogilvy|first1=Geryl|title=Abang Johari: Oil and gas companies must get relevant permits by July 1|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/19/abang-johari-oil-and-gas-companies-must-get-relevant-permits-by-july-1/|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=The Star (Malaysia)|date=19 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419102544/https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/19/abang-johari-oil-and-gas-companies-must-get-relevant-permits-by-july-1/|archivedate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abang Johari also claimed that under the Item 2(c) of the State List, Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution, Petros is able to exercise its rights on Sarawak waters. Petronas had welcomed Petros into the oil and gas mining scene as long as Petros acted within the framework of Malaysian Petroleum Development Act, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Churchill|first1=Edward|title=Petronas welcomes Petros|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/03/08/petronas-welcomes-petros/|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=8 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308034211/https://www.theborneopost.com/2018/03/08/petronas-welcomes-petros/|archivedate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opposition politicians in Sarawak casted doubts on whether Sarawak has truly regained its oil and gas rights without making any amendments to the existing laws in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Desmond |first1=Davidson |title=Not true that Sarawak has reclaimed oil and gas rights, says opposition |url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/41638/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |publisher=The Malaysian Insight |date=7 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605225959/https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/41638/ |archivedate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the opposition coalition, [[Pakatan Harapan]] offered a 20% oil royalty deal for Sarawak government if the former wins the federal power in [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 Malaysian general election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakatan offers ‘New Deal Agreement’ to state BN |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/10/pakatan-offers-new-deal-agreement-to-state-bn/ |accessdate=7 June 2018 |publisher=The Borneo Post |date=10 April 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180607031101/http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/10/pakatan-offers-new-deal-agreement-to-state-bn/ |archivedate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Sarawak refused to sign it because it has no legal standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PH Sarawak’s ‘New Deal Agreement’ no force of law — Abdullah |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/05/19/ph-sarawaks-new-deal-agreement-no-force-of-law-abdullah/ |accessdate=7 June 2018 |publisher=The Borneo Post |date=19 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521041914/http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/05/19/ph-sarawaks-new-deal-agreement-no-force-of-law-abdullah/ |archivedate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 Malaysian general election]], Malaysian federal government changed hands.

Then later he fixed it with the approval of Russian Tzar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Egbert Jahn]]|title=International Politics: Political Issues Under Debate -, Volume 1|publisher=Springer|year=2015|page=21|ISBN=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y77fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Ural+%22border+of+Europe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj5aiHjMbLAhXmApoKHTk0CuoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Ural%20%22border%20of%20Europe%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Strahlenberg was born in [[Stralsund]], which then belonged to Sweden, and his original name was Philip Johan Tabbert. He joined the Swedish army in 1694 and was promoted captain in 1703. In 1707, he was ennobled and took the name von Strahlenberg. 

Taking part in the [[Great Northern War]], he was captured by the victorious Russian forces during the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. As a [[prisoner of war]], he was sent to [[Tobolsk]], where he lived from 1711 to 1721. During this time, he studied the [[geography]] of [[Siberia]] and the [[anthropology]], languages and customs of its [[Northern indigenous peoples of Russia|native tribes]]. After returning to [[Stockholm]] in 1730, he published his book ''Das Nord- und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia'' (''North and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia'') with the results of his studies. The book was well received and soon translated into [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

As part of his book, Strahlenberg and [[Johan Anton von Matérn]] drew new maps of all of Russia - a formidable task in itself. He also suggested a new border between the [[continent]]s of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] in Russian territory. This border follows the peaks of the [[Ural mountains|Urals]], then branches off westwards along a minor mountain range, follows the hilly west bank of [[Volga river]] downstream to the 49th degree of latitude and [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]] thereon to the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasily Tatischev]] claimed that it was at his suggestion that Strahlenberg adopted the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europa-asia.ural.org/raspol.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313164032/http://www.europa-asia.ural.org/raspol.htm |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Boundaries between continents]] for the current political and geographical debates about the Europe-Asia border.

Strahlenberg's book also extensively deals with the languages and customs of the [[Tatars]], [[Yakuts]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Turkmen Tatars]] and [[Mongols]]. He also compiled and published a Kalmyk-German dictionary, subsequently issued with French and English translations. In writing about the shamanic rituals of the indigenous peoples of Siberia, he noted their use of the fly agaric [[mushroom]] (''[[Amanita muscaria]]'').

In his later years, Strahlenberg wrote an extensive two-volume treatise on the history of Russia, which was published in French translation as ''Description Historique de l'Empire Russien'' (''Historical Description of the Russian Empire'') in 1757.

The asteroid [[15766 Strahlenberg|(15766) Strahlenberg]] is named after him.

'''Pomology''' (from [[latin language|latin]] ''pomum'' ([[fruit]]) + ''-logy'') is a branch of [[botany]] that studies and cultivates [[fruit]]. The denomination '''fruticulture'''—introduced from [[Romance language]]s (from [[Latin]] ''fructus'' and ''cultura'')—is also used.

Pomological research is mainly focused on the development, enhancement, cultivation and physiological studies of fruit trees. The goals of fruit tree improvement include enhancement of fruit quality, regulation of production periods, and reduction of production cost. One involved in the science of pomology is called a '''pomologist'''.

==History==
Pomology has been an important area of research for centuries.

===United States===
During the mid-19th century in the [[United States]], farmers were expanding fruit orchard programs in response to growing markets. At the same time, horticulturists from the [[USDA]] and agricultural colleges were bringing new varieties to the United States from foreign expeditions, and developing experimental lots for these fruits. In response to this increased interest and activity, USDA established the Division of Pomology in 1886 and named Henry E. Van Deman as chief pomologist. An important focus of the division was to publish illustrated accounts of new varieties and to disseminate research findings to fruit growers and breeders through special publications and annual reports. During this period   [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and his brother [[Charles Downing (pomologist)|Charles]] were prominent in Pomology and [[Horticulture]], producing ''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxADAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8 |title=''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845) online |accessdate=|date=|publisher=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant breeders could accurately document and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th Century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced [[cultivar]]s. Many of the watercolors were used for [[Lithography|lithographic reproductions]] in USDA publications, such as the ''Report of the Pomologist'' and the ''Yearbook of Agriculture''.

Today, the collection of approximately 7,700 watercolors is preserved in the [[National Agricultural Library|National Agricultural Library's]] Special Collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide.shtml |title=Guide to the USDA Special Collections |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=  |publisher=[[National Agricultural Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it serves as a major historic and botanic resource to a variety of researchers, including [[horticulturists]], historians, artists, and publishers..

The study of pomology has somewhat dwindled over the past century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

From painting, attributed to either Gregório Lopes or Cornelis Antoniszoon, showing voyage of the marriage party of Portuguese [[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy|Infanta Beatriz]] to Savoy, 1521]]
The '''Portuguese India Armadas''' (''Armadas da Índia'') were the fleets of ships, organized by the crown of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and dispatched on an annual basis from [[Portugal]] to [[India]], principally [[Goa]]. These armadas undertook the '''''Carreira da Índia''''' ("India Run"), following the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] first opened up by [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1497–1499.

==The India run==
For a long time after its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was dominated by the Portuguese India armada – the annual fleet dispatched from Portugal to India. Between 1497 and 1650, there were 1033 departures of ships at [[Lisbon]] for the ''Carreira da Índia'' ("India Run").&lt;ref&gt;Guinote, P.J.A. (1999) "Ascensão e Declínio da Carreira da Índia", ''Vasco da Gama e a Índia, Lisboa: Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian'', 1999, vol. II, pp. 7–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing===
[[File:Gama route 1.svg|300px|thumb|The route of Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497–1499), what became the typical ''Carreira da Índia'']]
The India armada typically left [[Lisbon]] and each leg of the voyage took approximately six months.&lt;ref&gt;Godinho (1963: v. 3, pp. 44–45).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1509) strongly recommended February as the ideal departure month. Godinho (1963: v. 3, pp. 43–44) calculates that 87% of departures left in March or April, and the 13% outside that range were usually destined for elsewhere (Africa, Arabia).&lt;/ref&gt; The critical determinant of the timing was the [[monsoon]] winds of the [[Indian Ocean]]. The monsoon was a southwesterly wind (i.e. blew from East Africa to India) in the summer (between May and September) and then abruptly reversed itself and became a northeasterly (from India to Africa) in the winter (between October and April). The ideal timing was to pass the [[Cape of Good Hope]] around June–July and get to the [[East Africa]]n middle coast by August, just in time to catch the summer monsoon winds to India, arriving around early September. The return trip from India would typically begin in January, taking the winter monsoon back to Lisbon along a similar route, arriving by the summer (June–August). Overall, the round trip took a little over a year, minimizing the time at sea.

The critical step was ensuring the armada reached East Africa on time. Ships that failed to reach the [[equator]] latitude on the East African coast by late August would be stuck in Africa and have to wait until next Spring to undertake an Indian Ocean crossing. And then they would have to wait in India until the Winter to begin their return. So any delay in East Africa during those critical few weeks of August could end up adding an entire extra year to a ship's journey.&lt;ref group = "N"&gt;Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 44) calculates that around 11% of outgoing ships missed the monsoon and ended up having to winter in East Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumnavigation of [[Madagascar]] opened an alternative route to get to India, which gave more flexibility in timing. The rule that quickly emerged was that if an outbound armada doubled the Cape of Good Hope before mid-July, then it should follow the old "inner route" – that is, sail into the [[Mozambique Channel]], up the East African coast until the equator latitude (around [[Malindi]], [[Seychelles]]), then take the southwesterly monsoon across the ocean to India. If, however, the armada doubled the Cape after mid-July, then it was obliged to sail the "outer route" – that is, strike out straight east from South Africa, go under the southern tip of Madagascar, and then turn up from there, taking a northerly path through the [[Mascarenes]] islands, across the open ocean to India. While the outer route did not have the support of African staging posts and important watering stops, it sidestepped sailing directly against the post-summer monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew (1988: 233); Pimentel (1746: pp. 385–386)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Goa-Vasco 03-2016 02 Vaddem.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A brief view of the [[India]]n city of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]]]
Return fleets were a different story.  The principal worry of the return fleets was the fast dangerous waters of the inner Mozambican channel, which was particularly precarious for heavily loaded and less maneuverable ships.  In the initial decades, the return fleet usually set out from [[Cochin]] in December, although that was eventually pushed forward to January.  January 20 was the critical date, after which all return fleets were obliged to follow the outer route (east of Madagascar) which was deemed calmer and safer for their precious cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt;  That meant they missed the important watering stop on Mozambique island on the return leg and had to put in elsewhere later, such as [[Mossel Bay]] or [[St. Helena]].  Between 1525 and 1579, ''all'' return fleets were ordered to follow the outer route. This rule was temporarily suspended between the 1570s and 1590s. From 1615, a new rule was introduced whereby return fleets from [[Goa]] were allowed to use the inner route, but return fleets from Cochin still had to use the outer route.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew (1988: 233)&lt;/ref&gt;  With the entry of Dutch and English competition in the 1590s, the start of the return legs were delayed until February and March, with the predictable upsurge in lost and weather-delayed ships.&lt;ref name="Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46"&gt;Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrival times in Portugal varied, usually between mid-June and late August.  It was customary for return fleets to send their fastest ship ahead to announce the results in Lisbon, before the rest of the fleet arrived later that summer.&lt;ref name="Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46"/&gt;

Because of the timing, an armada had to leave Lisbon (February–April) before the previous year's armada returned (June–August). To get news of the latest developments in India, the outgoing armada relied on notes and reports left along the way at various African staging posts by the returning fleet.

===Outward voyage===

Portuguese India armadas tended to follow the same outward route.  There were several staging posts along the route of India Run that were repeatedly used.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;For old ''[[Rutter (nautical)|roteiro]]''s of the India Run, see [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] (1509), [[João de Lisboa]] (1519: pp. 69ff) and Manuel Pimentel (1746: pp. 381ff)&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting out from [[Lisbon]] (February–April), India-bound [[naus]] took the easy [[Canary Current]] straight southwest to the [[Canary Islands]]. The islands were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and so this was not a usual watering stop for the Portuguese India naus, except in emergencies.

The first real obstacle on the route was the [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] peninsula (Cap-Vert, [[Senegal]]), around which the Canary Current ends and the equatorial drift begins. Although not difficult to double, it was a concentration point of sudden storms and [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|tropical cyclones]], so ships were frequently damaged. (see [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]])

The [[Cape Verde islands]], to the west of Cape Verde peninsula was the usual first stop for India ships. Relative scarcity of water and supplies on the islands made this a suboptimal stop. Nonetheless, the islands (esp. [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]) served as a harbor against storms and was frequently a pre-arranged point for the collection and repair of tempest-tossed ships.

The ''Angra de Bezeguiche'' (Bay of [[Dakar]], Senegal) was a common watering stop for ships after doubling Cape Verde. The shores were controlled by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people|Serer]] kingdoms, whose relations with the Portuguese were ambivalent, so a warm reception on the mainland could not always be counted on. In the middle of the bay was the island of [[Gorée]] (''ilha de Bezeguiche''), a safe anchoring spot, but the island itself lacked drinkable water. As a result, ships frequently watered and repaired at certain mainland points along the [[Petite Côte]] of Senegal shore such as ''Rio Fresco'' (now [[Rufisque]]) and ''Porto de Ale'' (now  [[Saly|Saly-Portudal]]). It was not unheard of for India naus to water much further south, e.g. among the many inlets and islands (e.g. [[Bissagos Islands|Bissagos]]) along the African coast to ''Serra Leoa'' ([[Sierra Leone]]).

Below Cape Verde, around the latitudes of Sierra Leone, begin the Atlantic [[doldrums]] – that is a calm low pressure region on either side of the equator with little or no winds.  At this time of year, the doldrums belt usually ranged between 5° N and 5° S. &lt;ref group="N"&gt;The exact latitude where the doldrums lay varies because of the "Atlantic mini-monsoon" phenomenon, i.e. during the summer months, the heating of West African mainland pulls winds up from the equator, thereby shunting the doldrums belt further north.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the southern hemisphere, below the doldrums, was the counter-clockwise [[Ocean gyre|gyre]] of the [[South Atlantic Gyre|South Atlantic]] and the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, which prevented sailing directly southeast to the Cape.

Passing the doldrums was a navigational challenge, and pilots had to avail themselves deftly of the currents and every little breeze they could get to stay on course. The usual tactic was to proceed south or even southeast along the West African coast as long as possible, until the doldrums hit (usually around Sierra Leone), then to strike southwest sharply, drift over the doldrums and then catch the [[South Equatorial Current]] (top arm of the South Atlantic gyre) towards the coast of [[Brazil]]. This was usually referred to as following the ''[[volta do mar]]'' (literally, 'turn of the sea', i.e. the South Atlantic gyre).

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|450px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the Portuguese India run (''Carreira da Índia'')]]
[The ''volta do mar'' was usually contrasted to the ''rota da Mina'' (Mina route). The latter meant striking ''southeast'' in the doldrums to catch the  [[Equatorial Counter Current]] (or 'Guinea Current') east into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. This was the usual route to the fort of [[Elmina|São Jorge da Mina]] on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]]. This was ''not'' part of the India run.  The route from Mina down to South Africa involved [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] ''against'' the southeasterly trade winds and the contrary [[Benguela Current]], a particularly tiresome task for heavy [[square rig]]ged [[carrack]]s. However, it sometimes happened that by poor piloting, India naus would be inadvertently caught by the Guinea counter-current and forced to take that route, but such ships would not be likely to reach India that year.]&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The ''rota da Mina'' had been the usual route used by all Portuguese explorers to Africa until the end of the 15th century. The first fleet to sail the ''volta do mar'' was [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first fleet in 1497. However, credit for the discovery of the 'volta do mar' as a route to the Cape ought to be given to [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who in 1488–89, first discovered the [[westerlies]] below the 30°S and the [[South Atlantic Current]], from which was deduced the probable existence of the quicker and easier ''volta do mar'' route to the Cape. See Coutinho (1951–5: 319–63) and Waters (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the India armada successfully caught the south equatorial current of the ''volta do mar'', the armada would drift southwest through the doldrums and reach the southbound [[Brazil Current]] off the coast of Brazil (around [[Pernambuco]]). Although India naus did not usually stop in Brazil, it was not unheard of to put in a brief watering stop at [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape Santo Agostinho]] (Pernambuco, Brazil), especially if the southeasterly trade winds were particularly strong (pilots had to be careful not to allow themselves to be caught and driven backwards).

From the environs of Pernambuco, the India [[naus]] sailed straight south along the Brazil Current, until about the latitude of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], visibly the [[Abrolhos Archipelago|Abrolhos]] islands or the [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]] islands, where they began to catch more favorable prevailing [[westerlies]]. These would take them quickly straight east, across the South Atlantic, to South Africa.

The [[Cape of Good Hope]] – once aptly named the 'cape of storms' – was a very challenging headland on the India Run. The outbound crossing was always difficult, and many a ship was lost here. Larger armadas often broke up into smaller squadrons to attempt the crossing, and would re-collect only on the other side – indeed quite far on the other side. There was usually no stop or collection point after the Cape crossing until well inside the [[Mozambique Channel]]. The reason for this is that outbound ships tried to steer clear from the South African coast, to avoid the rushing waters of the contrary [[Agulhas Current]].

The exception was the ''Agoada de São Brás'' ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), a watering stop after the Cape. It was not always used on the outbound journey since individual ships often charted wide routes around the Cape, and sighted coast again only well after this point. However, ships damaged during the crossing frequently had no choice but to put in there for emergency repairs. Trade for food supplies with the pastoral [[Khoikhoi]] peoples that lived in the area was frequent (although there were also occasional skirmishes). São Brás was a more frequent stop on the return journey, as a place to repair the ships to tip-top shape before doubling the Cape the other way. As a result, particularly in early years, São Brás was used as a postal station, where messages from the returning armadas would be left for the outward armadas, reporting on the latest conditions in India.

[[File:Bonne - Afrique, cote orientale.jpg|thumb|300px| French map of [[Mozambique Channel]], c. 1791]]

If the armada went by the 'inner route', then the next daunting obstacle was [[Cape Correntes]], at the entrance of the Mozambique Channel. Treacherously fast waters, light winds alternating with unpredictably violent gusts, and treacherous shoals and rocks made this cape particularly dangerous. It is estimated that nearly 30% of all ships lost on the India Run, capsized or ran aground around here, more than any other place.&lt;ref&gt;Guinote (1999). The dangers of the 'inner route' through the Mozambique channel are summarized in many old sailing rutters, e.g. Pimentel (1746: pp. 386ff), Hornsborough (1852, p. 211), Findlay (1866: 115).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal passage through the Mozambique Channel would be to sail straight north through the middle of the channel, where a steady favorable wind could be relied upon at this season. But this was a particularly hard task in an era where [[longitude]] was determined largely by [[dead reckoning]]. If a pilot miscalculated and charted a course too close to the African coast, the current ran south, the winds were light or non-existent, subject to arbitrary gusts from strange directions and the coasts littered with [[shoals]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Indeed, another reason ships steered clear away from the South African coast after crossing the Cape of Good Hope was precisely that the contrary [[Agulhas current]] threw off the dead reckoning calculations, and often misled pilots into turning too soon into the Mozambique channel, forcing them on a dangerous too-western route up the channel.&lt;/ref&gt;  Into this dreaded mix, Cape Correntes added its own special terror to the experience. The Cape was not only a confluence point of opposing winds, creating unpredictable whirlwinds, it also produced a strange and extraordinarily fast southerly current, violent enough to break a badly-sewn ship, and confusing enough to throw all reckoning out the window and lure pilots into grievous errors.

The temptation would be to err in the opposite direction, and keep on pushing east until the island of [[Madagascar]] was sighted, then move up the channel (the current here ran north), keeping the Madagascar coast in sight at all times. Although a Madagascar-hugging route cleared up the longitude problem, it was also abundant in fearful obstacles – coral islets, atolls, shoals, protruding rocks, submerged reefs, made for a particularly nerve-wracking experience to navigate, especially at night or in bad weather.

To avoid the worst consequences of doubling Cape Correntes, India ships stayed as far from the African coast as possible but not so close to Madagascar to run into its traps. To find the ideal middle route through the channel, pilots tended to rely on two dangerous longitude markers – the [[Bassas da India]] and the [[Europa Island|Europa rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel (1746: 385–386)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although conveniently situated in the middle of the channel, they were not always visible above the waves, so sailors often watched for hovering clusters of [[seabird]]s, which colonized these rocks, as an indicator of their location.  Unfortunately, this was not a reliable method, and many an India ship ended up crashing on those rocks.

If they succeeded sailing up the middle channel, the India naus usually saw African coast again only around the bend of [[Angoche]]. If the ships were in a bad shape, they could stop at the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (off Angoche) for urgent repairs. The Primeiras are a long row of uninhabited low coral islets – not much more than mounds above the waves – but they form a channel of calm waters between themselves and the mainland, a useful shelter for troubled ships.

[[File:Ilha de Moçambique.jpg|thumb|250px| left|[[Mozambique Island]], with [[Fort São Sebastião]] in background]]
The scheduled stop was a little further north on [[Mozambique Island]], a coral island off the coast, with two outlying smaller islands (''São Jorge'' and ''Sant' Iago''). Mozambique's main attribute was its splendid harbor, that served as the usual first stop and collection point of Portuguese India armadas after the crossing of the Cape of Good Hope. The island had a town and a fortress, so some stock of supplies was usually at hand.

The conditions of the ships by the time they reached Mozambique was often quite woeful. Notice that with the occasional exception of Cape Santo Agostinho and Mossel Bay, there are no stops between Cape Verde and Mozambique Island, an extraordinarily long time for 16th-century ships to remain at sea without repairs, watering or resupply. Already before the Cape, provisions had grown stale, [[scurvy]] and [[dysentery]] had often set in, and deaths of crews and passengers from disease had begun. The ship itself, so long at sea without [[Caulking#Wooden shipbuilding|re-caulking]] or re-painting, was in a fragile state. To then force the miserable ship through the mast-cracking tempests of Cape of Good Hope, the seam-ripping violent waters of Cape Correntes and the treacherous rocks of the channel, turned this final stage into a veritable hell for all aboard.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie and Winius (p. 201)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozambique Island was originally an outpost of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a collection of Muslim [[Swahili people|Swahili]] cities along the East African coast, centered at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], that formed a Medieval commercial empire from Cape Correntes in the south to the Somali borderlands in the north, what is sometimes called the "[[Swahili Coast]]". The Kilwa Sultanate began disintegrating into independent city-states around the time of the Portuguese arrival (1500), a process speeded along by the intrigues and interventions of Portuguese captains.

The original object of Portuguese attentions had been the southerly Swahili city of [[Sofala]], the main outlet of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade, and the first Portuguese fortress in East Africa was erected there in 1505 ([[Fort São Caetano]] de Sofala). But Sofala's harbor was marred by a long moving sandbank and hazardous shoals, making it quite unsuitable as a stop for the India armadas. So in 1507, the 9th Portuguese India Armada (Mello, 1507) seized Mozambique Island and erected a fortress there (Fort São Gabriel, later replaced by [[Fort São Sebastião]] in 1558), simply because its spacious and well-sheltered harbor was so much more preferable.

[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|300px| Principal cities of the [[Swahili Coast]] of East Africa, c. 1500.]]
The principal drawback was that Mozambique Island was parched and infertile. It produced practically nothing locally, it even had to ferry drinkable water by boat from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Theal (1902, p. 118)&lt;/ref&gt;  Replenishing the islands was not a simple matter. Although Mozambique islanders had established watering holes, gardens and coconut palm groves (essential for timber) just across on the mainland (at ''Cabaceira'' inlet), the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] inhabitants of the area were generally hostile to both the Swahili and the Portuguese, and often prevented the collection of supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Theal (1902, p. 118). The hostility of the Bantus of Cabaceira may be related to old slave-raiding in the area.&lt;/ref&gt;   So ensuring Mozambique had sufficient supplies presented its own challenges. The Portuguese [[Factor (agent)|factor]]s in Mozambique had to ensure enough supplies were shipped in from other points on the East African coast to Mozambique Island before the armada's scheduled arrival. The Mozambican factor also collected East African trade goods that could be picked up by the armadas and sold profitably in Indian markets – notably [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[copper]], [[pearl]]s and [[coral]].

After Mozambique, the rule for the India armadas was generally to continue sailing north until they reached the [[equator]] latitude (the [[Seychelles]] islands, at 4ºS, were a common reference point). It was around here that the all-important southwesterly [[monsoon]] winds began to pick up. The armada would then just sail east, and let the monsoon carry them headlong across the Indian Ocean until India. That is presuming the armada arrived at the equator sometime in August.

In Pimentel's (1746) estimation, ships ''must'' leave Mozambique before August 25 to avail themselves of the summer monsoon. If, however, the armada arrived in the latter part of the season, say September, turning at the equator was a risky route. The southwesterly monsoon may be blowing in the right direction at the moment, but the ship ran the risk of not reaching a safe Indian port before the monsoon reversed direction (usually around late September to early October, when it became a northeasterly). So a late season ship was usually stuck in Africa until next April.

Notice that the trajectory, as described, skips over nearly all the towns on the East African coast north of Mozambique – [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Quíloa''), [[Zanzibar]], [[Mombasa]] (''Mombaça''), [[Malindi]] (''Melinde''), [[Barawa]] (''Brava''), [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), etc. This is not to say Portuguese did not visit those locations – indeed, some even had Portuguese factories and forts (e.g. Fort Santiago in Kilwa, held from 1505 to 1512). But Portuguese armadas on their way to India did not have to stop at those locations, and so usually did not. The stop on Mozambique island was usually the only necessary one.

[[File:Pillar of Vasco da Gama.jpg|thumb|250px| left| Pillar of [[Vasco da Gama]], at [[Malindi]]]]
Nonetheless, if it had time, or got into trouble for some reason, the stopping choice was [[Malindi]]. A Portuguese ally from the earliest trip of Vasco da Gama in 1498, Malindi could usually be counted on to give a warm reception and had plenty of supplies. Unlike most other Swahili towns, Malindi was on the mainland and had an ample hinterlands with fertile cultivated fields, including groves of oranges and lemons (critical to [[Ascorbic acid|combat scurvy]]). The problem was that Malindi didn't really have a suitable harbor. Although waters were kept calm by an offshore reef, the anchorage area was littered with shoals. It did, however, have a peculiar protruding rock that served as a decent natural [[pier]] for loading and unloading goods.&lt;ref&gt;Theal (1902, p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

Malindi's other advantage was that, at 3º15'S, it was practically at exactly the right latitude to catch the southwesterly monsoon for an Indian Ocean crossing. Plenty of experienced Indian Ocean pilots – Swahili, Arab or Gujurati – could be found in the city, and Malindi was likely to have the latest news from across the sea.  So it was a very convenient stop for the Portuguese before a crossing.  However, stops take time. Given the imminent monsoon reversal, that was a scarce commodity. So if the armada had been decently equipped enough at Mozambique island, a stop at Malindi, however delightful or useful, was a rather unnecessary and risky expenditure of time.

With the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually arrived in India in early September (sometimes late August).  Because of the wind pattern, they usually made landfall around [[Anjediva]] island (''Angediva'').  From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] coast of India to the city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in [[Kerala]].  Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades.  However, this changed after the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]] in 1510.  The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas.  Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal.  The island was generally undersupplied – it contained only a few fishing villages – but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or to await for better winds to carry them down to Cochin.  Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it.  The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur.  As a result, the Portuguese governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] decided the nearby island-city of [[Goa]] was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510.  Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first anchorage point of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India.  Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center.  The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.

===Return voyage===
The return voyage was shorter than the outbound. The fleet left India in December, picking up the [[Monsoon#Northeast_monsoon|northeast monsoon]] towards the African coast. Passing through the Mozambique Channel, the fleet kept close to land to avoid the westerlies and catch the [[Agulhas Current]] to round the Cape of Good Hope. Once in the Atlantic, it caught the southeast trade winds and sailed to the west of [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[Saint Helena]] as far as the doldrums. The fleet then sailed almost straight north to the [[Azores]], where it caught the prevailing westerlies and sailed due west into Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Marchant, "Colonial Brazil as a Way Station for the Portuguese India Fleets", ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 31, No. 3 (1941), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logistics of the Armadas==

===Organization===
[[Image:Departure of fleet from Lisbon harbor.jpg|thumb|right|350px| Departure of fleet for the Indies from Lisbon harbor, by [[Theodor de Bry]], 1592]]
The size of the armada varied, from enormous fleets of twenty-something ships, to small fleets of only four or five.   This changed over time. In the first decade (1500–1510), when the Portuguese were establishing themselves in India, the armadas averaged around 15 ships per year. This declined to around 9–10 ships in 1510–1525. From 1526 to the 1540s, the armadas declined further to 7–8 ships per year, with a few exceptional cases of large armadas (e.g. 1533, 1537, 1547) brought about by military exigency, but also several years of exceptionally small fleets. In the second half of the 16th century, the Portuguese India armada stabilized at 5–6 ships annually, with very few exceptions (rose above seven only in 1551 e 1590 and below 4 only in 1594 and 1597).&lt;ref name="Guinote 1999"&gt;Guinote (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Organization was principally in the hands of the ''[[Casa da Índia]]'', the royal trading house established around 1500 by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. The Casa was in charge of monitoring the crown monopoly on India trade – receiving goods, collecting [[Tariff#Customs duty|duties]], assembling, maintaining and scheduling the fleets, contracting private merchants, correspondence with the ''feitorias'' (overseas [[Factory (trading post)|factories]]), drafting documents and handling legal matters.

Separately from the ''Casa'', but working in coordination with it, was the ''Armazém das Índias'', the royal agency in charge of nautical outfitting, that oversaw the Lisbon docks and naval arsenal. The Armazém was responsible for the training of pilots and sailors, ship construction and repair, and the procurement and provision of naval equipment – sails, ropes, guns, instruments and, most importantly, maps. The ''piloto-mor'' ('chief pilot') of the Armazém, in charge of pilot-training, was, up until 1548, also the keeper of the ''[[Padrão Real]]'', the secret royal master map, incorporating all the cartographic details reported by Portuguese captains and explorers, and upon which all official nautical charts were based. The screening and hiring of crews was the function of the ''provedor'' of the Armazém.

[[File:City of Lisbon, 1572.jpg|left|thumb|Ribeira Palace in the foreground of this view of the city of [[Lisbon]], Portugal from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]
From at least 1511 (perhaps earlier), the offices of the Casa da India were based in the ground floor of the royal [[Ribeira Palace]], by the [[Praça do Comércio|Terreiro do Paço]] in Lisbon, with the Armazém nearby. (Neither the Casa nor the Armazem should be confused with the ''[[Estado da Índia]]'', the Portuguese colonial government in India, which was separate and reported directly to the monarch.)

Ships could be and sometimes were owned and outfitted by private merchants, and these were incorporated into the India armada. However, the expenses of outfitting a ship were immense, and few native Portuguese merchants had the wherewithal to finance one, despite eager government encouragement. In the early India runs, there are several ships organized by private consortiums, often with foreign capital provided by wealthy Italian and German trading houses. This fluctuated over time, as the royal duties, costs of outfitting and rate of attrition and risk of loss on India runs were sometimes too high for private houses to bear. Private Portuguese merchants did, however, routinely contract for cargo, carried aboard crown ships for freight charges.

[[Marine insurance]] was still underdeveloped, although the Portuguese had helped pioneer its development and its practice seemed already customary.&lt;ref&gt;De Souza (1977), Diffie &amp; Winius (1977: pp. 38, 101.)&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref group="N"&gt;In May, 1293, King [[Denis of Portugal]] had established the ''Sociedade de Mercadores Portugueses'' (Society of Portuguese Merchants), with mutual help clauses that formed the kernel of marine insurance contracts, similar to those in practice in Italian ports such as [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]]. In 1380 [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] established a shipping company (''[[Companhia das Naus]]''), with a compulsory insurance scheme, whereby member-merchants (essentially all shipowners and merchants outfitting ships above 50t) to contribute a fixed rate of 2% of freight revenue as a premium to a central fund (''Bolsa de Seguros''), from which claim payouts would be redistributed. Around 1488, [[Pedro de Santarém]] (''Petrus Santerna''), a Portuguese consul in Italy, wrote perhaps the first treatise, ''De assecurationibus'' (published 1552–53), outlining the theory and principles behind marine insurance. Around 1578, [[Henry, King of Portugal|Cardinal-King Henry]] established the ''Consulado'', a tribunal explicitly dedicated to decide marine insurance cases (initially suppressed by the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, the tribunal was resurrected by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1593, with the modification that a private marine insurance contract had to have the signature of a royal official (''comissário de seguros''), to be valid in the law courts). This formed the framework for marine insurance in which the India Armadas operated.  Later developments include the establishment of an insurance house (''Casa de Seguros'')  as an organ of the ''Junta do Comércio Geral'' (Board of General Trade) by regent-prince [[Peter II of Portugal]] in 1668, subsequently replaced by the ''Mesa do Bem Comum do Comércio (''Board of Common Trade Welfare) in 1720. Around 1750, the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis de Pombal]] persuaded the monarch to fold the older house into a new entity, the ''Real Junta do Comércio'' (Royal Board of Trade). (DeSouza, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ships===

[[File:Armada portugaise.jpg|thumb|250px|Carracks of the India Armada of 1507, from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]
The ships of an India armada were typically [[carracks]] (''naus''), with sizes that grew over time. The first carracks were modest ships, rarely exceeding 100-tonnes, carrying only up to 40–60 men, e.g. the [[São Gabriel (ship)|''São Gabriel'']] of [[Vasco da Gama|Gama's]] 1497 fleet, one of the largest of the time, was only 120t. But this was quickly increased as the India run got underway. In the 1500 [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]] armada, the largest carracks, Cabral's flagship and the ''El-Rei'', are reported to have been somewhere between 240t and 300t. The ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', built in 1502, was a 400t nau, while at least one of the naus of the [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] armada of 1503 is reported to have been as large as 600t. The rapid doubling and tripling of the size of Portuguese carracks in a few years reflected the needs of the India runs. The rate of increase tapered off thereafter. For much of the remainder of the 16th century, the average carrack on the India run was probably around 400t.

In the 1550s, during the reign of [[John III of Portugal|John III]], a few 900t behemoths were built for India runs, in the hope that larger ships would provide [[economies of scale]]. The experiment turned out poorly. Not only was the cost of outfitting such a large ship disproportionately high, they proved unmaneouverable and unseaworthy, particularly in the treacherous waters of the [[Mozambique Channel]]. Three of the new behemoths were quickly lost on the southern African coast – the ''São João'' (900t, built 1550, wrecked 1552), the ''São Bento'' (900t, built 1551, wrecked 1554) and the largest of them all, the ''Nossa Senhora da Graça'' (1,000t, built 1556, wrecked 1559).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew (1988: pp. 266–268); Castro (2005: p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Relação da muy notavel perda do Galeão Grande S. João.jpg|thumb|left|180px| Wreck of the ''São João'', a large 900t India carrack (or great galleon), off the coast of South Africa, 1552.]]These kind of losses prompted King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] to issue an ordinance in 1570 setting the upper limit to the size of India naus at 450t.&lt;ref&gt;Castro (2005: p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, after the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, this regulation would be ignored and shipbuilders, probably urged on by merchants hoping to turn around more cargo on every trip, pushed for larger ships. The size of India naus accelerated again, averaging 600t in the 1580–1600 period, with several spectacularly large naus of 1500t or greater making their appearance in the 1590s.

If the lesson was not quite learned then, it was certainly learned in August, 1592, when English [[privateer]] [[Sir John Burroughs]] (alt. Burrows, Burgh) captured the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'' in the waters around the [[Azores]] islands. The ''Madre de Deus'', built in 1589, was a 1600t carrack, with seven decks and a crew of around 600. It was the largest Portuguese ship to go on an India run. The great carrack, under the command of Fernão de Mendonça Furtado, was returning from [[Cochin]] with a full cargo when it was captured by Burrough. The value of the treasure and cargo taken on this single ship is estimated to have been equivalent to half the entire treasury of the English crown. The loss of so much cargo in one swoop confirmed, once again, the folly of building such gigantic ships.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, ibid; Kingsford (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; The carracks built for the India run returned to their smaller ideal size after the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Caravela Vera Cruz a entrar no Porto de Pipas, festas São Joaninas, 2008, Angra do Heroísmo, ilha Terceira, Açores.JPG|thumb|right|150px| Modern replica of a lateen-rigged [[caravel]]]]
In the early ''Carreira da India'', the carracks were usually accompanied by smaller [[caravels]] (''caravelas''), averaging 50t–70t (rarely reaching 100t), and capable of holding 20–30 men at most. Whether [[Lateen|lateen-rigged]] (''{{lang|pt|latina}}'') or [[square rig|square-rigged]] (''[[Square Rigged Caravel|redonda]]''), these shallow-drafted, nimble vessels had a myriad of uses. Caravels served as forward lamp, scouts and fighting ships of the convoy. Caravels on the India run were often destined to remain overseas for coastal patrol duty, rather than return with the main fleet.

In the course of the 16th century, caravels were gradually phased out in favor of a new escort/fighting ship, the [[galleon]] (''galeão''), which could range anywhere between 100t and 1000t. Based on the design of the [[carrack]], but slenderer and lower, with forecastle diminished or removed to make way for its famous 'beak', the galleon became the principal fighting ship of the India fleet. It was not as nimble as the caravel, but could be mounted with much more cannon, thus packing a bigger punch. With the introduction of the galleon, carracks became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why they were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the ''[[Botafogo (galleon)|São João Baptista]]'' (nicknamed ''Botafogo'', 'spitfire'), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns.

Many fleets also brought small supply ships on outward voyage. These were destined to be scuttled along the way once the supplies were consumed. The crews were redistributed and the abandoned ships usually burned to recover their iron nails and fittings.

Average speed of an India Armada was around 2.5 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], but some ships could achieve speeds of between 8 and 10 for some stretches.

===Seaworthiness===

Portuguese India ships distinguished themselves from the ships of other navies (especially those of rival powers in the Indian Ocean) on two principal accounts: their seaworthiness (durability at sea) and their artillery.

With a few exceptions (e.g. ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]''), Portuguese India naus were not typically built to last longer than four or five years of useful service.   That a nau managed to survive a single India run was already an achievement, given that few ships of any nation at the time were able to stay at sea for even a quarter as long without breaking apart at the seams.

The success of the India nau depended on 15th-century innovations in Portuguese shipbuilding that greatly improved the seaworthiness and longevity of the ship. Notable among these were the use of iron nails (rather than wooden pegs) to hold planks, the mixing of [[lead]] in the seams, and a [[caulking]] technique that improved upon traditional [[oakum]] with 'galagala' paste (a mixture of oakum, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[olive oil]], producing a kind of putty that could be pressed between the planks). Hulls were amply coated in [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and pine [[tar]] (imported in bulk amounts from northern Germany), giving the India naus their famous (and, to some observers, sinister) dark tone.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Black Ships]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artillery===
[[File:Falconete Museu Marinha Lisboa.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese breech-loading ''falconete'', reign of King Sebastian]]
[[Naval artillery#Transition|Naval artillery]] was the single greatest advantage the Portuguese held over their rivals in the Indian Ocean – indeed over most other navies – and the Portuguese crown spared no expense in procuring and producing the best naval guns European technology permitted.

King [[John II of Portugal]], while still a prince in 1474, is often credited for pioneering the introduction of a reinforced deck on the old Henry-era [[caravel]] to allow the mounting of heavy guns.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 193)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1489, he introduced the first standardized teams of trained naval gunners (''bombardeiros'') on every ship, and development of naval tactics that maximized broadside cannonades rather than the rush-and-grapple of Medieval [[galleys]].

The Portuguese crown appropriated the best cannon technology available in Europe, particularly the new, more durable and far more accurate [[bronze]] cannon developed in Central Europe, replacing the older, less accurate [[wrought-iron]] cannon. By 1500, Portugal was importing vast volumes of [[copper]] and cannon from northern Europe, and had established itself as the leading producer of advanced naval artillery in its own right. Being a crown industry, cost considerations did not curb the pursuit of the best quality, best innovations and best training.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263) emphasize its importance as a crown industry – the coincidence between the producer and consumer of the product. Portuguese naval artillery was rarely faulty or exploded from misuse, not only because of crown self-interest in quality during production, but also because defective domestic pieces (unlike imported ones) were easy to fix or replace locally.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown paid wage premiums and bonuses to lure the best European artisans and gunners (mostly German) to advance the industry in Portugal. Every cutting-edge innovation introduced elsewhere was immediately appropriated into Portuguese naval artillery – that includes bronze cannon (Flemish/German), breech-loading swivel-guns (prob. German origin), truck carriages (possibly English), and the idea (originally French, c. 1501&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;) of cutting square [[gun port]]s (''portinhola'') in the hull to allow heavy cannon to be mounted below deck.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: pp. 260–264)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, the Portuguese spearheaded the evolution of modern naval warfare, moving away from the Medieval warship, a carrier of armed men, aiming for the grapple, towards the modern idea of a floating artillery piece dedicated to resolving battles by gunnery alone.

According to Gaspar Correia, the typical fighting caravel of Gama's [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]] (1502) carried 30 men, four heavy guns below, six [[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]] (''falconete'') above (two fixed astern) and ten [[Swivel gun|swivel-guns]] (''canhão de berço'') on the quarter-deck and bow.

An armed carrack, by contrast, had six heavy guns below, eight falconets above and several swivel-guns, and two fixed forward-firing guns before the mast.&lt;ref&gt;Correa, in Stanley, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;  Although an armed carrack carried more firepower than a caravel, it was much less swift and less manoeuvrable, especially when loaded with cargo. A carrack's guns were primarily defensive, or for shore bombardments, whenever their heavier firepower was necessary. But by and large, fighting at sea was usually left to the armed caravels. The development of the heavy galleon removed even the necessity of bringing carrack firepower to bear in most circumstances.

===Losses===
[[File:Nau de Rui Vaz Pereira levantada por um monstro marino, armada de 1520. Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu.jpg|thumb|right|Sea-monster depicted in the ''Livro de Lisarte de Abreu'']]

According to historian Oliveira Martins, of the 806 naus sent on the India Run between 1497 and 1612, 425 returned safely to Portugal, 20 returned prematurely (i.e. without reaching India), 66 were lost, 4 were captured by the enemy, 6 were scuttled and burnt, and 285 remained in India (which went on to meet various fates of their own in the East.)

The loss rate was higher in certain periods than others, reflecting greater or lesser attention and standards of shipbuilding, organization, supervision, training, etc. which reveals itself in shoddily-built ships, overloaded cargo, incompetent officers, as well as the expected higher dangers of wartime. The rates fluctuated dramatically. By one estimate, in 1571–1575, 90% of India ships returned safely; by 1586–1590, the success rate fell to less than 40%; between 1596 and 1605, the rate climbed above 50% again, but in the subsequent years fell back to around 20%.&lt;ref name="Guinote 1999"/&gt;

That only four ships on India runs were known to be captured by the enemy seems quite astonishing. These were:

*(1) 1508, the ship of Jó Queimado, originally part of the 8th Portuguese India Armada (Cunha, 1506) of [[Tristão da Cunha]] that set out in 1506. It was captured in 1508 by the French corsair Mondragon (said by one account to be in the [[Mozambique Channel]], but it is unlikely Mondragon would have taken the trouble of doubling the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]]; it was more likely captured on the Atlantic side, probably near the [[Azores]]). Mondragon was himself tracked down and taken prisoner by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in January, 1509, off [[Cape Finisterre]].
*(2) 1525, ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]'', the great carrack built in [[Goa]] in 1512. It had been used to carry [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1523 to serve as the new [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy of India]], and was on its way back to Portugal in 1525, with the former governor D. [[Duarte de Menezes]], when it was taken by French corsairs. (However, some have speculated that there was no foreign attack, that Menezes himself simply decided to go [[pirate|piratical]] and took command of the ship.)
*(3) 1587, ''São Filipe'', returning from an India run, was captured by English privateer Sir [[Francis Drake]], off [[the Azores]]. The triumph of the ''São Filipe'' cargo, one of the wealthiest hoards ever captured, was overshadowed only by the even wealthier trove of paperwork and maps detailing the Portuguese trade in Asia which fell into English hands. This set in motion the first English expedition to India, under Sir [[James Lancaster]] in 1591.
*(4) 1592 ''Madre de Deus'', the gigantic carrack captured by [[Sir John Burroughs]] near the Azores, already described above.

This does not count, of course, ships that were attacked by enemy action and subsequently capsized or destroyed. It also does not count ships that were captured later in the East Indies (i.e. not on the India route at the time). The most famous of these was probably the mighty Portuguese carrack [[Santa Catarina (ship)|''Santa Catarina'']] (not to be confused with its earlier ''Mount Sinai'' namesake), captured in 1603, by Dutch captain [[Jacob van Heemskerk]]. The ''Santa Catarina'' was on a [[Portuguese Macau]] to [[Portuguese Malacca]] run with a substantial cargo of Sino-Japanese wares, most notably a small fortune in [[musk]], when it was captured by Heemskerk in [[Singapore]]. The captured cargo nearly doubled the capital of the fledgling [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]].

Ships losses should not be confused with crew losses from disease, deprivation, accident, combat and desertion. These tended to be horrifically high – one third, or even as much as one half, even in good years.

===Crews===
[[File:Portuguese Discoveries and Empire Flag.svg|thumb|right| The banner of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] became a popular, and de-facto, naval and war ensign amongst captains below the rank of Viceroy (who flew the royal banner), since many notable Portuguese captains belonged to that order.]]
The admiral of an armada, necessarily a nobleman of some degree, was known as the ''capitão-mor'' (captain-major), with full jurisdiction over the fleet. There was also usually a designated ''soto-capitão'' (vice-admiral), with a commission to assume command should tragedy befall the captain-major. The vice-admirals were also useful if a particular armada needed to be split into separate squadrons. If an armada carried a [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy or governor of the Indies]], he typically assumed the senior position (although in practice many delegated the decision-making during the journey to their flagship's captain).

Each India ship had a ''capitão'' ([[Captain (nautical)|captain]]). As the position of captain could be quite profitable, it became quite attractive to lesser nobles and men of ambition hoping for a quick and easy fortune.   The crown was often happy to 'sell' captain positions on India runs as a form of royal patronage to candidates with little or no experience at sea. Nonetheless, the captain was formally the king's representative and highest authority on his ship. Everyone, even noble passengers of greater formal rank, were under his jurisdiction. The supremacy of a captain's authority was curtailed only if the captain-major came aboard his ship, and when he docked in [[Goa]] (jurisdiction passed to the [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|Vice-Roy or Governor]]).

Another important figure on an India ship was the ''escrivão'' ([[Captain's clerk|clerk]]), the ''de facto'' royal agent. The clerk was in charge of the written record of everything on the ship, especially the cargo inventory, which he tracked with meticulous precision. The clerk was carefully screened by the [[Casa da Índia]], and was the crown's most trusted agent on board ship, and expected to keep an eye for crown interests. This gave him, in practice, a greater authority on the ship than his formal title suggests. At departure, the clerk was presented with the keys to the ''porão'' ([[Hold (ship)|hold]]) and a [[Seal (emblem)|royal signet]] to seal the cargo. Nobody, not even the captain, was allowed to visit the cargo hold without the clerk present. It is said that rations could not be distributed, nor even a cup of water drawn from a barrel, without notifying the clerk. Upon the capture of an enemy ship, the clerk was immediately escorted aboard the captured vessel to seal the holds, cabins and chests, and take inventory of the loot.

Technical command of the ship was in the hands of the ''piloto'' (who combined the roles of [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] and [[navigator]]) and his assistant, the ''soto-piloto'' (second or under-pilot). The pilot and his assistant not merely steered the ship, but were responsible for all navigational matters – charts, instruments, plotting the course, etc. As captains were often quite inexperienced, the pilot was usually the highest trained naval officer aboard. Captains frequently deferred to them on the running of the ship.

Lacking a formal navigation school, early pilots were trained by [[apprenticeship]]. New pilots received their instruction, both practical and theoretical,  first-hand from master pilots aboard ship and kept a tight lid on their professional secrets.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Tratado que...fez em defensão da carta de marear, Co' regimento de altura'' (1537), the ''comosgrafo-mor'' (chief cosmographer) [[Pedro Nunes]] chides the India pilots for their reluctance to instruct or seek instruction formally.&lt;/ref&gt;  This changed in the late 1550s or early 1560s, with the establishment of formal courses of instruction for India pilots in Lisbon by the ''cosmógrafo-mor'' [[Pedro Nunes]], which included a final examination and formal certification.&lt;ref&gt;Although still holding his mathematics chair in [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]] until 1562, Pedro Nunes began spending extended periods in Lisbon in the late 1550s.  Details of Pedro Nunes's 'navigation courses' are scanty.  It is believed the course was carried on after Nunes's death in 1578 by his successors Thomaz Orta and [[João Baptista Lavanha]].  See Sousa Viterbo (1897). Diffie and Winius (p. 142).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mariner's astrolabe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[mariner's astrolabe]] was developed shortly before 1500 and found its first use in early Portuguese India Armadas]]
Despite their general secretiveness, several early India pilots compiled written navigation manuals, probably initially merely as notes for themselves, but eventually passed on and copied by others.  These included general instructions on how to read, plot and follow routes by nautical chart, how to use the principal nautical instruments of the day – the  mariner's [[compass]], the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], the [[astrolabe]], the [[Nocturnal (instrument)|nocturlabe]] and the ''balestilha'' ([[cross-staff]]) – and astronomical tables (notably that of solar declination, derived from [[Abraham Zacuto]] and later Pedro Nunes's own) to correctly account for "compass error" (the deviation of the [[magnetic north]] from the [[true north]]) by recourse to the [[Pole Star]], [[Sun]] and [[Southern Cross]], the flux and reflux of [[tides]], etc.  These manuals often contained a ''roteiro'' ([[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]), giving the detailed instructions (by geographical coordinates and physical description) of the routes to India.  Two of the few which have survived were [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]]'s ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1509) and  [[João de Lisboa]]'s ''Livro da Marinharia'' (c. 1514).&lt;ref&gt;Other famous rutters of the India run include those by [[André Pires]] (c. 1530), [[Diogo Afonso]] (c. 1536), [[João de Castro]] (1538–1541), [[Manuel de Álvares]] (1545), [[Pêro Vaz Fargosa]] (1560), [[Vicente Rodrigues]] (1575, 1591) and, perhaps most famous of all, the 1595 Dutch edition by [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]. (Matthew, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative to the ships of other nations (e.g. French, Dutch), clerks and pilots on Portuguese vessels held an unusually high degree of authority.

Next in a ship's hierarchy was the ''mestre'' ([[Master (naval)|master]]). The ship's master was the officer in charge of all sailors, ship's boys and the rest of the crew. His primary job at sea was to ensure the crew implemented the technical manoeuvre orders of the pilot – raising and lowering sails, etc. As such, the master required a good degree of sailing knowledge – knowing how to translate the pilot's instructions into sail &amp; crew instructions. He was often sufficiently trained in navigation to take over pilot's duties if the pilot and under-pilot were incapacitated. But a ship which lost all three officers would usually be in serious trouble.

[[Image:Portuguese Nau.png|thumb|230px| Portuguese carrack]]
Assisting the master, was the ''contramestre'' (or ''soto-mestre'', [[boatswain]]). The boatswain was the crew enforcer – he ensured the master's orders were implemented by the crew. In practice, they usually partitioned the deck between them, with the master in charge of implementation in the [[stern]], and the boatswain in the [[bow (ship)|bow]]. The boatswain was also in charge of the maintenance of rigging, anchors and supervising the loading and unloading of cargo, etc. The boatswain had his own assistant, the ''guardião'' (boatswain's mate).

The bulk of the crew were all-purpose sailors – usually half of them ''marinheiros'' (seamen), the other half ''grumetes'' (ship-boys). The partition between the two classes was akin to the modern distinction between [[able seaman]] and [[Ordinary Seaman (occupation)|ordinary seamen]], e.g. ship-boys were assigned the drudgery duties, swabbing and scrubbing, moving cargo, etc., while seamen would be given 'higher' responsibilities, e.g. assigned to hold the wheel on the ''tolda'' ([[quarterdeck]]). The boatswain was considered the head of the seamen, and served as the intermediary between the seamen and the higher officers (master, pilot, etc.). The boatswain's mate had authority only over the ship-boys; seamen would not obey a boatswain's mate's order.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter (2005: p. 180)&lt;/ref&gt;

Then there were the specialized crew. A Portuguese India nau usually had two ''estrinqueiros'', skilled sailors in charge of the [[windlass]] that operated the round [[Mast (sailing)|sails]] (one for the main mast, another for the fore mast). The ''meirinho'' ([[bailiff]]), a judicial officer, was in charge of dispensing punishment and supervising on-board dangers (fires, gunpowder stores, weapon caches). The ''capelão'' ([[chaplain]]) was in charge of saving souls, the ''barbeiro'' ([[barber surgeon]]) in charge of saving lives. A large nau usually had a number of ''pagens'' ([[Page (occupation)|pages]]), who not only attended upon the officers and the cabins, but also served as runners delivering orders across the deck.

The ''despenseiro'' ([[purser]]/[[Chief Steward|steward]]) was in charge of food stores and rations. Unlike ships of other nations, Portuguese vessels did not usually have a cook aboard, sailors were expected to cook their own meals themselves at the ship's ovens.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter (2005: p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt; Rations were composed primarily of [[ship biscuit]] (the main staple, rationed at 2&amp;nbsp;lb per person per day). Other provisions included wine, salt, olive oil, salted cod, sardines, pork, cheese, rice, and the like, with fresh fruits and vegetables available on the initial part of the journey.  Rations were suspended if the ship was at dock and the men ashore. On the return journey, the crown would only supply enough biscuit and water for a ship to reach the Cape of Good Hope; the ship's crew would have to find its own provisions thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, 1988: p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most valued of the specialized positions was the repair crew. This was usually composed of two ''carpinteiros'' ([[carpenter]]s ) and two ''calafate'' (caulkers) that fixed anything that was broken, plus the ''tanoeiro'' ([[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]), who ensured the cargo and water stores remained preserved. A nau might also have ''mergulhadores'' (divers), crew specially trained to go down the outside of the ship to check and help repair hull damage below the water level.

Military personnel aboard a nau varied with the mission. Except for some specialists and passengers, most of the crew was armed before encounters and expected to fight. But every nau also had, at the very least, a small specialized [[Naval artillery|artillery]] crew of around ten ''bombardeiros'' (gunners), under the command of a ''condestável'' ([[constable]]). As naval artillery was the single most important advantage the Portuguese had over rival powers in the Indian Ocean, gunners were highly trained and enjoyed a bit of an elite status on the ship. (Indeed, many gunners on Portuguese India ships were highly skilled foreigners, principally Germans, lured into Portuguese service with premium wages and bonuses offered by crown agents.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Ships that expected more military encounters might also carry ''homens d'armas'' ([[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]]), ''espingardeiros'' ([[arquebusier]]s/[[musketeer]]s) and ''besteiros'' ([[crossbowmen]]). But, except for the gunners, soldiers aboard ship were not regarded as an integral part of the naval crew, but rather just as passengers.

The following is a sample composition of a typical 16th-century Portuguese India nau ([[carrack]]):&lt;ref&gt;Castro (2005: p. 63)&lt;/ref&gt;
*1 captain (capitão)
*1 clerk (''escrivão'')
*1 chaplain (''capelão'')
*2 pilots (''piloto'', ''soto-piloto'')
*1 master (''mestre'')
*1 boatswain (''contramestre'')
*1 boatswain's mate (''guardião'')
*2 windlass operators (''estrinqueiros'')
*45 seamen (''marinheiros'')
*48 ship-boys (''grumetes'')
*4 pages (''pagems'')
*2 carpenters (''carpinteiro'' and ''carpinteiro sobressalente'')
*2 caulkers (''calafate'' and ''calafate sobressalente'')
*1 cooper (''tanoeiro'')
*1 steward (''despenseiro'')
*1 bailiff (''meirinho'')
*1 barber-surgeon (''barbeiro'')
*1 constable (''condestável'')
*11 gunners (''bombardeiros'')

Total = 127 crew

Plus any soldiers and passengers that might be taken aboard.

===Compensation and spoils===
In addition to the cash salaries paid by the [[Casa da Índia]], captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and a certain number of boxes of assorted goods (''caixas forras de fretes e direitos'', or ''caixas de liberdades'', "liberty chests"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships free of freight charge and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit.  Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' × 3' × 2.5' &lt;ref&gt;Matthew, 1988: p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeronimos-SouthFacade.jpg|270px|thumb|The [[Jerónimos Monastery]], built on the profits of the India armadas]]
In the early armadas, the captain-major and captains of the carracks were obliged, by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], to pay the ''vintena de Belém'', a 5% duty of the earnings from the private sales of imported goods for the construction and maintenance of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Santa Maria de Belém|Belém]]. This rule was introduced in 1502 and continued until about 1522.

The following compensation schedule is taken from the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second India Armada]] of 1500&lt;ref&gt;As reported in Gaspar Correia's ''Lendas da India'', p. 147; Matthew (1988: p. 247) gives a different breakdown&lt;/ref&gt;

* captain-major: 10,000 cruzados for entire journey, 500 [[quintal]]s of pepper, 10 liberty chests
* captain: 1,000 cruzados for each 100-tonne ship size they command, 50 quintals, 6 chests
* pilot, master: 500 cruzados, 30 quintals, 4 chests
* constable: 200 cruzados, 10 quintals, 2 chests
* gunners: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest
* soldiers: 5 cruzados per month, 3 quintals, 1 chest
* sailors: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest
* boatswain &amp; boatswain's mate: 1 and a 1/3 times the sailor's salary.
* specialized crew (chaplain, steward, barber-surgeon, carpenter, caulker, windlass-operator): 2/3 of the sailor's salary
* ship-boys: 1/2 of the sailor's salary
* pages: 1/4 of the sailor's salary

The ''Casa da India'' allowed the captain-major to draw as much as 5,000 cruzados of his salary in advance, a captain 1,000. Any married crewman could draw up to one year in salary in advance, while a single man could draw up to six months.

Officers, soldiers and officials that were to remain in India in some capacity (patrol ship captains, factors, clerks, magistrates (''[[alcaide]]-mor''), etc.) typically signed employment contracts of three years duration. Soldiers who signed an overseas service contract received a bonus of 800 ''[[Portuguese real|reais]]'' per month en route, bumped up to 1200 per month in India (to pay for living expenses),&lt;ref&gt;1 cruzado was between 324 and 400 reais&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to ship back an additional 2.5 quintals of pepper per year (in addition to the quintals they were already authorized to send back according to the standard pay scale).&lt;ref&gt;See Barros, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 193–194]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if not formally authorized, captains sometimes supplemented their earnings by undertaking a bit of piracy and extortion on the side. Although it did not necessarily encourage India armadas to pursue activities that might endanger their ships and cargoes, rules were still set out for the partition of the spoils of captured ships and extortion of tribute from 'unfriendly' ports.

The rules of plunder were as follows: first of all, the captain-major has the 'right to a jewel', i.e. he is allowed to pick one item from the spoils for himself, provided it is worth no more than 500 cruzados. Then one-fifth is set aside for the crown. The remainder is subsequently divided into three parts: 2/3 for the crown again (albeit to be expended on the armada itself in the form of equipment, supplies and ammunition), and the remaining third distributed among the crew for private taking. The partition of this last third worked out as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca (1908: p. 201)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Captain-major: 15 parts
*captains of the large carracks: 10 parts
*Captains of caravels: 6 parts
*Pilot-Master (i.e. those who served double office of pilot &amp; master): 4 parts
*Masters: 3 parts
*Pilots: 3 parts
*Sailors: 2 parts
*Gunners: 2 parts
*''Espingardeiros'' (arquebusiers/musketeers): 2 parts
*Crossbowmen: 2 parts
*Armed sailors: 1.5 parts
*Men-at-arms: 1.5 parts
*Ship boys: 1 part

Once again, the captain-major and captains of large carracks had to contribute 10% of their part to the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] of Belém (although that does not seem to apply to the others).

==The India Trade==

===Cargo===
While the India armadas were used to ferry troops, officials, missionaries and colonists between Europe and Asia, their primary objective was commercial. They were engaged in the spice trade, importing Asian spices to sell in European markets, especially the five "glorious spices" – pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and mace.

|}

[[Black Pepper]], grown locally in [[Kerala]], composed as much as 90% of the return cargo of the early armadas. But the other glorious spices could also be found in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Cochin]] and other major markets on the [[Malabar coast]] of India – [[cinnamon]] was imported in large amounts from [[Ceylon]], while, from further east, via [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], came [[long pepper]] (from [[Java]]), [[cloves]] (grown exclusively in the [[Moluccas|Moluccan]] islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]]) and, in smaller amounts, highly valued [[nutmeg|nutmeg and mace]] (grown only in the [[Banda Islands]]).

The armadas also loaded less glorious spices found in Indian markets, notably locally-grown [[ginger]] (the principal 'filler' cargo), [[cardamom]] and [[tamarind]], balms and aromatics like [[Artemisia (plant)|''Artemisia indica'']] (wormwood), [[Aloe perryi|Socotra aloe]], [[galbanum]], [[camphor]] and [[myrrh]]. Also brought back from India were dyes like [[lac]], [[indigo]] and [[dyewood]] and precious ornamental objects and materials like [[ivory]], [[ebony]] and [[pearl]]s.

It is estimated that the average India carrack brought back between 6,100 and 6,800 [[quintal]]s of imported spices and goods – or, around 25,000 to 30,000 quintals for the average yearly India armada (4–5 ships).  Exceptionally large armadas and/or behemoth ships could push it up to 40,000 in some years.&lt;ref&gt;Steensgard (1985: p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that around 15% of the cargo was lost at sea, spoilage, etc. over the long run.

A greater difficulty involved determining the cargo on the outgoing journey. The following list, from the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Fourth Armada]] of 1502, gives an idea of the kind of European items brought by the Portuguese to sell in India: "cut and branch [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[copper]] in pigs and sheets, [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]], [[vermilion]], rugs, Flanders brass basins, coloured cloths, knives, red barret-caps, mirrors and coloured [[silk]]s." &lt;ref&gt;(Danvers, 1894 p. 87).&lt;/ref&gt; But, by and large, European products did not sell well in Asia, which meant that ship holds were frequently empty, or nearly so, on the outward leg. In other words, outbound ships carried little more than the metal bullion – principally [[silver]], but also [[copper]] and [[lead]] – needed to purchase spices in Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;Newitt (2005: p. 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if they stopped by [[Mozambique Island]] on the outward leg (as almost all India armadas did), they could expect the local Portuguese factors to have a stockpile of East African trade goods – gold, ivory, coral, pearls, acquired during the year at several points along the [[Swahili Coast]] – ready to be picked up by the armadas for sale in India.

===Factories===
[[Image:Portugues map of India, 1630.jpg|thumb|230px| Portuguese map of India, from 1630.]]

Of course, an armada could not just sail into an Indian city and expect to find enough supplies at hand in the city's spice markets to load up five or ten large ships at once. Should it even try, it would likely provoke an instant scarcity and quickly drive up the prices of spices astronomically.

Instead, the Portuguese relied on the ancient 'factory' system. That is, in every major market, the Portuguese erected a warehouse ('[[Factory (trading post)|factory]]', ''feitoria'') and left behind a purchasing agent ([[Factor (agent)|'factor']], ''feitor''). The factor and his assistants would remain in the city and buy spices from the markets slowly over the course of the year, and deposit them into the warehouse. When the next armada arrived, it would simply load up the accumulated spices from the warehouse and set sail out at once.

[[File:Calicut 1572.jpg|left|thumb|City of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], India, c. 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]
The first Portuguese factory in Asia was set up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal spice entrepot on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India in September 1500, but it was overrun in a riot a couple of months later. Consequently, the first lasting factory was set up in the nearby smaller city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in late 1500. This was followed up by factories in [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur) (1502) and [[Kollam|Quilon]] (''Coulão'', Kollam) (1503).

Although some Portuguese factories were defended by [[palisade]]s that eventually evolved into Portuguese [[fort]]s garrisoned by Portuguese troops (e.g. [[Fort Kochi|Fort Manuel]] was erected around the Cochin factory in 1503, [[St. Angelo Fort|Fort Sant' Angelo]] around the Cannanore factory in 1505), not all did. The two concepts are distinct. Factories were commercial outposts, not political, administrative or military. The factor was formally an employee of the ''Casa da Índia'' (the trading house), not an officer of the ''Estado da Índia'' (the colonial government).

===Age of Antwerp===
[[File:Armed Four-Master Putting Out to Sea from The Sailing Vessels MET DP818236.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engraving of a Portuguese carrack, by Frans Huys circa 1555. Identifiable by the armillary sphere it flies as a banner]]
While [[Lisbon]] was the offloading point of the India armada, it was not the endpoint of the Portuguese [[spice trade]]. There remained the matter of distribution of the spices in Europe.

Until the Portuguese breakthrough into the Indian Ocean, the supply of eastern spices to European consumers had been largely in the hands of [[Republic of Venice]]. Arab and Gujarati merchants ferried spices from Indian ports like [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], across the [[Arabian Sea]] and into the [[Red Sea]] ports like [[Jeddah]]. From there, they would be carried overland to ports in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Alexandria]], where they would be picked by Venetian merchants and then sold on European markets.

The Portuguese India armadas challenged this old spice route, for a brief period disrupted it, but they did not eliminate it. Despite Portuguese efforts to secure monopolies at the source, enough spices still slipped through the old Venetian-Arab route and forced competition on the sale end in Europe.

[[File:City of Antwerp, 1572.jpg|thumb|City of [[Antwerp]], 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]
Realizing that the Mediterranean was saturated with spices supplied by Venetian merchants, the Portuguese decided to avoid head-to-head competition that might cut into their profits there, and focused on selling their spices in northern Europe, a market the Venetians had barely touched. To this end, the Casa da Índia set up a factory (''feitoria de Flandres'') in the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] town of [[Antwerp]] in 1508. The factory had two purposes: firstly, to serve as a distribution center of the Portuguese spices to the rest of northern Europe; secondly, to acquire the silver bullion needed by the Portuguese India armadas to buy spices in Asia.

It is in the silver trade that Portugal and Venice competed directly. Both needed large volumes of European silver to buy spices in Asia, yet the only significant silver source was in Central Europe, dominated by major German trading families like the [[Welser]]s, the [[Hochstetter]]s and the [[Fuggers]] of [[Augsburg]]. To get their hands on this silver, the Portuguese and Venetians offered gold, not only from their revenues of spice sales, but also from overseas sources: the Portuguese had access to gold from the [[Akan people|Akan]] fields on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of west Africa, while the Venetians had access to the gold mines of the [[Sudan]] (which was freighted up the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]]). Via river routes, the German silver merchants directed silver bullion supplies up to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp, from where ships would carry them to Lisbon, to be loaded onto the India armadas.

The intercontinental streams of spices, gold and silver flowing in and out of the Portuguese factory transformed Antwerp overnight from a sleepy town into arguably the leading commercial and financial center of Europe in the 16th century, a position it would enjoy until its [[Sack of Antwerp|sack by mutinous Spanish soldiers]] in 1576.

Recent research has shown that, after 1505, most of the trade that moved between Lisbon and Antwerp sidestepped the Portuguese royal "factory of Flanders".  Most of the European leg of the trade was directly contracted between the ''Casa da Índia'' in Lisbon and private foreign consortiums (usually Italian and German) in Antwerp and freighted largely by Dutch, Hanseatic and Breton ships.  As a result, the bulk of the profits of the Portuguese spice trade accrued not to the Portuguese crown, but to the private consortiums (Smith calculates that, in 1517–1519, as much as half the price difference for spices between Indian and European markets was pocketed by private European merchants on this leg; by 1585, the share reaped by the Portuguese crown had fallen to a mere 15%).&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The End==

Due to a series of costly losses in the 1550s, the ''Casa da Índia'' fell into severe financial straits and was basically bankrupt by 1560. In 1570, King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] issued a decree revoking the royal monopoly, and opening up trade with India to any private Portuguese merchant. As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, whereby the ''Casa'' sold the rights of the India trade to a private merchant consortium, guaranteeing them a monopoly for one year.  The annual monopoly system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed.  But by that time, everything had changed.

For an entire century, the Portuguese had managed to monopolize the India run.  The spice trade itself was not monopolized – through the 16th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] had kept up its competition through its overland Levantine routes – but the sea route by the Cape remained exclusively Portuguese.  Despite occasional leaks (e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502), details of the Portuguese ''Carreira da Índia'' had been largely kept secret, or at least was not exploited by competitors.  But this changed in the 1590s.

The capture of the Portuguese ship ''São Filipe'' by the English privateer Sir Francis Drake in 1587, with its [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] and detailed maps, prompted the first English attempt to sail to the East Indies, a private three-ship fleet organized by London merchants, and led by Sir [[James Lancaster]].  It was a disaster – most of the ships and crews were lost, and Lancaster had to resort to piracy to fill his hold – but it opened the way.

In the Netherlands, the preacher and cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]] had long been urging his countrymen to set out on their own route, rather than relying on the Portuguese hauls.  The Dutch effort received an injection from the information provided by [[Cornelis de Houtman]], a Dutch spy dispatched to Lisbon in 1592 to scout the spice trade, and [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], a Dutch sailor who had served on many Portuguese India armadas from the 1580s.  With this information in hand, the Dutch finally made their move in 1595, when a group of [[Amsterdam]] merchants formed the ''Compagnie van Verre'' and sent out their first expedition, under de Houtman, to the East Indies, aiming for the market port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]].  That same year, Linschoten published a little tract in Amsterdam entitled ''Reysgheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'' (Travel Account of the Voyages of the Portuguese in the Orient),  a [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] giving the details of the sailing directions of the Portuguese India Run.  It was republished in 1596, as part of a larger book, the ''Itinerario'', where Linschoten gave the details of the trade and the condition of Portuguese defenses in Asia.  It was an explosive sensation. It was immediately translated into English, German, Latin and soon French.

1597 was the bellwether year – the year of Houtman's successful return, and the spread of Linschoten's tracts. A slate of new Dutch companies (''voorcompagnie'') to trade with the East Indies were immediately erected by various competing merchant consortiums in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg and elsewhere – often with the help of exiled Antwerp merchants ('Brabantsche'), who had long been involved on the distribution end of the Portuguese spice trade, but expelled due to the Dutch-Spanish conflict. At least fifteen separate Dutch expeditions to the East Indies, each involving enormous numbers of men, ships, and amounts of treasure, were sent out by the ''voorcompanies'' in 1598–1601. From this enthusiastic anarchic beginning, the Dutch trade got organized in 1601, when the Dutch government forced the voorcompagnie to fold under a single monopoly company, the ''[[Dutch East India Company|Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie]]'' (VOC).

Fearful of being left behind, the English had founded their own [[East India Company]] (EIC) in 1600, and managed to organize a small English expedition to Bantam in 1601, but enthusiasm was weaker and the EIC had problems competing with the better-organized and better-financed Dutch.

The vigorous [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]] and [[East India Company|English EIC]] encroachments on the [[Portuguese empire]] and trade in Asia, prompted the monarchy (then in [[Iberian Union]] with Spain) to experiment with different arrangements.  In 1624, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip III of Portugal]] granted a monopoly charter to a Portuguese ''[[Portuguese East India Company|Companhia do commércio da Índia]]'', a private joint-stock company organized on the same lines as the Dutch and English companies. The ''Companhia'' was to take over all the  responsibilities of the ''Casa da Índia'', including the annual India armada.&lt;ref&gt;Silva (1974); Disney (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  It proved to be a fiasco. The Anglo-Dutch breach of the Portuguese East Indies trade was irreparable by this time, squeezing profit margins and rendering the ''Companhia'' unprofitable.  It was liquidated in 1633, and what remained of the dwindling Portuguese India trade was brought back under the royal ''Casa da Índia''.

==Sources==
What seems like the first chronology of the Portuguese India armadas can be found in the magnificently illustrated codex known as the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'' ("Book of Lisuarte de Abreu", named after the man who ordered the compilation). It covers the period from Vasco da Gama's first trip (1497–99) to the end of 1563. It is conserved at the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in [[New York City]] (ms. 525).

Another codex of the same nature is the ''Memória das Armadas que de Portugal passaram à Índia'' ("Memory of the Armadas that from Portugal passed to India") or ''Livro das Armadas'', held by the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon|Academia das Ciências]] in [[Lisbon]]. It covers the period from 1497 to 1567 (although missing the armada of 1517).

The first Portuguese chronicler to attempt a systematic chronology of the India Armadas seems to have been [[Diogo do Couto]], in his appendix to [[João de Barros]]'s ''Décadas da Ásia'' ("Decades of Asia"), entitled " "De todas as Armadas que os Reys de Portugal mandáram à Índia, até que El-Rey D. Filippe succedeo nestes Reynos", de 1497 a 1581" (Dec X, Pt.1, Bk. 1, c.16).

Other codices include "''Relação das Náos e Armadas da India com os Sucessos dellas que se puderam Saber, para Noticia e Instrucção dos Curiozos, e Amantes da Historia da India''" ("Relation of the Ships and Armadas of India") (Codex Add. 20902 of the [[British Library]]), covering the period from 1497 to 1653. It was compiled on the order of D. [[António de Ataíde]], who was himself responsible for a good part of its extensive marginal annotations. Other annotations were added by later unidentified writers.

One of the more exhaustive chronologies, at least up to 1640, was compiled by [[Manuel de Faria e Sousa]] in his ''Ásia Portugueza'' (part III, end of volume), published posthumously in 1675. Faria e Sousa includes not only the India Armadas, but all the Portuguese fleets from 1412, including those dispatched to Africa under Prince [[Henry the Navigator]].

There are several [[chronicle]]s of Portuguese India written by contemporaries and historians, which provide substantive descriptions of the various armadas. [[João de Barros]]'s ''Décadas da Ásia'' and [[Damião de Góis]]'s royal chronicles (''Crónica do Felicíssimo Rei D. Manuel'', 1566–67 and ''Crónica do Principe D. João'', 1567) were official chronicles. As a result, while comprehensive, they have the drawbacks of being carefully [[censorship|censored]] and consciously [[propaganda|propagandistic]]. Both Barros and Gois constructed their accounts primarily from archives in Lisbon although Barros's vast work was far more comprehensive and more conscientiously faithful to accuracy (Góis's was an unabashed [[hagiography]], whereas Barros frequently updated his account on the discovery of any new scrap of information). Barros's work was supplemented later by several additional volumes written by [[Diogo do Couto]], who had spent most of his career in India.&lt;ref&gt;Russell-Wood (1992: p. 210)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the unofficial accounts, [[Jerónimo Osório]]'s ''De rebus Emmanuelis'', is essentially a [[Latin]] restatement of the earlier chronicles, hoping for a wider European audience, and provides little that we don't already know. [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]]'s ''História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses'' ("History of the Discovery and Conquest of the East Indies by the Portuguese", 1554–59), although unofficial, is generally regarded as 'respectable' and reliable. Unlike Barros, Góis or Osório, Castanheda actually visited the East, spending ten years in India, and supplemented the archival material with independent interviews he conducted there and back in Coimbra.

Distinct from all the others is [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da Índia'' ("Legends of India", written c. 1556, manuscript found and published only in 1885). This is almost entirely original material, his facts and names are often at variance with the official chronicles. Correia spent nearly his entire life in India, and drew primarily from materials available there. His style of writing is also much more entertaining, intense and replete with 'gossipy' details. Although not regarded as reliable, Correia's account supplies a lot of information that the others miss or prefer to remain silent on.

Besides these comprehensive chronicles, there are many accounts of particular armadas – on-board diaries, accounts, memoirs and letters written by their passengers.

There is quite some conflict between the various sources over the exact composition of the various India Armadas, particularly in the names of the captains of the vessels. Attempts have been made to reconcile the differences between the sources (e.g. Quintella's ''Annaes da Marinha Portugueza''), although these inevitably involve some degree of conjecture, dispute and revision.

Like his luckless brother, Miguel disappears at sea. A third brother, Vasco Anes de Corte Real, petitions to search for his lost brothers, but King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] vetoes the expedition.
* 1502 Alberto Cantino, Italian spy working for Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, bribes an unknown cartographer of the Armazem das Indias, to smuggle out a copy of the Portuguese secret master-map, the ''Padrão Real''. This will the basis of the [[Cantino planisphere]] published in 1502. In response, [[Manuel I of Portugal]] will pass a new law (November 1504) instituting state censorship of all private map and globe production, with outright prohibition of any depiction of coast beyond West Africa.
* 1502 On return of the 2nd Brazil expedition, King Manuel I of Portugal grants a consortium headed by [[Fernão de Noronha|Fernão de Loronha]] (or Noronha), a New Christian merchant of Lisbon, a three-year charter for the exclusive commercial exploitation of the 'lands of Santa Cruz' ([[Brazil]]). He will drum up a profitable business in [[brazilwood]] and novelty pets (monkeys, parrots). It is estimated that Loronha will collect some 20,000 [[quintal]]s of brazilwood between 1503 and 1506, representing a 400–500% profit rate on the 4,000 ducats the charter cost him.

Note: In some lists, Pêro Dinis (or Dias) de Setúbal is substituted with two small ships, one under Simão de Alcáçova, another under [[Cristóvão de Távora]], bringing the total to fourteen. To get thirteen again, they assume Albergaria doesn't have his own ship, but is aboard Pêro de Mendonça's ship on outbound journey.

'''Rare''' is an international conservation organization whose stated mission is to help communities adopt sustainable behaviors toward their natural environment and resources. The organization uses marketing techniques and technical interventions to address threats like [[overfishing]], [[deforestation]] and unsustainable agricultural practices.  Rare's work is founded on the belief that most of the threats faced by the environment are the result of human behavior, and that changing human behavior requires appealing to people using both rational and emotional arguments and removing any barriers that might prevent change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rare.org/pride|title = Pride campaigns {{!}} Rare|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Rare was founded on January 1, 1973 by David Hill. The organization was originally headquartered at the offices of the [[National Audubon Society]] in New York before joining the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] in the 1980s. In 1987, Rare returned to being an independent entity.

Currently headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, in the United States, Rare also has offices in the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Brazil, Mozambique, Mexico and Micronesia. Rare has worked with communities and local partners in over 55 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservation-that-works-for-locals-1496420515|title=Conservation That Works for Locals|last=Bobrow|first=Emily|date=2 June 2017|website=|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rare receives four stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=5158|title = Charity Navigator Rating –  Rare|accessdate = 2015-09-10|website = Charity Navigator}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a four-star scale from [[Charity Navigator]].

==Approach to Conservation==

[[Social marketing]]: Rare uses social marketing to achieve its mission. Each marketing concept is applied to motivate communities to take pride in their surrounding environment and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/harnessing-local-pride-for-global-conservation|title=Harnessing Local Pride for Global Conservation|last=Bornstein|first=David|date=9 February 2012|website=|publisher=NY Times Opinionator Blog|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools Rare uses include: animal mascots, puppet shows, religious sermons, radio spots, billboards, art contests, community theater events, festivals, murals, songs and school visits.

Rare's campaign approach originated on the Eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia in 1977, with the work of Paul Butler, now Rare's senior vice president. Butler was hired by St. Lucia's Forestry Department in an effort to save the declining, endemic St. Lucia Parrot. Hunting, habitat destruction and the bird trade had caused the species to decline from 1000 birds in the mid-1950s to less than 150 by 1977.

Working with Gabriel Charles (Former Chief Forest Officer) and a team of forest officers, he created an outreach campaign that aimed to build community pride in the parrot and its forest habitat. Butler and his forestry department colleagues leveraged marketing materials that mirrored those used by the private sector, including campaign songs, mascots, and poster art depicting the parrot alongside a targeted call to action: "Take Pride in St. Lucia! Report illegal hunting of wildlife and clearing of land!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Switch|last = Heath|first = Chip &amp; Dan|publisher = Broadway Books|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0-385-52875-7|location = |pages = 149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the government of St. Lucia declared the parrot its national bird, established a parrot sanctuary, and updated and enforced laws to protect the species and its habitat. The parrot population steadily recovered, and today population estimates for the species exceed 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYDQIZWRsEc|title = St. Lucia &amp; the Jacquot Parrot {{!}} up! magazine|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYDQIZWRsEc|title = St. Lucia &amp; the Jacquot Parrot {{!}} up! magazine|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Butler's campaign and marketing tactics formed the foundation of Rare's social marketing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pride Protects St. Lucia Parrots {{!}} BirdNote|url = https://birdnote.org/show/pride-protects-st-lucia-parrots|website = birdnote.org|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===Fisheries===

Rare works with coastal communities to restore small-scale fisheries in the Philippines, Belize, Brazil, Indonesia and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fish Forever {{!}} Turning the tide for coastal fisheries in the developing tropics|url = https://www.fishforever.org|website = www.fishforever.org|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the Fish Forever partnership between Rare, the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], and the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California Santa Barbara]], the organization expands and implements sustainable fisheries management solutions worldwide.

The Fish Forever program pilots and implements TURF+Reserves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Well-funded program tries new approach to tackle overfishing in developing world|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/well-funded-program-tries-new-approach-to-tackle-overfishing-in-developing-world/2014/02/23/c3b678e0-9b33-11e3-975d-107dfef7b668_story.html|accessdate = 2016-04-13|first = Lenny|last = Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; (territorial user rights for fishing) a pairing of exclusive fishing access and marine reserves that allows fisheries restoration and marine conservation to work together. Marine reserves (specifically in the form of no-take areas) are designated alongside or within the exclusive fishing areas, or TURFs, with the aim of giving fish populations the chance to thrive and spill over into the fishing areas.

===Watersheds===

Rare works with local communities throughout Latin America to implement reciprocal water agreements for upstream habitat protection. The agreements incentivize upstream landowners to conserve watershed habitat, with downstream water users (both entities and individuals) financing such incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecosystems in Colombia |url=http://www.instiglio.org/en/watershed-management-in-colombia/ |website=www.instiglio.org |publisher=Instiglio |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sourcing Solutions===

Solution Search is a crowdsourcing online contest platform designed to source, reward and disseminate proven solutions in conservation and development. Past competition themes have sought out fisheries restoration solutions and climate adaptation approaches worldwide. The 2015 Solution Search contest recognized solutions in U.S. weather-related disaster risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://blog.nature.org/conservancy/2015/06/10/contest-shows-natural-solutions-can-protect-against-extreme-weather/|title = Contest Shows Natural Solutions Can Protect Against Extreme Weather|website = The Nature Conservancy Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest has identified more than 240 solutions from 65 countries across the various topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solution Search|url = https://solutionsearch.org|website = Solution Search|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tackling.png|right|thumb|300px|Sailing [[frigate]] and her [[rigging]]]]
A '''sail plan''' is a set of drawings, usually prepared by a [[Naval Architecture|naval architect]] which shows the various combinations of [[sail]] proposed for a [[sailing ship]]. Alternatively, as a term of art, it refers to the way such vessels are rigged as [[#Types of rig|discussed below]].&lt;ref name = Folkard&gt;

The combinations shown in a sail plan almost always include three configurations:
* A ''light air'' sail plan. Over most of the Earth, most of the time, the wind force is [[Beaufort scale|Force 1]] or less. Thus a sail plan should include a set of huge, lightweight sails that will keep the ship underway in light breezes.
* A ''working'' sail plan. This is the set of sails that are changed rapidly in variable conditions. They are much stronger than the light air sails, but still lightweight.  An economical sail in this set will include several sets of reefing ties, so the area of the sail can be reduced in a stronger wind.
* A ''storm'' sail plan. This is the set of very small, very rugged sails flown in a gale, to keep the vessel under way and in control.
In all sail plans, the architect attempts to balance the force of the sails against the drag of the underwater [[keel]] in such a way that the vessel naturally points into the wind. In this way, if control is lost, the vessel will avoid [[Broach (sailing)|broaching]] (turning edge-to-the wind), and being beaten by breaking waves. Broaching always causes uncomfortable motion, and in a storm, the breaking waves can destroy a lightly built boat. The architect also tries to balance the wind force on each sail plan against a range of loads and ballast. The calculation assures that the sail will not knock the vessel sideways with its [[mast (sailing)|mast]] in the water, [[capsizing]] and perhaps sinking it.

==Terminology==
[[File:Starofindia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Star of India (ship)|''Star of India'']] showing view of most of her sails, and her standing and running rigging]]

===Types of rig===
* ''[[Fore-and-aft rig]]'' features sails that run fore and aft (along the length of the sailing craft), controlled by lines called "sheets", that changes sides, as the bow passes through the wind from one side of the craft to the other. Three variants include:
**''[[Bermuda rig]]'' (also known as a ''Marconi rig'') features a three-sided [[mainsail]].
**''[[Gaff rig]]'' features a four-sided mainsail with the upper edge made fast to a spar called a gaff.
**''[[Lateen rig]]'' features a three-sided sail set on a long yard, mounted at an angle on the mast and running in a fore-and-aft direction.
* ''[[Square rig]]'' features sails set square to the mast from a [[Yard (sailing)|yard]], a spar running transversely in relation to the hull (athwartships).  Although these sails are more or less "square" (trapezoid) in appearance, this is not the reason they are referred to as "square". In ships built using older designs of the square rig, sailors would have to climb the [[rigging]] and walk out on [[footropes]] under the yard to furl and unfurl the sails. In a modern square rigged design the crew can furl and unfurl sails by remote control from the deck. Some cruising craft with fore-and-aft sails will carry a small square sail with top and bottom yards that are easily rigged and hauled up from the deck; such a sail is used as the only sail when running downwind under storm conditions, as the vessel becomes much easier to handle than under its usual sails, even if they are severely reefed (shortened).  A modern version of this rig is the German-engineered [[DynaRig]] which has its yards fixed permanently in place on its rotating masts and has twice the efficiency of operation of the traditional square rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=International HISWA Symposium on Yacht Design and Yacht Construction|date=2004|last1=Perkins|first1=Tom| author-link1=Thomas Perkins (businessman)| last2=Dijkstra|first2=Gerard| last3=Navi| first3=Perini|author-link3= Perini Navi |last4=Roberts|first4=Damon| title=The Maltese Falcon: the realization|url=http://www.hiswasymposium.com/assets/files/pdf/2004/Dijkstra@hiswasymposium-2004.pdf|access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of sail===
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
[[file:fore and aft sails.svg|thumb|The main- and topsails of a traditional fore-and-aft rigged mast]]
Each form of rig requires its own type of sails. Among them are:
* A ''[[staysail]]'' ("stays'l") is a piece of cloth that has one or two sides attached to a ''stay'', that is, one of the ropes or wires that helps hold the mast in place. A staysail was classically attached to the stay with wooden or steel hoops, but on modern yachts are attached by clips. Sailors would test the hoops by climbing on them.
* A ''[[jib]]'' is a [[headsail]] that flies in front of the foremost vertical mast and attaches to a stay or roller furling gear, whether that be the mainmast or a somewhat shorter foremast.
* A "genoa" is a large jib that increases area by extending rearward of the mast.
* A  "[[mainsail]]" is a sail attached to the main mast.  For fore and aft sails it is triangular sail with the forward edge attached to the mast with the foot or lower edge generally attached to a boom.  A gaff rig mainsail also has a boom at the top of the sail and is truncated triangle. For square rigged ships it is suspended on a cross spar attached to the mast, and is the lowest of such sails
* A [[mizzen]] sail is a small triangular sail at the [[stern]] of a boat.
* A [[lug sail]] is a quadrilateral sail suspended on a spar on the mast similarly to a square main sail but used as a fore and aft sail

===Order===
[[File:Square rigged sails.svg|thumb|Itemized list of all possible sails on a square rigged mast]]
The standard terminology assumes three masts, from front to back, the foremast, mainmast and mizzenmast. On ships with fewer than three masts, the tallest is the mainmast. Ships with more masts number them.

From bottom to top, the sails of each mast are named by the mast and position on the mast, e.g. for the [[mainmast]], from lowest to highest: main [[mainsail|course]], main [[topsail]], main [[topgallant sail|topgallant]] ("t'gallant"), main [[royal (sail)|royal]], main [[skysail]], and main [[moonraker (sail)|moonraker]]. Since the early nineteenth century, the topsails and topgallants are often split into a lower and an upper sail to allow them to be more easily handled.  This makes the mast appear to have more "sails" than it officially has.

On many warships, sails above the fighting top (a platform just above the lowest sail) were mounted on separate masts ("topmasts" or "topgallant masts") held in wooden sockets called "tabernacles". These masts and their stays could be rigged or struck as the weather and tactical situation demanded.

In light breezes, the working square sails would be supplemented by ''[[studding sail]]s'' ("stuns'l") out on the ends of the yardarms. These were called as a regular sail, with the addition of "studding". For example, the ''main top studding sail''.

Between the main mast and mizzen as well as between main mast and foremast, the [[staysail]]s between the masts are named from the sail immediately ''below'' the highest attachment point of the stay holding up that staysail. Thus, the mizzen topgallant staysail can be found dangling from the stay leading from ''above'' the ''mizzen'' (third) mast's ''topgallant'' sail (i.e., from the mizzen topgallant yard) to at least one and usually two sails down from that on the ''main'' mast (the slope of the top edge of all staysail lines runs from a higher point nearer the stern to a lower point towards the bow).

The jibs --staysails between the first mast and the ''[[bowsprit]]''-- are named (from inner to outer most) fore topmast staysail (or foretop stay), inner jib, outer jib and flying jib. Many of the jibs' stays meet the foremast just above the fore topgallant. A fore royal staysail may also be set.

===Lines===
In the age of sail, lines were made of [[manila hemp|manila]], [[cotton]], [[hemp]], or [[jute]].  Modern lines are made of polyester (Dacron), polyamides (nylon), and sometimes crystallized hydrocarbons ([[Kevlar]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#Kite flying|Spectra]]).  [[Standing rigging]] may include wire rope made of [[stainless steel|stainless]] or [[Hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized]] steel. Other older, or less common materials include [[papyrus]] in ancient Egypt and [[coir]].

===Rigging===
* ''[[standing rigging|Standing]]'' rigging does not change position. Usually it braces the masts.
* ''[[running rigging|Running]]'' rigging is used to adjust sails and anchors.
* A ''line'' is a rope that has been put to use aboard a sailing vessel.
* A ''[[stays (nautical)|stay]]'' is a wire or rope that supports a mast. It is part of the standing rigging, usually located in the fore-aft plane of the vessel.
* A ''[[shroud (sailing)|shroud]]'' is similar to a stay, but is located in the athwartship plane of the vessel. Thus, shrouds come down to the sides of the boat and are attached to ''[[chainplate]]s''. Shrouds may be held away from the mast by spreaders.
* A ''vang'' is a rope used to pull something around or down.
** A ''[[boom vang]]'' pulls down on a boom.
* A ''[[sheet (sailing)|sheet]]'' is a line used to adjust the position of a sail so that it catches the wind properly.
* ''[[Halyard]]s'' (from "haul-yard") are the lines on which one pulls to hoist something; e.g. the main-topgallant-staysail-halyard would be the line on which one pulls to hoist (unfurl) the main-topgallant-staysail.
* A ''[[block (sailing)|block]]'' is the seaman's name for a pulley-block. It may be fixed to some part of the vessel or spars, or even tied to the end of a line.
** The ''sheave'' is the wheel within a block, or a spar, over which a line is rove.
** A ''fiddle'' block has two or more sheaves in one block, each with its own axle, so the sheaves are aligned.
** A ''snatch-block'' can be closed around a line, to grab the line, rather than threading the end of the line through the block.
* A ''[[shackle]]'' is a piece of metal to attach two ropes, or a block to a rope, or a sail to a rope. Customarily, a shackle has a screw-in ''pin'' which often is so tight that a ''shackle-key'' must be used to unscrew it. A ''snap-shackle'' does not screw, and can be released by hand, but it is usually less strong or more expensive than a regular shackle.
* Running lines are made ''fast'' (unmoving) by ''belaying'' them to (wrapping them around) a cleat or a ''[[Belaying pin|belaying-pin]]'' located in a ''pin-rail'' or ''[[Fife rail|fife-rail]]''. Wrapping the rope holds it tight and prevents the line from slipping, i.e. stops it. Thus to "belay" something meant to stop or cease it in naval slang ("belay that noise!").

====Sprit and stays====
* ''[[Bowsprit]]'', a horizontal spar extending from the bow (front) of the boat used to attach the forestay to the foremost mast. Sails which attach to the stays of the bowsprit are called forestaysails.
* ''[[Bobstay]]s'', a heavy stay directly below the bowsprit attaching on the above the waterline on the stem to the bowsprits end, often the strongest on a ship, frequently made of chain.
* Whisker Stays, any number of pair of stays on either side of the bowsprit and jib boom bracing them against lateral forces
* Jib boom, a horizontal spar completely outboard the vessel and laying on top of the bowsprit. Used to fly the jibs from and attach the upper forestays to the higher masts.
* ''[[dolphin striker]]'', Under the tip of the bowsprit runs downward a heavy pole to provide tension to the jib boom
* Martingale backstays, a pair of stays on either side of the bobstay run to the bottom of the dolphin striker sometimes from the cathead
* ''[[Martingale (rigging)|martingale]]'', a stay that ends from the bottom of the dolphin striker to the end of the jib boom

The stays on a ship roughly form hoops of tension holding the masts up against the wind. Many ships have been "tuned" by tightening the rigging in one area, and loosening it in others. The tuning can create most of the stress on the stays in some ships.

== Types of sailing vessels ==
[[File:Ship Rigging differences in schematic view.png|thumb|right|Examples of historic rigging for two masted ships]]
Sailing vessels may be distinguished by:
* hull configuration ([[monohull]], [[catamaran]], [[trimaran]]),
* keel type (full, fin, wing, centerboard etc.),
* purpose (sport, racing, cruising),
* number and configuration of masts
* sail plan (square and/or fore-and-aft rigged sails).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Trivia====
All of these sails may have a [[boom (sailing)|boom]] along the bottom, or they may have none. A [[boom (sailing)|boom]]-footed sail gives better control of the sail shape and thus makes the sail more efficient, especially upwind. One of the advantages of loose-footed sails is that there is no boom to hit one's head or knock one into the water. Boats without booms are also lighter and cheaper to make.

Some gaff and some junk rigs get in the way of [[shroud (sailing)|shroud lines]] strung between the mast and hull. If the mast cannot be held up by shrouds, it must [[unstayed mast|stand up by itself]], which makes it heavier, especially on a large boat.

A  [[gunter rig]] is often used for smaller boats where the mast is frequently taken down; the mast is made short enough to be stored flat inside the boat. The popular [[Mirror (dinghy)|Mirror class]] of racing [[dinghy]] is gunter-rigged for this reason.

[[lugsail|Lug]], [[lateen]] and [[settee sail]]s have an efficient tack and an [[lateen#inefficient tack|inefficient tack]], in which the sail presses against the mast, spoiling its aerodynamics. Some swing their yards around the mast to make both tacks efficient, but this is difficult with larger sails.

Crab-claws are easily to construct, as they work well when cut from a single flat sheet (they don't need multiple shaped pieces to create their 3-D [[Draft (sail)|draft]]). On a small boat like the [[Sunfish (sailboat)|Sunfish]], their rigging can also be limited to one [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]] and one [[halyard]].

Junk rigs, like crab-claws, place no extreme loads anywhere on the sail or rigging, so they can be built using light-weight, weaker, less-expensive materials. The subdivided sails make them easy for a small crew to handle, and they are easy to [[reef (sailing)|reef]]. Junks also customarily have internal water-tight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], as do modern ships.

====[[Aspect ratio]]====
The sails above vary in shape from square to triangular. A triangular sail has half the [[triangle#area|surface area]] of a squarish sail of the same height. For the sails to have the same surface area, the triangular sail must be twice as tall.

There are several disadvantages to a tall rig. Firstly, it makes the boat less stable. If the sails are tall, the wind tends to push the boat over (the [[center of effort]] of the sail pushes sideways higher on the mast). A boat is also more tippy if it has a taller mast or heavy [[spar (sailing)|spars]] high up (such as the gaff on a gaff rig). An [[outrigger]], [[ballast]], and/or a long [[keel]] is needed to keep the boat upright. Secondly, a taller rig makes it harder to hold the mast onto the boat (with the [[standing rigging]]). Generally, taller rigs are more [[Stress (mechanics)|highly stressed structures]] than shorter rigs. This makes them more expensive and more fragile for a given strength of material. Stronger, cheaper modern materials are one reason why shorter, squarer rigs are becoming rare.

Why, then, use a tall triangular sail? Because it is more aerodynamic than a squarish one. Downwind, a sail acts like a [[windsock]]; the wind just [[forces on sails#drag|hits and bounces]], pushing the boat downwind. But at right angles to the wind, the sail catches the wind and [[forces on sails#lift|''redirects'']] it, letting it sail [[Forces on sails#Effect of points of sail on forces|faster than the wind]]. Pushing the wind around to a different direction pushes the sailboat off in [[Newton's third law|the opposite direction]] (modified by the forces from the hull, which are all that stop the boat from blowing away). A sailboat can't sail directly upwind, but by redirecting the wind it can sail nearly upwind. It can then [[tack (sailing)|tack]] in a zigzag to move directly upwind.

A tall, thin sail redirects the wind more smoothly, so it can sail more nearly upwind than a wide sail (it is more [[point of sail#Close-hauled|weatherly]]). Sailing a race in a circle, everyone has to go upwind. So other things (like sail area) being equal, the most weatherly boat will win. This is why almost all racing boats have tall, thin sails. They also have deep, heavy keels, or are [[multihull]]s, so that they don't tip over, and strong [[standing rigging]], so their masts don't blow off.

Boats with shorter, wider sails have lighter, shallower hulls. They may wait for a favorable wind to avoid sailing upwind. They may go faster than a high-aspect-ratio sailboat when not going upwind; for instance, crab-claws sail extremely well on a [[beam reach]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

European, and especially English, watercraft terminology draws a strong distinction between [[square-rig]]ged vessels (with square sails hung from yards mounted centrally and horizontally from masts) and [[fore-and-aft rig]]ged ones (everything else). '''It is important to note that any other sail''' (such as a lug or spritsail),''' ''[[Forces on sails#Sail terminology|even if it is geometrically square]]'', is not a [[square sail]] in the technical sense used in European sail terminology'''. It is merely a quadrilateral fore-and-aft sail. Vessels are named by the number of square-rigged masts that they have. This is because [[square-rig]]ged vessels used to be the fastest rig, and more masts were faster.

Any traditional European vessel that really needed speed was [[square-rig]]ged. Navy sailing vessels, pirates, merchants that needed to escape pirates, and merchant vessels that just needed speed, such as [[tea clipper]]s, all had towering stacks of smallish square sails. Given a huge crew to control all the sails, they could often outrace the fore-and-aft rigged vessels of the day, even upwind. They needed more [[tack (sailing)|tacks]], so they had to go further, but they had nearly twice the sail area, so they went more quickly and still got there sooner. A fore-and-aft rigged vessel, with its less sub-divided sails, would break its masts and rigging if it tried to carry the same area of sail and go equally fast. Stronger materials (and winch technology to control large sails) now let fore-and-aft rigged vessels outrace square-rigged ones.

[[File:Junk rigs.JPG|thumb|left| ]]
Junk rigs essentially have the stack of sails, but without all the gaps between them. Where the [[yard (sailing)|yards]] controlled the towers of square sails, the [[batten (sailing)|battens]] controlled the junk sail. In [[East Asia]], the largest and the smallest boats traditionally use junk sails, and vessels are not named by sail type, but by region, function, and other characteristics.

Likewise, in the [[Oceania|Pacific]] both large and small sailing vessels traditionally use what are generally called crabclaw sails, although they are of many different types. Other sails are also traditionally used.

In the [[Middle East]], on the east coast of [[Africa]], and as far east as India, [[lateen]]s and [[settee sail|settees]] were in common use. Ships were named more with regard to purpose than number of masts or type of sail. For instance, [[felucca]]s and [[sambuk]]s were mostly used for fishing and ferrying, [[dhow]]s are heavy cargo vessels. [[Xebec]]s, which also had oars, were used by [[Privateer|corsairs]] to outpace merchant vessels, which were also often [[xebec]]s.

Attempts to blend nomenclature, as in the junk diagram to the left above, occur. A ship can be rigged with one of its sails as a junk sail and another as a Bermuda rig without being considered a junk vessel.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Catboat (one mast, one sail)===
{{main|Catboat}}

A catboat is a sailboat with a single mast and single sail; for examples of the variety of catboats, see the section above. This is the easiest sail plan to sail, and is used on the smallest and simplest boats. The catboat is a classic fishing boat. A popular movement for home-built boats uses this simple rig to make "folk-boats".

The term "catboat" is usually qualified by the type of sail, for example, "a gaff catboat".

==== Proa ====
&lt;gallery&gt;
Sail plan proa steep.svg|Pacific proa, on a [[beam reach]] rightwards, with the wind blowing into the page.
Sail plan Atlantic proa.svg|Atlantic proa. Note that the wind is on the other side, blowing out of the page.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A proa has one sail, and is thus a catboat, though it is rarely called a catboat. Both ends are alike, and the boat is sailed in either direction, but it has a fixed leeward side and a windward side. The boat is shunted from [[beam reach]] to beam reach to change direction, with the wind over the side, a low-force procedure. The bottom corner of the crabclaw sail is moved to the other end, which becomes the bow as the boat sets off back the way it came. The mast usually hinges, adjusting its [[rake (mast)]]. The proa is a [[Stress (mechanics)|low-stress]] rig, which can be built with simple tools and low-tech materials, but it is extremely fast. On a [[beam reach]], it may be the fastest simple rig.

In a traditional '''Pacific proa''', the outrigger (ama) lies on the ''windward'' side of the main hull (vaka), with its weight helping keep the proa upright. The ama is very thin, to punch through waves, smoothing the ride. The first Europeans, building proas from travelers' reports, built '''Atlantic proas''', with the outrigger on the leeward side, with its buoyancy keeping the proa upright.

"To be clear, we can blame Richard C. Newick for the debate" (about racing proas), "since it was he who came up with the Atlantic proa in the first place, with his groundbreaking Cheers - the “giant killer” that came in third in the 1968 OSTAR. Unlike all proas until Cheers, Newick placed the ama to lee and the rig to windward, concentrating all the ballast to windward and thus multiplying the righting moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proafile.com/multihull-boats/discussion-forum/viewthread/86/|title=Proa File - Discussion Forum|website=ProaFile.com|access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]] or [[Gaff rig|gaff]] [[mainsail]] lifted by a single [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] with a single [[jib]] attached to a bowsprit, bent onto the [[forestay]], held taut with a [[backstay]].  The mainsail is usually managed with a [[spar (sailing)|spar]] on the underside called a "[[Boom (sailing)|boom]]".

A Bermuda-rigged sloop is one of the best racing rigs per square foot of sail area as is it very [[point of sail#Close-hauled|weatherly]], making it faster on upwind passages. This rig is the most popular for recreational boating because of its potential for high performance. On small boats, it can be a simple rig. On larger [[sloop]]s, the large sails have high loads, and one must manage them with winches or multiple purchase block-and-tackle devices.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A small single-masted ship with three or more sails. A common rig is a gaff-rigged mainsail, multiple headsails, and, often, a gaff- or square-rigged topsail above.  Sometimes cutters also had an additional square-rigged mainsail when traveling downwind.  The mast was normally set amidships, and two or more headsails were set from the mast to the running bowsprit.&lt;ref name="BlakeLawrence2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Blake|author2=Richard Lawrence|title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&amp;pg=PA46|date=August 2005|publisher=Stackpole |isbn=978-0-8117-3275-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered better than a sloop for light winds; it is also easier to manage, as the sail area is more subdivided.

A lugger is a two-masted vessel, with for each mast a sail plan similar to a gaff rig. The [[lug sail]]s it uses, however, do not have gaffs, that attach directly to its masts.  Instead, the spars are allowed to move forward and aft of the mast and are managed through a series of lines that attach to the ''yards'' and to the corners of the sails.  Each sail may or may not have a boom along its foot.  In Scotland, when constructed with a main [[Lug sail#Types|''dipping'' lug sail]] and a [[mizzen]] [[Lug sail#Types|''standing'' lug sail]], such vessels are known as [[fifie]]s, ''sailing fifies'', or ''herring drifters''; they were often used for herring fishing.

A small ship, fore-and-aft rigged on its two masts, with its mainmast much taller than its mizzen and with or without headsails.  The mizzen mast is located aft of the rudderpost, sometimes directly on the [[transom (nautical)|transom]], and is intended to help provide helm balance.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

}}
A small ship with two masts, both fore-and-aft rigged, with the mizzen located well forward of the rudder post and of only slightly smaller size than the mainmast (if the height of the masts were reversed—the taller in the back and the shorter in the front—it would be considered a schooner).  If square-rigged on her mainmast above the course, it is called a "square topsail ketch".  Historically the mainmast was square-rigged instead of fore-and-aft, but in modern usage only the latter is called a ketch.  The purpose of the mizzen sail in a ketch rig, unlike the mizzen on a yawl rig, is to provide drive to the hull.  A ketch rig allows for shorter sails than a sloop with the same sail area, resulting in a lower center of sail and less overturning moment.  The shorter masts, therefore, reduce the amount of ballast and [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] on the rigging needed to keep the boat upright. Generally the rig is safer and less prone to [[Broach (sailing)|broaching]] or [[capsize]] than a comparable sloop, and has more flexibility in sail plan when reducing sail under strong crosswind conditions—the mainsail can be brought down entirely (not requiring reefing) and the remaining rig will be both balanced on the helm and capable of driving the boat. The ketch is a classic small cargo boat.

}}

A fore-and-aft rig having at least two masts, with a foremast that is usually smaller than the other masts.  Schooners have traditionally been gaff-rigged and in small craft are generally two-masted, however many have been built with [[marconi rig]]s (and even junk rigs) rather than gaffs and in the golden age of sail, vessels were built with as many as seven masts. One of the easiest types to sail, but performs poorly to windward without gaff topsails.  The extra sails and ease of the gaff sails make the rig easier to operate, though not necessarily faster, than a sloop on all points of sail other than up-wind.  Schooners were more popular than sloops prior to the upsurge in recreational boating.  The better performance of the sloop upwind was outweighed for most sailors by the better performance of the schooner at all other, more comfortable, points of sail.  Advances in design and equipment over the last hundred years have diminished the advantages of the schooner rig.  Many schooners sailing today are either reproductions or replicas of famous schooners of old.

==== Topsail schooner ====
{{multiple image
| align=right

| image1=Topsailschoonerdiagram.jpg
| image2=Topsail schooner3.jpg
}}
This type of vessel has two masts, each made of two spars.  The mainmast is rigged exactly like the mainmast of any other schooner (i.e., fore and aft mainsail and gaff rigged topsail) but the foremast, though having the typical schooner's fore and aft rigged mainsail, has above it one or more square-rigged topsails.  The arrangement requires the ship to have a foremast yard (the lowest) from which no sail hangs.  The foremast and all of its sails are comparable to that of a brigantine (see below).  If there are square-rigged topsails on both masts, then it is called a two topsail schooner or double topsail schooner.&lt;ref name="RobinsonDow1922"/&gt;
{{clear}}

====Bilander====
{{main|Bilander}}
{{multiple image
| align=right
| width=100

| image1=Bilander.svg
}}
The bilander is a two-masted vessel, the foremast carrying square rigs on all of its yards and its taller mainmast having a long lateen mainsail yard with corresponding trapezoidal sail and rig inclined at about 45° with square rigs on the yards above that, the lowermost secured at the corners by a crossjack.  The design was popular in the Mediterranean Sea as well as around New England in the first half of the 18th century but was soon surpassed by better designs.  It is considered the forerunner of the brig.&lt;ref name="RobinsonDow1922"/&gt;

====Brig====
{{main|Brig}}
In American parlance, the brig encompasses three classes of ship: the full-rigged brig (often simply called a "brig"), the hermaphrodite brig, and the brigantine.  All American brigs are defined by having exactly two masts that are entirely or partially square-rigged.  The foremast of each is always entirely square-rigged; variations in the taller mainmast are what define the different subtypes &lt;ref name="RobinsonDow1922"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Robinson|author2=George Francis Dow|title=The Sailing Ships of New England, 1607-1907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vEsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=1922|publisher=Marine Research Society|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The definition of a brig, brigantine, etc. has been subject to variations in nation and history, however, with much crossover between the classes).

=====Full-rigged brig=====
{{multiple image
| align=right
| width=100
| direction=vertical
| image1=Brig.png
}}
For the full-rigged brig, the foremast and mainmast each has three spars, all of them square rigged.  In addition, the mainmast has a small gaff-rigged sail mounted behind ("abaft") the mainmast.
{{clear}}

=====Hermaphrodite brig=====

}}
On a hermaphrodite brig, also called a "half brig" and a "schooner brig", the main mast carries no yards: it is made in two spars and carries two sails, a gaff mainsail and gaff topsail, making it half schooner and half brig (hence its name).  If it also carries one or more square-rigged topsails on the mainmast, it is then considered a "jackass brig".&lt;ref name="RobinsonDow1922"/&gt;  Some authors have asserted that this type of sail plan is that of a brigantine.&lt;ref name="Harper2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Harper|title=Ghostly Tales on Land and Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2IEQh7ujkUC&amp;pg=PT57|date=30 November 2010|publisher=F+W Media|isbn=978-1-4463-5004-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=====Brigantine=====
{{main|Brigantine}}
{{multiple image
| align=right
| width=100
| direction=vertical
| image1=Brigantine.png
}}
Like the hermaphrodite brig, a brigantine also has a main (second) mast made in two spars, and its large mainsail is also fore and aft rigged.  However, above this it carries two or three square-rigged yards ''instead'' of a gaff topsail (the hermaphrodite brig retains the gaff topsail), and carries ''no'' square-rigged sail at all on its lowermost yard of its mainmast (the full-rigged brig retains a square-rigged sail in this position, making it very difficult to visually distinguish at a distance from a brigantine).&lt;ref name="RobinsonDow1922"/&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Snow ====
{{main|Snow (ship)}}
{{multiple image
| align=right
| width=100
| direction=vertical
| image1=Snow.png
}}
Although superficially similar in appearance to the brig or brigantine, the snow is a much older three masted design which evolved from the larger fully rigged ship. The foremast and mainmast are both square-rigged, but the fore and aft rigged spanker sail is attached to a small [[trysail]] mast (or in modern times a steel cable) stepped directly behind the mainmast. This "snow-mast" allows the gaff to raised unhindered by the mainmast and higher than the main yard, which in turn also allows the snow to fly a main course without complications.

Three masts or more, square rigged on all except the aftmost mast. Usually three or four-masted, but five-masted barques have been built. Lower-speed than a full-rigged ship, especially downwind, but requiring fewer sailors than a full-rigged ship. Optimum rig for transoceanic voyages. This is a classic [[windjammer]] rig.

A three-masted vessel, square-rigged on the foremast and fore-and-aft rigged on the main and mizzen masts.  Some sailors who have sailed on them{{who|date=February 2011}} say it is a poor-handling compromise between a barque and a ship, though having more speed than a barque or schooner.

}}
Three or more masts, square-rigged on all, usually with stay-sails between masts. Occasionally the mizzen mast of a ship-rigged ship would have a fore-and-aft sail as its course sail (top image), but in order to qualify as a "fully rigged ship" the vessel would need to have a square-rigged topsail mounted above this (thus distinguishing the fully rigged ship from, say, a barque—see above).  The classic ''ship rig'' (top)  originally had exactly three masts, but later, four- and five-masted ships were also built (bottom).  The classic sailing warship—the [[ship of the line]]—was ''full rigged'' in this way, because of high performance on all points of wind.  In particular, studding sails or topping sails could be easily added for light airs or high speeds.  Square rigs have twice the sail area per mast height compared to triangular sails, and when tuned, more exactly approximate a multiple airfoil, and therefore apply larger forces to the hull.  Windage (drag) is more than triangular rigs, which have smaller tip vortices.  Therefore, historic ships could not point as far upwind as high-performance sloops.  However, contemporary Marconi rigs (sloops, etc.) were limited in size by the strength of available materials, especially their sails and the running rigging to set them.  Ships were not so limited, because their sails were smaller relative to the hull, distributing forces more evenly, over more masts.  Therefore, due to their much larger, longer waterline length, ships had much faster hull speeds and could run down or away from any contemporary sloop or other Marconi rig, even if it pointed more upwind. Schooners have a heavier rig and require more ballast than ships, which increases the wetted area and hull friction of a large schooner compared to a ship of the same size.  The result is that a ship can run down or away from a schooner of the same hull length.  Ships were larger than brigs and brigantines, and faster than barques or barquentines, but required more sailors. Also called "ship-rigged".

By way of his voyages in the 1770s, [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term ''Southern Ocean'' has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/the-new-fifth-ocean-1435095 The Southern Ocean is the Fifth and Newest World Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating [[Antarctic Convergence]] as the natural boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, Stephen J.; ''The Ice: A Journey to Antarctica''. University of Washington Press, 1986. (A study of Antarctica's exploration, earth-sciences, icescape, esthetics, literature, and geopolitics)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and use==
[[File:Iceedgekils.gif|thumb|512px|center|Pulsating pack-ice around Antarctica reflects the various definitions of the Southern Ocean]]

Borders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the [[International Hydrographic Bureau]] (IHB), the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'', the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60°S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the [[Sea of Japan naming dispute|naming dispute]] over the [[Sea of Japan]].

=== 1928 delineation ===
[[File:Limit of Oceans and Seas - 1st Edition - 1928.jpg|thumb|220px|right|'''1928 First Edition''' of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' with original IHO delineation of Southern Ocean abutting land-masses.&lt;ref name=NAOO1928/&gt;]]
In the 1928 first edition of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'', the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits:  Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and [[Broughton Island, New Zealand]] to the north.

The detailed land-limits used were from [[Cape Horn]] in South America eastwards to [[Cape Agulhas]] in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to [[Cape Leeuwin]], [[Western Australia]]. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to [[Cape Otway]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], then southwards across [[Bass Strait]] to [[Cape Wickham]], [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]], along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to [[Cape Grim]], [[Tasmania]]. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the
[[South East Cape]] and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.&lt;ref name=NAOO1928&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/map00340.htm |title=Map accompanying first edition of IHO Publication Limits of Oceans and Seas, Special Publication 23 |website=NOAA Photo Library |publisher= [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Limit of Oceans and Seas - 2nd Edition - 1st July 1937.jpg|thumb|220px|right|'''1937 Second Edition''' of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' showing IHO's pre-1953 delineation of Southern Ocean moved southwards.&lt;ref name=NAOO1937/&gt;]]

=== 1937 delineation ===
The northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''. From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses.

In the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40°S between [[Cape Agulhas]] in Africa (long. 20°E) and [[Cape Leeuwin]] in Western Australia (long. 115°E), and extended to latitude 55°S between [[Auckland Island]] of New Zealand (165 or 166°E east) and [[Cape Horn]] in South America (67°W).&lt;!-- delineators observed from 1937 map and not obtained from written IHO description with 1937 edition, which should be sought and checked too --&gt;&lt;ref name=NAOO1937&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/map00341.htm |title=Map accompanying second edition of IHO Publication Limits of Oceans and Seas, Special Publication 23 |website=NOAA Photo Library |publisher= [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is discussed in more detail below (see section on '2002 delineation'), prior to the 2002 (draft) edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The [[Great Australian Bight]] was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters (as designated in 1928) but was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans (for example to compare surface areas) it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison.

=== 1953 delineation ===
The Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition and a note in the publication read:
{{quote|
The Antarctic or Southern Ocean has been omitted from this publication as the majority of opinions received since the issue of the 2nd Edition in 1937 are to the effect that there exists no real justification for applying the term Ocean to this body of water, the northern limits of which are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change. The limits of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans have therefore been extended South to the Antarctic Continent.

Hydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits (Great Britain uses Latitude of 55 South.)
}}

Instead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of [[South East Cape]], and the southern limits of the [[Great Australian Bight]] and the [[Tasman Sea]] were moved northwards.&lt;ref name="IHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pacific Ocean - en IHO.png|thumb|right|250px|The '''Pacific Ocean''' as example of terminology concerning seas: the area inside the black line includes the seas included in the Pacific Ocean prior to 2002 and the darker blue areas are its informal current borders, following the recreation of the Southern Ocean and the reinclusion of marginal seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Pacific Ocean |work= [[The World Factbook]] |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/zn.html |accessdate= 27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== 2002 (draft) delineation ===
The IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except [[Argentina]] agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name ''Southern Ocean'' won 18 votes, beating the alternative ''Antarctic Ocean''. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at [[60th parallel south|60°S]] (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly [[50th parallel south|50°S]], but a few for as far north as [[35th parallel south|35°S]].

A draft fourth edition of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the "2000 edition" as it summarized the progress to 2000).&lt;ref name=IHO2002&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/S-23WG/S-23WG_Misc/Draft_2002/Draft_2002.htm| title= IHO Publication S-23, ''Limits of Oceans and Seas, Draft 4th Edition'' |year=2002 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organisation|accessdate=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world – primarily the [[Sea of Japan naming dispute]] – and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eastsea.khoa.go.kr/eng/open_content/iho/magazine.asp |title=IHO Special Publication 23 |publisher=Korean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201213815/http://eastsea.khoa.go.kr/eng/open_content/iho/magazine.asp |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/21/1071941610556.html|title=Canberra all at sea over position of Southern Ocean|last=Darby|first=Andrew|date=22 December 2003|publisher=The Age|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded.

Despite this, the 4th edition definition has partial ''de facto'' usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[World Factbook]] uses "Southern Ocean" but none of the other new sea names within the "Southern Ocean" such as "[[Cosmonauts Sea]]") and [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]],&lt;ref name=CIAintro/&gt;&lt;ref name=merriamwebster/&gt;&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic/&gt; scientists and nations – and even by some within the IHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/rhc/HCA/HCA3/HCA3-6.3B_Report_on_IBCSO.pdf|last=Schenke|first=Hans Werner|title=Proposal for the preparation of a new International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean| conference= Third HCA Meeting, 8–10 September 2003| booktitle=IHO International Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (HCA)|conferenceurl=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/rhc/HCA/HCA3/HCA3docs_list.htm |date=September 2003 |location=Monaco | publisher=[[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO)|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the [[55th parallel south|55°S parallel]] for example.&lt;ref name="IHO"/&gt; Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the [[Antarctic Convergence]], yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.&lt;ref name=Britannica-Indian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica-Southern&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Ocean|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27026/Southern-Ocean|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources, such as the [[National Geographic Society]], show the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic/&gt;

In Australia, [[Cartography|cartographical]] authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60°s elsewhere.&lt;ref name=ahs&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/factsheets/WFS_Names_and_Limits_of_Oceans_and_Seas_Around_Australia.pdf|title=AHS – AA609582|publisher=The Australian Hydrographic Service|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=30 May 2013|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal maps of [[Tasmania]] and [[South Australia]] label the sea areas as ''Southern Ocean'',&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{citation|url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/webapps/jsp/charts/charts.jsp?chart=Aus343&amp;subchart=0 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090526042934/http://www.hydro.gov.au/webapps/jsp/charts/charts.jsp?chart=Aus343&amp;subchart=0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2009 |title=Chart Aus343: Australia South Coast – South Australia – Whidbey Isles to Cape Du Couedic |publisher=Australian Hydrographic Service |date=29 June 1990 |accessdate=11 October 2010 }}, {{citation|url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/webapps/jsp/charts/charts.jsp?chart=Aus792&amp;subchart=0 |title=Chart Aus792: Australia – Tasmania – Trial Harbour to Low Rocky Point |publisher=Australian Hydrographic Service |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=11 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cape Leeuwin]] in [[Western Australia]] is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/00104%20Cape%20Leeuwin%28P-AD%29.PDF |title=Assessment Documentation for Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse |page=11 |work=Register of Heritage Places |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825214915/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/00104%20Cape%20Leeuwin%28P-AD%29.PDF |archivedate=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A radical shift from past IHO practices (1928–1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA ''World Fact Book'') which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the '''Pacific Ocean''' in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the [[Tasman Sea]] between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.

The new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by [[Drake Passage]] which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the [[Scotia Sea]], which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.

=== Unknown southern land ===
{{See also|Terra Australis}}
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|right|220px|1564 ''Typus Orbis Terrarum'', a map by [[Abraham Ortelius]] showed the imagined link between the proposed continent of Antarctica and [[South America]].]]
Exploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a ''Terra Australis'' – a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa – which had existed since the times of [[Ptolemy]]. The doubling of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1487 by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who passed through the [[Strait of Magellan]] in 1520, assumed that the islands of [[Tierra del Fuego]] to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, [[Abraham Ortelius]] published his first map, ''Typus Orbis Terrarum'', an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the ''[[Regio Patalis]]'' with ''[[Locach]]'' as a northward extension of the ''[[Terra Australis]]'', reaching as far as [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Joost Depuydt, ‘[[Ortelius, Abraham]] (1527–1598)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barber, "Ortelius' great world map", National Library of Australia, ''Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

European geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the ''Terra Australis Incognita'' ("Unknown Southern Land"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.

The [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[Gabriel de Castilla]], who claimed having sighted "snow-covered mountains" beyond the [[64th parallel south|64° S]] in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time.

In 1606, [[Pedro Fernández de Quirós]] took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the [[New Hebrides]]) and those he would discover "even to the Pole".

[[Francis Drake]], like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob Le Maire]] discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it [[Cape Horn]] in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, [[Abel Tasman]] showed that even [[New Holland (Australia)]] was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent.

The visit to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] by [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] i.e. in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, Alexander.

[[James Cook]] was aware of la Roché's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, James. (1777).

[[Edmond Halley]]'s voyage in [[HMS Paramour (1694)|HMS ''Paramour'']] for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in [[52nd parallel south|52°&amp;nbsp;S]] in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140&amp;nbsp;mi off the north coast of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]]) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier]] to discover the "South Land" – described by a half legendary "[[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville|sieur de Gonneyville]]" – resulted in the discovery of [[Bouvet Island]] in 54°10′&amp;nbsp;S, and in the navigation of [[48th meridian west|48° of longitude]] of ice-cumbered sea nearly in [[55th parallel south|55°&amp;nbsp;S]] in 1730  .

In 1771, [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec|Yves Joseph Kerguelen]] sailed from [[France]] with instructions to proceed south from [[Mauritius]] in search of "a very large continent."  He lighted upon a land in [[50th parallel south|50°&amp;nbsp;S]] which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which [[Kerguelen Islands|was ultimately named after him]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |title=Polar Regions |url=http://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/bri.html |volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy''.]]
The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of [[Alexander Dalrymple]], the brilliant and erratic [[Hydrography|hydrographer]] who was nominated by the [[Royal Society]] to command the [[Transit of Venus]] expedition to [[Tahiti]] in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain [[James Cook]]. Sailing in 1772 with ''Resolution'', a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and ''Adventure'' of 336 tons under Captain [[Tobias Furneaux]], Cook first searched in vain for [[Bouvet Island]], then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in [[58th parallel south|latitude 58°&amp;nbsp;S]], and then 30° eastward for the most part south of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]], a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the [[Antarctic Circle]] was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached {{nowrap|67° 15' S}} by {{nowrap|39° 35' E}}, where their course was stopped by ice.

Cook then turned northward to look for [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], of the discovery of which he had received news at [[Cape Town]], but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10° too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in {{nowrap|61° 52′ S}} by 95°&amp;nbsp;E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]] to [[147th meridian east|147°&amp;nbsp;E]]. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the ''Adventure'', and reached [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]] by [[177th meridian west|177°&amp;nbsp;W]], whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching {{nowrap|67° 31′ S}} to stand north again in [[135th meridian west|135°&amp;nbsp;W]].

A long detour to {{nowrap|47° 50′ S}} served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at {{nowrap|109° 30′ W}} before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at {{nowrap|71° 10′ S}} by {{nowrap|106° 54′ W}}. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between [[53rd parallel south|53°]] and [[57th parallel south|57°&amp;nbsp;S]] to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered [[Anthony de la Roché#Maps showing la Roché's discovery|Roché Island]] renaming it [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|Isle of Georgia]], and discovered the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] (named ''Sandwich Land'' by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between [[55th parallel south|55°]] and [[60th parallel south|60°]]. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the [[60th parallel south|60th parallel]], and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Voyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.

In a voyage from 1822 to 1824, [[James Weddell]] commanded the 160-ton [[brig]] ''Jane'', accompanied by his second ship ''Beaufoy'' captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where [[Seal hunting|sealing]] proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached [[latitude]] 74°15'&amp;nbsp;S and [[longitude]] 34°16'45″&amp;nbsp;W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to [[Coats Land|Coat's Land]] (to the east of the [[Weddell Sea]]) but Weddell decided to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== First sighting of land ===
[[File:Admiral Faddey Faddeyevich Bellingshausen.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Admiral von Bellingshausen]]
{{See also|William Smith (mariner)|Fabian von Bellingshausen}}

The first land south of the [[60th parallel south|parallel 60° south latitude]] was discovered by the [[English people|Englishman]] [[William Smith (mariner)|William Smith]], who sighted [[Livingston Island]] on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the [[South Shetland Islands|South Shetlands]] archipelago, landed on [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]], and claimed the new territories for Britain.

In the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship ''[[San Telmo (ship)|San Telmo]]'' sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of [[Livingston Island]] ([[South Shetland Islands|South Shetlands]]). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands.

The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf |title=Antarctica – past and present |author=U.S. Antarctic Program External Panel |publisher=[[National Science Foundation|NSF]] |accessdate=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html |title=Nathaniel Brown Palmer |author=Guy G.

It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships ''Vostok'' and ''Mirny'', reached a point within {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from [[Princess Martha Coast]] and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at {{coord|69|21|28|S|2|14|50|W|}}&lt;ref name=tammiksaar&gt;{{cite news|author=Erki Tammiksaar|title=Punane Bellingshausen|newspaper=[[Postimees]].

On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted [[Trinity Peninsula]], the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered [[Peter I Island]] and [[Alexander Island|Alexander I Island]], the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the [[sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war]] {{USS |Vincennes |1826 | 6}} and {{USS |Peacock |1828 |6 }}, the [[brig]] {{USS |Porpoise |1836| 6}}, the [[full-rigged ship]] [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], and two [[schooner]]s [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']] and {{USS |Flying Fish |1838 |6}}. They sailed into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it maintains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] are named after two ships from his expedition: [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and ''[[HMS Terror (1813)|Terror]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm|title=South-Pole – Exploring Antarctica|work=South-Pole.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214042438/http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm|archivedate=14 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endurance trapped in pack ice.jpg|thumb|220px|Frank Hurley, ''As time wore on it became more and more evident that the ship was doomed'' (The [[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]] trapped in pack ice), [[National Library of Australia]].]]
The [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914, led by [[Ernest Shackleton]], set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to [[Elephant Island]]. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called [[Voyage of the James Caird|''James Caird'']], and then trekked over [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] to raise the alarm at the whaling station [[Grytviken]].

In 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called [[Operation Highjump|Operation ''Highjump'']]. Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given.

Captain [[Finn Ronne]], Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947–1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923941,00.html | work=Time | title=Milestones, 28 January 1980 | date=28 January 1980 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf|Ronne Ice Shelf]], named by Ronne after his wife [[Jackie Ronne|Edith "Jackie" Ronne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://traverse.npolar.no/historical-traverses/historic-names Historic Names – Norwegian-American Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica].

The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits [[military activity in the Antarctic]] to the support of scientific research.

The first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander [[David Henry Lewis]], in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop ''Ice Bird''.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands}}
The Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and [[South America]] moved apart, opening the [[Drake Passage]], roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

With a northern limit at [[60th parallel south|60°S]], the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.

One reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean.

The Southern Ocean has typical depths of between {{convert|4,000|and|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of {{convert|7,236|m|ft|abbr=on}} occurs at the southern end of the [[South Sandwich Trench]], at 60°00'S, 024°W. The [[Antarctic continental shelf]] appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}, compared to a global mean of {{convert|133|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[Equinox]] to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of {{convert|2.6|e6km2|e6sqmi}} in March to about {{convert|18.8|e6km2|e6sqmi}} in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.

=== Sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean ===
Sub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as "seas", "straits", "bays", "channels", and "gulfs". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''. In clockwise order these include (with IHO sub-division chartlet numbers in parenthesis) the [[Weddell Sea]] (10.1), the [[Lazarev Sea]] (10.2), the [[Riiser-Larsen Sea]] (10.3), the [[Cosmonauts Sea]] (10.4), the [[Cooperation Sea]] (10.5), the [[Davis Sea]] (10.6), [[Davis Sea|Tryoshnikova Gulf]] (10.6.1), the [[Mawson Sea]] (10.7), the [[D'Urville Sea|Dumont D'Urville Sea]] (10.8), the [[Somov Sea]] (10.9), the [[Ross Sea]] (10.10), [[McMurdo Sound]] (10.10.1), the [[Amundsen Sea]] (10.11), the [[Bellingshausen Sea]] (10.12), part of the [[Drake Passage]] (10.13), [[Bransfield Strait]] (10.14) and part of the [[Scotia Sea]] (4.2).&lt;ref name=IHO2002/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Reservation by Norway: Norway recognizes the name [[King Haakon VII Sea|Kong Håkon VII Hav]] which covers the sea area adjacent to [[Dronning Maud Land]] and stretching from 20°W to 45°E.&lt;ref name=IHO2002/&gt;|group="note"}}{{#tag:ref|The [[Drake Passage]] is situated between the southern and eastern extremities of [[South America]] and the [[South Shetland Islands]], lying north of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' [[National Geographic Society]] and the 2014 12th edition of the British [[Times Atlas of the World]], but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubricon.com/imgbyid.asp?ii=1&amp;iid=219112465]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gturs.com/Maps/pic/ant_fiz.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910060624/http://gturs.com/Maps/pic/ant_fiz.jpg |archivedate=10 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural resources ===
[[File:Manganknolle.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Manganese nodule]]
The Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] fields on the [[continental margin]]. [[Placer deposit]]s, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=CIAgeo/&gt;

[[Manganese nodules]] are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock [[concretion]]s on the [[sea]] bottom formed of concentric layers of [[iron]] and [[manganese]] [[hydroxide]]s around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by [[crystallization]]. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=CIAgeo/&gt;

The [[iceberg]]s that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough [[fresh water]] to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water from Icebergs|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson12/l12la1.html|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|work=Ocean Explorer|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural hazards ===
[[Iceberg]]s can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances.

Sailors know latitudes from [[40th parallel south|40]] to [[70th parallel south|70 degrees south]] as the "[[Roaring Forties]]", "Furious Fifties" and "Shrieking Sixties" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.

== Physical oceanography ==
[[File:Antarctic Circumpolar Current.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the strongest current system in the world oceans, linking the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific basins.]]

=== Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Antarctic Convergence ===
The [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] moves perpetually eastward –  chasing and joining itself, and at {{convert|21,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length –  it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting {{convert|130|e6m3/s|e9cuft/s}} of water – 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers.

Several processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of [[water mass]]es not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. One of these is the [[Antarctic Bottom Water]], a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under [[sea ice]].

Associated with the Circumpolar Current is the [[Antarctic Convergence]] encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the [[subantarctic]], Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and [[upwelling]] create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of [[phytoplankton]] with associated copepods and [[Antarctic krill]], and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:5:0::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:488|title=Antarctica Detail |accessdate=18 January 2014 |date=18 October 2000 |work=U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=CIAgeo/&gt;

[[File:Antarctic bottom water.svg|thumb|250px|left|{{center|Upwelling in the Southern Ocean}}]]

=== Upwelling ===
Large-scale [[upwelling]] is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around [[Antarctica]], driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between [[South America]] and the tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and [[Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System|southeast Australia]], all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.

Some models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.

=== Ross and Weddell Gyres ===
The [[Ross Gyre]] and [[Weddell Gyre]] are two [[Oceanic gyre|gyres]] that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the [[Ross Sea]] and [[Weddell Sea]] respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] and the [[Antarctic Continental Shelf]].

[[Sea ice]] has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Michael L. |first=Van Woert |display-authors=etal |editor-last=DiTullio |editor-first=Giacomo R. |editor2-last=Dunbar |editor2-first=Robert B. |contribution=The Ross Sea Circulation During the 1990s |title=Biogeochemistry of the Ross Sea |publisher=American Geophysical Union |year=2003 |location= |pages=4–34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4o7i8yJeEPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-87590-972-8}} p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that [[global warming]] has resulted in some decrease of the [[salinity]] of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Florindo |first=Fabio |authorlink= |last2=Siegert |first2=Martin J. |author2-link= |title=Antarctic Climate Evolution |publisher=Elsevier |year=2008 |location= |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUu-x70CZEcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-444-52847-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Coriolis effect]] acting to the left in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the resulting [[Ekman transport]] away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.

== Climate ==
Sea temperatures vary from about −2 to 10&amp;nbsp;°C (28 to 50&amp;nbsp;°F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and [[Pelagic zone|open ocean]]. The ocean-area from about [[40th parallel south|latitude 40 south]] to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2059.html |title=The World Fact Book: Climate |publisher=U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date= |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter the ocean freezes outward to [[65th parallel south|65 degrees south latitude]] in the Pacific sector and [[55th parallel south|55 degrees south latitude]] in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.

=== Animals ===
A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[Killer whale|orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregates in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[benthic]] communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in {{convert|1|m2|sqft|1}}. As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. [[Deep-sea gigantism]] is common among these animals.&lt;ref name="AADseabed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/seabed-benthic-communities|title=Seabed (benthic) communities |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154433/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/seabed-benthic-communities |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, [[sea cucumber]]s and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution – fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport egg and larva stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish ===
There are relatively few fish species in few [[Family (biology)|families]] in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the [[snailfish]] (Liparidae), followed by the [[cod icefish]] (Nototheniidae)&lt;ref name=Eastman1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eastman, J.T.|author2=M.J.

Together the snailfish, eelpouts and [[notothenioid]]s (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost {{frac|9|10}} of the more than 320 described fish species of the Southern Ocean (tens of [[undescribed species]] also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish).&lt;ref name=Eastman2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eastman, J.T.|year=2005|title=The nature of the diversity of Antarctic fishes | journal=Polar Biol|volume=28|pages=93–107|doi=10.1007/s00300-004-0667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Ocean snailfish are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also occur in shallower waters.&lt;ref name=Eastman1998/&gt;

==== Icefish ====
[[File:Icefishuk.jpg|thumb|220px|Fish of the [[Notothenioidei]] suborder, such as this young icefish, are mostly restricted to the Antarctic and Subantarctic]]

Cod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the [[Notothenioidei]] suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with [[antifreeze protein]]s in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AADfish"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheng2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheng, C.-H.C.|author2=L.

The [[crocodile icefish]] (family Channichthyidae), also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack [[hemoglobin]] in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the [[mackerel icefish]] (''Champsocephalus gunnari''), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than {{convert|400|m|ft|0}} deep, but was [[overfished]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the [[water column]] eating plankton and smaller fish.&lt;ref name="AADfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/fish|title=Fish |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=5 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154530/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/fish |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two species from the genus ''[[Dissostichus]]'', the [[Antarctic toothfish]] (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') and the [[Patagonian toothfish]] (''Dissostichus eleginoides''). These two species live on the seafloor {{convert|100|-|3000|m|ft|0}} deep, and can grow to around {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long weighing up to {{convert|100|kg|lb|0}}, living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.&lt;ref name="AADfish"/&gt;

Another abundant fish group is the genus ''[[Notothenia]]'', which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.&lt;ref name="AADfish"/&gt;

An unusual species of icefish is the [[Antarctic silverfish]] (''Pleuragramma antarcticum''), which is the only truly [[pelagic]] fish in the waters near Antarctica.&lt;ref name=FishBase&gt;{{FishBase species|genus = Pleuragramma|species = antarcticum|month = December|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of mammals of Antarctica}}

Seven [[pinniped]] species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the [[elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), can reach up to {{convert|4000|kg|lb|0}}, while females of the smallest, the [[Antarctic fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus gazella''), reach only {{convert|150|kg|lb|0}}. These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. [[Crabeater seal]]s (''Lobodon carcinophagus'') and [[Weddell seal]]s (''Leptonychotes weddellii'') form breeding colonies, whereas [[leopard seal]]s (''Hydrurga leptonyx'') and [[Ross seal]]s (''Ommatophoca rossii'') live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.&lt;ref name="AADseals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/seals-and-sea-lions|title=Seals and sea lions |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154452/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/seals-and-sea-lions |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Aquatic animals|aquatic]] [[mollusc]]s are present in Antarctica. [[Bivalves]] such as ''[[Adamussium colbecki]]'' move around on the seafloor, while others such as ''[[Laternula elliptica]]'' live in burrows [[Filter feeder|filtering]] the water above.&lt;ref name="AADseabed"/&gt; There are around 70 [[cephalopod]] species in the Southern Ocean,&lt;ref name="AADsquid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/squid |title=Squid |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154439/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/squid |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest of which is the [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni''), which at up to {{convert|14|m|ft|0}} is among the largest invertebrate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/28451 |title=Amazing specimen of world's largest squid in NZ |author=Anderton, J. | publisher=beehive.govt.nz |accessdate=27 December 2017 |date=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Squid]] makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as [[grey-headed albatross]]es and [[sperm whale]]s, and the [[Moroteuthis ingens|warty squid]] (''Moroteuthis ingens'') is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.&lt;ref name="AADsquid"/&gt;

The [[sea urchin]] genus ''Abatus'' burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it.&lt;ref name="AADseabed"/&gt; Two species of [[salp]]s are common in Antarctic waters, ''Salpa thompsoni'' and ''Ihlea racovitzai''. ''Salpa thompsoni'' is found in ice-free areas, whereas ''Ihlea racovitzai'' is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.&lt;ref name="AADsalps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/salps |title=Salps |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154345/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/salps |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctic [[sponge]]s are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.&lt;ref name="AADsponges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/sponges |title=Sponges |author=Australian Antarctic Division |publisher=Government of Australia |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319154351/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/sponges |archivedate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment ==
=== Current issues ===
Increased solar [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] resulting from the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] has reduced marine primary productivity ([[phytoplankton]]) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the [[DNA]] of some fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith RC, Prézelin BB, Baker KS, Bidigare RR, Boucher NP, Coley T, Karentz D, MacIntyre S, Matlick HA, Menzies D |display-authors=etal |year=1992 |title=Ozone depletion: ultraviolet radiation and phytoplankton biology in antarctic waters. |journal=Science|volume=255 |issue=5047 |pmid=1546292 |issn=0036-8075 |pages=952–59 |doi=10.1126/science.1546292|bibcode=1992Sci...255..952S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more [[Patagonian toothfish]] than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.

=== International agreements ===
All international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:

* The ''[[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]'' of the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) prohibits commercial [[whaling]] south of [[40th parallel south|40 degrees south]] (south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]] between [[50th meridian west|50 degrees]] and [[130th meridian west|130 degrees west]]). [[Japan]] regularly does not recognize this provision, because the sanctuary violates IWC charter. Since the scope of the sanctuary is limited to commercial whaling, in regard to its whaling permit and whaling for scientific research, a Japanese fleet carried out an annual whale-hunt in the region. On 31 March 2014, the [[International Court of Justice]] ruled that Japan's whaling program, which Japan has long claimed is for scientific purposes, was a cloak for commercial whaling, and no further permits would be granted.
* ''[[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]]'' is part of the ''[[Antarctic Treaty System]]''. It was signed at the conclusion of a multilateral conference in London on 11 February 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Antarctic Challenge: Conflicting Interests, Cooperation, Environmental Protection, Economic Development'' Proceedings of an Interdisciplinary Symposium, 22–24 June 1983;
Volume 88 of Veröffentlichungen des Instituts für Internationales Recht an der Universität Kiel (Rüdiger Wolfrum and Klaus Bockslaff, eds.), Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1984, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]]'' (CCAMLR)  is part of the ''[[Antarctic Treaty System]]''. The Convention was entered into force on 7 April 1982 and has its goal is to preserve [[marine life]] and environmental integrity in and near [[Antarctica]]. It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in [[krill]] catches in the Southern Ocean could have a serious impact on populations of other marine life which are dependent upon krill for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ccamlr.org/ |title=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  |work=ccamlr.org |year=2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of [[mineral]] resources south of the fluctuating [[Antarctic Convergence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2033.html |title=The World Fact Book: Environment – International Agreements |publisher=U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date= |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The [[Antarctic Treaty]] covers the portion of the globe south of [[60th parallel south|sixty degrees south]],&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp The Antarctic Treaty], article 6
&lt;/ref&gt;
it prohibits new claims to Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp The Antarctic Treaty], article 4, clause 2
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources'' applies to the area south of 60° South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/e-pt1.pdf |title=Text of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|publisher=Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources |work=ccamlr.org |year=1972 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
Between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 [[tonne]]s, of which 85% consisted of [[krill]] and 14% of [[Patagonian toothfish]]. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998–99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.

== Ports and harbors ==
[[File:USNS Southern Cross at the ice pier in 1983.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Severe cracks in an [[ice pier]] in use for four seasons at [[McMurdo Station]] slowed cargo operations in 1983 and proved a safety hazard.]]

Major operational ports include: [[Rothera Research Station|Rothera Station]], [[Palmer Station]], [[Villa Las Estrellas]], [[Esperanza Base]], [[Mawson Station]], [[McMurdo Station]], and offshore anchorages in Antarctica.

Few ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require [[icebreaker]] escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]] are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.

The Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at {{coord|77|50|S|166|40|E|}}. [[Winter Quarters Bay]] forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of [[Ross Island]] where a floating [[ice pier]] makes port operations possible in summer. [[Operation Deep Freeze]] personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.&lt;ref name=Unique&gt;
[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/2005-2006/Documents/01-08-2006_antarcticsun.pdf#page=3 "Unique ice pier provides harbor for ships,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630113555/http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/2005-2006/Documents/01-08-2006_antarcticsun.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }} Antarctic Sun. 8 January 2006; McMurdo Station, Antarctica.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the [[Great Australian Bight]] is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between [[Cape Leeuwin]] and [[Cape Otway]] on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of [[Tasmania]] would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], [[Thevenard, South Australia|Thevenard]], [[Port Lincoln]], [[Whyalla]], [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], [[Port Adelaide]], [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]], [[Warrnambool]], and [[Macquarie Harbour]].

[[Yacht race]]s have been held in the Southern Ocean, such as the [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Velux 5 Oceans Race]], [[Vendée Globe]], [[Jules Verne Trophy]] and [[Global Challenge]].

The '''Taurus Mountains''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Toros Dağları'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Տաւրոսեան լեռներ, [[Ancient Greek]]: Ὄρη Ταύρου) are a [[mountain range|mountain complex]] in southern [[Turkey]], separating the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean coastal region]] of southern Turkey from the central [[Anatolia#Anatolian plateau|Anatolian Plateau]]. The system extends along a curve from [[Lake Eğirdir]] in the west to the upper reaches of the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers in the east. It is a part of the [[Alpide belt]] in [[Eurasia]].

The Taurus mountains are divided into three chains from west to east as follows;
*'''Western Taurus''' (Batı Toroslar)
** Akdağlar, the Bey Mountains, Katrancık Mountain, Geyik Mountain
*'''Central Taurus''' (Orta Toroslar)
** Akçalı Mountains, [[Bolkar Mountains]], [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]], [[Tahtalı Mountains]], Aladaglar Mountain
*'''Southeastern Taurus''' (Güneydoğu Toroslar)
** Nurhak Mountains, Malatya Mountains, Maden Mountains, Genç Mountains, Bitlis Mountains

==History==
[[Image:Asia minor-Shepherd 1923 Syria.jpg|thumb|right|Amanus Mts. near the [[Gulf of İskenderun|Gulf of Issus]] and [[Antioch]]]]

===Pre-history to early Roman period===
The bull was commonly the symbol and depiction of ancient Near Eastern storm gods, hence [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the bull, and hence the name of the mountains. The mountains are a place of many ancient storm-god temples.&lt;ref&gt;Ravinell, Alberto and Green, Whitney ''The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East'', p.126. {{ISBN|1-57506-069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torrential thunderstorms in these mountains were deemed by the ancient Syrians to be the work of the storm-god Adad to make the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers rise and flood and thereby fertilise their land.&lt;ref&gt;Saggs, H.W.F. ''The greatness that was Babylon: a survey of the ancient civilization of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley'', Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 2nd Revised edition, 1988, p.380. {{ISBN|0283996234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hurrians]], probably originators of the various [[Storm-god|storm-gods]] of the ancient Near East, were a people whom modern scholars place in the Taurus Mountains at their probable earliest origins.

A [[Bronze Age]] archaeological site, where early evidence of [[tin]] [[mining]] was found, is at [[Kestel]].&lt;ref&gt;Yener, K.A. (2000) ''The Domestication of Metals: The Rise of Complex Metal Industries in Anatolia'' Brill, Leiden, {{ISBN|90-04-11864-0}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The pass known in antiquity as the [[Cilician Gates]] crosses the range north of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].

The Amanus range in southern Turkey is where the Taurus Mountains are pushed up as three tectonic plates come together. The Amanus is a natural frontier: west is Cilicia, east is Syria. There are several passes, like the [[Amanian Gate|Amanian Gate (Bahçe Pass)]], which are of great strategical importance. In 333 BCE at the [[Battle of Issus]], Alexander the Great defeated Darius III Codomannus on the foothills along the coast between these two passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amanus Mountains|url=http://www.livius.org/place/amanus-mountains/|website=Livius - Places|publisher=Livius.org - [[Jona Lendering]]|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Temple period, Jewish authors seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the [[Promised Land]], began to construe [[Mount Hor]] as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bechard|first=Dean Philip|title=Paul Outside the Walls: A Study of Luke's Socio-geographical Universalism in Acts 14:8-20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwoLOauyDcUC&amp;pg=PA203|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=978-88-7653-143-9|pages=203–205|quote=In the Second Temple period, when Jewish authors were seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the Land, it became customary to construe “Mount Hor” of Num 34:7 as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain (Bechard 2000, p. 205, note 98.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Roman period to present ===
During [[World War I]], the German and Turkish railway system through the Taurus Mountains proved to be a major strategic objective of the Allies. This region was specifically mentioned as a strategically controlled objective slated for surrender to the Allies in the [[Armistice]], which ended hostilities against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E0DD1339E13ABC4E52DFB4678383609EDE Price, Ward (16 December 1918) "Danger in Taurus Tunnels" ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
In the Aladaglar and Bolkar mountains, [[limestone]] has eroded to form [[karst]]ic landscapes of [[waterfall]]s, [[underground river]]s, and some of the largest [[cave]]s of [[Asia]]. The [[Manavgat River]] originates on the southern slopes of the Beydaglari range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.ipcri.org/watconf/papers/ibrahim.pdf|title=Manavgat River Water as a Limited but Alternative Water Resource for Domestic Use in Middle East|publisher=|accessdate=2008-02-16|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227021417/http://www.ipcri.org/watconf/papers/ibrahim.pdf|archivedate=2008-02-27|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
In addition to hiking and mountain climbing,&lt;ref name="AAT"/&gt; there are two [[ski resort]]s on the mountain range, one at [[Davras]] about {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the two nearest towns of [[Egirdir]] and [[Isparta]], the second is [[Saklıkent]] {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city of [[Antalya]].

==Western Taurus==
West Taurus and Taurus Mountains form an arc around the [[Gulf of Antalya]]. The East [[Taşeli Plateau]] and [[Goksu River]] divide it from the Central Taurus Mountains. It has many peaks rising above {{convert|3,000|–|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8329">[[File:Bor District and Zaječar District (Timočka Krajina).jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Timočka Krajina, in [[central Serbia]].]]

'''Timočka krajina''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Тимочка kрајина}}, "Timok [[Krajina]]"; Romanian, "Timok Valley") is a [[geographical region]] in east-central [[Serbia]] around the [[Timok River]]. Its name means "Timok [[Frontier]]". Timočka krajina corresponds to parts of two Serbian districts ([[Bor District|Bor]] and [[Zaječar District|Zaječar]]), with a total 2002 census population of 284,112.

==Name==
The toponym is derived from the [[hydronym]] ''Timok'' and ''[[krajina]]'' ("frontier, [[March (territorial entity)|march]]"), named such due to its location and history as a borderland. It was introduced in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Interwar period]] as denoting the Timok confluence with the [[Negotinska Krajina]] and [[Ključ (region)|Ključ]].{{sfn|Živković|2014|p=409}} The term has no historical or geographical basis.{{sfn|Živković|2014|p=409}} In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the term "Timoc Valley" ({{lang|ro|Valea Timocului}}) is used for the area inhabited by the Romanian-speaking [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cristea Sandu Timoc|title=Povești populare românești|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5W2OzPFw0oC&amp;pg=PR19|year=1988|publisher=Editura Minerva|pages=19–|id=GGKEY:AYQZJLRSB9S|quote=&lt;!--românovlahilor din valea Timocului--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region was named sometimes Podunavia in Medieval times&lt;ref&gt; Coman Marian, Putere și teritoriu.

==Geography==
Timočka Krajina roughly corresponds to the [[Bor District|Bor]] and [[Zaječar District|Zaječar]] districts of Serbia. It includes seven [[municipality|municipalities]] and one [[city]]: 
*[[Zaječar]] - 66,000
*[[Bor, Serbia|Bor]] - 48,000
*[[Negotin]] - 43,000
*[[Knjaževac]] - 37,000
*[[Sokobanja]] - 19,000
*[[Kladovo]] - 21,000
*[[Boljevac]] - 15,000
*[[Majdanpek]] - 23,000

The largest city in the region is [[Zaječar]], and therefore functions as its cultural, urban, and economic centre. It consists of four municipalities: Stari grad (old parts of the city: Vlačić, Kraljevica, Karađorđev venac, Šljivarsko brdo, Lubničko brdo, [[Oskoruša]], Pazaršte, Zvezdan, Podliv, Veliki izvor), Kotlujevac (Ključ 1,2,3,4, Živinarnik, Selište, Vlaško brdo, Beli breg), Grljan (south suburban parts and Višnjar) and Salaš (north suburban parts). The largest ethnic group in Zaječar is Koltlujevac, with a population of over 25,000.

==History==
Early [[Bronze Age]] [[pottery]] of the [[Kostolac-Kocofeni culture]] has been found throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/srejovic/dsrejovic-eneolit.html|website=Projekat Rastko|author=Dragoslav Srejovic|title=Kulture bakarnog i ranog bronzanog doba na tlu Srbije}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Roman era, the area was administratively part of the [[Dacia Ripensis]]. During emperor Justinian's reign there were numerous fortifications in the area. Notable Roman sites include [[Timacum Minus]], [[Trajan's Bridge]], [[Diana Fortress]], and others.
The Bulgar ruler Ivan Stracimir (Vidin principate) and voevod Mircea cel Batran controlled the territory of Podunavia until the Ottoman conquest in the XIVth century&lt;ref&gt; Coman Marian, Putere și teritoriu.

Several settlements in the region received [[Habsburg Monarchy]] frontier status after the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718); the area became a frontier towards the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles W. Ingrao|author2=Nikola Samardžić|author3=Jovan Pesalj|title=The Peace of Passarowitz, 1718|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3Sg_1wR4poC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2011|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-594-8|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peasant uprising took place in 1883 in Timok, in Eastern Serbia, known as the Timok Rebellion ( Timocka buna in Serbian). The peasant movement of 1883 resulted from economic, political and social factors.

Between 1918 and 1922, two districts of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] existed in the area - Krajina District, with seat in [[Negotin]], and Timok District with seat in [[Zaječar]]. In 1922, these two districts were merged into the newly formed Timok Oblast with seat in Zaječar. Timok Oblast existed until 1929 when it was included into the newly formed [[Morava Banovina]] with seat in [[Niš]]. At present there are two districts in the area: [[Bor District]] with seat in [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]]; and [[Zaječar District]] with seat in Zaječar.

==Culture==
===Ethnic groups===
 {{see also|Vlachs of Serbia}} [[File:Map of Vlach community in eastern Serbia.jpg|thumb|The Vlach community in eastern Serbia.]] 
The region is inhabited by a majority of [[Serbs]] and minority of [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]]. Based on the 2002 census and results in the Bor and Zaječar Districts (which together had 284,112 inhabitants), there were 85,58% Serbs, 8,31% Vlachs and 0,96% [[Romani in Serbia|Romani]]. The Serb community traditionally speak the Kosovo–Resava dialect in the north and the Prizren-Timok dialect in the south, however, Standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is used in formal communication. The Vlachs speak the [[Vlach language in Serbia|Vlach language]], which awaits standardization, which in this region is a form of the [[Wallachian subdialect of Romanian|Oltenian subdialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/a103742/romanii-din-valea-timocului-recunoscuti-drept-minoritate-nationala.html |title=Romanii din Valea Timocului, recunoscuti drept minoritate nationala. |date=16 August 2007|accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222741/http://www.romanialibera.ro/a103742/romanii-din-valea-timocului-recunoscuti-drept-minoritate-nationala.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Serbs and Vlachs are Eastern Orthodox by denomination. There is currently controversy regarding the ethnic identification of the Vlach community.

==Economy==

The region is rich in [[copper]] and [[gold]] [[Mining|mine]]s, especially in the Bor and Majdanpek areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4511">[[Image:Trollkyrka trail 1.jpg|thumb|right|The arduous trail up the "tower" is marked with orange signs]]'''Trollkyrka''' ("[[Troll]]'s church") is a secluded [[butte]]-like rock in the heart of the National Park of [[Tiveden]], [[Sweden]], which served as a pagan sacrificial ground ([[horgr]], see also [[blót]]) for centuries after Christianity became the dominant religion in Scandinavia. It may have been used as late as the 19th century, when popular tradition still held the mountain to be off-limits for Christians.

According to Lidman (1972:52) old people used to say: "No Christian can go there. The mountains of the troll church belong to the heathen [[troll]]s. If a Christian ventures there, he will come to grief."

In fact, local tradition relates that the mountain was used not long ago for heathen rites and that anyone who was not initiated and saw it risked either to be buried in a bog in the forest or sworn into the brotherhood. These precautions clearly indicate that the rites took place as late as the period 1604–1735, which was a time when there was a penalty of death on practising such rituals. The rites are described in a folk poem documented by the folklorist Carshult (1941) when he documented the traditions on [[Skaga stave church]]. It has later been published in Karlsson (1970:62) and Lidman (1972:52).

[[Image:Closeup of Bridalveil Fall seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite NP.JPG|right|thumb|Bridal Veil Falls in [[Yosemite National Park]]. Either side of the waterfall are the flat vertical faces of the truncated spurs]]
[[File:26_swiatoinos.jpg|thumb|250px|Faulted southeastern side of Svyatoy Nos peninsula, Lake Baikal - [[active fault]]ing shown by faceted [[Spur (mountain)|spurs]] forming triangular facets]]

A '''truncated spur''' is a [[Spur (topography)|spur]], which is a ridge that descends towards a valley floor or coastline from a higher elevation, that ends in an inverted-V face and was produced by the erosional truncation of the spur by the action of either streams, waves, or glaciers. Truncated spurs can be found within mountains, along the walls of river valleys, or along coastlines.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds. (2005) ''Glossary of Geology'' (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W. D., 1954, ''Principles of Geomorphology.'' John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York. 618 pp. {{ISBN|978-8123908113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''faceted spur''' is also a spur that ends in a triangular face, known as a '''triangular facet''', with a broad base and an apex pointing upward. As typically used in [[geology]], the triangular facet is usually a remnant of a fault plane and it and its associated faceted spur are the result of faulting. The term ''faceted spur'' is also applied to inverted-V rock faces formed by stream, wave, or glacial erosion and, thus, as a synonym for ''truncated spur''.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;

==Formation==

===Truncated spurs===
Before glaciation, relatively immature rivers display a pattern of [[interlocking spur]]s. A valley glacier cannot avoid the interlocking spurs as a river can. As the valley glacier moves, abrasion and plucking erode the protruding tips of the spurs, leaving steep cliff-like truncated spurs. [[Hanging valleys]] are found in between truncated spurs as they join the main glacial valley from the side. It is common for waterfalls to form from them, where they fall into the main valley. Such truncated spurs can be found in mountainous regions. The [[Mer de Glace]], in the European Alps, is a valley through which a glacier currently flows. This is a geologically active process where the glacier continues to gradually erode the valley sides.

===Faceted spurs===
In the most typical usage of this term, faceted spurs are formed by active faulting, especially [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal faulting]] that produces well-defined triangular facets along either a mountain front or edges of a rift valley. These triangular facets provide evidence for recent fault movement and are used in [[Seismotectonics|seismotectonic]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Bull2007a"&gt;Bull, W. B., 2007, ''Tectonic Geomorphology of Mountains: A New Approach to Paleoseismology.'' Blackwell Publishing, New York, New York. 304 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic examples of faceted spurs can be found all along the Central Wasatch Fault, north-central Utah.&lt;ref name="ZuchiewiczOthers2000a"&gt;Zuchiewicz, W. and J. P. McCalpin, 2000, ''Geometry of faceted spurs on an active normal fault; case study of the central Wasatch fault, Utah, USA.''

The '''Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies''' is located in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. The museum collects, preserves, and exhibits materials related to the cultural heritage of the Rocky Mountains of Canada, making them available for education as well as research. The museum, which contains an archive and a library, was the inspiration of Banff artists [[Peter and Catharine Whyte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/whyte-museum-of-the-canadian-rockies/ The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alpine Club of Canada]] has dedicated the [[Peyto Hut|Peter and Catharine Whyte Hut]] on the [[Peyto Glacier]] after the couple.

The Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies is the largest privately funded public museum in Canada and is the fourth largest cultural history museum in Alberta. The Museum opened in 1968 and houses the Art Galleries, Archives, Heritage Gallery and Museum Shop. The four-acre site also includes two historic log homes, that can be visited during the summer, and four log cabins.

==History==
The museum was opened on June 16, 1968 by the Peter and Catharine Whyte Foundation. The Archives of the Canadian Rockies was the starting point of the museum and the Banff Library was incorporated in the Whyte Museum in 1970. The exhibition space saw several expansions during the 1980s and a new facility was opened in 1993. The museum acquires and exhibits art and artifacts from the [[Canadian Rockies]], aiming to showcase the culture and history of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[Canada]].  Many of [[Byron Harmon]]'s photographs, pioneer photographer of the Canadian Rockies, are housed at the museum.&lt;ref name="bestknown"&gt;Holt, Faye Reineberg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2O5T2bJ6iPkC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Byron+Harmon%22+photographer+rockies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oeKET6XDN-X40gGTsKGtBw&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Byron%20Harmon%22%20photographer%20rockies&amp;f=false Canada's Rocky Mountains: A History in Photographs], p. 81 (2010) ("The best known of Canada's mountain photographers")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founders===
[[Peter and Catharine Whyte]] met at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. Peter was a typical "Banffite", he participated in all the activities the area offered like skiing, hiking, horseback riding, etc. He was also an artist and had learnt a lot by accompanying artists that came to Banff in the early 20th century, including [[Carl Rungius]], [[Aldro Hibbard]], and [[J.E.H. MacDonald]]. He drove tourbusses and limousines for the Brewster Company. Catharine was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts to a fairly affluent family. Her father had been the treasurer and Vice President of the [[Stone and Webster|Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Firm]] and her mother was a business woman in the 1890s. Her grandfather, [[Edward Sylvester Morse]], had been the first director of the [[Peabody Museum of Salem|Peabody Museum in Salem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whyte|first1=Jon|title=Mountain Glory; The Art of Peter and Catharine Whyte|date=1988|publisher=Paperworks Press Limited|location=Calgary|isbn=0-920608-31-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her affluent lifestyle gave her a great childhood, but she was looking something more in her life. Peter and the Canadian Rockies offered her that; Catharine was a free spirit, and she believed in happiness over material goods. Peter and Catharine got married in 1930, and moved out to Banff to start their lives together. Catharine fell in love with Pete's mountains quickly. Their first summer they dedicated to painting wilderness and First Nations people, and in the autumn they arranged with Earl Spencer to build their log home studio, still located today on Museum property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Chic|title=Mountain Romantics; The Whytes of Banff|date=2014|publisher=Assiniboine Publishing Limited|location=Banff, AB, Canada|isbn=978-0-9811059-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayberry|first1=Kim|title=Romance in the Rockies; The Life and Adventures of Catharine and Peter Whyte|date=2003|publisher=Altitude Publishing Canda Ltd.|location=1500 Railway Ave., Canmore, AB, Canada|isbn=1-55153-998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter and Catharine Whyte Foundation===
Founded and initially endowed by Peter and Catharine in 1958, the Foundation originally had  a broad base of interests. As well as acting as an agency for collecting and preserving the culture of the Canadian Rockies, the Wa-Che-Yo-Cha-Pa Foundation supported medical research and Native education. Peter and Catharine's extensive collection of artifacts and historical materials formed the nucleus of what became known as the Archives of the Canadian Rockies. Catharine increased the Foundation's endowments in 1971 and renamed it in honour of Peter who died in 1966. The Peter Whyte Foundation ceased to give money to other causes and used all of its income to support the new building which now housed the archives, gallery and library. Catharine Whyte, founder, benefactor and President of the Foundation passed away in 1979. The endowment was increased through her bequest and the remainder of the historic and artistic collections, including the Whyte and Moore homes, were left to the Foundation, which was renamed the Peter and Catharine Whyte Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Chic|title=Mountain Romantics; The Whytes of Banff|date=2014|publisher=Assiniboine Publishing Limited|location=Banff, AB, Canada|isbn=978-0-9811059-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Expanded Museum===
In 1993 a new wing was added to the Whyte Museum to help it meet its full potential as a cultural tourism generator. The new wing added 13,000 square feet to the existing 16,000 square foot building, which was renovated at the same time the addition was completed. The construction and renovation project increased exhibition and public space, provided expanded storage space and conservation work areas, and expanded the Museum Shop and administration areas. The new building allowed the Museum to continue to collect, preserve and exhibit its growing collections.

==Heritage homes==
[[File:Moore residence, Banff.JPG|thumb|Moore residence, Lynx Street, Banff]]
[[File:Whyte Residence, Banff.JPG|thumb|Whyte residence, Bow Avenue, Banff]]
There are six homes on the property of the Whyte Museum. Two are available for entry during the summer tour season (the Moore home and the Whyte home), and the other four cabins are only able to be seen on the outside. These [[Historic house museum|historic homes]] work to represent the lifestyle of Banff's earlier pioneers and the people who helped to shape the community and land into what it is today. They are aimed at preserving significant examples of Banff's earlier architectural styles and homes associated with some of the area's more noteworthy residents.

===Moore Home===
The Moore home is the home of collectors and community leaders Philip and Pearl (Brewster) Moore. The house was built in 1907 on Fox Street and was later donated to the Whyte Museum in 1971, leading to its transplant onto museum property. It belonged to Philip and Pearl Moore, who were early pioneers of the area and worked to preserve a lot of Banff's earlier history.

===Whyte Home===
The home of Peter and Catharine (Robb) Whyte, the Museum's founders, philanthropists, world travellers and visual artists. The Whyte home was built in its current location in 1930-31 just after Peter and Catharine were married. It was originally meant to be a summer home, but as time went by it turned into a year-round residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayberry|first1=Kim|title=Romance in the Rockies; The Life and Adventures of Catharine and Peter Whyte|date=2003|publisher=Altitude Publishing Canda Ltd.|location=1500 Railway Ave., Canmore, AB, Canada|isbn=1-55153-998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peyto Cabin===
[[File:Bill Peyto Cabin Label.jpg|thumb|Bill Peyto Cabin]]
Welcoming visitors to the town of Banff is the face of the legendary guide [[Bill Peyto]]. Ebenezer William Peyto came to Banff from England in the early 1890s. Peyto, a prospector, hunter-trapper, warden and guide, used this cabin to store his outfitting and trapping supplies. With Peyto's cabin as well as those of Jack Sinclair, Jimmy Simpson, and Fred Ballard, this property by the Bow River became Banff's outfitting and guiding center. In the 1930s Peter and Catherine Whyte moved the cabin closer to their house and used it to house their Stoney friends while painting portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Chic|title=Mountain Romantics; The Whytes of Banff|date=2014|publisher=Assiniboine Publishing Limited|location=Banff, AB, Canada|isbn=978-0-9811059-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinclair Cabin===
[[File:Jack Sinclair Cabin Label.jpg|thumb|Jack Sinclair Cabin]]
Jack Sinclair was a [[Prospecting|prospector]] from Australia. After settling in Banff in the 1890s, Jack began packing for his prospecting companion and friend Bill Peyto. At the outbreak of the [[Boer war]], Jack and Bill flipped a coin to see who would go forth to defend the Empire. Jack, losing the toss, stayed to look after their claims. Sinclair later decided to seek his own fortune in prospecting in Africa. The land near the Bow where the museum now stands was transferred to Dave White for $100 in 1910.

===Mather Cabin===
[[File:Mather Family Cabin Label.jpg|thumb|Mather Family Cabin]]
William Mather arrived in Banff from Ontario around 1910, where he entered into a boat rental business with Raymond Rooper. Bill later became sole owner and expanded the business to include ice skating in the winter. A well trained logman, Bill built the sturdy shaped timber cabin. This small structure was where Mather's four children were raised. Bill's wife once gave birth in the cabin during a large flood; the doctor who birthed the baby was wearing a pair of hipwaders! In later years Bill's son, Allen, rented the cabin out as part of a cabin rental business. The cabin was moved to the Whyte property from across the river in 1977.

===Windy Cabin===
[[File:Windy Warden Cabin Label.jpg|thumb|'Windy' Warden Cabin No. 3]]
Windy is the sole remaining example of the original backcountry cabins used by the National Parks Warden Service. It is the third of a string of cabins that enabled the wardens to patrol the Parks frontiers against poaching. Built in 1911, Windy was located 45 kilometers north of Banff on the [[Panther River]]. As headquarters for the Panther River district, Windy was operated year-round. In the early 1970s, worried about the deterioration of this important structure, [[Parks Canada]] moved the cabin down the Cascade fire road to its present location. The Park Warden Service furnished Windy with appropriate artifacts in 1985.

==Archives and Library==
The Whyte Museum's Archives &amp; Library was established in 1966 to serve the unique [[Canadian Rockies|mountain regions]] of [[Western Canada]]. The Archives &amp; Library has various collections available, and holds the records and archival materials of the [[Alpine Club of Canada]].
