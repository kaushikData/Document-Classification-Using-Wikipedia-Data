'''1921 Census of Newfoundland''' was a population [[census]] taken in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the year 1921.

== History ==

The original census was organized in the order of the houses on the street or path in each community. People living next door to each other or within the same house would be identified by the order of the names in the census. The 1921 census was the only census taken in Newfoundland to have the question, "Are you [[Mi'kmaq people|Micmac]] Indian?",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therooms.ca/archives/aboriginal_ancestry.asp The Rooms Provincial Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as there were many Mi'kmaq people in Newfoundland at the time. The "Report on the Census of Newfoundland and Labrador, 1921" explains the census after it was taken. "The census was taken under the Cap. 20, Consolidated Statutes (Third Series), which directed that the population of the Colony be enumerated between the months of June and December in the year of 1921. In the early part of 1921, the necessary forms for the work of the Census were prepared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngb.chebucto.org/C1921/121-dist-idx.shtml|title=1921 District Arrangement Listing, Newfoundland|website=ngb.chebucto.org|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 1921, each electoral district was subdivided into divisions and the enumerators were appointed to each division. The forms were sent to these enumerators and they commenced the work of taking the census. One enumerator was appointed for [[Labrador]]. A Bishop Martin, of Nain, enumerated the far northern [[Moravian Church|Moravian Mission]] stations in Labrador. Copies of each enumerators returns were given to the respective clergymen in each division and the correctness of the census depended in a great measure upon the assistance in checking with the various clergymen in the island.

'''Arebhashe''' is a [[dialect]] of [[Kannada language|Kannada]] spoke by [[Hindu|Hindus]] of the [[Kodagu gowdas|Gowda]]&lt;ref name="kdkgowdas.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdkgowdas.com/|title=Kdk|author=|date=|work=kdkgowdas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; community in the regions of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]] and [[Sullia]] of [[Dakshina Kannada]] in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]..

==Etymology==
Linguists&lt;ref&gt;[[:kn:ಪುರುಷೋತ್ತಮ ಬಿಳಿಮಲೆ]]&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the word Arebhashe means 'half-tongue,'  from the Arebhashe word "a're" meaning "half" and ''bhashe,'' meaning "speech." Arebhashe pronunciation and accent are slightly distinct from [[Kannada language|Kannada]].

==History==
Arebhashe is written in the Kannada script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharedlist.org/writing/Arebhashe%20or%20Gowda%20Kannada%20is%20a%20dialect%20of%20the%20Kannada%20language-589/?i=9450|title=Arebhashe|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=|author=|work=arebhase.blogspot.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Arebhashe dialect is believed to have originated during the transformation of Hale Kannada to Hosa Kannada, and according to some historians{{who|date=June 2018}} the dialect may be five-hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coorga2z.in/regional/kodagu-arebhashe-gowdas-ethnic-group|title=Kodagu Arebhashe Gowdas - A Ethnic Group - Coorg A2Z|author=|date=24 September 2015|work=coorga2z.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2016}}

'''Aruek''' is a [[Torricelli languages|Torricelli language]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. There is little data to classify it, and it is therefore left unclassified within Torricelli by Ross (2005).  There are no longer any speakers in the one village where it was spoken and people of that village say the language is now extinct.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in Georgia''' number over 3,000, and most arrived in the Southern [[Caucasus]] in early 20th century when their ancestors fled present-day [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] during the [[Assyrian genocide]].

==History==
Historically, the first [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] arrived in Georgia in the 6th century A.D. when 13 Assyrian monks (historically known by the Georgians as the [[Thirteen Assyrian Fathers|13 saint Assyrian fathers]]) from the city of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] came to Georgia and established the [[Shio-Mgvime Monastery]]. Scholars have linked their contribution to the Christianization of Georgia, with [[Saint Nino]] leading the way of converts from paganism. Assyrians came in contact with Georgians once again in the 1760s. Assyrians under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule were looking for some kind of protection from religious and ethnic persecution. Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Mar Avraam]] requested of Georgian king [[Erekle II]] protection for Assyrians and the [[Yezidi]]s of present-day Turkey. In April 1770, Georgian troops, under Russian command, headed towards the city of Akhaltsikhe. At the same time, Assyrian bishop Ishaya (Isaiah) left [[Tbilisi]] and carried letters to Assyrian and Yezidi leaders, whence the Georgian king invited them to fight together against the Ottomans. The Assyrians and Yezidis were prepared to move against the Ottomans, whenever the support from Erekle II arrived, but Russian General [[Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben|Totleben]] changed his mind and turned his detachment back to Kartli.

The plans for military cooperation failed, but during the war that ensued, an Assyrian community of several dozen families appeared in Georgia. They arrived in Makhani&lt;!--Mukhrani?--&gt; from [[Persia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The second wave of Assyrian immigrants arrived when Russia signed the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] with Persia in 1828, where Assyrians and Kurds from Iran arrived in Georgia as workers. They also arrived in the second half of the 19th century and settled in [[Tbilisi]], becoming Russian and later [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens. By the end of the 19th century, there were over five thousand Assyrians living in Georgia. A fourth and largest wave came in between the years of 1915 and 1918, as Assyrians fled from the [[Assyrian Genocide]].

==Today's Assyrian community in Georgia==
On May 15, 2005, [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] met with the leaders of Georgia's Assyrians.
The meeting was mostly about the situation of Assyrians in Iraq. Assyrian leaders also gave the American president a letter as well. [https://archive.is/20130123194200/http://www.furkono.com/modules/upload/appeal_usa/picture_008.jpg]
When asked by Edgar Bitbunov, the Member of Assyrian International Congress
"Nowadays American Georgian forces are on Assyrian soil in Iraq. Of course,we aren't indifferent to the fortune of assyrians in Iraq. What's their future like? What can you say about it?" Bush answered: "We consider that every nation is equally responsible to find its own way to develop and achieve its own object. Assyrians are equal in right to any other peoples living in Iraq these days. Assyrians other nations in Iraq first of all should change their way of thinking, should act more persistently, resolutely and bravery to achieve their own objects and principles all these are in their hands. The USA always stands for, defends and supports people fighting for justice, freedom, independence and democracy."

'''Baga''', or '''Barka''', is a [[dialect cluster]] spoken by the [[Baga people]] of coastal Guinea. The name derives from the phrase ''bae raka'' 'people of the seaside'. Most Baga are bilingual in the [[Mande languages|Mande]] language [[Susu language|Susu]], the official [[regional language]]. Two ethnically Baga communities, Sobané and Kaloum, are known to have abandoned their (unattested) language altogether in favour of Susu.

The varieties as distinct enough to sometimes be considered different languages.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;W.A.A.Wilson, ''Temne, Landuma and the Baga Languages'' in: ''Sierra Leone Language Review, No. 1, 1962'' published by Fourah Bay College, Freetown.&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
:Baga Koga (Koba)
:Baga Manduri (Maduri, Mandari)
:Baga Sitemu (Sitemú, Stem Baga, Rio Pongo Baga)

The extinct Baga Kaloum and Baga Sobané peoples spoken Koga and Sitemu, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighboring [[Baga Pokur language|Baga Pokur]] is not closely related.

'''Beau's All Natural Brewing Company''', also known as '''Beau's Brewing Company''' or simply '''Beau's''', is a [[brewery]] in [[Vankleek Hill, Ontario|Vankleek Hill]], [[Ontario]], 50 minutes east of [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Local Brewery, Beer and Pub Win Big at Golden Tap Awards |url=http://www.beaus.ca/pr-sep208.html |publisher=Beau's All Natural Brewing Company |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2009-12-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beau's was started by father and son Tim and Steve Beauchesne.&lt;ref name=Family&gt;{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Colleen |title=Beau's All-Natural Brewing Company - Family Brewed |url=http://www.ottawaxpress.ca/food/food.aspx?iIDArticle=17322 |newspaper=[[Ottawa XPress]] |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521090707/http://www.ottawaxpress.ca/food/food.aspx?iIDArticle=17322# |archive-date=2009-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After having informally discussed the idea, they left their previous employment (Tim having run a [[textile]] company for 17 years, and Steve having worked for the Ontario government and running Go! Go! Go! Records) and opened Beau's on [[Canada Day]] (July 1) 2006.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

Beau's has been successful since opening, having sold its entire first batch of 3,000 litres (5,300 [[pint]]s) to nine [[Ottawa]]-area [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and [[restaurant]]s before the official opening date.&lt;ref name=Sold&gt;{{Cite press release|title=New Brewery Sells Out of Beer in Two Weeks |url=http://www.beaus.ca/pr-june2806.html |publisher=Beau's All Natural Brewing Company |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912020543/http://www.beaus.ca/pr-june2806.html |archivedate=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it originally expected to supply Lug Tread to local [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario|LCBO]]s and [[The Beer Store|Beer Store]]s in 2006, Lug Tread first appeared in Ottawa LCBOs in early 2008, by which time it had expanded to over 90 establishments in the Ottawa area.&lt;ref name=Citizen&gt;{{Cite news |last=Eade |first=Ron |title=Good things brewing at Beau's |url=http://communities.canada.com/ottawacitizen/blogs/omnivore/archive/2008/02/26/good-things-brewing-at-beau-s.aspx |newspaper=[[The Ottawa Citizen]] - Omnivore's Ottawa |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220233515/http://communities.canada.com/ottawacitizen/blogs/omnivore/archive/2008/02/26/good-things-brewing-at-beau-s.aspx# |archive-date=2009-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2009, over 200 [[Eastern Ontario]] establishments featured Beau's Lug Tread on tap.&lt;ref name=BeauMarket&gt;{{Cite news |last=Van Dusen |first=Tom |title=A Beau market for organic beer |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/news/ottawa/2009/07/09/10074896.html |newspaper=[[The Ottawa Sun]] |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Just about every LCBO in the region" sells Lug Tread.

On May 17, 2016, Steve Beauchesne, speaking as chief executive officer of Beau's, announced that the brewery would be owned by its employees in an [[employee stock ownership plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Serebrin | first = Jacob | title = Beau's brewery to remain independent by selling ownership to employees | newspaper = The Globe and Mail | date = 17 May 2016 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/beaus-brewery-to-remain-independent-by-selling-ownership-to-employees/article30046219/ | access-date = 24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beers==
Beau's flagship beer is Lug Tread, a [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]-style [[lager]]ed [[ale]] that is produced year-round.

The brewery also produces seasonal beers such as Beaver River I.P. Eh? (an [[India Pale Ale]] (IPA) with a "citrusy punch"); Festivale (an [[Altbier]]-style [[ale]]); Farm Table: Märzen (an [[Oktoberfest]]-style [[amber lager]]); and Bogwater (a "Strong &amp; Spicy Dirty-Brown Ale"). Other limited and one-off beers are released periodically under the Wild Oats Series, Farm Table Series, Greener Futures Barrel-Aged Series, and Pro-Am Series.&lt;ref name=Beers&gt;{{Cite web |title=Beers |url=http://www.beaus.ca/beer |publisher=Beau's All Natural Brewing Company | accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2013, Beau's released The Tom Green Beer, a [[milk stout]] made in collaboration with actor and comedian [[Tom Green]].&lt;ref name=TomGreen&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Beau's "The Tom Green Beer" Milk Stout Now in LCBOs |url=https://www.beaus.ca/news/oct-31-13/the-tom-green-beer |location=Vankleek Hill, Ontario, Canada |publisher=Beau's All Natural Brewing Co. |agency= |date=1 November 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221214454/https://www.beaus.ca/news/oct-31-13/the-tom-green-beer# |archive-date=2014-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Green was a guest on [[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]], he brought the beer on-air and drank it with the host.&lt;ref name=CitizenUSA /&gt;

All of Beau's beers use only [[Organic food|organic]] ingredients, and the brewery itself has now been certified as an organic brewery by Pro-Cert Inc.&lt;ref name=BeauMarket/&gt; Beau's also emphasizes local ingredients, maintaining membership in the [[Ontario Federation of Agriculture]], and is currently developing local [[hops]] to replace imports from [[Germany]].

==Reception and awards==
Beau's beers have been very well received, having "earned a reputation for quality and clean taste with beer drinkers who want more than just a cheap buzz,"&lt;ref name=Citizen/&gt; and Lug Tread having become a "fast favourite."&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

In its debut year, Lug Tread won "Best Beer of the Fest" at the 2006 [[Golden Tap Awards]].&lt;ref name=Golden&gt;{{Cite web |title=Previous winners of Golden Tap Awards |url=http://www.goldentapawards.com/winners.html |publisher=Golden Tap Awards |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lug Tread went on to win "Best beer brewed in Ontario (outside of the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]])" at the 2007 and 2008 Golden Tap Awards,&lt;ref name=Golden/&gt; and "Best regularly-produced craft beer brewed in Ontario" and "Best of the Fest" at the 2009 awards.&lt;ref name=Golden09&gt;{{Cite web |title=Golden Tap Awards 2009 Winners Announced |url=http://www.bartowel.com/news/archives/000521.php |publisher=The Bar Towel |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brewery itself also won "Best microbrewery in Ontario (outside of the GTA)" and "Best micro/craft brewery in Ontario" in 2008 and 2009, respectively.&lt;ref name=Golden/&gt;&lt;ref name=Golden09/&gt;

'''Beneficial State Bank''' (formerly One PacificCoast Bank, FSB &amp; OneCalifornia Bank) is an [[Oakland, California]]-based [[community development bank]]. Founded by [[Tom Steyer]] and his wife, Kat Taylor, in June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Innovation meets tradition in community development banking |first= |last= |newspaper=Oakland Business Review |date=May 2008 |url= &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-06-01--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficial State Bank functions as a regulated financial institution, but provides [[commercial banking]] services to underserved small and medium-size businesses, nonprofits, affordable-housing developers, community facilities, as well as families and individuals in the Bay Area.

In August 2010, the bank signed an agreement to acquire Shorebank Pacific, a [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-based community bank. Together the merged banks would have $300 million in combined [[assets]] and serve [[California]], [[Oregon]] and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2012702051_shorebank24.html|title=Shorebank Pacific Bought by California Bank|accessdate=2010-08-23 |last=Bhatt|first=Sanjay |coauthors= |date=2010-08-23 |work= |publisher=Seattle Times |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the bank [http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2013/10/10/one-pacificcoast-deal-albina-bank-closes.html acquired 90% of the stock of Albina Community Bank] based in Portland, OR.

==Founders==

==Mission and structure==
The bank maintains a [[triple bottom line]], seeking to be profitable, promote environmental sustainability and expand economic opportunity in underserved communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13053">'''Berber music''' refers to the musical traditions of the [[Berbers]], an [[ethnic group]] native to the [[Maghreb]], as well as parts of the [[Sahara]], [[Nile Valley]], [[West Africa]]. Berber music varies widely across North-West Africa and some of the best known varieties can be found in [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] music; [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]], [[Chawi]] and [[Gasba music]] from [[Algeria]]; and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] from [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]] and [[Mali]].

Ancient Berber music is stylistically diverse, with styles including [[pentatonic]] music, such instruments as the [[oboe]] and the [[bagpipes]], and [[African music|African rhythms]] along with singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-bab.com/arab/background/berber.htm |title=The Berbers |publisher=Al-bab.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819165403/http://al-bab.com/arab/background/berber.htm |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient musical traditions have been kept alive by small bands of musicians traveling from village to village, entertaining at weddings and other social events with their songs, tales and poetry.

Most Berber music is of the village- and urban-folk musical variety. Berber music and culture is influenced by the Berber people's long-standing struggle to achieve basic language rights and identity recognition in modern North African societies, aside from aesthetics and style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.north-of-africa.com/article.php3?id_article=107 ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical/Vocal Styles==
Berber music is characterized by its use of folk oral traditions, as well as particular [[musical scale|scales]] and rhythmic patterns, which include [[pentatonic]] music and African rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwanforthearts.org/event/282 |title=Berber Music of Morocco and the Middle Atlas |publisher=Alwan For The Arts |date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these elements are combined together to form one of the main sources of entertainment in Berber social ceremonies like marriages, as well as verses, tales and songs.

==Instrumentation==
The Berber people are spread out over a large part of Africa, but are mostly concentrated in the northwestern region of Africa. They use a vast array of both melodic and percussive instruments. The following instruments are part of their secular and religious dance and song:
[[File:Taghanimt_ou_taqsebt_1.JPG|thumb| Taghanimt reed flute]]
*''[[Taghanimt]]'', an end-blown reed flute. Used mostly to accompany songs rather than dance, the ''taghanimt'' has a rich, breathy texture.
*''[[Mizwad|Mizwid]]'', a type of [[bagpipe]]; the term literally means "bag" or "food pouch".
*''[[Zukra]]''{{clarify|date=December 2015}} (Tunisia) or ''[[Rhaita|ghaytah]]''{{clarify|date=December 2015}} (Morocco). In both countries, these instruments are combined with several percussive instruments to create large ensembles which may perform at public festivals or similar occasions.
*''[[Nafir]]'', a long [[natural horn]], a type of valveless [[trumpet]]. This instrument is used mostly as a signaling instrument to send out messages to large groups, although it also has some performance value.
*''[[Sintir|Ginbri]]'' (Morocco), a fretless plucked string instrument with a skin stretched over its body on the playing side: the skin has the same acoustic function as the membrane on a banjo. Most ensembles have at least one ginbri, although some have more than one.
*''[[Rebab]]'', a long-necked bowed instrument with a large body. Like the ginbri, it is constructed with a skin on the string side. This instrument has only one string, usually of horse hair, and is commonly played alongside the ginbri.
*''[[Davul|Tabl]]'' ({{lang-ber|e'ṯbel}}), a cylindrical double-sided drum. Although it has a similar usage and spelling to the [[tabla]] of India, no direct connection has been found between the two. The ''qas'ah'' is a large shallow kettledrum found mostly in Tunisia. Similar to the qas'ah is the ''[[Naqareh|Naqqarah]]'', two ceramic kettledrums played simultaneously by both hands.
*''[[Bendir]]'' (Morocco), a snare frame-drum. A series of bendirs played simultaneously provide the main percussive rhythm for Berber music as the above-mentioned drums are more artistic than bendirs.
*''[[Krakebs|Qaraqib]]'', a large metal [[castanet]]-like musical instrument. Normally one is held in each hand. These may be used to keep a rhythm or to play their own pattern.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classicalarabicmusic.com/instruments.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506144420/http://www.classicalarabicmusic.com/instruments.htm |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabylia==
{{see also|music of Algeria}}
The music of the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle Berbers]] has achieved some mainstream success outside of its [[Kabylia]] homeland, both in the rest of Algeria and abroad. Traditional Kabyle music consists of vocalists accompanied by a [[rhythm]] section, consisting of [[Davul|t'bel]] ([[tambourine]]) and [[bendir]] (frame [[drum]]), and a [[melody]] section, consisting of a [[ghaita]] ([[bagpipe]]) and [[ajouag]] ([[flute]]).

===Development of Kabyle music===
In the 1930s, Kabyles moved in large numbers to Paris, where they established cafes where musicians like {{ILL|Cheikh Nourredine|fr}} added modern, Western instruments like the [[banjo]], [[guitar]] and [[violin]] to Kabyle folk melodies. [[Slimane Azem]] was a Kabyle immigrant who was inspired by Nourredine and 19th century poet [[Si Mohand Ou Mohand]] to address homesickness, poverty and passion in his songs, and he soon (like many Kabyle musicians) became associated with the Algerian independence movement.

By the 1950s, [[Arab classical music]], especially [[Egypt]]ian superstars like [[Umm Kulthum]], had become popular and left a lasting influence on Kabyle music, specifically in lush orchestration. [[Cherif Kheddam]] soon arose with the advent of a Kabyle branch of [[Radio Algiers]] after independence in 1962, when France called a cease fire on March 19 and enacted the voting upon an agreement during a referendum in June. Included here were the Evian Accords which, for three years with all Algerians gave certain legal protections to colons equally. After the three years however, all Europeans would have to become Algerian citizens or risk being classified as aliens, which would then make them lose rights. Some of the rights discussed in the Accords were the right to participate in public affairs, the right to a full range of cultural and civic rights and the right to own property. Female singers also became popular during this period, especially [[Cherifa]], [[Djamilla]] and [[Hanifa (singer)|Hanifa]].

Algerian independence did not lead to increased freedom for Kabyle musicians, and these Berbers soon included often covert lyrics criticizing the [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]] government, which had little repercussion due to the Evian Accords. Many of these musicians were inspired by other [[singer-songwriter]]s, including [[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]], [[Víctor Jara]] and [[Silvio Rodríguez]]. With the song "A Vava Inouva" (1973), [[Idir]] brought international attention to Kabyle music and paved the way for the Algerian [[raï]] genre. [[Ferhat Mehenni]], known for his politically uncompromising lyrics, [[Lounis Ait Menguellet]], known for his poetic and inspired lyrics, also became popular during the 1970s and [[Amour Abdenour]], who's ongoing career started in 1969 wrote and performed about kabyle society, nature and more importantly love relationships.

By the time [[raï]] became popular in Europe in the 1980s, Kabyle artists were also moving towards sentimental, [[Popular music|pop]]-ballads. [[Hassen Zermani]]'s all-electric [[Takfarinas]] and [[Abderrahmane Abdelli|Abdelli]]'s work with [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records|Real World]] helped bring Kabyle music to new audiences, while the murder of [[Matoub Lounes]] inspired many Kabyles to rally around their popular musicians.

Modern singers include [[Djur Djura]] and many [[chawi]] singers and groups like [[Houria Aichi]], Les Berberes, [[Amirouch]], Massinissa, Amadiaz, Numidas, Mihoub, Massilia, [[Merkunda]], Thiguyer, Salim Souhali (Thaziri), [[Dihya]], and [[Messaoud Nedjahi]].

==Morocco==
{{see also|Music of Morocco}}
Traditional Moroccan Berber music can be categorised into collective and professional music.&lt;ref name=Ilahiane2006&gt;{{cite dictionary|first=Hsain |last=Ilahiane |title=Music |encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E8qp_k515oC&amp;pg=PA98 |date=2006 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6490-0 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dansgroep uit Ouarzazate tijdens het Nationaal Folkore Festival in Marrakech TMnr 20017663.jpg|thumb|Dancers (back) and musicians (front) from [[Ouarzazate]] performing ''[[ahwash]]'' during the National Folklore Festival in [[Marrakesh]] (1970
)]]
In collective music, men and women from entire families or villages participate in dances such as the ''[[ahwash]]'' and ''[[ahidus]]''.&lt;ref name=Ilahiane2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt; A prayer is chanted at the beginning, followed by a response from a chorus of dancers. Accompanied by drums (''[[bendir]]'') and flutes (''[[ney]]''), dancers dance in a ring around the musicians.&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999&gt;{{cite book|first=Dave |last=Muddyman |editor1=Simon Broughton |editor2=Mark Ellingham |editor3=Richard Trillo |chapter=Morocco |title=World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyiTOcnb2yYC&amp;pg=PA567 |year=1999|publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-1-85828-635-8 |pages=567–569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by an ''amdyaz'' or poet, groups of usually four professional musicians (''imdyazan'') travel across the region to perform in various villages.&lt;ref name=Ilahiane2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt; The ''amdyaz'' recites improvised poems about current national and world affairs. His fellow musicians accompany the poem with a drum, a single-string ''[[rebab]]'' and a double clarinet.&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt;

A [[Shluh]] Berber variant of professional music is performed by rways, led by a ''rays'' or ''raiss''. A ''rway'' or''rwai'' performance starts with the ''astara'', an instrumental session on the ''rebab'' or ''wtar'', followed by the tambourine and flute. The ''astara'' sets the basic notes of the melody.&lt;ref name=Ilahiane2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt; The middle section consists of sung poetry (''amarg''), a choreographed overture (''ammussu''), a lively song (''tamssust''), and dance (''aberdag'').&lt;ref name=Ilahiane2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt; The ''tabbayt'' marks the final part, in which the rhythm first accelerates and then ceases abruptly.&lt;ref name=Muddyman1999/&gt;

Famous Moroccan Berber musicians include [[Ammouri Mbarek]], a singer and songwriter active since the 1960s and considered {{by whom|date=October 2014}} the "[[John Lennon]]" of the Berber world, and [[Najat Aatabou]], a singer whose debut cassette, "J'en ai Marre", sold an unprecedented half-million copies in Morocco.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]] tour internationally and have collaborated with [[Brian Jones]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[William S. Burroughs]].

Many musicians have created fusion styles from Berber and European music, including [[Hindi Zahra]], [[Hassan Hakmoun]], [[Khalid Izri]], Hassan Idbasaid, Thidrin, Med Ziani, Imtlaa and Houssaine Kili.

==Tuaregs==
The Berber music of the Tuareg region uses rhythms and vocal styles similar to the music of other Berber, [[Iberians|Iberian]], and Arab music, while West African call-and-response-style singing is also common. In contrast to many of the region's peoples, among the Tuareg music is mostly the domain of women, especially playing the imzhad, a string instrument like a violin. Tuareg weddings feature unique styles of music, such as women's vocal trilling and special dances (ilkan) of slaves marking the occasion.

'''''Brain Renaissance''''' is a book written by [[Marco Catani]] and [[Stefano Sandrone]]. It was published on the 500th anniversary of the birth and the 450th anniversary of the death of the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]]. In 2016 ''Brain Renaissance'' won the biennial Award for Outstanding Book in the History of the Neurosciences presented by the International Society for the History of the Neurosciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishn.org|title=ISHN.ORG|website=www.ishn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The 304-page book is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the biography of [[Andreas Vesalius]], one of the greatest anatomists of all time. The second parts provides a modern [[translation]] from Latin of Vesalius' original book on the brain, namely the seventh book of ''[[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]]''. The third part tells a 500-year story behind some of the most important discoveries in [[neuroscience]], while relating the findings of Vesalius with the subsequent development of neuroscience. In these pages the reader becomes familiar with the ebb and flow of many ideas that had a significant impact in the [[history of neuroscience]]. At the end of the book the authors have added an appendix with the figures and captions from the seventh book of the ''Fabrica''.

==Reception==
Alison Abbott dedicated a one-page review to ''Brain Renaissance'' in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. She underlined that through the translation from the Latin 'we can appreciate Vesalius's extraordinary attention to detail, and his willingness to believe his eyes, even when what he saw contradicted established knowledge' and that the 'accompanying texts by Catani and Sandrone place the work in its historical and scientific context'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Alison|title=Neurophysiology: The man who bared the brain|journal=Nature|date=13 May 2015|volume=521|issue=7551|pages=160–160|doi=10.1038/521160a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paolo Mazzarello, who reviewed ''Brain Renaissance'' in the journal ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences'', wrote that the book is 'a tool to explore the neuroscience from a historical point of view' as well as 'a convincing attempt to use the fundamental discoveries of Andreas Vesalius as a key to start and develop multiple explorations of the brain'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27200442 | volume=55 | title=A Vesalian guide to neuroscience | year=2016 | journal=Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci | pages=121–3 | last1 = Mazzarello | first1 = P | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Angela P. Pacheco, while reviewing ''Brain Renaissance'' for The British Society for Literature and Science, emphasised that 'Catani and Sandrone have produced a remarkable compilation of the history of neuroscience from Vesalius to the present day' and that this book 'is relevant both to students of medicine, and to those interested in Renaissance studies, medicine, and history.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsls.ac.uk/reviews/early-modern-and-enlightenment/marco-catani-and-stefano-sandrone-brain-renaissance-from-vesalius-to-modern-neuroscience/|title=The British Society for Literature and Science · Marco Catani and Stefano Sandrone, Brain Renaissance: From Vesalius to Modern Neuroscience|website=www.bsls.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[PsycCRITIQUES]], Gordon M. Burghardt noted that 'Brain Renaissance is even more valuable for those teaching neuroscience in all its guises and at whatever levels, in universities and medical schools. There are lots of lecture tidbits at the very least, helping put our modern conceits as part of a long journey to understand [[mind]] and [[behavior]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psyccritiques/|title=PsycCRITIQUES|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Camping and Caravanning Club''' is a United Kingdom [[not-for-profit]] organisation involved with all aspects of [[camping]] based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1901, the club now{{when|date=August 2018}} represents over half a million members.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History==
The Camping and Caravanning Club started in 1901 as the Association of Cycle Campers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/aboutus/history/|title=Over 100 years of The Camping and Caravanning Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hiram Holding]], one of the founders, is considered by many to be the father of modern camping. He also founded the Bicycle Touring Club in 1878, which became Cyclists' Touring Club, now renamed [[Cycling UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinguk.org/|title=We are Cycling UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding wrote ''The Campers Handbook'' in 1908, to share his enthusiasm for the great outdoors. His love of camping derived from his experiences as a boy, which dated back to the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkcamping.co.uk/guides/history_of_camping.html|title=History of Camping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 the Association of Cycle Campers (now The Camping and Caravanning Club) opened its first camping site, in Weybridge. By that time the organisation had several hundred members. In 1909 the association split into three separate organisations, which joined again in 1910 as the National Camping Club. Two more name changes followed, in 1919 (The Camping Club of Great Britain and Ireland) and in 1983.

In 1967 its membership rose to 100,000 and more than 300,000 by the end of the 20th century. The club now{{when|date=August 2018}} represents over half a million campers in the UK.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Membership from a modern club==
The club offers a paid membership service to tent, campervan, caravan and motorhome owners – in fact, the club accepts units of any shape and size, including motorbike campers.

Benefits of being a club member include discounts on its UK and European campsites, money off attractions worldwide and offers on some outdoor retailers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Structure==
The Camping and Caravanning Club is a membership organisation. The club's board of directors, The National Council, are appointed to serve the interests of all club members and manage the club and its policy. The National Council consists of 18 nationally elected councillors, 13 regional councillors, and an honorary treasurer.

Regional elections are held to elect club members onto region councils; these councils oversee the operation of the district associations within their region.

==Site classifications ==
There are currently more than 1600 campsites owned, managed or certified by the club.

=== Club sites ===
The club has 106 club sites throughout the UK. These are owned, maintained and run by the club.

=== Camping-in-the-forest sites (CITF) ===
The club works alongside the Forestry Commission to run 15 sites in Britain's forests and woodland. The New Forest is home to the majority of these campsites. CITF also have sites in the Forest of Dean, Savernake Forest, Loch Lomond, and Aviemore.

=== Certificated sites ===
The club is recognised as an "exempted organisation" within the terms of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. This means that the UK government allows the club to issue a certificate to land owners, giving them permission to operate a small campsite on their land without specific planning permission. The club has over 1,550 certificated sites open to members.

=== Independent listed sites ===
These sites are not owned or run by the club. They are commercial sites which are promoted by the club under the condition that they meet the standards expected by the club members.

===Club-approved campsites in Europe===
Opening up a world of choice for campers, the club's travel service promotes over 150 sites in 12 European countries.

== Other products and services == 
The club also offers insurance, {{clarify span|RAC breakdown cover|date=August 2018}}, and travel booking in other countries.

==Notable presidents==

* [[Julia Bradbury]] – current president
* [[David Bellamy]] – 2001–2013
* [[Robert Baden-Powell, 3rd Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Crause Baden-Powell]] – 1992–2001
* [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] – 1919–1941
* [[Robert Falcon Scott]] – 1909–1912

== Annual events ==
The club holds events throughout the year, catering to both members and non-members.

National Feast of Lanterns (NFOL) – the club's annual national camping rally – is held in different locations each year.

Macy]]) plays a reluctant hit man who works with father, Michael ([[Donald Sutherland]]); when Alex discusses with his psychotherapist ([[John Ritter]]) his desire to quit the "family business", Michael orders Alex to kill his psychotherapist

More rarely, [[Romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] have used light-hearted depictions of assassins:

* [[Ashton Kutcher]] plays an assassin-for-hire in the 2010 film ''[[Killers (2010 film)|Killers]]''.

===Award-winning portrayals===
Portrayals of hitmen  that have earned major nominations or awards:
* In 1985, [[Jack Nicholson]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for playing a hitman named Charley Partanna in ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]''.
* In 1994, both [[John Travolta]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] were nominated for Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best actor]] and [[Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] respectively for their portrayals of two hitmen in the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''.
* [[Javier Bardem]] played a ruthless assassin named [[Anton Chigurh]] in search of a lost cache of money in the [[Coen Brothers]]' 2008 [[Academy Award]]-winning film, ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]''.

===Tragic or solitary portrayal===
In other countries the vision of the hitman is often one of a tragic individual with a solitary existence:
* In the 1967 French film, ''[[Le Samouraï]]'', Jef Costello is an example of this.
** The film ''Ghost Dog'' takes inspiration from this "solitary" depiction.
* In the French film ''[[Léon: The Professional]]'' his existence outside of hits revolves around his houseplant and watching old films.
* In the 1989 film, ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'', the main character, Ah Jong, attempts to perform one last hit as a means of setting right an injustice that he had previously caused.

==Video games==
* The fictional main character of the video game series ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' was genetically engineered by a man called [[Dr. Ort-Meyer]] in an insane asylum in Romania. He is known only as [[Agent 47]]. 47 is highly regarded in the criminal underworld, so much so that many consider him to be a [[myth]]. The gameplay revolves around infiltrating an area, executing a target (or targets) and escaping without apprehension. Although it isn't compulsory, the ''Hitman'' games encourage the player to use stealth and cunning maneuvers to eliminate targets, as opposed to making use of pure firepower.  The seventh game in the series, [[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|Hitman 2]] was released on November 13, 2018.
* In the ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' game series, there is a group called the "Dark Brotherhood", which is a group of assassins that are like hitman. This group has appeared in all ''Elder Scrolls'' games since Daggerfall. Groups like the Morag Tong also perform contract killings in the series, and have been a playable faction in Morrowind. However, the nature of the Morag Tong is different from the Dark Brotherhood, since the Morag Tong is a legal assassination group in the province of Morrowind, and played a more justice-oriented role. Conversely, the Dark Brotherhood plays a role more similar to that of hired assassins.
* In some videogames, such as the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, the main character is given tasks akin to acting as a hitman. This is shown in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' with [[Niko Bellic]], who is frequently hired as a hitman.
* In [[Cause of Death (game)|Cause of Death]], several characters—most notably The Ghost (featured in Volumes 2, 8 and 13) -- are assassins (often also acting as bodyguards).
* Two fictional assassins ([[List of Ace Attorney characters|Shelly De Killer and Ryoken Hoinbo]]) are featured in the [[Ace Attorney]] series, specifically in [[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Justice For All]] and [[Ace Attorney Investigations 2]].
* In [[Killer is Dead]] game, the main character [[Mondo Zappa]] works for [[Brian's Execution Firm]] and is hired to kill several strange targets.
* In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] hires the Broodals to marry [[Princess Peach]] and kill [[Mario]].
* In ''Welcome to the Game 2'', the player is constantly being hunted by Lucas Kumiega, a Polish hitman who has, for unknown reasons, been hired to assassinate Clint Edwards, the protagonist.

Crime is present in various forms in [[North Korea]], officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
Many people in North Korea are stricken with poverty and as a result, are often forced to take up extreme measures in order to survive. Several defectors have reported hearing rumours that murder and cannibalism is rife in the country; these rumours first arose during the [[North Korean famine|Great Famine]] of 1994 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22209894 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |last=Hegarty |first=Stephanie |title=North Korea: Defectors adjust to life abroad |date=April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korea Institute for National Unification]]'s 2014 ''White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea'' lists twelve public executions between 2004 and 2010 for the crime of murder. Murder victims included lovers, a spouse, a creditor, and a hospital administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3B1BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=The Reality of Civil and Political Rights |title=White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea 2014 |publisher=[[Korea Institute for National Unification]] |page=122-124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political offences===
{{See|Human rights in North Korea}}

In North Korea, any perceived criticism of the country's political leaders is seen as a grave offense. Treason is also taken very seriously; traitorous behaviour may include attempting to escape to [[South Korea]], or simply praising any aspect of South Korean culture. Crossing the northern border into China or Russia is also illegal, but this law is less strictly enforced, due to the sheer number of North Koreans driven across the border in search of employment.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book |last=Yun |first=Minwoo |editor-last=Newman |editor-first=Graeme R. |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uK6bR9byVIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA180 |chapter=North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) |title=Crime and Punishment Around the World |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=180 |isbn=9780313351341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism or rejection of [[communist]] principles, or idleness in upholding these principles, is another serious political crime. This category of offence includes anything which threatens the communist system – for example, running a private business, or stealing agricultural goods such as corn, rice or potatoes.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

===Foreigners accused of crimes against North Korea===
A small number of American citizens have been charged in North Korea for alleged crimes against the nation. This encompasses illegally trespassing into the country or displaying signs of hostility towards the country. Two reporters from the United States were sentenced to [[penal labour]] after being found guilty of crimes against the nation. They were freed later the same year, when [[Bill Clinton]] visited the then-North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] to negotiate their release. In April 2013, American tour operator [[Kenneth Bae]], also known as Pae Jun Ho, was accused of plotting to overthrow the North Korean government. State media reported that there was evidence to substantiate the claim. He has since been released and allowed to return to the United States. According to the [[law of North Korea]], such an act is punishable either by a life sentence in prison, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/27/kenneth-bae-charged-north-korea-plot_n_3171167.html |title=Kenneth Bae, American Detained In North Korea, Charged With Plot To Overthrow Regime |date=April 27, 2013 |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and child marriages===
{{See|Prostitution in North Korea}}

[[Prostitution in North Korea]] is illegal and, according to the North Korean government, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DPRK FAQ |url=http://www.korea-dpr.com/faq.htm |publisher=Democratic People's Republic of Korea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308222109/http://www.korea-dpr.com/faq.htm |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government is reported to employ approximately 2,000 women, known as the ''[[Kippumjo]]'', to provide sexual services to high-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jasper |last=Becker |title=North Korea: At Home With the Kims |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/EJ11Dg04.html |publisher=Asia Times |date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also widespread [[human trafficking]] within the country; women and girls are often sold abroad, mostly to China, where they are subjected to [[forced prostitution]] or [[forced marriage]]. Others may willingly migrate to China, only to be kidnapped by traffickers on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUMhDcgeg2wC&amp;pg=PA198 |pages=198–9 |title=Trafficking in Persons Report |edition=10 |author=[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary Rodham]] (ed.) |year=2010 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |isbn=9781437937169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{See|Corruption in North Korea}}

[[Corruption in North Korea]] is a widespread and growing problem in the country. It is ranked 174 out of 176  countries in [[Transparency International]]'s 2012 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], tied with [[Somalia]] and [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results |title=2012 Corruption Perceptions Index |publisher=[[Transparency International]] |accessdate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making the country one of the "'most corrupt' nations on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2069934/Somalia-North-Korea-corrupt-nations-Earth--Britain-ties-Barbados-number-16.html |title=Somalia and North Korea are the 'most corrupt' nations on Earth... and Britain ties with Barbados at number 16 |last=Silver |first=Katie |date=December 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict rules and draconian punishments imposed by the regime against, for example, accessing foreign media, are commonly evaded by bribing the police. [[Informant|Informing]] on colleagues and family members has become less common.&lt;ref name=IM&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quiet Opening: North Koreans in a Changing Media Environment|url=http://www.intermedia.org/press_releases/A_Quiet_Opening_FINAL.pdf|publisher=InterMedia|authors=Kretchun, Nat; Kim, Jane|date=May 10, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512143135/http://intermedia.org/press_releases/A_Quiet_Opening_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''Daina''' (literally: ''song'') was a [[Lithuania]]n cultural organization promoting Lithuanian folk traditions and songs.

During the [[Lithuanian national revival]], several organizations committed to promoting and maintaining Lithuanian folk traditions were formed.  The most prominent of these was ''Daina'', formed by composer [[Juozas Naujalis]] in 1899. ''Daina'' was registered with the Russian government in 1905, with the official purpose of being a church choir.  Singers from ''Daina'' traveled across Lithuania, singing and communicating with like-minded Lithuanians.

Daina's staging of ''[[America in the Bath-House]]'' and the choir's performance of several nationalist songs was a great cultural event that gave momentum to the nationalist movement, and ''Daina'' spread across the country.  [[Violin]]ist [[Mykolas Leškevičius]] was a part of ''Daina'' during this time.

After suppression by the German authorities in 1915, ''Daina'' ceased all activities.  Only a year later, however, Naujalis and [[Stasys Šimkus]] revitalized the society. [[Opera]] singers like [[Antanas Sodeika]] and [[Kipras Petrauskas]] performed during this time.

The '''population of Japan''' at the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]] was estimated to be 34,985,000 on January 1, 1873,&lt;ref&gt;''Population of Japan after Meiji 5'' compiled by the Cabinet Bureau of Statistics of Japan in 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; while the official {{nihongo|original family registries|本籍|honseki|}} and ''de facto'' (or {{nihongo|present registries|現住|genjū|}}) populations on the same day were 33,300,644 and 33,416,939, respectively.  These were comparable to the population of the [[United Kingdom]] (31,000,000), [[France]] (38,000,000) and [[Austria-Hungary]] (38,000,000).

== Japan proper ==
=== Total Population ===
Meiji government established the uniformed registered system of {{nihongo|[[koseki]]|戸籍|family registries}} in 1872, which is called {{nihongo|Jinshin koseki|壬申戸籍}}.

The first national [[census]] based on full sampling of inhabitants was conducted in Japan in 1920, and was conducted every five years thereafter. Per the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the population distribution of Japan proper from 1920 to 1945 is as follows &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/final/hyodai.htm Statistics Bureau, The Population of Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Total Fertility Rate]] from 1874 to 1950==
The [[Total fertility rate|total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

In 1937 Japanese demographers projected the Japanese population in 1980 to reach 100,000,000, in accordance with observed growth rates.

== Japanese overseas possessions ==
[[Japan]] annexed [[Taiwan]] after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], while victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] gained Japan the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], [[Karafuto]], and [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. These acquisitions increased the area controlled by Japanese to {{convert|262912|sqmi|km2|0}}.

The total population of the Empire of Japan, including Taiwan, Korea and Karafuto was 64,940,034 in Dec 31, 1908, which could be broken down as follows:

*Japan proper: 51,742,486
*Korea: 9,918,566
*Taiwan: 3,252,589
*Karafuto: 26,393

And the population of concessions as of Dec 31, 1908 was as follows:

*[[Kwantung Leased Territory|Kwantung]]: 427,117
*[[South Manchuria Railway Zone|Railway Zone]]: 28,307

=== Manchukuo ===
The population of [[Manchuria]] in early 1934 was estimated at 30,880,000. These numbers included 30,190,000 Chinese, 590,760 Japanese, and 98,431 other nationalities (Russians, Mongols, etc.). The Chinese numbers included 680,000 ethnic [[Koreans]]. In 1937, shortly after the foundation of [[Manchukuo]], the government launched a twenty-year colonization program, with the goal of increasing the population through the immigration of 1,000,000 Japanese families (5 million people) between 1936 and 1956. This was in addition to the Japanese military garrison of approximately 300,000 men in 1937. Between 1938 and 1942 a contingent of young farmers of 200,000 arrived in Manchukuo; joining this group after 1936 were 20,000 complete families. In [[Shinkyō, Manchukuo|Shinkyō]] Japanese made up 25% of the population. By 1940, the total population of Manchukuo was estimated at 36,933,000, which included approximately 1 million Japanese civilian and 500,000 Japanese military personnel. These figures exclude that of the Kwantung Leased Territory and Dalien, which were included within that of the Japanese overseas territories.

}}'''Elvin Morton "Bunky" Jellinek''' (15 August 1890 – 22 October 1963), '''E. Morton Jellinek''', or most often, '''E. M. Jellinek''', was a [[biostatistician]], [[physiologist]], and an [[alcoholism]] [[researcher]], fluent in nine languages and able to communicate in four others.

The son of Markus Erwin Marcel Jellinek (1858-1939) and Rose Jellinek (1867-1966), née Jacobson (a.k.a. the opera singer [[Marcella Lindh]]), he was born in [[New York City]] and died at the desk of his study at [[Stanford University]] on 22 October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Bahariahtas, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Jellinek studied biostatistics and physiology at the [[University of Berlin]] from 1908 to 1910. He then studied [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[anthropology]], and [[theology]] for two years at the [[Joseph Fourier University]] in [[Grenoble]]. He was also enrolled, apparently concurrently, at the [[University of Leipzig]] from 25 November 1911 to 29 July 1913, and from 22 November 1913 to 2 December 1914 for classes in languages, linguistics and cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, he conducted research in [[Sierra Leone]] and at [[Tela]], [[Honduras]]. In the 1930s he returned to the U.S.A. and worked at the Worcester State Hospital, [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], from whence he was commissioned to conduct a study for the ''Research Council on Problems of Alcohol''. The eventual outcome of his study was the 1942 book, ''Alcohol Addiction and Chronic Alcoholism''.

From 1941 to 1952, he was Associate Professor of Applied Physiology at [[Yale University]]. In 1941 he was managing editor of the newly established [[Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol]] (now the [[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.jsad.com/jsad/static/about.html |title=About the Journal |accessdate=2010-09-09 |publisher=Center of Alcohol Studies, [[Rutgers University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103141907/http://www.jsad.com/jsad/static/about.html |archivedate=3 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 he was engaged by the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva as a consultant on alcoholism, and made significant contributions to the work of the Alcoholism Sub-committee of the W.H.O.'s ''Expert Committee on Mental Health''.

The [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/40186/1/WHO_TRS_48.pdf Second Report] of the Alcoholism Subcommittee, published in August 1952, have reproduced in its 2nd Annex, the text of an important communication that Jellinek gave to the first European Seminar on Alcoholism in Copenhagen in October 1951.

In that conference, he exposed his work on the Phases of alcoholic addiction and he presented a detailed Chart (page 30) exposing the progressive nature of alcoholism. That chart is considered as the 1st version of the future Jellinek's Curve that some other people will eventually draw from his work.

Upon his retirement from the W.H.O. in the late 1950s, he returned to the USA. In 1958 he joined the Psychiatry Schools of both the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Alberta]], and in 1962, he moved to Stanford University in California, where he remained until his death.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see 1964 obituary in ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'' [http://www.jellinekaward.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Addiction researcher [[Griffith Edwards]] (2002, p.98) holds that, in his opinion, Jellinek's ''The Disease Concept of Alcoholism'' was a work of outstanding scholarship based on a careful consideration of the available evidence.

=== Disease concept of alcoholism ===
{{main|Disease theory of alcoholism}}
In 1849, the Swedish Physician Magnus Huss (1807–1890)&lt;ref&gt;He was physician to the Swedish kings [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles XIV]] and [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]].&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to systematically classify the damage that was attributable to alcohol ingestion. Huss coined the term [[alcoholism]] and used it to label what he considered to be a chronic, relapsing disease.&lt;ref&gt;The term first appeared (in 1849) in the Swedish edition of '''''Alcoholismus Chronicus''', or Chronic Alcohol Illness. A Contribution to the Study of Dyscrasias Based on my Personal Experience and the Experience of Others'', which was soon translated to German (1852) and later into English.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellinek coined the expression "[[Disease theory of alcoholism|the disease concept of alcoholism]]",&lt;ref&gt;It also appears as the title of his 1960 book, ''The Disease Concept of Alcoholism''.&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly accelerated the movement towards the [[medicalization]] of [[drunkenness]] and alcohol [[habituation]].

Jellinek’s initial 1946 study was funded by Marty Mann&lt;ref&gt;Marty Mann (1905–1980), an early female member of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Brinkley Smithers&lt;ref&gt;In his lifetime, R. Brinkley Smithers (1907–1994) – an American philanthropist, and founder of the ''Christopher D. Smithers Foundation'', which had been named after his father, an IBM founder (via the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]]), and a Director of IBM (1913–1952) – a self-styled "recovering alcoholic", donated more than $US40 million to alcoholism programs; $US13.5 million through the Smithers Foundation, and $US28 million from his own his personal funds.(Peele [http://www.peele.net/lib/smithers.html])&lt;/ref&gt; (Falcone, 2003). It was based on a narrow, selective study of a hand-picked group of members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] ('''AA''') who had returned a self-reporting questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;Of the 158 questionnaires returned, Marty Mann selected 98; and it was upon this hand-picked population that Jellinek’s reported in his 1946 study.&lt;/ref&gt; Valverde opines that a biostatistician of Jellinek’s eminence would have been only too well aware of the "unscientific status" of the "dubiously scientific data that had been collected by AA members".&lt;ref&gt;Valverde (1998), pp.110–111; Valverde also noted that the AA questionnaire that was the source for Jellinek's classification only had relevance to "the experience of white, male, middle-class alcoholics in the 1940s" (p.110).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1960 book he identified five different types of alcoholism, and defined them in terms of their abnormal physiological processes:
:''In order to differentiate alcoholism not just [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]ally, along a time line but also [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]ally across groups of people, thus distinguishing '''types''' of alcoholics in a way that ran quite counter to the AA emphasis on the unity of all alcoholics, Jellinek came up with the idea of grouping different drinking patterns and naming them by giving each a Greek letter. One might think that the purpose of such a classification is to expand the range of alcoholism and include as many people as possible under the "disease concept"; but, contrary to what the title suggests, Jellinek's 1960 magnum opus in fact tries to limit the scope of the "disease concept", stating that most of the types described might be alcoholics, but they are not diseased – because they do not suffer from "loss of control".''&lt;ref&gt;Valverde, 1998, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Alpha alcoholism''': the earliest stage of the disease, manifesting the purely psychological continual dependence on the effects of alcohol to relieve bodily or emotional pain. This is the "problem drinker", whose drinking creates social and personal problems. Whilst there are significant social and personal problems, these people can stop if they really want to; thus, argued Jellinek, they have not lost control, and as a consequence, do not have a "disease".
* '''Beta alcoholism''': [[polyneuropathy]], or [[cirrhosis of the liver]] from alcohol without physical or psychological dependence. These are the heavy drinkers that drink a lot, almost every day. They do not have physical [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and do not suffer [[alcohol withdrawal|withdrawal]] [[symptoms]]. This group do not have a "disease". 
* '''Gamma alcoholism''': involving acquired tissue tolerance, physical dependence, and loss of control. This is the AA alcoholic, who is very much out of control, and does, by Jellinek's classification, have a "disease".&lt;ref&gt;"''It is characterized by binge drinking and a slow downward slide into helplessness''"(Valverde, 1998, p.112).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Delta alcoholism''': as in '''Gamma alcoholism''', but with inability to abstain, instead of loss of control.
* '''Epsilon alcoholism''': the most advanced stage of the disease, manifesting as [[dipsomania]], or periodic alcoholism.

:''While Jellinek's classification draws a clear (if arbitrary) line between the garden-variety alcoholic and the truly diseased alcoholic, it does not draw such a clear boundary between alcoholism in general and normal drinking. This is Jellinek's [[Achilles' heel]] . . .''
:''By relying on cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s to define several of his types, he implicitly gives up the project of providing a single, objective, universally valid clinical definition of alcoholism, and opens the door to anthropological [[nominalist]]ic definitions along the lines of "whatever is normal drinking in that particular culture is normal drinking".'' (Valverde, 1998, p.112)

The "Jellinek curve"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from this classification of Jellinek, and it was named out of respect for Jellinek’s work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hindsfoot.org/BSV02Psy.html William E. Swegan, 2. The Psychology of Alcoholism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Jellinek later completely dissociated himself from this chart's representations; however it is still known as the "Jellinek curve".

=== Recognition of placebo effect ===
{{main|Placebo}}
In post-war 1946, various pharmaceutical chemicals were in short supply for making medicines. A headache remedy manufacturer found that supplies of one of its remedy’s three constituent chemicals was running out.

They asked Jellinek, then at Yale, to test whether the absence of that particular chemical would affect the drug’s [[efficacy]] in any way. Jellinek set up a complex trial – with 199 subjects, divided randomly into four test groups – involving various [[permutation]]s of the three drug constituents, with a [[placebo]] as a [[scientific control]]. Each group took a test remedy for two weeks at a time. The trial lasted eight weeks, by the end of which each group had taken each of the test drugs, albeit in a different sequence. Over the entire population of 199 subjects, 120 of the subjects (~60%) responded to the placebo, and 79 did not. The trial also demonstrated that the chemical in question significantly contributed to the remedy's efficacy.

In the process of examining the data produced by his trial, Jellinek discovered that there was a significant difference in responses to the active chemicals between the 120 who had responded to the placebo and the 79 who did not. He (1946, p.&amp;nbsp;90) described the former group as being "''reactors to '''placebo'''''", and this seems to be the first time that anyone had spoken of either "''placebo reactions''" or "''placebo responses''".&lt;ref&gt;This is 10 years prior to Beecher's 1955 paper, "The Powerful Placebo", which is commonly and incorrectly named as the source of the term; see: [[Placebo (origins of technical term)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jellinek Award ==
The '''Jellinek Memorial Award''', or '''Jellinek Award''', is an award presented annually by the Jellinek Memorial Fund in Jellinek's honor. It is given to a scientist who has made an outstanding contribution to research on alcohol or alcoholism. Winners receive a cash prize of $5,000 USD, as well as a bust of Jellinek with a personalized inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jellinekaward.org/about-us.html|title=About Us |website=Jellinek Memorial Awards|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NCF-Envirothon''' is an annual [[environmental movement|environmentally themed]] [[academic]] competition for high school aged students organized by the NCF-Envirothon a program of the National Conservation Foundation. The competition is held by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on a regional, state, and bi-national level. Envirothon combines in-class and hands-on environmental education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association New Brunswick|url=http://www.cfanb.ca/the_envirothon_experience|publisher=CFANB|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a competition setting which involves a problem-solving presentation as well as written field tests. The competition tests students on five core subjects- [[aquatic ecology]], [[forestry]], [[soils|soils and land use]], [[wildlife]]- along with a fifth annually-changing subtopic which focuses on relevant environmental issues. Currently, roughly 500,000 students from forty-five U.S. states and nine Canadian provinces/territories participate in the competition.&lt;ref name = "canon enviro"&gt;{{Citation
  | title = NCF-Envirothon Official Webpage
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://envirothon.vologon.com/index.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the NCF-Envirothon competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In areas with a considerable number of teams, subdivisions such as county, regional, or district competitions are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels.

==Organizers and Sponsors==
The NCF-Envirothon is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] [[Nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Washington,D.C. Coordinating the delivery of the North American competition, the organization also relies heavily on volunteers across North America to advise individual teams from each participating state and province.&lt;ref name="Envirothon: About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: About Us|url=http://www.envirothon.org/about-us.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governing the program is the National Conservation Foundation (NCF) Executive, along with a NCF-Evirothon Operating Committee which is made up of representatives from participating states and provinces.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon" /&gt;

Envirothon is sponsored by the [[National Natural Resources Conservation Foundation|National Conservation Foundation]], the [[Conservation district|National Association of Conservation Districts]], the [[United States Forest Service]], and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].&lt;ref name="Envirothon: Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: Sponsors|url=http://www.envirothon.org/sponsors.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual teams are often sponsored by school clubs or classes, local businesses and governments, or [[4H]] and other such non-scholastic organizations.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==Competition==

Competition participants are generally teams of five students with one to two team advisers. Home-schoolers can also take part as their own team.
[[File:Envirothon Training 2012.jpg|thumb|Training Session During the 2012 Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;]]

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the North American Envirothon Competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In regions with a considerable number of teams, competitions on subdivision, county, regional, or district levels are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels. At the North American Competition, teams that rank first through tenth receive prizes and scholarships of various values.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

Competition week at the NCF-Envirothon level includes various workshops, field trips, and seminars led by professionals and educators for both the students and their advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association|url=http://www.canadianforestry.com/html/education/envirothon_e.html|publisher=CFA|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these outings are linked to the current issue topic and provide information on the area in which the competition is being held.

During the competition, each team must complete five written field tests, each dealing with a different topic. These tests consist of various question types, including identifications and hands-on assessments. Each team must also prepare an oral presentation on the current issue topic, which the team presents to a panel of judges. An important element of the competition is the understanding that each topic is interrelated, and understanding human effects on the environment and how human activities connect with ecosystem functions. Each test is scored out of 100 points, with the presentation being scored out of 200 points. The team with the highest cumulative total of points at the end of the scoring is the winning team. Recognition is also given to teams with the highest scoring in each of the five categories.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Competition locations===
The location of the North American competition is determined based on a regional map that separates North America into five general regions: Far West, Mid-West, Southeast, Northeast, and Far North. The host college or university is usually located in a different region than that of the year preceding it.&lt;ref name="Future Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Envirothon: Future Competitions|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/future-competitions.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a competition (2013) was held in at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]] in the Far West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=MSU picked as site for 2014 NCF-Envirothon competition|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/article_1e391598-11ce-11e2-a7f7-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|accessdate=20 November 2012|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Competition===
The 2015 NCF-Envirothon competition will be held July 27-August 7, and hosted at [[Missouri State University]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. 45 states and 9 Canadian provinces and Territories will registered for the competition. The current Issue Topic for that year's competition is Urban/Community Forestry. This will be the second time that the state of [[Missouri]] Missouri Envirothon hosts the NCF-Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="Present Competition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montana to Host North America’s Largest High School Natural Resource Competition|url=http://www.roundupweb.com/story/2012/09/26/news/montana-to-host-north-americas-largest-high-school-natural-resource-competition/1316.html|publisher=Roundup Web|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition Topics==
{{More references|section|date=January 2015}}

Each field test dealing with one of five competition topics requires both theoretical understandings and hand-on skills such as identification and chemical testing. Each topic also has a degree of relatedness to one another, which is sometimes considered in theoretical-based test questions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==History==
In 1979 the Pennsylvania Soil and Water Conservation Districts set up the Environmental Olympics, later renamed Enviro-Olympics, to encourage interest in environmental issues through hands-on competition.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon"&gt;{{cite web|title=History Of Envirothon|url=http://www.envirothon.org/pdf/history.pdf|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012|author=April Smith|date=2 November 2010|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expanding rapidly to include forty conservation districts by 1987, it gained attention from other states, and in 1988, the program became the National Envirothon, with participation from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Ohio. In 1992 Nova Scotia became the first Canadian province to join the competition. The competition was sponsored by various state, local, and provincial conservation programs and associations until 1997 when [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] began its support of the program, with local sponsors still supporting lower level competitions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt; In 1999 Canon became the title sponsor of the competition between the U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with the competition being renamed the "Canon Envirothon." It is currently referred to as the "NCF-Envirothon."&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

== Historical background ==

Georgia’s ethnic composition varied from one historical epoch to another and this happened as the result of certain economic, political or social factors. Georgian academic Vakhtang Jaoshvili identified four major stages in the [[History of Georgia (country)|history of Georgia]] that influenced the ethnic composition of Georgia: from medieval times to the late 18th century; from the 19th century to the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|1921 Soviet invasion of Georgia]]; from 1921 to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the USSR]]; and present days, starting with the Georgian declaration of independence.

As Georgia during medieval times remained the victim of military aggression coming from its neighbors, its territories near the borders were often abandoned by Georgians, and the vacated areas were occupied by other ethnic groups. In the 15th century [[Muslims]] populations moved to the [[Kvemo Kartli]] province. In this era, Ossetians also moved from [[Northern Caucasus]], settling in Georgia. In the 18th century Greek people appeared in Georgia as well. By the early 19th century Georgians made up only four-fifths of the total population.

In the beginning of the 19th century a big influx of foreign populations were deliberately settled in Georgia. In 1832 Georgians were 75.9 percent of total population in comparison to the 79,4 percent in 1800. This was determined by the [[Russian Empire]] establishing its rule over Georgia, replacing the Georgians populations near the borders with other ethnic groups because of economical or military interests. In the beginning of the 19th century Russia forced Muslim Georgians to move from [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] to the Ottoman Empire, replacing them with Armenians who were encouraged by Russia to leave [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]] through the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] and the 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] as signed respectively with the two.&lt;ref&gt;"Griboedov not only extended protection to those Caucasian captives who sought to go home but actively promoted the return of even those who did not volunteer. Large numbers of Georgian and Armenian captives had lived in Iran since 1804 or as far back as 1795."

''The Cambridge History of Iran'' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://feb-web.ru/feb/griboed/texts/piks3/3_4_v3.htm A. S. Griboyedov.

By 1830 18 Greek settlements appeared in Georgia as well. In addition Georgia also remained a potential place of residence for Russian demoralized soldiers and religious sects like [[Dukhobors]]. During [[World War I]] [[Kurds]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] also settled in Georgia.

Under Soviet rule Georgia received a massive influx of immigrants, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Ossetians and Armenians. In addition, the increase of the [[birth rate]] among Jews, Azerbaijanis or other ethnic groups led to a significant decrease in ethnic Georgians and by 1939, for the first time in the history of Georgia, Georgians were less than two-third of the whole population. This decrease was contrasted by the emigration of Georgians, many of whom not ethnically Georgians, after the end of [[World War II]]. By 1979 the share of Georgians was 62.1 percent in urban areas and 75.7 percent in rural areas.
The collapse of the Soviet Union had a similar effect, causing emigration from Georgia, especially among non-ethnically Georgian populations. Thus, ethnic minorities in 1989 constituted 30 percent of total population, and by 2002 this number had dropped to 16 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Mamuka, Komakhia.

== Ethnic minorities in Georgia today ==
Georgia is, to this day, ethnically diverse. The government worked out special plans for the integration of ethnic minorities into the society. In August 2005 the Georgian government established the Civil Integration and Tolerance Council. Its main function was to study the issue of tolerance towards ethnic minorities and their level of their participation to society. The council defined six main priority areas for the development of policies, and consequently created six working groups inside the council: Rule of Law; Education; Culture; Social and Regional Integration of Society; Media; Civic Participation;

== Rule of law ==
As a member of the international community Georgia has ratified several international agreements providing guarantees for ethnic minorities living on the territory of Georgia. Following is a list of such agreements, followed by the date of ratification by Georgia:

* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (15.09.1991)
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (25.01.1994)
* [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (25.01.1994)
* [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|International Convention Concerning discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation]] (04.05.1995)
* [[European Cultural Convention]] (16.04.1997)
* [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (16.04.1999)
* [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for The Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] (12.05.1999)
* [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] (16.10.2004)
* [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] (13.10.2005)
* [[Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation|European Outline Convention on Trans-frontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities]] (04.11.2006)

The [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitution of Georgia]] also recognizes the equal rights of every citizen regardless of race, colour, language, sex, religion, ethnic origin or nationality. Any violation of the equality of citizens is punishable under the Georgian law.

== Education ==
According to the Georgian Law on General Education every citizen of Georgia has a right on receiving secondary education in their native language if [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is not their native language. In addition it is also obligatory to teach state language in schools. As of 2008, the Georgian government funded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.una.ge/pdfs/publications/UNAG-Publication-English.pdf |title=Tolerance and Civil Integration – State Policy |publisher=Administration of the President of Georgia |year=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721031107/http://www.una.ge/pdfs/publications/UNAG-Publication-English.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 141 [[Armenian language|Armenian]]-language schools.
* 117 [[Azeri language|Azerbaijani]]-language schools
* 151 [[Russian language|Russian]]-language schools
* 3 [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]]-language schools.
* 161 bilingual schools
* 6 trilingual schools

In order to provide [[equal opportunity]] for every citizen of Georgia to receive higher education in 2008, for the first time the national examination in general skills was conducted in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Armenian languages]] as well.

In 2005 the [[Zurab Zhvania]] School of Public Administration was founded with the assistance of President and State in order to implement and promote democratic values in regional governmental and self-governmental institutions, and to improve the quality of social services and civil service. The school focuses on the preparation of civil servants and on the promotion of the teaching of [[Georgian language]] to ethnic minorities.

== Social and regional integration of society ==
The Georgian government identified the decrease of [[unemployment]] in the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities as fundamental to their integration in society. With this goal, it has economically promoted the local businesses. In total 6,941,500 GEL has been provided for such projects as re-equipment of wood processing, development of construction material producing, honey production, and so on, in the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities.

== Media ==
The [[Georgian Public Broadcasting]] (GPB) is the only media source legally obliged to broadcast in minority languages. On March 21, 2008 the [[Georgian parliament]] changed the Law on Broadcasting and GPB was obliged to spend at least 25% of its budget on programs related to [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] as well as on programs concerning ethnic minorities.

In order to allow ethnic minorities living in Georgia to be well informed about events taking place in the country the GPB news program “Moambe” is aired in different languages: [[Abkhazian language|Abkhazian]], [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]  and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. 
Since 2007 a 50-minute weekly radio bridge is held in conjunction with [[Baku]] and [[Yerevan]].

Since June 2, 2007 the [[talk show]] ''Italian Yard'' has been aired on GPB. Its main aim is to promote dialogue among ethnic minorities living in Georgia and to encourage their successful integration into society. The show itself is conducted in Georgian and is designed for a wider audience. The format was designed with guidance of American journalist and producer Stan Matthews. The talk show crew acts according to the recommendations by GPB’s minority council and considering the result of surveys carried out by the [[UN]] association of Georgia and other [[NGOs]]. The show crew frequently receives letters from ethnic minorities living in [[Samstkhe-Javakheti]] through the post boxes placed in the region. The project of ''Italian Yard'' is carried out with the assistance of [[USAID]] in the frames of National Integration and Tolerance in Georgia program of the United Nations Association of Georgia.

== Civic participation ==
Apart from participation in elections and to the decision-making process there also should be wider opportunities for civic participation that implies monitoring and consultation. An important step on this way was the memorandum signed on 26 June 2008 between the Civil Integration and Tolerance Council and the Ethnic Minorities Council within Ombudsman’s Office.

== List of the councils for the support and protection of ethnic minorities in Georgia ==

'''Ethnic relations in India''' have historically been complex.  ("Ethnic relations" refers to attitudes and behaviours toward people of other [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] or [[Race (human categorization)|races]].)  India is extremely diverse ethnically, with more than 2,000 different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Note: India |author=US Department of State |date=17 April 2012 |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3454.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618165336/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3454.htm |archivedate=18 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, within [[India]], there is also significant diversity within regions, and almost every [[Provinces of India|province]] has its own distinct mixture of ethnicities, traditions, and culture.  Throughout the history of India, ethnic relations have been both constructive (as with mutual cultural influences) and destructive (as with [[discrimination]] and ethnically-based violence).

==Constructive relations==
Usually, people in different regions respect each other's cultures and traditions.  According to local sources, [[unity in diversity]] has been growing in India, making the country more tolerant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unity in diversity is basis for India|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/09/stories/2010010954970700.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=9 January 2010|location=Dindigul, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==

===Against North-East Indians===
In recent years there have been many reports of discrimination against people from [[North-East India]].  In 2007, the ''North East Support Centre &amp; Helpline (NESC&amp;H)'' was started as a separate wing of [[All India Christian Council]].  Its stated goal is to increase awareness regarding prejudice and attacks against people from North-East India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nehelpline.net/?page_id=193|title=About NE Support Centre &amp; Helpline|date=5 January 2011|publisher= North East Support Centre &amp; Helpline|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many North-Eastern Indians face discrimination; are refused living accommodations when they travel to urban areas to study;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi won't lend a home to students from northeast|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Delhi-won-t-lend-a-home-to-students-from-northeast/Article1-1105466.aspx|accessdate=|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=9 August 2013|location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subjected to racial slurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students from North East tired of discrimination|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/students-from-north-east-tired-of-discrimination-10607|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=NDTV|date=26 October 2009|location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the appearance of their eyes.  A spokesman for the NESC&amp;H has stated that abuse and harassment of North-Easterners is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiaedunews.net/in-focus/June_2009/Northeast_students_question_%27racism%27_in_India_8316|title=Northeast students question 'racism' in India|date=6 June 2009|publisher=India edunews|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, in an attempt to prevent such discrimination, the Indian government asked all of its states and union territories to arrest anyone who commits an act of [[wikt: atrocity|atrocity]] against a North-Easterner under the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]] (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.  A person found guilty under this law can be jailed for 5 years.

In 2014, a North-Eastern student named Nido Taniam was [[Nido Taniam|killed in New Delhi]].

in October 2014, there were two separate incidents, one in which a North-East student was beaten by three men in [[Bangalore]] for not speaking [[Kannada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/northeast-student-attacked-in-bangalore-allegedly-for-not-speaking-kannada-607174|title=Northeast Student Attacked in Bangalore, Allegedly For Not Speaking Kannada|author=Maya Sharma|date=15 October 2014|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipuri-student-leader-attacked-in-bangalore-told-speak-in-kannada/article1-1275549.aspx|title=Manipuri student attacked in Bangalore, 3 arrested|work=www.hindustantimes.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second where a North-East student was beaten by seven men in [[Gurgaon]], Haryana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/after-bangalore--it-s-gurgaon--n-e-students-brutally-assaulted-110501137.html|title=After Bangalore, it’s Gurgaon: N-E students brutally assaulted|date=16 October 2014|work=Yahoo News India|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on non-natives in Assam and other North Eastern States===
In Assam India, there have been many attacks on those from outside the region.  In 2007, thousands of [[Hindi]]-speaking labourers fled from Assam after a series of massacres and bomb attacks.  In May 2007, nine of them were killed and another 20 injured in violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Subir Bhaumik (23 May 2007). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6683767.stm Persecution of Assam's Hindi speakers]". BBC&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, 26 people from other parts of India were killed in a series of attacks over a period of six days. The police blamed [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA) and the [[Karbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Front|Karbi Longri National Liberation Front]] for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wasbir Hussain]] (12 August 2007). "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/11/AR2007081100464_pf.html 30 Killed in Northeast Violence in India]". Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the members of Purvottar Hindustani Sammelan (PHS) staged a [[hunger strike]] in [[Dispur]] to protest against the "merciless killings of innocent and defenceless Hindi-speaking people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1321800621.html Hindustani Sammelan stages fast-unto-death]". Hindustan Times. 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 98 non-locals were killed in Assam during 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/data_sheets/militenetattack.htm Militant Attacks on Non-Locals in Assam]". SATP. Retrieved 4 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 2008, a banned [[Meitei people|Meitei]] outfit killed 16 non-locals in Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.upi.com/Emerging_Threats/2008/04/18/Manipur-rebels-kill-Hindi-speakers/UPI-20441208560399/#ixzz2sIa9ZyjG Manipur rebels kill Hindi speakers]". UPI. 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  PHS alleged that anti-social groups in Assam were carrying out a continuous hate campaign against the Hindi speakers in the region.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-allegation-of-harrassment-of-hindi-speaking-people-1171553 Allegation of harrassment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; of Hindi-speaking people]". DNA. 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, nine Hindi speakers were killed in Assam and Manipur, after the attackers set around 70 houses on fire.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-hindi-speaking-people-among-12-killed-in-northeast/article1-409905.aspx Nine Hindi-speaking people among 12 killed in Northeast]". Hindustan Times. 12 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 8–10 November 2010, 21 Hindi, [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers were killed by a faction of the NDFB in Assam.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/nine-attacks-since-monday-toll-now-22/708839/ Nine attacks since Monday, toll now 22]". Indian Express. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Meghalaya]], the non-indigenous people (who are collectively called ''Dkhars'') are often targets of militant groups.&lt;ref&gt;T.

A '''full-body scanner''' is a device that detects objects on a person's body for security screening purposes, without physically removing clothes or making physical contact.  Depending on the technology used, the operator may see an alternate-wavelength image of the person's naked body, or merely a cartoon-like representation of the person with an indicator showing where any suspicious items were detected.  For privacy and security reasons, the display is generally not visible to other passengers, and in some cases is located in a separate room where the operator cannot see the face of the person being screened.  Unlike [[metal detector]]s, full-body scanners can detect non-metal objects, which became an increasing concern after various airliner bombing attempts in the 2000s.

Starting in 2007, full-body scanners started supplementing metal detectors at airports and train stations in many countries.

Three distinct technologies have been used, though the use of Backscatter X-ray has now been discontinued in many countries:
* [[Millimeter wave scanner]]s use non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation similar to that used by wireless data transmitters, in the [[Extremely high frequency|Extremely High Frequency (EHF)]] radio band (which is a lower frequency than visible light). The health risks posed by these machines are still being studied, and the evidence is mixed, though millimeter wave scanners do not generate [[ionizing radiation]]. &lt;ref name="health_privacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |work=Security Management |title=Companies Seek Full-Body Scans That Ease Health, Privacy Concerns |author=Harwood, Matthew |date=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006112416/http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Backscatter X-ray]] machines use low dose penetrating radiation for detecting suspicious metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing or in shoes and in the cavities of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='AMAZING RESULTS' OF THE SCANNER THAT 'SEES EVERYTHING' |url=http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |work=Moscow Domodedovo Airport |date=October 2, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303102333/http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been considerable debate with regard to how safe this technology is.
* Through-body [[X-Ray]] security scanners that emit a high level of radiation have been supplied by the US to at least two African countries.
Passengers and advocates have objected to images of their naked bodies being displayed to screening agents or recorded by the government. Critics have called the imaging virtual strip searches without probable cause, and have suggested they are illegal and violate basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/10/AR2011031003628.html|title=Group says body scanners an 'unreasonable search'|author=Pickler, Nedra |publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current technology is less intrusive and because of [[privacy]] issues most people are allowed to refuse this scan and opt for a traditional pat-down.

==History (US)==
The first full body security scanner was developed by Dr. Steven W Smith,&lt;ref name="Tek84.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tek84.com/company.html |title=Steven W. Smith / Original Developer of Secure 1000 in 1992 |publisher=Tek84.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908095734/http://www.tek84.com/company.html |archivedate=September 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, John (January 14, 2010) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122499686 New Airport Body Scans Don't Detect All Weapons]. National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the Secure 1000 whole body scanner in 1992. He subsequently sold the device and associated patents to [[Rapiscan Systems]], who now manufacture and distribute the device.

The first passive, non-radiating full body screening device was developed by [[Lockheed Martin]] through a sponsorship by the National Institute of Justice ([[NIJ]])'s Office of Science and Technology and the [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory]]. Proof of concept was conducted in 1995 through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Rights to this technology were subsequently acquired by [[Brijot|Brijot Imaging Systems]], who further matured a commercial-grade product line and now manufacture, market and support the passive millimeter wave devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brijot Acquires Rights to Lockheed Martin-Developed Technology for Design and Development of Concealed Weapons Detection Camera, Supporting Counter-Terrorism and Homeland Security Efforts |work=Business Wire |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90526909.html | location=Orlando | date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety aspects of the Secure 1000 have been investigated in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] since the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:AIT Passenger Checkpoint Video.ogv|thumb|Video from the TSA explaining the procedure]]
[[Schiphol]] in the [[Netherlands]] was the first [[airport]] in the world to implement this device on a large scale after a test with flight personnel the previous year. On May 15, 2007 two of 17 purchased security scans were installed. 

Full-body scanners was installed in at least one Florida courthouse in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/05/feds_pervscan/ Feds admit storing pervscanner pics], The Register, August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and have started to appear in courthouses around the US.&lt;ref&gt;Banda, P.

''Associated Press'' via news.yahoo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one New Jersey [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train station used full-body scanners during a two-week trial in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsoncity.net/tubes/securitytesting.html PATH train riders to face anti-terror screening: PATH Trains Hudson Tubes Hudson &amp; Manhattan RR].

As of September 3, 2014, [[Transportation Security Administration]] reported that there were almost 740 Millimeter Wave AIT (Advanced Imaging Technology) &lt;sup&gt;[meaning needed]&lt;/sup&gt; scanners now in use at 160 United States airports &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061725/http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/advanced-imaging-technology-ait Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)]. tsa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Government also hinted in 2010 at the possibility of deploying the full body scanners at train stations and subways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/now-body-scanners-could-be-deployed-at-us-train-stations-subways-other-mass-transits-news-international-kl0rkpdbgja.html|title='Now 'body scanners' could be deployed at US train stations, subways, other mass transits'|publisher=sify|date=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government had planned to install full-body scanners at all airport and train stations throughout the country, but announced in September 2010 plans to remove the scanners from airports, calling them "slow and ineffective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/italy-to-abandon-airport-body-scanners-20100924-15pgu.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Italy to abandon airport body scanners | date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has stated in 2010 they "[have] not, will not and the machines cannot store images of passengers at airports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/08/tsa-response-to-feds-admit-storing.html |title=The TSA Blog: TSA Response to “Feds admit storing checkpoint body scan images” |publisher=Blog.tsa.gov |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the TSA later disclosed, in a response to the house chair on homeland security, that its procurement of airport scanners requires manufacturers to include image storage and transmission features but that these features should be disabled before being placed in an airport. The TSA shows 45 individuals have the ability to turn these machines into 'test mode' which enables recording images, but states that they would never do this on a production system.&lt;ref&gt;Rossides, Gale D. (February 24, 2010) [https://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/TSA_Reply_House.pdf Letter to Bennie G. Thompson]. &lt;/ref&gt; The US Marshal Service did operate a backscatter machine in a courthouse which records images. However, in a statement they noted that only individuals involved in a test were recorded. A sample of these images was received and disseminated by Gizmodo in 2010, using a Freedom Of Information Request.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40218074/ns/technology_and_science-security|title=Leaked U.S. Marshal body scan images revealed|author=Rothman, Wilson |publisher=MSN|date=November 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the US Marshal service has put these new scanning machines, that have recording capabilities, into production.

The analyst is in a different room and is not supposed to be able to see the person being scanned by the Backscatter X-Ray AIT, but is in contact with other officials who can halt the scanned person if anything suspicious shows up on the scan.

In the U.S. TSA currently uses Millimeter Wave AIT scanners exclusively, which show no identifying characteristics of the person being scanned. Instead, a generic outline of a person is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150503061337/http://www.tsa.gov/ait-how-it-works AIT: How it Works].

The [[European Union]] currently allows member states to decide whether to implement full body scanners in their countries:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/aviation-security.56u/ Member States must decide on airport body scanners: EC – EU business news].

In Australia the Government has decided a no opt-out policy will be enforced in relation to screening at airports. Persons with medical or physical conditions that prevent them from undertaking a body scan will be offered alternative screening methods suitable to their circumstances.

The implementation of widespread full-body scanners has raised a public controversy.

===Health concerns===
There have been health concerns relating to the use of full body scanning technology, especially the use of x-ray scanners.

====Millimeter wave scanners====
{{Main article|Millimeter wave scanner}}
Currently adopted millimeter wave scanners operate in the millimeter or sub-terahertz band, using [[non-ionizing radiation]], and have no proven adverse health effects, though no long term studies have been done.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt; Thomas S. Tenforde, president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, said in 2010 that millimeter wave scanners are probably within bounds [of standards for safe operation], but there should be an effort to verify that they are safe for frequent use.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes |first=John C. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/safety/content/article/113619/1509059 |title=Whole-body airport scanners are basically safe—or are they? |publisher=Diagnosticimaging.com |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO (World Health Organization) in 2011 categorized RF (radio frequency) radiation as a possible carcinogen,&lt;ref name=Wall Street Journal,10-3-14.

Numerical simulations of [[terahertz radiation]], which active millimeter wave scanners do not operate at, have produced mixed results. Researchers at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico have used simulations to show a way that terahertz radiation may affect DNA
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexandrov|first1=B.S.|title= DNA Breathing Dynamics in the Presence of a Terahertz Field|journal=Physics Letters A|date=October 29, 2009|volume=374|issue=10|pages=1214|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2009.12.077|pmid=20174451|pmc=2822276|arxiv=0910.5294 |bibcode=2010PhLA..374.1214A}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this has not been verified.

====Backscatter X-ray scanners====
In the United States, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required that all full-body scanners operated in airports by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] use "Automated Target Recognition" software, which replaces the picture of a nude body with the cartoon-like representation.&lt;ref name="abandons"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/tsa-abandons-nude-scanners/|title=TSA Pulls Plug on Airport Nude Body Scanners |date= 2013-01-18| first=David | last=Kravets}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this law, all backscatter X-ray machines formerly in use by the Transportation Security Administration were removed from airports by May 2013, since the agency said the vendor (Rapiscan) did not meet their contractual deadline to implement the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Rapiscan backscatter contract | date=Jan 2013 | publisher=TSA | format= [[World wide Web]] log | url= http://blog.tsa.gov/2013/01/rapiscan-backscatter-contract.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, backscatter X-ray screening of airline passengers was banned in 2012 to protect passenger safety, and the deployment at [[Manchester Airport]] was removed.

The health effects of the more common millimeter wave scanner are largely unknown, and at least one expert believes a safety study is warranted. "I am very interested in performing a National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements study on the use of millimeter-wave security screening systems," said Thomas S. Tenforde, council president. However, no long-term studies have been done on the health effects of millimeter wave scanners.

Perhaps the most notable and debated professional opinion in regard to the safety of scanners is the so-called "Holdren Letter" from a number of world-renowned biochemists and biophysics researchers from the University of California to the Assistant to the US President for Science and Technology, Dr. John P. Holdren (Co-author of EcoSolutions). The opening paragraph of their letter of concern reads: "We, a number of University of California, San Francisco faculty, are writing—see attached memo—to call your attention to our concerns about the potential serious health risks of the recently adopted whole body back scatter X-ray airport security scanners. This is an urgent situation as these X-ray scanners are rapidly being implemented as a primary screening step for all air travel passengers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://shadowproof.com/letter-from-john-w-sedat-et-al-on-the-dangers-of-tsa-backscatter-scanners/ Letter from John W.

Critics of backscatter x-ray scanners, including the head of the [[Center for Radiological Research]] at [[Columbia University]], say that the radiation emitted by some full-body scanners is as much as 20 times stronger than officially reported and is not safe to use on large numbers of persons because of an increased risk of cancer to children and at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport-body-scanners-could-give-you-cancer.html|title=Airport body scanners 'could give you cancer'|author=Bloxham, Andy |publisher=The Telegraph|location=London|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/health/Some |title=Some full-body scanners not without cancer risk: Experts |publisher=Canwest News Service |author=Tam, Pauline |date=January 22, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115144315/http://www.canada.com/health/Some+full+body+scanners+without+cancer+risk+Experts/2472370/story.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292414|date=May 23, 2010 |title=Radiation from airport scanners may increase cancer risk|author=Lindner, Bill |publisher=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], (UCSF) have argued that the amount of radiation is higher than claimed by the TSA and body scanner manufacturers because the doses were calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, but the radiation from backscatter x-ray scanners is focused on just the skin and surrounding tissues:&lt;ref name="scribd.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Scott. (May 18, 2010) [http://www.gadling.com/2010/05/18/scientists-question-safety-of-airport-full-body-scanners/ Scientists question safety of airport full body scanners]. Gadling.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/radiation The risk of 'low dose radiation is controversial']. Radiology.ucsf.edu (February 14, 2010). Retrieved on 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of [the scanners'] energy is delivered to the skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.

The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.

In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant radiation quantity, the Flux [photons per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device)] has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However other professors in the UCSF radiology department disagree, saying that the radiation dose is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/11/tsa_scanner_controversy_ucsf_r.php|title=TSA Scanners: U.C.

"People who are totally unrelated to radiation wrote it. ... It was senior faculty at UCSF. They're smart people and well-intended, but their conclusions, I think, were off-base. They don't understand how radiation translates to an actual dose in the human body".

Dr. Steve Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, and president of Tek84, one of the companies that produces the machines, has stated that the concerns of Dr. Brenner and UCSF Scientists regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners are incorrect. He states the values used for X-ray penetration were incorrectly based on the description of the imaging depth which describes what the instrument sees and is a few mm into the skin and the dosage depth which is deeper. He describes experimental proof that the X-rays have the same properties as any other X-Rays and the penetration is correct to be averaged over the whole body. Dr. Smith has provided measured data from an operating body scanner to explain his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf re: Misinformation on airport body scanner radiation safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203604/http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}.

Scanners also concentrate the dose in time, because they deliver a high dose-rate at the moment of exposure. High dose-rate exposure has been shown to cause greater damage than the same radiation dose delivered at lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8140(86)80181-5|title=Dose-rate effects and the repair of radiation damage|year=1986|last1=Gordonsteel|first1=G|last2=Down|first2=J|last3=Peacock|first3=J|last4=Stephens|first4=T|journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=321–31|pmid=3726169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises further questions about comparisons to background radiation.

The FDA report states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since general-use x-ray systems emit ionizing radiation, the societal benefit of reliably detecting threats must be sufficient to outweigh the potential radiation risk, if any, to the individual screened. The dose from one screening with a general-use x-ray security screening system is so low that it presents an extremely small risk to any individual. To put the radiation dose received into perspective:
* Naturally occurring ionizing radiation is all around us. We are continuously exposed to this background radiation during ordinary living. In 42 minutes of ordinary living, a person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources than from screening with any general-use x-ray security system.
* The national radiation safety standard (see below) sets a dose per screening limit for the general-use category. To meet the requirements of the general-use category a full-body x-ray security system must deliver less than the dose a person receives during 4 minutes of airline flight. TSA has set their dose limit to ensure a person receives less radiation from one scan with a TSA general-use x-ray security system than from 2 minutes of airline flight.
* A person would have to be screened more than a thousand times in one year in order to exceed the annual radiation dose limit for people screening that has been set by expert radiation safety organizations (see below).
* Millimeter wave security systems which comply with the limits set in the applicable national non-ionizing radiation safety standard (see below) cause no known adverse health effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. David Brenner, head of Columbia University's center for radiological research, said although the danger posed to the individual passenger is "very low", he is urging researchers to carry out more tests on the device to look at the way it affects specific groups who could be more sensitive to radiation. 

Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University, has made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;: "A passenger would need to be scanned using a backscatter scanner, from both the front and the back, about 200,000 times to receive the amount of radiation equal to one typical CT scan," said Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. "Another way to look at this is that if you were scanned with a backscatter scanner every day of your life, you would still only receive a tenth of the dose of a typical CT scan," he said. "By comparison, the amount of radiation from a backscatter scanner is equivalent to about 10 minutes of natural background radiation in the United States", Einstein said. "I believe that the general public has nothing to worry about in terms of the radiation from airline scanning," he added. "For moms-to-be, no evidence supports an increased risk of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities from these scanners", Einstein added. "A pregnant woman will receive much more radiation from cosmic rays she is exposed to while flying than from passing through a scanner in the airport," he claimed.

In May 2010 the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements issued a press release in response to the health risk claims from UCSF and Columbia University (claims of excessive skin dose and risks to large populations vs. individuals). The NCRP claims that cancer risks cited by opponents are completely inaccurate, stating that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrponline.org/Press_Rel/Commentaries/Comm_16_Press_Release.pdf Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage Radiotherapy Facilities].

&lt;blockquote&gt; the summation of trivial average risks over very large populations or time periods into a single value produces a distorted image of risk, completely out of perspective with risks accepted every day, both voluntarily and involuntarily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that

&lt;blockquote&gt;general-use systems should adhere to an effective dose of 0.1 microsievert (μSv) (0.01 millirem) or less per scan, and can be used mostly without regard to the number of individuals scanned or the number of scans per individual in a year. An effective dose of 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem) per scan would allow 2,500 scans of an individual annually [i.e., if each scan required 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem)] without exceeding the administrative control of 0.25 mSv (25 mrem) to a member of the general public for a single source or set of sources under one control. Assuming 250 workdays per year, this would correspond to an average of 10 scans each day, a frequency that is unlikely to be encountered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the same the [[Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safety]] which includes the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] and the [[World Health Organization]], reported that, "Pregnant women and children should not be subject to scanning, even though the radiation dose from body scanners is 'extremely small'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aoG.YbbvnkzU&amp;pos=11|title=Airport Body Scanning Raises Radiation Exposure, Committee Says|author=Tirone, Jonathan |publisher=Bloomberg|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. The researchers write:&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35498347/UCSF-letter-to-Holdren-concerning-health-risks-of-full-body-scanner-TSA-screenings-4-6-2010 UCSF letter to Holdren concerning health risks of full body scanner TSA screenings 4-6-2010].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, there are a number of 'red flags' related to the hardware itself. Because this device can scan a human in a few seconds, the X-ray beam is very intense. Any glitch in power at any point in the hardware (or more importantly in software) that stops the device could cause an intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin. Who will oversee problems with overall dose after repair or software problems? The TSA is already complaining about resolution limitations; who will keep the manufacturers and/or TSA from just raising the dose, an easy way to improve signal-to-noise and get higher resolution? Lastly, given the recent incident (on December 25th), how do we know whether the manufacturer or TSA, seeking higher resolution, will scan the groin area more slowly leading to a much higher total dose?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of backscatter X-ray scanners argue that the [[ANSI N43.17 standard]] addresses safety requirements and engineering design of the systems to prevent the occurrence of accidental high radiation due to defects and errors in hardware and software. Safety requirements include "fail-safe" controls, multiple overlapping interlocks and engineering design to ensure that failure of any systems result in safe or non-operation of the system to reduce the chance of accidental exposures. Furthermore, TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI N43.17 (2009) section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} But there are cases where types of medical scanning machines, operated by trained medical personnel, have malfunctioned, causing serious injury to patients that were scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/health/01radiation.html|title=After Stroke Scans, Patients Face Serious Health Risks|author=Bogdanich, Walt |publisher=New York Times|date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of full-body scanners cite these incidents as examples of how radiation-based scanning machines can overdose people with radiation despite all safety precautions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-stanley/full-body-scanners-from-a_b_694466.html Jay Stanley: Full Body Scanners: From Airports to the Streets?].

===Ineffectiveness===
Some critics suggest that full-body scanner technology is ineffective for multiple reasons, including that they can easily be bypassed and a study published in the November 2010 edition of the ''Journal of Transportation Security'' suggested terrorists might fool the Rapiscan machines and others like it employing the X-ray "backscatter" technique. A terrorist, the report found, could tape a thin film of explosives of about 15–20 centimeters in diameter to the stomach and walk through the machine undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/scanners-part3/ |title=Airport 'Nude' Body Scanners: Are They Effective? |publisher=Wired.com |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSA's expansion of scanning program===

Forbes magazine reported, in March 2011, that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/02/docs-reveal-tsa-plan-to-body-scan-pedestrians-train-passengers|title=Documents Reveal TSA Research Proposal To Body-Scan Pedestrians, Train Passengers|author=Greenberg, Andy |date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/09/tsa-never-tested-full-body-scans-for-mass-transit-except-when-it-did|title=TSA Never Tested Full-Body Scans For Mass Transit, Except When It Did|author=Greenberg, Andy |publisher=Forbes|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Newly uncovered documents show that as early as 2006, the Department of Homeland Security has been planning pilot programs to deploy mobile scanning units that can be set up at public events and in train stations, along with mobile x-ray vans capable of scanning pedestrians on city streets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that the TSA had research proposals to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;bring full-body scanners to train stations, mass transit, and public events. Contracts included in the EPIC release showed plans to develop long-range scans that could assess what a subject carried from 30 feet away, along with studies that involved systems for x-ray scanners mounted in vans and "covert" scans of pedestrians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="No nudity" full-body scanner===
The new software for scanners has been applied by US Aviation Security, so the new full-body scanner will not give image of nudity of the person who is scanned to the operators of the scanner, but only give the image as a generic male or female figure with no features. Opponents of full body scanners still consider this to be an unconstitutional strip search, because even though the operators see an edited version of the image, a naked image is still captured by the machine, and there is no guarantee that the Government or private companies won't store the images in the case that a terrorist attack were successful.

This type of software has been applied at Washington, Atlanta and Las Vegas airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halsey |first=Ashley |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2015670654_nudescanners21.html |title=New airport software to end naked scanner images |publisher=Seattletimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our top priority is the safety of the traveling public, and TSA constantly strives to explore and implement new technologies that enhance security and strengthen privacy protections for the traveling public," TSA Administrator John Pistole stated. "This software upgrade enables us to continue providing a high level of security through advanced imaging technology screening, while improving the passenger experience at checkpoints." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hachman|first=Mark|title=No more 'naked' full body airport scans after TSA upgrade|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388855,00.asp|publisher=PCMAG|accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical countermeasures==
Some people wish to prevent either the loss of privacy or the possibility of health problems or genetic damage that might be associated with being subjected to a backscatter X-ray scan. One company sells X-ray absorbing underwear which is said to have X-ray absorption equivalent to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockyflatsgear.com/ |title=Rocky Flats Gear X-ray protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901143535/http://www.rockyflatsgear.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another product, Flying Pasties, is "...&amp;nbsp;designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners", but its description does not seem to claim any protection from the X-ray beam penetrating the body of the person being scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingpasties.com/ |title=Flying Pasties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601134012/http://flyingpasties.com/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5565">'''Hezbollah social services''' are social development programs organized by the Lebanese paramilitary group, [[Hezbollah]]. Hezbollah's popularity among the Lebanese Shiite population, historically one of the poorest communities in Lebanon, comes partly from the social services it provides. Social services have a central role in the party's programs, closely linked to its military and politico-religious functions.  

Most experts believe that Hezbollah's social and health programs are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually.&lt;ref name="irinnews52494"&gt;{{cite web

|date=2006-03-29
|accessdate=2006-08-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[think tank]] [[Council on Foreign Relations]] also said that Hezbollah "is a major provider of social services, operating schools, hospitals, and agricultural services for thousands of Lebanese Shiites."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;http://rt.com/Politics/2010-07-08/tweet-editor-internet-inquisition.html?fullstory{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fastfacts"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203277,00.html "Fast Facts: Hezbollah."] ''Fox News''. 13 July 2006. 8 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansiveness of these services has helped Hezbollah remain deeply embedded in Lebanese society.

== Summary ==
Hezbollah organizes an extensive social development program and runs hospitals, news services, educational facilities, and encouragement of [[Nikah mut‘ah]].&lt;ref name="irinnews52494"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/25/the_militarization_of_sex "The Militarization of Sex: The story of Hezbollah's halal hookups." by Hanin Ghaddar], ''Foreign Policy'', November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its established institutions are: Emdad committee for Islamic Charity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/emdad/index.html Emdad committee for Islamic Charity]&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah Central Press Office, Al Jarha Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/jarha/index.html Al Jarha Association]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jihad Al Binna|Jihad Al Binaa Developmental Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/jihad-el-binna/index.html Jehad Al Benaa Developmental Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Jihad Al Binna's Reconstruction Campaign is responsible for numerous economic and infrastructure development projects in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="sachs"&gt;Sachs, Susan.

In March 2006, an IRIN news report of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted:

"Hezbollah not only has armed and political wings - it also boasts an extensive social development program. Hezbollah currently operates at least four hospitals, twelve clinics, twelve schools and two agricultural centres that provide farmers with technical assistance and training. It also has an environmental department and an extensive social assistance program. Medical care is also cheaper than in most of the country's private hospitals and free for Hezbollah members".&lt;ref name="irinnews52494"/&gt;

According to CNN: "Hezbollah did everything that a government should do, from collecting the garbage to running hospitals and repairing schools."&lt;ref name="cnn20060724-1"&gt;{{cite news|author=CNN|date=2006-07-25|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/schuster.hezbollah/index.html|title=Hezbollah's secret weapon|accessdate=2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, during the war with Israel, when there was no running water in [[Beirut]], Hezbollah was arranging supplies around the city. "People here [in South Beirut] see Hezbollah as a political movement and a social service provider as much as it is a militia, in this traditionally poor and dispossessed Shiite community."&lt;ref name="cnn20060724-1"/&gt; Also, after the war it competed with the Lebanese government to reconstruct destroyed areas. According to analysts like American University Professor Judith Palmer Harik, [[Jihad Al Binna|Jihad al-Binaa]] has won the initial battle of hearts and minds, in large part because they are the most experienced in Lebanon in the field of reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jackson Allers | date=September 12, 2006 | url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=34687 | title=Hezbollah Ahead of Govt Again | work=ipsnews.net | accessdate=2007-05-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310161043/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=34687 | archivedate=March 10, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">The '''Italians of Crimea''' are a small ethnic minority residing in [[Crimea]].

==History==
Ancestors of the Italians populated some areas of Ukraine and Crimea since the time of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Republic of Genoa]] and the [[Republic of Venice]]. Some sources affirm that in Odessa, at the end of the 18th century, one inhabitant in ten was Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucraini.org.ua/?page_id=237 Storia degli italiani in Ucraina e Crimea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180533/http://www.ucraini.org.ua/?page_id=237 |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 and 1870 two distinct migrations arrived in [[Kerch]] from the cities of [[Trani]], [[Bisceglie]] e [[Molfetta]]. These migrants were peasants and sailors, attracted by the job opportunities in the local Crimean seaports and by the possibility to cultivate the almost virgin and fertile Crimean lands. Italian general and patriot [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] worked as a sailor at least twice in the region of Odessa, between 1825 and 1833.
 
In Kerch they built a catholic church, still locally known as the Church of the Italians. From Kerch the Italians moved to [[Feodosiya]] (the former [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colony of [[Caffa]]), [[Simferopol]], [[Mariupol]] and to other Russian seaports of Crimea, such as [[Batumi]] and [[Novorossiysk]].

In the beginning of the 20th century the Italian community was numerous enough to have a primary school and a library. The local newspaper ''Kerčenskij Rabocij'' at that time used to publish articles in Italian. According to the information contained in the Ukrainian statistics archives, the Italians resident in Kerch accounted in 1897 to 1,8% of the population and in 1921 to 2% for a total of 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Page 6 of Giulia Giacchetti Boiko - Giulio Vignoli, ''L'olocausto sconosciuto. Lo sterminio degli Italiani di Crimea'' (Edizioni Settimo Sigillo, Roma, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Deportation===
After the [[Russian Revolution]], many Italians were considered [[fascists]] and forced to move to Italy. 

Between 1920 and 1930 many antifascist Italians seeking asylum in [[Soviet Union]] were sent from Moscow to Kerch to organise the local Italian community. According to the plans of Soviet [[collective farming]], the Italians were forced to create a [[kolkhoz]] called [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Sacco e Vanzetti]]. Those refusing to comply were forced to leave or were deported. According to 1933 census the number of Italians in the region of Kerch had already dropped by 1,3%.

Between 1936 and 1938, during Stalin's [[Great Purge]], many Italians were accused of [[espionage]] and literally disappeared.

When in 1942 the [[Wehrmacht]] conquered Ukraine and Crimea, the Italian ethnic minority was deported to Asia with the same modalities of the [[Volga Germans]], who had already been deported in August 1941. The entire Italian community, including the antifascists settling in the 20s was gathered and sent to [[Kazakhstan]] in sealed trains. The trip started on the 29 January 1942 and lasted until March, when the convoy arrived in [[Atbasar]] and the prisoners were moved to labour camps. Half of the convoy (including all the children) died during the trip, as well as many others during the detention in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;Giulia Giacchetti Boiko, Giulio Vignoli - ''La tragedia sconosciuta degli Italiani di Crimea - Neisvestnaja traghedija italianzev Kryma - Nevidoma traghedija italijzev Krymu'' (Kerch, 2007). Text in Italian, Russian and Ukrainian&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The few survivors were allowed to return to Kerch under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s regency. Some families dispersed in other territories of Soviet Union, mainly in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

==Italians of Crimea today==
The descendants of the survival Italians of Crimea account today to 300 people, mainly resident in Kerch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladante.it/?q=comunicatistampa/italiani-perseguitati-da-stalin-e-poi-dimenticati-crimea Italiani perseguitati da Stalin e poi dimenticati, [[Il Giornale]], 23 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koothu''' or '''Therukoothu''' ({{lang-ta|கூத்து}}), is an ancient art, where artists play songs with dance and music in storytelling the epics, performed in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]; it is a folk art originated from the early [[Tamil country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovertamilnadu.net/tamilnadu%20dances.html Dance forms of Tamilnadu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814040440/http://discovertamilnadu.net/tamilnadu%20dances.html |date=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html Tamilnadu.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619060246/http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html |date=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But more precisely Koothu refers to either [[Terukuttu]] ([[tamil language|Tamil]]:தெருக்கூத்து) or [[Kattaikkuttu]]. The terms [[Terukkuttu]] and [[Kattaikkuttu]] are often used interchangeably in modern times; however, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while Terukkuttu referred to mobile performances in a procession, Kattaikkuttu denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space. Koothu as a form of entertainment reached its peak hundreds of years ago in [[Tamil Nadu]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maduraimessenger.org/printed-version/2010/april/therukoothu-the-people-s-art/ Madurai Messenger - Times of Madurai - April 2010 : Therukoothu: The People’s Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned in the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] texts about the development of iyal (literature), isai (music) and natagam (drama).  Going beyond just a means of entertainment, koothu educates the rural people about religion and their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html |title=Therukoothu |publisher=Tamilnadu.com |date=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619060246/http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koothu is an informal dance structure, the performances generally depict scenes from ancient epics like Ramayana, Mahabharatha and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] other classical epics. There are traditionally no dialogues, only songs instead. Artists are trained to sing in their own voice and in a high pitch to reach the entire crowd, since no amplification technology is used. The artists are dressed up with complex heavy costumes and have a very bright elaborated makeup. They put on towering head dresses, sparkling shoulder plates and wide colorful skirts. Traditionally this theatre form has been predominately male, though in modern times more females have been included (e.g., Girl's theatre at the [[Kattaikkuttu]] Gurukulam).

Types of koothu&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/tamilnadu/music-and-dance/theru-koothu.html Theru Koothu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622055107/http://www.mapsofindia.com/tamilnadu/music-and-dance/theru-koothu.html |date=2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes Nattu Koothu, Kuravai Koothu, and Valli Koorhu, which are about the state and culture of different peoples in Tamil country; Samaya Koothu showcase religious topics, while Porkaala Koothu, Pei Koothu, Thunangai Koothu are focused on the martial arts and war of the country. Another important art form viz, Chakyar koothu is very popular in Kerala. There is mention of this koothu in [[Silappatikaram]].
[[File:Kovalan.jpg|thumb|An artist depicting [[Kovalan]]]]
In years past there were no formal training institutions, schools or [[nattuvanar]] (teacher) for koothu. Now to encourage the dying art there are some workshops for koothu called ''koothu pattarai'', and also some dedicated schools (e.g., [[Kattaikkuttu]] Gurukulam).

It is very popular among the rural areas and has remained relatively unchanged even in modern times. Koothu eventually spread out from Tamil Nadu into most of south India, particularly Karnataka and Kerala.

The deity at the [[Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram]] is known from the [[Sangam period]] as "Thillai Koothan", the cosmic dancer of Thillai; the Sanskrit translation of this is [[Nataraja]].

== Outside India==

As the Tamils diaspora migrated abroad to different areas such as [[Mauritius]] , [[Re-union]] , [[Guyana]] and [[Fiji]] during British and French Colonial times, they took this kuthu dance form to their new settlements therby promoting it's growth universally.

In Fiji - this Therukootu is known as Tirikutu.

The [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]] refers to the Han 漢 people which is often misunderstood as Han Chinese, are the largest ethnic group, where (as of 2010) some 91.51%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Han Chinese proportion in China's population drops: census data (2011-04-28)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/28/c_13849933.htm|website=Xinhua News (English)|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711022113/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/28/c_13849933.htm|archivedate=11 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population was classified as Han (~1.2 billion). Han is the name the Chinese have used for themselves since the Han Dynasty BC 202, whereas the name "Chinese" (used in the West) is of uncertain origin, but possibly derives ultimately from Sanskrit Cina-s "the Chinese," perhaps from the Qin dynasty. Besides the [[Han-Chinese]] majority of 92%, 55 other ethnic (minority) groups are categorized in present China, numbering approximately 105 million people (8%), mostly concentrated in the bordering northwest, north, northeast, south, and southwest but with some in central interior areas.

The major [[minority ethnic groups in China]] are [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] (16.9 million), [[Hui people|Hui]] (10.5 million), [[Manchu people|Manchu]] (10.3 million), [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] (10 million), [[Miao people|Miao]] (9.4 million), [[Yi people|Yi]] (8.7 million), [[Tujia people|Tujia]] (8.3 million), [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] (6.2 million), [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] (5.9 million), [[Dong people|Dong]] (2.8 million), [[Buyei people|Buyei]] (2.8 million), [[Yao people|Yao]] (2.7 million), [[Bai people|Bai]] (1.9 million), [[Koreans in China|Korean]] (1.8 million), [[Hani people|Hani]] (1.6 million), [[Li people|Li]] (1.4 million), [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] (1.4 million), and [[Dai people|Dai]] (1.2 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/pcsj/rkpc/6rp/indexch.htm|title=index|author=|date=|website=www.stats.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taiwanese aborigines ==
{{Main|Taiwanese Aborigines}}
{{POV section|date=October 2015}}

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] government officially refers to all [[Taiwanese aborigines]] ({{zh|c=[[wikt:原住民族|原住民族]]|hp=Yuánzhùmínzú}}),  as ''Gaoshan'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:高山族|高山族]]|hp=Gāoshānzú}}), whereas the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) recognizes 16 groups of Taiwanese aborigines. The term ''Gaoshan'' has a different connotation in Taiwan than it does in [[mainland China]]. While several thousands of these aborigines have migrated to [[Fujian]] province in mainland China, most remain in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/guoqing/2015-07/24/content_2902200.htm|title=高山族_中国概况_中国政府网|first=|last=曹晓轩|date=|website=www.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the contested [[Political status of Taiwan|political status]] and [[legal status of Taiwan]], the PRC classification of Taiwanese aborigines may be controversial.

{{citation needed span|[[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese Han]] "blood nationalists"|date=February 2016}} have in the past claimed that they have [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|Plains Aboriginal]] ({{zh|c=[[wikt:平埔族|平埔族]]|hp=Píngpuzú}}), ancestry in order to promote [[Taiwan independence]], claiming an identity different from that of mainland Chinese. However, genetic tests showed differences between them and plains aborigines, and given that they usually were recent migrants, their claims were rejected by descendants of Taiwanese Plains Aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Chen|first=Shu-Juo|title=How Han are Taiwanese Han?

[[File:Beijing-Niujie-Minzu-Tuanjie-Da-Jiating-3666.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Part of a poster in Beijing showing the 56 ethnic groups of China]]
This is a list of ethnic groups in China that are not officially recognized by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].
* [[Äynu people]] (艾努人 ''Àinǔ rén'')

* [[Tuvans]] (图瓦人 ''Túwǎ rén'')
* [[Waxiang people|Waxiang]] (瓦乡人 ''Wǎxiāng rén'')
* [[History of the Jews in China|Jews]] (犹太人 / 猶太人 ''Yóutài rén'') (Jewish people of China and Jews in general)
* [[Yamato people|Yamatos]] (大和民族 ''Dàhé mínzú'') and [[Ryukyuans]] (琉球民族 ''Liúqiú mínzú'') living as permanent residents in [[Taiwan]] and [[Northeast China]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* [[Macanese people|Macanese]] (土生葡人 ''Tǔshēng pú rén''), mixed race Catholic [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speakers who lived in [[Macau]] since 16th century of various ethnic origins
* [[Utsuls]] (回辉人 ''Huíhuī rén''), descendants of [[Cham people|Cham]] Muslims who fled [[History of the Cham–Vietnamese wars|Vietnamese invasions]] of [[Champa]]

During the [[Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]] (2000), 734,438 persons in the Chinese mainland, 97% of them in [[Guizhou]], were specifically recorded as belonging to "Undistinguished ethnic groups".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/renkoupucha/2000pucha/html/t0106.htm 第五次人口普查数据(2000年). 表1—6. 省、自治区、直辖市分性别、民族的人口] ( [[Fifth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]] (2000). Table 1-6: Population of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities by ethnicity). {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, other members of such groups may have been counted within larger "recognized" groups.

== Ethnic groups in Hong Kong and Macau ==
{{see also|Demographics of Hong Kong|Demographics of Macau}}

[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]s of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The governments of Hong Kong and Macau do not use the official PRC ethnic classification system, nor does the PRC's official classification system take ethnic groups in Hong Kong and Macau into account. As a result, minority groups such as Europeans (mainly English), and South or Southeast Asians (mainly Filipinos, Indians, Indonesians, Nepalese, and Pakistanis) live in Hong Kong.

==1722 to 1797==
Between Peter I's decree on the succession to the throne of 16 February 1722 and [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]'s decree of 15 May 1797, the Emperor had the right to name his or her own successor.  All heirs in this period were nominated by the reigning monarch, rather than holding the position by right of inheritance.  Despite Peter the Great's modification of the law to allow nomination of a successor by the monarch, neither he nor his two immediate successors ever nominated an heir, and Catherine I, Peter II, and Anna were all chosen irregularly, after the death of their predecessor.  In addition, Ivan VI, who had not named a successor, was deposed in a coup, while Peter III, who was deposed and murdered after a coup, was succeeded not by his son Paul, his chosen successor, but by his wife, who became Catherine II.

|}

==1797 to 1917==

In 1797, Emperor Paul modified the laws of succession, abolishing the Petrine law and establishing in its place a law establishing [[semi-Salic]] succession among his own descendants.  This law remained until the abolition of the monarchy.

Although Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich renounced his claims to the throne in 1820, he did so secretly, and so was still widely viewed as heir to the throne until his older brother's death in 1825.  At the death of Alexander I, the next brother, who would become Nicholas I, deferred his claims until his older brother Constantine renounced once again, but after Constantine's second renunciation he claimed to have taken the throne immediately upon Alexander's death.

She is famous for hits such as "[[You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)]]", "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) (song)|Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]",  "[[One's on the Way]]", "[[Fist City]]", and "[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]" along with the [[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|1980 biographical film]] of the same name.

She is the most awarded female country recording artist and the only female ACM Artist of the Decade (1970s).

She is recognized by the strength and quality of her voice still today, as well as her down to earth, quick wit and humor.

==Early years==
Lynn was born Loretta Webb on April 14, 1932 in [[Butcher Hollow, Kentucky]]. She is the eldest daughter and second child born to Clara Marie "Clary" (née Ramey; 1912–1981) and Melvin Theodore "Ted" Webb (1906–1959). Ted was a [[coal miner]] and [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmer]].&lt;ref name="Official website"&gt;[http://www.lorettalynn.com Official Loretta Lynn website]. Accessed May 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Webb children:

* Melvin "Junior" Webb (December 4, 1929 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1993)
* Herman Webb (September 3, 1934 &amp;ndash; July 28, 2018)
* [[Jay Lee Webb|Willie "Jay" Lee Webb]] (February 12, 1937 &amp;ndash; July 31, 1996)
* Donald Ray Webb (April 2, 1941 &amp;ndash; October 13, 2017)
* [[Peggy Sue (singer)|Peggy Sue Wright]] (née Webb; born March 25, 1943)
* Betty Ruth Hopkins (née Webb; born 1946)
* [[Crystal Gayle]] (born Brenda Gail Webb; January 9, 1951)

Loretta's father died at age of 52 of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] a few years after he relocated to [[Wabash, Indiana]] with wife Clary and his younger children.

==Path to stardom==
On January 10, 1948, 15-year-old &lt;!--do not change 15 to 13; please read the cited article--&gt;Loretta Webb married [[Oliver Lynn|Oliver Vanetta "Doolittle" Lynn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/story/2012-05-18/loretta-lynn/55068814/1|title=AP: Country singer Loretta Lynn married at 15, not 13|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (August 27, 1926 &amp;ndash; August 22, 1996), and the two soon relocated to northern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The happiness and heartache of her early years of marriage would help to inspire Lynn's songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lubbockonline.com/stories/100500/ent_100500008.shtml Profile], lubbockonline.com; accessed July 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Doolittle bought her a $17 [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Don|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/things-do/going-out/music/2011-06-08/lynns-road-stardom-started-17-guitar|title=Lynn's road to stardom started with $17 guitar|newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught herself to play the instrument, and over the following three years, she worked to improve her guitar playing. With Doolittle's encouragement, she started her own band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, with her brother Jay Lee playing lead guitar. She often appeared at Bill's Tavern in [[Blaine, Washington]], and the Delta Grange Hall in [[Custer, Washington]], with the Pen Brothers' band and the Westerneers. She cut her first record, "[[I'm a Honky Tonk Girl]]", in February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/307891/loretta-lynn/biography|title=Loretta Lynn – Biography |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a part of the country music scene in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the 1960s. In 1967 she had the first of 16 number-one hits (out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner).&lt;ref name="Loretta Lynn at CMT.com"&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lynn_loretta/bio.jhtml Loretta Lynn at CMT.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Her later hits include "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) (song)|Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]", "[[You Ain't Woman Enough]]", "[[Fist City]]", and "[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]".&lt;ref name="Coal Miner's Daughter, p. 73"&gt;''Coal Miner's Daughter''. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn focused on blue-collar women's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses; her music was inspired by issues that she faced in her marriage. She pushed boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control ("[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]"), repeated childbirth ("[[One's on the Way]]"), double standards for men and women ("[[Rated "X"|Rated 'X']]"), and being widowed by the draft during the [[Vietnam War]] ("Dear Uncle Sam").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanki|first=Juli|title=20 Most Controversial Songs by Women|url=http://www.engine145.com/20-most-controversial-songs-by-women|publisher=Engine 145|accessdate=April 6, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104144/http://www.engine145.com/20-most-controversial-songs-by-women/|archivedate=April 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Country music radio stations often refused to play her music, banning nine of her songs, but Lynn pushed on to become one of country music's legendary artists. She and contemporaries like [[Tammy Wynette]] provided a template for female country music artists to follow.

Her best-selling 1976 autobiography, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'', was made into an [[Academy Award]]–winning [[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|film of the same title]] in 1980, starring [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]], with Spacek winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role as Lynn. Her album ''[[Van Lear Rose]]'', released in 2004, was produced by the [[alternative rock]] musician [[Jack White]]; Lynn and White were nominated for five Grammys and won two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grammy.com|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22Loretta+Lynn%22&amp;field_nominee_work_value=&amp;year=2004&amp;genre=All|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/12/loretta-lynn-love-is-the-foundation.html|title=Loretta Lynn - Love Is The Foundation|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn has received numerous awards in country and American music. She was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1983, the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1988, and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2008, and she was honored in 2010 at the [[Academy of Country Music|Country Music Awards]]. She was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2013 (it was also presented to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Bob Dylan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/presidential-medal-of-freedom-honors-diverse-group-of-americans/2013/11/20/7651bcdc-5190-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html|title=Presidential Medal of Freedom honors diverse group of Americans|last=Branigin|first=William|date=2013-11-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn has been a member of the [[The Grand Ole Opry|Grand Ole Opry]] since joining on September 25, 1962; her debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry was on October 15, 1960.

In 2013, Loretta's daughter, Betty Sue, died of [[emphysema]] near Loretta's ranch in Hurricane Mills; she was 64.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt; Two years after her twins Peggy and Patsy were born, Lynn became a grandmother at age 34. She has 27 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren {{as of|2017|August|lc=y}}. Before her marriage, she often sang at churches and in local concerts in Butcher Hollow. She also sang continually to her younger siblings. After she married, Lynn temporarily stopped singing in public and focused on family life. She passed her love of music on to her children, often singing to them the hymns her mother taught her such as "The Great Titanic" and "In The Pines".&lt;ref name="Coal Miner's Daughter, p. 73"/&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

===Marital problems===
The Lynns were married for almost 50 years until Doolittle died at age 69 in 1996. In her 2002 autobiography ''[[Still Woman Enough]]'' and in an interview with [[CBS News]] the same year, she recounted how her husband [[Adultery|cheated]] on her regularly and once left her while she was giving birth.&lt;ref name= CBS&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/10/48hours/main508640.shtml |title= Legends: Loretta Lynn Tells All|work= CBS News|date= December 27, 2002|quote= Her autobiography recounts how once, in a drunken rage, he smashed many jars full of vegetables she had painstakingly canned. |accessdate= February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband fought frequently, but she said that "he never hit me one time that I didn't hit him back twice". Loretta has said that her marriage was "one of the hardest love stories".{{Sfn | Lynn | 2002}}{{Page needed |date=January 2015}} In one of her autobiographies, she recalled:
{{quote| I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special than anyone else in the world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through.{{Sfn | Lynn | 2002 |p = xiii}}}}

===Homes===
Lynn owns a ranch in [[Hurricane Mills, Tennessee]]. Billed as "the 7th Largest Attraction in Tennessee", it features a recording studio, museums, lodging, restaurants, western stores, and more. Traditionally, three holiday concerts have been held annually at the ranch: Memorial Day Weekend, Fourth of July Weekend, and Labor Day Weekend. As Lynn ages, some concerts do not take place.&lt;ref name="LorettaLynn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorettalynn.com/50/?p=2040|title=Loretta Lynn official website|publisher=LorettaLynn.com|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1982, the ranch has hosted [[Loretta Lynn’s Amateur Championship]] motocross race. It's the largest amateur motocross race of its kind. In addition, the ranch hosts [[GNCC Racing]] events. The centerpiece of the ranch is it's large plantation home which Lynn once resided in with her husband and children. She hasn't lived in the [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansion in over 30 years, but her current home is nearby. Lynn regularly greets fans who are touring the plantation house. Also featured is a replica of the cabin in which Lynn grew up in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="LorettaLynn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motosport.com/blog/a-bit-of-loretta-lynns-motocross-history|title=A Bit of Loretta Lynn's Motocross History|website=MotoSports.com|date=July 28, 2014|last=Tuttle|first=Andrew|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Lynn purchased a home in Mexico. When she was not touring, she spent time there with her twin daughters, Patsy and Peggy, and her husband.

Lynn and her husband also bought a cabin in Canada and spent a lot of time there during the 1980s. They purchased the property in the early 1970s as a hunting lodge for Lynn's husband, Doolittle.

===Health issues===
In May 2017, Lynn had a stroke at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. She was taken to a Nashville hospital and subsequently had to cancel all of her upcoming tour dates. Lynn also delayed the release of her new album ''[[Wouldn't It Be Great]]'' until 2018 when she would be well enough to promote it. According to her website, she is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thanki |first=Juli |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/nation-now/2017/05/05/loretta-lynn-hospitalized-after-stroke/312072001/ |title=Loretta Lynn hospitalized after stroke |work=[[USA Today]] |date=May 5, 2017 |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 2018, Loretta fell and broke her hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loretta Lynn In 'Great Spirits' After Breaking Hip in Fall at Home|url=http://people.com/country/loretta-lynn-breaks-hip-fall-at-home-great-spirits/|website=PEOPLE.com|accessdate=20 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==

===1960–1966: Early country success===
Lynn began singing in local clubs in the late 1950s with the help, insistence, and support of her husband. She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers, which included her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a televised talent contest in [[Tacoma, Washington]], hosted by [[Buck Owens]], for which the prize was a wristwatch that broke 24 hours later. (Lynn later laughed about it with Owens.) Lynn's performance was seen by Canadian [[Norm Burley]] of [[Zero Records]], who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing.&lt;ref name=webbio&gt;[http://www.lorettalynn.com/bio "Van Lear Rose"]; accessed February 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zero Records]] president, Canadian [[Don Grashey]], arranged a recording session in [[Hollywood]], where four of Lynn's own compositions were recorded: "I'm A Honky Tonk Girl", "Whispering Sea", "Heartache Meet Mister Blues", and "New Rainbow". Her first release featured "Whispering Sea" and "[[I'm a Honky Tonk Girl]]". She signed her first contract on February 2, 1960, with Zero; the material was recorded at [[United Western Recorders]] in Hollywood, engineered by [[Don Blake]] and produced by Grashey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kochdistribution.com/catalog/moreAudio.aspx?fn=CoverArt&amp;upc=684038811922&amp;item=AUD-CD-8119&amp;Muze=377039&amp;title=Still+Country Koch Entertainment Loretta Lynn Biography].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph Mauro 1995 p. 45"&gt;"Honky Tonk Make Believe", Don Grashy - Co. Joseph Mauro, "MY RAMBLING HEART" (Washington. DC: 1995), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians backing on the songs were "the great" steel guitar player [[Speedy West]],&lt;ref name="honkytonk"&gt;''Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics'' (2012). pp. 10-11; {{ISBN|978-0-307-59489-1}}&lt;!-- publisher?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Hensely on fiddle, Roy Lanham on guitar, Al Williams on bass, and Muddy Berry on drums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2011/05/loretta-lynn-part-1.html PragueFrank's Country Music Discographies], countrydiscography.blogspot.com; May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She commented on the different sound of her first record: "Well, there is a West Coast sound that is definitely not the same as the Nashville sound ... It was a shuffle with a West Coast beat".&lt;ref name="honkytonk"/&gt;

The Lynns then toured the country to promote the release to country stations,&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt; while Grashey and [[Del Roy]] took the music to [[KFRN|KFOX]] in [[Long Beach, California]].&lt;ref name="Joseph Mauro 1995 p. 45"/&gt; When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard's C &amp; W Chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the [[The Wilburn Brothers|Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company]]. Through the Wilburns, she secured a contract with [[Decca Records]].&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt; From the onset of her career, fans took notice and rallied behind her all the way, with the first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year, Billboard magazine listed Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Most Promising Female Artists of C&amp;W Jockeys |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PSAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA26 |magazine=Billboard |page=26 |date=31 October 1960 |access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn's relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], beginning in 1960,&lt;ref name=cmhf/&gt; helped Lynn become the number one female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She was still fighting to regain these rights 30 years after ending her business relationship with them but was ultimately denied the publishing rights. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of these contracts. Although [[Kitty Wells]] had become the first major female country vocalist during the 1950s, by the time Lynn recorded her first record, only three other women—[[Patsy Cline]], [[Skeeter Davis]], and [[Jean Shepard]]—had become top stars. Lynn joined [[The Grand Ole Opry]] on September 25, 1962.&lt;ref name="Official website"/&gt;

By the end of 1962 it was clear that she was on her way to becoming the fourth star. Lynn has credited Cline as her mentor and best friend during those early years. In 2010, when interviewed for Jimmy Mcdonough's biography of [[Tammy Wynette]], ''Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen'', Loretta mentioned having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: "Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Lynn released her first Decca single, "[[Success (Loretta Lynn song)|Success]]," in 1962, and it went straight to #6, beginning a string of Top 10 singles that would run through the rest of the decade and throughout the next. She was a hard honky-tonk singer for the first half of the 1960s and rarely strayed from the genre.&lt;ref name="Loretta Lynn at CMT.com"/&gt; During this time, Lynn soon began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as "[[Before I'm Over You (song)|Before I'm Over You]]", which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;4, followed by "[[Wine, Women and Song (song)|Wine, Women and Song]]," which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with [[Ernest Tubb]]. Their lead single, "[[Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be]]", peaked within the Top 15. Together, the pair recorded two more albums, "Singin' Again" (1967) and "If we Put Our Heads Together" (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, "[[Happy Birthday (Merry Christmas and Happy New Year)|Happy Birthday]]", "[[Blue Kentucky Girl (song)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]" (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the 1970s by [[Emmylou Harris]]), and "[[The Home You're Tearing Down]]". Lynn's label issued two albums that year, "Songs from My Heart" and "Blue Kentucky Girl". While most were Top 10 Country hits, none reached #1.&lt;ref name="Billboard Singles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn's first self-penned song to crack the Top Ten, 1966's "[[Dear Uncle Sam]]", was among the very first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Official website"/&gt; In the latter half of the decade, although she still worked within the confines of [[honky tonk]], her sound became more personal, varied, and ambitious, particularly lyrically. Beginning with 1966's Number 1 hit in Cash Box, "[[You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)]]", Lynn began writing songs with a [[feminist]] viewpoint, which was unheard of in country music. This song made Lynn the first country female recording artist to pen a No.&amp;nbsp;1 hit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lynn_loretta/bio.jhtml Loretta Lynn Profile], Country Music Television website; accessed May 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–1980: Breakthrough success===
In 1967 Lynn reached No. 1 with "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) (song)|Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Kurt (2000). ''In Country Music: The Rough Guide''. Orla Duane (ed.), London: Rough Guides Ltd. p. 311.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin" went to No. 1 and became one of the first albums by a female country artist to reach sales of 500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004026/Loretta-Lynn.html Loretta Lynn profile], MusicianGuide.com; retrieved April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn's next album, ''[[Fist City (album)|Fist City]]'', was released in 1968. The [[Fist City|title track]] became Lynn's second No.&amp;nbsp;1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, "[[What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)]]", peaked within the Top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, ''Your Squaw Is on the Warpath'', spawned two Top 5 Country hits: the [[Your Squaw Is on the Warpath (song)|title track]] and "[[You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)]]". In 1969, her next single, "Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, "[[To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)]]". She was reportedly once inspired to write a song about a real woman she suspected was flirting with her husband. The song, "[[You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)]]", was an instant hit and became one of Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her hit "[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]", which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]] in 1970, and the album has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. "Coal Miner's Daughter" tells the story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. The song became her first single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. The song "Coal Miner's Daughter" later served as the impetus for the best-selling autobiography (1976) and the [[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Oscar-winning biopic]], both of which share the song's title.&lt;ref&gt;''Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music In America''. Paul Kingsbury &amp; Alanna Nash (eds.) London: Rough Guides Ltd., 2006, p. 251&lt;!-- year of publication, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 ''[[Rated "X"]]'' peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was considered one of Lynn's most controversial hits. The following year, her next single, "Love Is the Foundation", also became a No. 1 country hit from her album of the same name. The second and last single from that album, "[[Hey Loretta]]", became a Top 5 hit. Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including 1975's "[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]", considered to be the first song to discuss [[birth control]], other than the 1967 French-language song in French, Pilule d'Or, sung by [[Luc Dominique]]. As a songwriter, Lynn felt no topic was off limits, as long as it spoke to other women, and many of her songs were autobiographical.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; In 1976, she released her autobiography, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'', with the help of writer George Vecsey. It became a #1 bestseller, making Lynn the first country music artist to make [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. This opened a flood gate of country artists who followed with books. By the early 1980s Lynn became the first American female recording artist to chart over fifty top ten hits.

====Professional partnership with Conway Twitty====
In 1971 Lynn began a professional partnership with [[Conway Twitty]]. As a duo, Lynn and Twitty had five consecutive Number 1 hits between 1971 and 1975: their first release "[[After the Fire Is Gone]]" (1971), which won them a Grammy award; "[[Lead Me On (Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty song)|Lead Me On]]" (1971); "[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]" (1973); "[[As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone]]" (1974); and "[[Feelins']]" (1974). The hit-streak kick-started what became one of the most successful duos of country history. For four consecutive years (1972–1975), Lynn and Twitty were named the "Vocal Duo of the Year" by the [[Country Music Association]]. The Academy of Country Music named them the "Best Vocal Duet" in 1971, 1974, 1975, and 1976. The American Music awards selected them as the "Favorite Country Duo" in 1975, 1976 and 1977. The fan-voted Music City News readers voted them the No.&amp;nbsp;1 duet every year between 1971 and 1981, inclusive. In addition to their five Number 1 singles, they had seven other Top 10 hits between 1976 and 1981.&lt;ref name="Loretta Lynn at CMT.com"/&gt; Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty are the most successful and most awarded male/female duet teams in country music history. Conway and Loretta, their duo name, released an album in 1977 titled "Dynamic Duo", and they were considered that by their many fans.
[[File:Loretta Lynn 1975 on tour.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Loretta Lynn touring in 1975]]
As a solo artist, Lynn continued to be very successful into 1971, achieving her fifth No.&amp;nbsp;1 solo hit, "[[One's on the Way]]", written by poet and songwriter [[Shel Silverstein]]. The songs that didn't reach the top spot peaked within the Top 10 during this time: "[[I Wanna Be Free (Loretta Lynn song)|I Wanna Be Free]]", "[[You're Lookin' at Country]]", and 1972's "Here I Am Again", all released on separate albums. The next year, she became the first country star on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref name="countrypolitan.com"&gt;[http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-loretta-lynn.php Loretta Lynn biography], Countrypolitan.com; retrieved April 18, 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206185830/http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-loretta-lynn.php |date=February 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Lynn was the first woman nominated and the first woman to win the prestigious Entertainer Of The Year award at The CMA awards. She won the Female Vocalist Of The Year and Duo Of The Year with Conway Twitty, beating out George Jones and Tammy Wynette and Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/cma-awards/1972.jhtml|title=CMA Awards: Archive: 1972|website=[[Country Music Association Awards]]|date=October 9, 2008|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribute album for Patsy Cline====
In 1977 Lynn recorded ''[[I Remember Patsy]]'', an album dedicated to her friend and country pop singer [[Patsy Cline]], who had died in a plane crash in 1963. The album covered some of Cline's biggest hits. The two singles Lynn released from the album, "[[She's Got You]]" and "Why Can't He Be You", became major hits. "She's Got You", which went to #1 by Cline in 1962, went to #1 again that year by Lynn. "[[Why Can't He Be You]]" peaked at #7 shortly afterward. Lynn enjoyed enormous success on country radio until the early 1980s, when a more pop-flavored type of country music began to dominate the market. She stayed within the country Top 10 until the mid 1980s; however, most of her music by the late 1970s had a slick pop sound to it. Lynn had her last No.&amp;nbsp;1 hit in 1978 with "[[Out of My Head and Back in My Bed]]".&lt;ref name="Billboard Singles"/&gt;

In 1979 she had two Top 5 hits, "[[I Can't Feel You Anymore]]" and "[[I've Got a Picture of Us on My Mind]]", from separate albums. Lynn would often sit for an hour or more onstage signing autographs to her fans after a performance. Once in [[Salisbury, Maryland]], the town's newspaper editor interviewed her while she was signing autographs. Editor Mel Toadvine asked her why she took so much time to sign autographs while more than 100 people stood in line all the way to the front of the Wicomico Youth and Civic Center. "These people are my fans... I'll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people", she told Toadvine. In 1979, she became the spokesperson for Procter &amp; Gamble's Crisco oil and did TV commercials and print ads for them for a decade, ending in 1989. Because of her dominant hold on the 1970s, Lynn was named the "Artist of the Decade" by the Academy of Country Music. She is the only woman to win this honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loretta Lynn added to ACM's Girls' Night Out|url=http://www.lorettalynn.com/50/?p=1188|publisher=LorettaLynn.com|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=self-published source|date=November 2015}}

===1980–1989: Continued success===
On March 5, 1980, the film ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' debuted in Nashville and soon became the No.&amp;nbsp;1 box office hit in the United States. Lynn crossed over from country music superstar to American legend. The film starred [[Sissy Spacek]] as Loretta and [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Mooney Lynn. The film received seven [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] Oscar for Spacek and a slew of other top honors, including a gold album for the soundtrack album, a Grammy nomination for Spacek's singing as Lynn, [[Country Music Association]] and [[Academy of Country Music]] awards, plus several [[Golden Globe]] awards. The 1980s featured more hits: ("[[Pregnant Again]]", "[[Naked in the Rain (Loretta Lynn song)|Naked in the Rain]]", and "[[Somebody Led Me Away]]").&lt;ref name="countrypolitan.com" /&gt; Her 1980 and 1981 albums ''Loretta'' and ''Lookin' Good'' spawned these hits. Lynn was the first woman in country music to have 50 Top 10 hits. Her last Top 10 record as a soloist was "[[I Lie (song)|I Lie]]" in 1982, but her releases continued to chart until the end of the decade. Lynn continued to have Top 20 hits throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Billboard Singles"/&gt;

One of her last solo releases was "[[Heart Don't Do This to Me]]" (1985), which reached No. 19—her last Top 20 hit. In 1993, Lynn stopped releasing singles and focused more on touring than promoting. As a concert artist, she remained a top draw throughout her career, but by the early 1990s she drastically cut down the number of personal appearances owing to the fragile health of her husband, who died in 1996. Her 1985 album ''Just a Woman'' spawned a Top 40 hit. In 1987, Lynn lent her voice to a song on [[k.d. lang]]'s album ''Shadowland'' with country stars [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Brenda Lee]], "Honky Tonk Angels Medley". They released a video for this medley; the album went gold and was Grammy nominated for the four women. Lynn's 1988 album ''[[Who Was That Stranger]]'' would be her last solo album for a major record company as a solo artist. She was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/lorettalynn/biography Loretta Lynn profile], rollingstone.com; accessed April 18, 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226204459/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/lorettalynn/biography |date=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–2004: Return to country: ''Honky Tonk Angels'', ''Still Country'' and second autobiography===
Lynn returned to the public eye in 1993 with a hit CD, the trio album ''Honky Tonk Angels'', recorded with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. The CD peaked at #6 on the Billboard Country charts and #42 on the Billboard Pop charts and charted a single with "Silver Threads and Golden Needles". They released a popular video of this song. The album sold over 800,000 copies and was certified gold in the United States and Canada. The trio was nominated for Grammy and Country Music Association awards. Lynn's former singing partner, [[Conway Twitty]], died in 1993. Tammy Wynette died five years later on April 6, 1998. She released a three-CD boxed set chronicling her career on MCA Records. In 1995 she taped a seven-week series on the Nashville Network ([[The Nashville Network|TNN]]), ''Loretta Lynn &amp; Friends'', and performed some 50 dates that year.&lt;ref name="Loretta Lynn at Musician Guide.com"&gt;[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004026/Loretta-Lynn.html Loretta Lynn profile], musicianguide.com; accessed April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Loretta was presented with the Pioneer Award at the 30th Academy of Country Music Awards. She only did a few performances that year because of her husband's failing health. In 1996 she became widowed, Lynn's husband Oliver Vanetta "Doolittle" Lynn died five days short of his 70th birthday. In 2000 she released her first album in several years, ''[[Still Country]]'', in which she included "I Can't Hear the Music", a tribute song to her late husband. She released her first new single in over 10 years from the album, "Country in My Genes", when the single charted on the Billboard Country singles chart it made Lynn the first woman in Country Music to chart singles in five decades. While the album gained positive critical notices, sales were low in comparison with her previous releases. In 2002 Lynn published her second autobiography, ''[[Still Woman Enough]]'', and became her second ''New York Times'' Best Seller peaking in the top ten. In 2004 she published a cookbook, ''You're Cookin' It Country''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You're Cookin' it Country|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/youre-cookin-it-country-loretta-lynn/1112473069?ean=9781418553920|publisher=Barnes and Noble|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–present: Late career resurgence===
In 2004, Lynn made a comeback with the highly successful album ''[[Van Lear Rose]]'', the second album on which Lynn either wrote or co-wrote every song. The album was produced by her "friend forever"&lt;ref name=RS&gt;Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone Magazine (2004).

Raised in rural Kentucky, she emerged as one of the first successful female country music vocalists in the early 1960s, courageously breaking barriers in an industry long dominated by men. Ms. Lynn's numerous accolades include the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients|title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
At the height of her popularity, some of Lynn's songs were banned from radio airplay, including [[Rated "X"|Rated 'X']]," about the double standards divorced women face; "[[Wings Upon Your Horns]]", about the loss of teenage virginity; and "[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]]", with lyrics by T. D. Bayless, about a wife and mother becoming liberated by the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth-control pill]]. Her song "Dear Uncle Sam", released in 1966, during the [[Vietnam War]], describes a wife's anguish at the loss of a husband to war. It was included in live performances during the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt; In 1971 Lynn was the first solo female country artist to perform at the White House, at the invitation of President Richard Nixon. She returned there to perform during the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Lynn stated early in 2016 that she supported [[Donald Trump]] in his run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2016/01/08/country-musician-loretta-lynn-to-trump-call-me/|title=Country Musician Loretta Lynn to Trump: Call Me|first=Emily|last=Flitter|date=January 9, 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lynn has been outspoken about her views on often controversial social and political subjects, she stated, "I don't like to talk about things where you're going to get one side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/loretta_lynn.html|title=Loretta Lynn Quotes|publisher=BrainyQuote|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has visited the White House six times since 1976, under both Republican and Democratic presidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Nichole|url=http://www.uncommonmusic.org/2009/concert/loretta-lynn-paramount-theatre-co|title=Loretta Lynn profile|publisher=Uncommonmusic.org|date=June 13, 2009|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her autobiography, she said her father was a Republican and her mother a Democrat. When asked about same-sex marriage by ''[[USA Today]]'' in November 2010, she replied, "I'm still an old Bible girl. God said you need to be a woman and man, but everybody to their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nash|first=Alanna|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20101105/ENTERTAINMENT04/11070324/The-once-future-Queen-Country|title=The Once and Future Queen of Country|work=[[USA Weekend]]|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She endorsed&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, Erica J.

McFarland. pp. 108–109. {{ISBN|9780786491094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with [[Peggy Sue (singer)|Peggy Sue]] and [[Crystal Gayle]], campaigned&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, Pamela (2003). ''Barbara Bush: Matriarch of a Dynasty''. Macmillan. p. 111. {{ISBN|9780312319700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[George H. W.

In 2002's ''[[Still Woman Enough]]'', she discusses her longtime friendship and support for [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Lynn, ''Still Woman Enough: A Memoir'' (New York: Hyperion, 2002)&lt;!-- ISBN, pages needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; yet during the same time period she made her only recorded political donations ($4,300) to Republican candidates and Republican-aligned [[Political action committee|PACs]]. In 2013, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients Lynn awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom], whitehouse.gov; accessed May 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, she has questioned both political parties: "Dear Uncle Sam" was written in 1966 during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration to "recount the human costs of the [[Vietnam War]]", and she made a return to her live sets during the Iraq War under [[George W. Bush]]'s presidency.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

While a recognized "advocate for ordinary women", Lynn has often criticized upper-middle-class feminism for ignoring the needs and concerns of working-class women.&lt;ref name="Official website"/&gt; She once stated, "I'm not a big fan of Women's Liberation, but maybe it will help women stand up for the respect they're due". Along these lines, her music has ranged from "The Pill" and "Rated X" to more culturally conservative gospel albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/loretta_lynn_2.html|title=Loretta Lynn Quotes|page=2|publisher=BrainyQuote|date=April 14, 1935|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She allowed [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] to use her song "I Wanna Be Free" in a public service campaign to discourage the chaining of dogs outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorettalynn.com/50/?m=200510 "Loretta Helps Furry Friends"].

'''Muhammad Aslam Khan Raisani''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|نواب  محمد اسلم خان رئیسانی}}}}) (born 5 July 1955 in [[Sarawan]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]) was four times elected a member of the [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]] and served as the [[List of Chief Ministers of Balochistan|Chief Minister of Balochistan]] from 9 April 2008 until 14 January 2013.

==Family==
Raisani is the ''[[Nawab]]'' of the [[Raisani]] tribe of the [[Sarawan]] area,&lt;ref name="pabalochistan.gov.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pabalochistan.gov.pk/index.php/members/profile/en/26/384|title=Welcome to the Website of Provincial Assembly of Balochistan|work=pabalochistan.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding, as eldest son, to the late Nawab Ghous Baksh Khan Raisani.

==Business career==
He maintains an interest in developing his own landed estates and is President of the Chamber of Agriculture in Balochistan.&lt;ref name="pabalochistan.gov.pk"/&gt; He is working to introduce modern technology and agricultural methods to his own estates and those of his friends and allies.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He also has an interest in preserving [[wildlife]] and is a lifetime member of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]].&lt;ref name="pabalochistan.gov.pk"/&gt;

== Political career ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2013}}
Raisani began his political career with the [[National Party (Pakistan)|Pakistani National Party]]. In 1989, he was first elected to the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan. He was a member of the Provincial Assembly until 1990, when the provincial assemblies and [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] were dissolved by then [[President of Pakistan]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]].
 
When elections were held in 1990, Raisani was again elected to the Provincial Assembly, on the National Party ticket. In 1999, he joined the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] and has remained a member since. In 1999, he was elected for the third time. In the general elections of 2008, he was elected for the fourth time, from the constituency of Mastung/[[Quetta]] (PB-38) and became the parliamentary leader in the assembly.

On 9 April 2008, Raisani was elected as the Chief Minister of Baluchistan, running unopposed.&lt;ref name="pabalochistan.gov.pk"/&gt; On 14 January 2013, upon the imposition of Governor's Rule following the [[January 2013 Pakistan bombings]], Raisani was dismissed as Chief Minister by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], under Article 234 of the Constitution of Pakistan.

On Thursday 1 November 2012, media reports claimed that Raisani party's membership had been cancelled by the Peoples Party [[Kalat District|Kalat]] Division, for continually violating party policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aslam Raisani’s party membership suspended |url=http://dawn.com/2012/11/01/aslam-raisanis-party-membership-suspended/ |date=1 November 2012 |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he denied these reports, and said that his party membership had not been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/general-news/172/1253691/|title=Capital punishment: preliminary hearing today|author=Business Recorder|work=Business Recorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In mid-2010, Raisani stated that he holds a master's degree in [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Which claim has not been verified however&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned by reporters investigating false claims of educational credentials in Pakistani politics, he stated, "A degree is a degree! Whether fake or genuine, it's a degree! It makes no difference!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fake degree scandal roils Pakistani politics |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/958083 |date=30 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in the same year, he rejected allegations of corruption against him by asserting that there was "nothing wrong" with corruption.&lt;ref&gt;http://gmcmissing.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/is-he-robert-mugabe/ Retrieved 19 October 2012{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raisani once turned up at a public function in a drunken state, which reflected poorly on his image in conservative Pakistani society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shiatv.net/view_video.php?viewkey=333543df57db9123d673|title=Nawab Aslam Raisani Drunk PPP ex-CM of Balochistan - All Languages Video - CurrentAffairs - ShiaTV.net|work=shiatv.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2012, there has been an increasing outcry against Raisani, following his government's failure to maintain law and order in Baluchistan, resulting in the mass murder of the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Hazaras]] community there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Husain |first=Fahd |title=Kill at will |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/columns/03-Sep-2012/kill-at-will |date=3 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]] |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous instances of people disappearing in Baluchistan and never returning. Many people have accused the government of doing nothing in missing-persons cases with a majority of cases being left unsolved, and people have accused federal agencies of Pakistan of being involved with the Government of Baluchistan in the abduction of suspected separatist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1261121--balochistan-s-missing-persons-studied-by-un-working-group|title=Balochistan’s missing persons studied by UN working group|date=23 September 2012|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/449434/missing-persons-is-now-an-international-issue-cj/|title=Missing persons is now an international issue: CJ|date=10 October 2012|work=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the [[National Accountability Bureau]] of Pakistan started investigating charges of massive corruption against Raisani.&lt;ref&gt;Asim Yasin, The News Report, [http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-273100-NAB-approves-probe-against-Raisani-for-amassing-wealth-illegally  NAB probe against massive corruption by Raisani] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918062330/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-273100-NAB-approves-probe-against-Raisani-for-amassing-wealth-illegally |date=18 September 2014 }} , 16th Sept 2014.

[[File:Al Jazeera English Doha Newsroom 1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Al Jazeera English]] Newsroom, [[Doha]], 2008 ]]

'''News''' is [[information]] about current events. This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events. It is also used as a platform to manufacture opinion for the population see [[propaganda]].

Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.

==Meaning==
===Etymology===
The [[English language|English]] word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nový|nový]]'', "new"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' – and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"News", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. "Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''rēs nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later {{smallcaps|novel n.}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=news|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Garretson Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at [[Barnard College]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|date=1 November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newness===
As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.&lt;ref name=Stephens13&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith7&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 7. "In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated."&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smith7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Théophraste Renaudot]]: "History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettegree3&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. "Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market—and by the sixteenth century it was a real market—was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Park675&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 675–676. "News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences."&lt;/ref&gt; News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.&lt;ref name=Park675 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, "When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff &amp; Schudson; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. "It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity===
According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. "... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. "The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. "[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media."&lt;/ref&gt; From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. "News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity."&lt;/ref&gt; A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.&lt;ref name=Globalization6&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. "News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;Phil MacGregor, "International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. "Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. […] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, naïve empiricism could not last."&lt;/ref&gt; News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. "Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often—whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder—to shock."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKH&gt;Jesper Strömbäck, Michael Karlsson, &amp; Nicolas Hopmann, "Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news". ''Journalism Studies'' 13.5–6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsworthiness===
Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists apply news values to identify a news story. News values determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by its audience or readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-10-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered "newsworthy" has met different definitions, such as the notion of [[news values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues |title=News values: immediacy and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of telecommunication}}

===Folk news===
Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. "The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing—let alone printing presses or computers—to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. […] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. "A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth—the coffeehouse—flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government proclamations===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]

Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsams.nl/ |title=United Courier Systems |publisher=Ucsams.nl |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming Emperor of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to [[Reeve (England)|sheriffs]] for public display and reading at the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], among the [[Khasi people]] in India, and in the [[Meskwaki|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] cultures of the American midwest. The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. "Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at [[mosque]]s, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early news networks===
The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. [[Mail|Postal services]] have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.&lt;ref name=Fang14&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27. "Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society—the ability to inform them of new regulations—but gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received—the power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the imperial communication channels, called the "[[Royal Road]]" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, "Royal Roads" (1995), p. 129. "The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker13 /&gt; The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Asia====
[[File:KaiYuanZaBaoRemake.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper from the Tang dynasty]]
The world's first written news may have originated in [[Spring and Autumn period|eighth century BCE China]], where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to [[Confucius]], were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han dynasty]] is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC–AD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes."&lt;/ref&gt; Government-produced news sheets, called [[tipao]], circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.&lt;ref name=Smith14 /&gt; The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') to centralize news distribution for the court.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 14. "However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau—the Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'')—was created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor-generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53–8)"&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters called ''ch'ao pao'' continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith14a&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960–1278), the ''ti pao'' was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367–1644) was seen by a wider circle of society."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in [[Beijing]], during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0520221540}} (Paperback). p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the [[Taika Reform]] and again during the [[Kamakura period]] from 1183–1333. The system depended on ''hikyaku'', runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), pp. 45–46 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Gordenker, "Postal Symbol"; ''Japan Times'', 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.&lt;ref name=Smith14&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The postal system established during the [[Edo period]] was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150&amp;nbsp;km/day and express speed of 200&amp;nbsp;km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own ''[[Kabunakama|nakama]]'' (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the [[Hanseatic League]] from Bruges to Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to-date news.&lt;ref name=Pettegree3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCusker &amp; Gravesteijn, ''Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism'' (1991), p. 21. "Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''Notizie scritte'', which cost one [[gazette|gazetta]].&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html Wan-Press.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html |date=2012-01-11 }}, A Newspaper Timeline, [[World Association of Newspapers]]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of [[newspapers]] though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avvisi'' were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century ''avvisi'' long passages from were finding their way into published monthlies such as the [[Mercure de France]] and, in northern Italy, ''Pallade veneta''.&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Pallade Veneta: Writings on Music and Society, 1650–1750''. Venice: Fondazione Ugo e Olga Levi, 1985. Chs. 1 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Song and Season: Science, Culture, and Theatrical Time''. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2007. Chs. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Postkurse 1563.jpg|thumb|Some European postal routes in 1563]]
Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian I]] in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janettto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]]. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This system became the [[Reichspost|Imperial Reichspost]], administered by Tasso descendents (subsequently known as [[Lamoral II Claudius Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt; The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] and [[General Post Office|English postal service]] also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und-Taxis.&lt;ref name=Bakker13&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 18–19. "Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin."&lt;/ref&gt; The German lawyer [[Christoph von Scheurl]] and the [[Fugger]] house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network.&lt;ref name=Bakker11 /&gt; Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 35–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.&lt;ref name=Bakker10&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments.&lt;ref name=Bakker10 /&gt; Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 21. "Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability.&lt;/ref&gt; Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Bakker11&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the newspaper===

{{see also|History of newspapers and magazines}}
The [[History of paper|spread of paper]] and the [[History of printing|printing press]] from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 6–8. "So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of the oldest newspapers|first newspapers]] emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien]], from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';&lt;ref name="Relation"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}; World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman [[acta diurna]] served a similar purpose circa 131 BC.

The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 9. "The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative—or even whether what was reported would turn out to be important."&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned "seditious opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Act]], publication was restricted to approved presses—as exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: "Published By Authority".&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tory]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (During this era, the [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act]] limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders—especially from the [[Dutch Republic]], where publishers could evade state censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 [[Postal Service Act]], and continuing into the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 90. "The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the [[American frontier|West]], fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 8–9, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 31, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boosterism|Boosters]] of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830s American, wrote [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], was "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 48. [''"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le résultat de dix-huit siècles de travaux et d'expérience. Il porte le vêtement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le passé, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le présent; c'est un homme très civilisé, qui, pour un temps, se soumet à vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les déserts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux."'']&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the ''Bureau d'Esprit''.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of [[statistics]], especially [[economic statistics]] which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the [[stock market]]s. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as [[Keynesianism]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was ''The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser'', established in 1801, and followed by ''The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer'' in 1822 and the ''Liberia Herald'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.&lt;ref name=Fosu60&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; The first newspaper published in a native African language was the ''Muigwithania'', published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; ''Muigwithania'' and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period—as well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were slow to [[Arab culture|spread to the Arab world]], which had a stronger tradition of [[Communication#Verbal|oral communication]], and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called ''jurnals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newswire===
The development of the [[electrical telegraph]], which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Days before Morse's Baltimore–Washington line transmitted the famous question, "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.)&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"/&gt; Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of [[wire services]] concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with [[Charles-Louis Havas]], who founded Bureau Havas (later [[Agence France-Presse]]) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Havas's protoges, [[Bernhard Wolff]], founded [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in Berlin in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Havas disciple, [[Paul Reuter]], began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the [[Reuters]] news agency—specializing in news from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central Press]] agency, later called the [[Press Association]], to handle domestic news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto "Follow the Cable", setting up news outposts across the [[British Empire]] in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the [[Western Union]] company.&lt;ref name=Starr177 /&gt;

The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]], reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|an undersea telegraph cable]] successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headrick | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Griset | first2 = Pascal | year = | title = Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838–1939 | url = | journal = Business History Review | volume = 75 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Meikle, ''Interpreting News''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p.

The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 153–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eisenbahnen- und Telegraphendichte der Erde um 1900.jpg|thumb|World railway and telegraph system, 1900]]
By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 26–27. "The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. […] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news […] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services."&lt;/ref&gt; Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into "soft" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and "human interest".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with ''Vestnik'', the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Russian Revolution]], the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]].&lt;ref name=Palmer184&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the ''Red China'' newspaper and the internal ''Reference News''. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency ''[[Xinhua]]'', New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=XinXin&gt;Xin Xin, "A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers"; ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 28.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

These agencies touted their ability to distill events into "minute globules of news", 20–30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments.&lt;ref name=Palmer184 /&gt; Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The wire services brought forth the "inverted pyramid" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details included as it goes along.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"/&gt; The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 20 September 1918 ''Pravda'' editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in "telegraph style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 25–26. Translating Lenin: "Why instead of 200–400 lines you can't write in 20–10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo-Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.&lt;ref name=OBB23&gt;Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 23–24. "Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests."&lt;/ref&gt; The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and [[economic globalization]]. "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
The [[British Broadcasting Company]] began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.&lt;ref name=Allen26&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 31. "It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it."&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).&lt;ref name=Allen26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press–Radio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Britain, American news radio avoided "controversial" topics as per norms established by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref name=Allen34&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by ''Fortune'' considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source.&lt;ref name=Allen34 /&gt; Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 27. "Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The [[Nazi Party]] made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. set up its [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was [[Germany Calling|seized by Germany]], and then [[Radio 1212|by the United States]]—which created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the "[[The Zero Hour (World War II)|Zero Hour]]" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 39, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide [[Voice of America]] programs, produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 108–114, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward R. Murrow]], who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 179, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Turner]]'s creation of the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, [[BBC World Service Television]]. Rupert Murdoch's Australian [[News Corporation]] entered the picture with [[Fox News Channel]] in the US, [[Sky News]] in Britain, and [[STAR TV]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=McNair108 /&gt; Combining this new appartus with the use of [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], the United States waged the 1991–1992 [[Gulf War]] with the assistance of nonstop [[Media coverage of the Gulf War|media coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's specialty is the [[crisis]], to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 45–48. "When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world."&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news was transmitted via [[INTELSAT]] communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN, said an executive, would bring a "town crier to the global village".&lt;ref name=Tomlinson /&gt;

In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab &amp; Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by [[BBC Arabic Television]], which closed in April 1996. It used [[Arabsat]] to broadcast.&lt;ref name=McNair108&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The early internet, known as [[ARPANET]], was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the [[Netscape]] browser in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[online newspaper]] was the ''Electronic Telegraph'', published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Richmond, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news]"; ''The Telegraph'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.&lt;ref name=Allan175&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the release of web browser Netscape made news sites accessible to more people.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt; On the day of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The ''Oklahoma City Daily'' posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and ''Time'' magazine, posted photographs of the scene.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt;

Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause [[information overload]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] called this period the "technetronic era", in which "global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him."&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the [[citizen journalist]], who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events.

==News media today==

News can travel through different [[Media (communication)|communication media]].&lt;ref name=Globalization6 /&gt; In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a [[reporter]], where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or [[editing|edited]] and manually [[typesetting|set in type]] along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "[[breaking news]]" has become trite as [[commercial broadcasting]] [[United States cable news]] services that are available 24 hours a day use live [[communications satellite]] technology to bring current events into [[consumer]]s' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via [[radio]], [[television]], [[mobile phone]], and the [[internet]].

Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 42–43. "In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper===
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news.]]
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies—i.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of [[consolidation of media ownership|consolidation in media ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt;

The world's top three [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|most circulated newspapers]] all publish from Japan.

About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented [[paywall]]s for their websites.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5–20 years.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Shelley Thompson, "The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's [[Público (Spain)|Público]] has [https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-spains-p%C3%BAblico-redefined-its-strategy-and-grew-its-audience-40-percent reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %].

===Television===
Internationally distributed news channels include [[BBC News]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Sky News]]. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya—especially rural areas without much electricity—televisions are rare.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42 /&gt;

The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is [[Associated Press Television News]]. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]]—itself a sizeable video news exchange.&lt;ref name=Hachten39&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN International]] is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN /&gt;

===Internet===
[[Online journalism]] is news that is reported on the [[internet]]. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: "It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting—you can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Einar Thorsen, "Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Patrick &amp; Stuart Allan, "'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Schudson]], professor at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], has said that "[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age."&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK3tgAEACAAJ|isbn=978-0393912876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of "news" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; "the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying".&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"/&gt;

Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:
* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.
* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.
* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of "pro-am" relationships has emerged.
* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.
* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.
* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. "The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future.

Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on social media platforms]. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/growth-in-mobile-news-use-driven-by-older-adults/ study by Pew Research], a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices.

Because internet does not have the "column inches" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the [[world wide web]] also enables [[hyperlinking]], which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paterson2006&gt;Chris Paterson, "News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet", ''Papers in International and Global Communication'' 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists.&lt;ref name=SKH /&gt;

==News agencies==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumb|Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988]]
News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Jane | last2 = Forde | first2 = Susan | title = "The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century News"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[news agency]] still operating is the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W. Miller  |editor= |others= |title=Consider the source: A Critical Guide to 100 Prominent News and Information Sites on the Web |origyear= |edition= |series= |year=2007 |publisher=Information Today, Inc. |location= |language= |isbn=978-0910965774 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=1 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and [[Advertising agency|advertising agent]], [[Charles-Louis Havas]] as [[Agence Havas]]. By the end of the twentieth century, [[Reuters]] far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;

[[United Press International]] gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]].

News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important [[Bloomberg News]], convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.&lt;ref name=OBB21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewha&gt;John Bartram Ewha, "News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg"; ''Journalism Studies'' 4.3 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ewha /&gt;

Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, [[Xinhua]] has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government-subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt; It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Junhao | title = "From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978"; | url = | journal = Political Communication | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agencies with considerable reach include [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (Germany), [[Kyodo News]] (Japan), the ''[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]'' (Italy), the [[Middle East News Agency]] (Egypt), [[Tanjug]] (Serbia), [[EFE]] (Spain), and [[Anadolu Agency]] (Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, [[news aggregators]] play a role similar to that of the news agency—and, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by [[Yahoo! News]] in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. [[Google News]] relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt; In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M.

==Global news system==
In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the "Big Four" news agencies—Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International—representing the [[Western bloc]], and the Communist agencies: [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] from the Soviet Union, and [[Xinhua]] from China.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Kohei | title = The western perspective in Yahoo! News and Google News: Quantitative analysis of geographic coverage of online news | url = | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 75 | issue = 2| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television news agencies include [[Associated Press Television News]], which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.&lt;ref name=OBB21&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 21. "Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP&gt; It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;

By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of [[History of the world|world history]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 7. "Since World War II, an intricate an worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication—speech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)—into a fifth era of long-distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World Information and Communication Order===
The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the [[Holocaust]] and [[World War Two]] which are considered foundational in the West.&lt;ref name=Zeiler31&gt;Barbie Zeiler, "Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form "development journalism", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic—the first major news item regarding that country in years—the resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] predominates in global news exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Tomlinson&gt;John Tomlinson, "Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) has promoted a [[New World Information and Communication Order]], which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 8. "The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news."&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the 1980 [[MacBride report]], "Many Voices, One World", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the [[Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter Press Service]], founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, [[economic development]], [[economic integration]], natural resources, population, health, education, and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=Giffard194&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Giffard194 /&gt; IPS receives grants from organizations such as the [[United Nations Development Program]] and other United Nations agencies, [[Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz]], the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975–1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]], with assistance from the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], and [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further transformation in global news flow===
By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58–72, 133–136. "In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. […] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment—whether the state is responsive to democratic public interest—\and its relative power vis-à-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi, "Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]], a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in [[information society]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==News values==
{{Journalism sidebar}}

[[News values]] are the professional norms of [[journalism]]. Commonly, news content should contain all the "[[Five Ws]]" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.

Journalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to "let the reader decide" the truth of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of "impartiality" on news broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Sue Wallace, "Impartiality in the News", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.

Mid-twentieth-century news reporting in the United States focused on political and local issues with important socio-economic impacts, such as the landing of a living person on the moon or the cold war. The focus similarly remains on political and local issues; the news [[mass media]] now comes under criticism for over-emphasis on "non-news" and "gossip" such as celebrities' personal social issues, local issues of little merit, as well as biased sensationalism of political topics such as terrorism and the economy. The dominance of celebrity and social news, the blurring of the boundary between news and reality shows and other popular culture, and the advent of citizen journalism may suggest that the nature of 'news' and news values are evolving and that traditional models of the news process are now only partially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues] News Values. URL Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsworthiness does not only depend on the topic, but also the presentation of the topic and the selection of information from that topic.

Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = "The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880–1930"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = | year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 15, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1416548614|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Shipley Hiles &amp; Amanda Hinnart, "Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: "Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words."&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: "The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. […] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality'—the need to hear the widest range of views—all sides of the story."&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;

==Social organization of news production==
===News organizations===
Viewed from a [[sociology of knowledge|sociological perspective]], news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchical organizations. Reporters, working near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports, subject to assignments and occasional intervention from higher decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship; however, news organizations have covert but firm norms about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job; without any written policy, they simply learn how things are done.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 139–140, 146–152. "One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient […] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism "''makes the use of discretion predictable.'' It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original)."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, including [[journalism school]].&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. "Rituals of objectivity", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of information [[Gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeepers]]: to ask why and how certain narratives make their way from news producers to news consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Shoemaker, "A New Gatekeeping Model", from ''Gatekeeping'' (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 57. "Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day."&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may continue due to the role of a few central nodes in the social network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Erneste, "Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is "click-thinking", the editorial selection of news stories—and of journalists—who can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has detailed data collection about which stories are popular and who is reading them.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Nguyen, "Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Redden, "[http://research.gold.ac.uk/6540/ The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics]"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists' sometimes unattributed echoing of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt; The digital age can accelerate the problem of [[circular reporting]]: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timmer, "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research/ Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up …]"; ''Ars Technica'', 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have found '[[Old boy network|old boys' networks]]' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to "hard" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to "soft", "humanised" topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with institutions===
For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.&lt;ref name=Fang14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmon90&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions.&lt;ref name=Salmon90 /&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] wire service developed a "bilateral monopoly" with the [[Western Union]] telegraph company.&lt;ref name=Starr177&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annteresa Lubrano, ''The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change''; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IVWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree.&lt;ref name=OBB23 /&gt; News for consumption has operated under [[Statism|statist]] assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5. "Free of an extended view of the history of press-government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, "The Sociology of News Production", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 14. "One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level—the story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 62–63. "To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted."&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 34–37. "In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Leuven | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Joye | first2 = Stijn | title = "Civil Society Organizations at the Gates? A Gatekeeping Study of News Making Efforts by NGOs and Government Institutions"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Press/Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State control===
{{Main|State media}}

Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct [[political warfare]], alternatively known as [[public diplomacy]] and, in the modern era, [[international broadcasting]]. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 4–6, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; American propaganda broadcasters include [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], [[Crusade for Freedom|set up during the Cold War]] and still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 [[Radio Moscow|by the Soviet Union]]. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 129–133, 132, 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the [[BBC World Service]] are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 21, 55. "The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy."&lt;/ref&gt; Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the [[International Organization of Journalists]]. The Russian [[KGB]] heavily pursued a strategy of [[disinformation]], planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasts into Iraq before the [[Gulf War|Second Gulf War]] mimicked the style of local programming.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see&lt;/ref&gt; The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station [[Alhurra]] and radio station [[Radio Sawa]] to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/10/news/war-iraqmedia10 Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq]"; ''Los Angeles Times'', 10 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Al Jazeera]], a TV and internet news network owned by the government of [[Qatar]], has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; State-owned [[China Central Television]] operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[Press TV]] and Russia's [[Russia Today]], branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences.

As distinct from [[advertising]], which deals with marketing distinct from news, [[public relations]] involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the "third-party technique", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as [[Video News Release]]s, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle [[product placement]] and other techniques to influence viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;Jamie Matthews, "Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This pre-organized news content has been called an [[information subsidy]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtin | first1 = Patricia A. | title = Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Public Relations Research | volume = 11 | issue = 1| year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests—but the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen /&gt;

Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the [[Nayirah (testimony)|1990 news story]] about Iraqi soldiers taking "babies out of incubators" in Kuwaiti hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rothmyer, "What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation." ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 9.3, Fall 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen&gt;Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, &amp; David McQueen, "News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==News consumption==
Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.&lt;ref name=Stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 1–2, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), pp. 93–94. "Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. […] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. […] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture—as exemplified by James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which derives from the newspapers of June 16 (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brandon Kershner, ''The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yc7HAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79 Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue]". Also see: James Broderick, "'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 study by sociologist [[Bernard Berelson]] found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as "lost", "nervous", "isolated", and "suffering" due to the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berelson, "[http://simson.net/ref/1948/What_missing_the_newspaper_means.pdf What 'missing the newspaper' means]", in ''Communications Research 1948–1949'', ed. Lazarsfeld &amp; Stanton; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.&lt;ref name="Allen47"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories—and get their "real news" from television.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and cultural cohesion===
An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.&lt;ref name=Starr24&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. "Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it."&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. "The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group."&lt;/ref&gt; News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, "Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 156–160. "In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent—Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968—gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;&lt;ref name=Zeiler31 /&gt; etc.

With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6–7. "But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. […] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people."&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28–31. "A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence—regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sphere===
This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=Starr24 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.&lt;ref name="Allen47"/&gt;

This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179–185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News events===
As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 685–686. "In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events—at least as listener if not as spectator—as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = "The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to "rally" behind its current leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a "crisis", and influenced a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.&lt;ref&gt;Danie Du Plessis, "What's News in South Africa?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. "Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, "What's News in the United States?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families—such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, "What's News in Jordan?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 233–234. Also see: Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past"; ''Memory Studies'' 7.4, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News making===
News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University – Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"/&gt; The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.

Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.

News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.

===Psychological effects===
{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}

Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Schuster, et al., "A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terr | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Rees, "The Trauma Factor", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. "Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.&lt;/ref&gt;

News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. "When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues."&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huile de palme biologique 350g.jpg|thumb|right|Palm oil block showing the lighter color that results from boiling]]
'''Palm oil''' is an edible [[vegetable oil]] derived from the [[Fruit anatomy#Mesocarp|mesocarp]] (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the [[Elaeis|oil palms]], primarily the African oil palm ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reeves |first1=James B. |last2=Weihrauch |first2=John L|author3=Consumer and Food Economics Institute |title=Composition of foods: fats and oils |series=Agriculture handbook 8-4 |year=1979 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Science and Education Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=5301713 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm ''[[Elaeis oleifera]]'' and the maripa palm ''[[Attalea maripa]]''.

Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high [[beta-carotene]] content. It is not to be confused with [[palm kernel oil]] derived from the [[palm kernel|kernel]] of the same fruit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Origin of oil palm |chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/y4355e/y4355e03.htm |title=Small-Scale Palm Oil Processing in Africa |first=Kwasi |last=Poku |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |series=FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin 148 |year=2002 |isbn=92-5-104859-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923032745/http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/y4355e/y4355e03.htm |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coconut oil]] derived from the kernel of the coconut palm (''[[Cocos nucifera]]''). The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks [[carotenoids]] and is not red), and in [[saturated fat]] content: palm mesocarp oil is 49 percent saturated, while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81 percent and 86 percent saturated fats, respectively. However, crude red palm oil that has been refined, bleached and deodorized, a common [[commodity]] called RBD palm oil, does not contain carotenoids.&lt;ref name=nag/&gt;

The oil palm produces bunches containing a large number of fruits with the fleshy mesocarp enclosing a kernel that is covered by a very hard shell. FAO considers palm oil (coming from the pulp) and palm kernels to be primary products. The oil extraction rate from a bunch varies from 17 to 27% for palm oil, and from 4 to 10% for palm kernels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ref.data.fao.org/dimension-member?entryId=2095d9b1-bd16-41ac-a315-2673fb88549a|title=FAO data - dimension-member - Oil, palm fruit|website=ref.data.fao.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Elaeis guineensis MS 3467.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Oil palm]]s (''Elaeis guineensis'')]]
Humans used oil palms as far as 5,000 years back; in the late–1800s, archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] dating back to 3,000 BCE.&lt;ref name=Kiple&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge World History of Food |editor1-last=Kiple |editor1-first=Kenneth F. |editor2-last=Conee Ornelas |editor2-first=Kriemhild |year=2000 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0521402166|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/palmoil.htm |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020201103/http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/palmoil.htm |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that traders brought oil palm to Egypt.&lt;ref name=Obahiagbon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obahiagbon |first1=F.I. |year=2012 |title=A Review: Aspects of the African Oil Palm (''Elaeis guineesis'' Jacq.) |journal=American Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=1–14|doi=10.3923/ajbmb.2012.106.119 |url=http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/academicjournals/ajbmb/0000/38799-38799.pdf |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234451/http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/academicjournals/ajbmb/0000/38799-38799.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm oil from ''E. guineensiss'' has long been recognized in West and Central African countries, and is widely used as a [[cooking oil]]. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in Europe.

Palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by British traders, for use as an industrial [[lubricant]] for machinery during Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2000 | title = British Colonial Policies and the Oil Palm Industry in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria, 1900–1960. | url = http://www.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/21-1/19-33.pdf | journal = African Study Monographs |volume = 21|issue=1|pages=19–33|deadurl= no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234451/http://www.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/21-1/19-33.pdf | archivedate = 16 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm oil formed the basis of [[soap]] products, such as [[Lever Brothers]]' (now [[Unilever]]) "[[Sunlight (cleaning product)|Sunlight]]" soap, and the American [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary |last=Bellis |title=The History of Soaps and Detergents |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsoap.htm |website=[[About.com]] |quote=In 1864, Caleb Johnson founded a soap company called B.J. Johnson Soap Co., in Milwaukee. In 1898, this company introduced a soap made of palm and olive oils, called Palmolive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By around 1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of some West African countries, such as Ghana and Nigeria, although this was overtaken by [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1_cocoa_report_2004.pdf ''antislavery.org'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa'' {{ISBN|978-1-847-01075-9}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palm Oils - outer pulp vs kernel from African Oil Palm - Elaeis guineenisis.jpg|thumb|Left, reddish palm oil made from the pulp of oil palm fruit. Right, clear [[palm kernel oil]] made from the kernels]]
===Fatty acids===
{{main|Fatty acid}}
Palm oil, like all fats, is composed of [[fatty acid]]s, [[ester]]ified with [[glycerol]]. Palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat, specifically the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, [[palmitic acid]], to which it gives its name.  Monounsaturated [[oleic acid]] is also a major constituent of palm oil. Unrefined palm oil is a significant source of [[tocotrienol]], part of the [[vitamin E]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=4392014 | title=A review of characterization of tocotrienols from plant oils and foods |vauthors=Ahsan H, Ahad A, Siddiqui WA | journal=J Chem Biol|year=2015|volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=45–59 | doi=10.1007/s12154-014-0127-8 | pmid=25870713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oil/&gt;

The approximate concentration of esterified fatty acids in palm oil is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fats-and-oils/510/2 | title=Oil, vegetable, palm per 100 g; Fats and fatty acids | website=Conde Nast for the USDA National Nutrient Database, Release SR-21 | date=2014 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028001118/http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fats-and-oils/510/2 | archivedate=28 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refining===
{{see also|Cooking oil#Refinement{{!}}Cooking oil refinement}}
After [[mill (grinding)|milling]], various palm oil products are made using [[refining]] processes. First is [[fractionation]], with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid ([[stearin]]), and liquid ([[olein]]) fractions.&lt;ref name=Asianagro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaj-id.com/operation.html|title=Investment in Technology|publisher=PT.

Then the oil is filtered and bleached. Physical refining{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} removes smells and coloration to produce "refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil" (RBDPO) and free fatty acids,{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} which are used in the manufacture of [[soap]]s, [[washing powder]] and other products. RBDPO is the basic palm oil product sold on the world's commodity markets. Many companies fractionate it further to produce palm oil for cooking oil, or process it into other products.&lt;ref name=Asianagro/&gt;

===Red palm oil===
Since the mid-1990s, '''red palm oil''' has been [[Vegetable oil#Mechanical extraction|cold-pressed]] from the fruit of the oil palm and bottled for use as a [[cooking oil]], in addition to other uses such as being blended into [[mayonnaise]] and [[salad oil|vegetable oil]].&lt;ref name=nag&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nagendran | first1 = B. | last2 = Unnithan | first2 = U.

Oil produced from palm fruit is called ''red palm oil'' or just ''palm oil''. It is around 50% [[saturated fat]]—considerably less than [[palm kernel oil]]—and 40% [[unsaturated fat]] and 10% [[polyunsaturated fat]]. In its unprocessed state, red palm oil has an intense deep red color because of its abundant [[carotene]] content. Like palm kernel oil, red palm oil contains around 50% [[medium chain fatty acids]], but it also contains the following nutrients:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

* [[Carotenoid]]s such as [[alpha-Carotene|alpha-]] and [[beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] and [[lycopene]]
* [[Sterol]]s
* [[Vitamin E]]
* [[Antioxidant]]s in the form of [[flavonoid]]s and [[phenolic acid]]

=== White palm oil ===
'''White palm oil''' is the result of processing and refining. When refined, the palm oil loses its deep red color. It is extensively used in food manufacture and can be found in a variety of processed foods including peanut butter and chips. It is often labeled as palm shortening and is used as a replacement ingredient for hydrogenated fats in a variety of baked and fried products.

===Use in food===
The highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions, making it a cheap [[fat substitute|substitute]] for [[butter]] or [[hydrogenated |hydrogenation]] [[vegetable oil]]s in uses where solid fat is desirable, such as the making of [[pastry]] dough and baked goods. The health concerns related to [[trans fat]]s in hydrogenated vegetable oils may have contributed to the increasing use of palm oil in the food industry.&lt;ref name="npr._Palm"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Palm Oil In The Food Supply: What You Should Know |author= |work=NPR.org |date=25 July 2013 |access-date=2 December 2018 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/07/25/205486197/palm-oil-in-the-food-supply-what-you-should-know?t=1543742568978 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, [[Nigeria]] was the third-largest producer, with approximately {{convert|2.3|e6ha}} under cultivation. Until 1934, Nigeria had been the world's largest producer. Both small- and large-scale producers participated in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayodele|first=Thompson|title=African Case Study: Palm Oil and Economic Development in Nigeria and Ghana; Recommendations for the World Bank's 2010 Palm Oil Strategy|url=http://www.ippanigeria.org/worldbankreportpalmoil%5B1%5D.pdf|website=Initiative For Public Policy Analysis|date=August 2010|accessdate=8 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422142906/http://www.ippanigeria.org/worldbankreportpalmoil%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ayodele|first=Thompson|title=The World Bank's Palm Oil Mistake|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/opinion/16ayodele.html?_r=1&amp;src=sch&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 8, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 15, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119150947/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/opinion/16ayodele.html?_r=1&amp;src=sch&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] is the world's third largest producer of crude palm oil, producing approximately two million tonnes per year, or 1.2 percent of global output. Ninety-five percent of Thai production is consumed locally. Almost 85 percent of palm plantations and extraction mills are in south Thailand. At year-end 2016, 4.7 to 5.8 million [[Rai (unit)|rai]] were planted in oil palms, employing 300,000 farmers, mostly on small landholdings of 20 rai. [[ASEAN]] as a region accounts for 52.5 million tonnes of palm oil production, about 85 percent of the world total and more than 90 percent of global exports. Indonesia accounts for 52.2 percent of world exports. Malaysian exports total 37.9 percent. The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50 percent of world exports. Thailand's Department of Internal Trade (DIT) usually sets the price of crude palm oil and refined palm oil. Thai farmers have a relatively low yield compared to those in Malaysia and Indonesia. Thai palm oil crops yield 4–17 percent oil compared to around 20 percent in competing countries. In addition, Indonesian and Malaysian oil palm plantations are 10 times the size of Thai plantations.&lt;ref name="BP-20180128"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arunmas|first1=Phusadee|last2=Wipatayotin|first2=Apinya|title=EU move fuelling unease among palm oil producers|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1403374/eu-move-fuelling-unease-among-palm-oil-producers|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=28 January 2018|format=Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In the 1960s, about {{convert|18,000|ha|sqmi}} were planted with palm. [[Colombia]] has now become the largest palm oil producer in the Americas, and 35 percent of its product is exported as biofuel. In 2006, the Colombian plantation owners' association, Fedepalma, reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to {{convert|1,000,000|ha|sqmi}}. This expansion is being funded, in part, by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] to resettle disarmed [[paramilitary]] members on arable land, and by the Colombian government, which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to {{convert|7,000,000|ha|sqmi}} by 2020, including oil palms. Fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspo.org/en/member/7 Fedepalma Annual Communication of Progress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116235144/http://www.rspo.org/en/member/7 |date=16 January 2013 }} Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Afro-Colombians claim that some of these new plantations have been expropriated from them after they had been driven away through poverty and civil war, while armed guards intimidate the remaining people to further depopulate the land, with [[coca]] production and trafficking following in their wake.&lt;ref name="dollar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upsidedownworld.org/main/colombia-archives-61/816-blood-on-the-palms-afro-colombians-fight-new-plantations|title=Blood on the Palms: Afro-Colombians fight new plantations|last=Bacon|first=David|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019191459/http://upsidedownworld.org/main/colombia-archives-61/816-blood-on-the-palms-afro-colombians-fight-new-plantations|archivedate=19 October 2012|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}   See also "Unfulfilled Promises and Persistent Obstacles to the Realization of the Rights of Afro-Colombians," [http://www.utexas.edu/law/academics/centers/humanrights/projects_and_publications/colombia-report.pdf] A Report on the Development of Ley 70 of 1993 by the Repoport Center for Human Rights and Justice, Univ. of Texas at Austin, Jul 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
[[File:Malayasia iko 2002169.jpg|thumb|350px|A satellite image showing deforestation in [[Malaysian Borneo]] to allow the plantation of [[oil palm]]]]

====Benin====
Palm is native to the wetlands of western Africa, and south [[Benin]] already hosts many palm plantations. Its 'Agricultural Revival Programme' has identified many thousands of hectares of land as suitable for new oil palm export plantations. In spite of the economic benefits, [[Non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs), such as [[Nature Tropicale]], claim biofuels will compete with domestic food production in some existing prime agricultural sites. Other areas comprise [[peat|peat land]], whose drainage would have a deleterious [[environmental impact]]. They are also concerned [[genetic modification|genetically modified]] plants will be introduced into the region, jeopardizing the current premium paid for their non-GM crops.&lt;ref name=wrm&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/120/Benin.html | title = Benin: Large scale oil palm plantations for agrofuel | date = 2007-08-03 | first = Flavio | last = Pazos | website= World Rainforest Movement | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808035000/http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/120/Benin.html | archivedate = 8 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=African Biodiversity Network|year=2007|title=Agrofuels in Africa: the impacts on land, food and forests: case studies from Benin, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia|publisher=African Biodiversity Network|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=as4sAQAAMAAJ|others=translated by|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418054802/https://books.google.com/books?id=as4sAQAAMAAJ|archivedate=18 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
[[Kenya]]'s domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand, estimated at around 380,000 metric tonnes. The rest is imported at a cost of around US$140 million a year, making edible oil the country's second most important import after petroleum. Since 1993 a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] variety of cold-tolerant, high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] in western Kenya. As well as alleviating the country's deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop, it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region, because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web | title = Hybrid oil palms bear fruit in western Kenya | date = 2003-11-24 | website= UN FAO | url = http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/field/2003/1103_oilpalm.htm | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150122113444/http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/field/2003/1103_oilpalm.htm | archivedate = 22 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ghana====
[[Ghana]] has a lot of [[Arecaceae|palm nut]] species, which may become an important contributor to the agriculture of the region. Although Ghana has multiple palm species, ranging from local palm nuts to other species locally called agric, it was only marketed locally and to neighboring countries. Production is now expanding as major investment funds are purchasing plantations, because Ghana is considered a major growth area for palm oil.

====Food vs. fuel====
{{main|Food vs. fuel}}
The use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food, leading to [[malnutrition]] in developing nations. This is known as the [[food vs. fuel|food versus fuel]] debate. According to a 2008 report published in the ''[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]]'', palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel. The production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies.&lt;ref name="Man Kee Lam"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Man Kee Kam |author2=Kok Tat Tan |author3=Keat Teong Lee |author4=Abdul Rahman Mohamed|date=9 September 2008 |title=Malaysian Palm oil: Surviving the food versus fuel dispute for a sustainable future |url=https://www.academia.edu/876673/Malaysian_palm_oil_Surviving_the_food_versus_fuel_dispute_for_a_sustainable_future |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study published in the ''Environmental Science and Policy'' journal, palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future, resulting in the expansion of palm oil production, and therefore an increased supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Corley | first1 = R.

===Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)===
{{Main|Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil}}
[[File:Zurich RT2.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=RT2 (Roundtable No 2) in Zurich in 2005.|Roundtable No 2 (RT2) in Zurich in 2005]]
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was created as a lobby group by industry in 2004&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt; following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts related to palm oil production. The organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production.&lt;ref name="Gunasegaran"/&gt; Products containing Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) can carry the RSPO trademark.&lt;ref name="Yulisman"/&gt; Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups, and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products.&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunasegaran"/&gt;

Palm oil growers who produce Certified Sustainable Palm Oil have been critical of the organization because, though they have met RSPO standards and assumed the costs associated with certification, the market demand for certified palm oil remains low.&lt;ref name="Gunasegaran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yulisman"/&gt; Low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil. Palm oil is mostly [[fungible]]. In 2011, 12 percent of palm oil produced was certified "sustainable", though only half of that had the RSPO label.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite news |title=WWF: Industry should buy into GreenPalm today, or it will struggle to source fully traceable sustainable palm oil tomorrow |last1=Watson |first1=Elaine |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/WWF-Industry-should-buy-into-GreenPalm-today-or-it-will-struggle-to-source-fully-traceable-sustainable-palm-oil-tomorrow |newspaper=Foodnavigator |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107133044/http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/WWF-Industry-should-buy-into-GreenPalm-today-or-it-will-struggle-to-source-fully-traceable-sustainable-palm-oil-tomorrow |archivedate=7 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with such a low proportion being certified, [[Greenpeace]] has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil, because it says that RSPO standards fall short of protecting rain forests and reducing greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Oil-crops/Growing-pressure-for-stricter-palm-oil-standards Growing pressure for stricter palm oil standards.

==Markets==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
According to the Hamburg-based ''Oil World'' trade journal,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor, accounting for 48 million tonnes, or 30 percent of the total output. [[Soybean oil]] came in second with 37 million tonnes (23 percent). About 38 percent of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans. Of the 60 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world, palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60 percent; Malaysia, with 45 percent of the market share, dominated the palm oil trade.

===Food label regulations===
Previously, palm oil could be listed as "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" on food labels in the European Union (EU). From December 2014, food packaging in the EU is no longer allowed to use the generic terms "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" in the ingredients list. Food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used, including palm oil.  Vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term "vegetable oils" or "vegetable fats" but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin (e.g., palm, sunflower, or rapeseed) and the phrase "in varying proportions".&lt;ref name="GAIN Report"&gt;{{Cite report |date=12 January 2012 |title=New EU Food Labeling Rules Published |url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/NEW%20EU%20FOOD%20LABELING%20RULES%20PUBLISHED_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_1-12-2012.pdf |website=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service|accessdate=29 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416111706/http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/NEW%20EU%20FOOD%20LABELING%20RULES%20PUBLISHED_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_1-12-2012.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSPO is applying different types of programmes to supply palm oil to producers.&lt;ref name="GreenPalm"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Green Palm?|url=http://greenpalm.org/about-greenpalm/what-is-green-palm|website=Green Palm|accessdate=4 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003232300/http://greenpalm.org/about-greenpalm/what-is-green-palm|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book and claim: no guarantee that the end product contains certified sustainable palm oil, supports RSPO-certified growers and farmers 
* Identity preserved: the end user is able to trace the palm oil back to a specific single mill and its supply base (plantations)
* Segregated: this option guarantees that the end product contains certified palm oil
* Mass balance: the refinery is only allowed to sell the same amount of mass balance palm oil as the amount of certified sustainable palm oil purchased

[[GreenPalm]] is one of the retailers executing the book and claim supply chain and trading programme. It guarantees that the palm oil producer is certified by the RSPO. Through GreenPalm the producer can certify a specified amount with the GreenPalm logo. The buyer of the oil is allowed to use the RSPO and the GreenPalm label for sustainable palm oil on their products.&lt;ref name="GreenPalm" /&gt;

==Ethnonym==
===Etymology===
{{see also|Perseus}}
The [[English language|English]] term ''Persian'' derives from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Persia}}, itself deriving from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{transl|grc|Persís}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Περσίς|Περσίς]]}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*persi/s|Περσίς|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a Hellenized form of [[Old Persian]] {{transl|peo|Pārsa}} ({{lang|peo|[[wikt:𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿|𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Persia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bible]], it is given as {{transl|he|Parás}} ({{lang-he|[[wikt:פרס#Hebrew|פָּרָס]]}})—sometimes {{transl|he|Paras uMadai}} ({{lang|he|פרס ומדי|rtl=yes}}; "Persia and [[Medes|Media]]")—within the books of [[Esther]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Ezra]], and [[Nehemiah|Nehemya]].

A Greek folk etymology connected the name to [[Perseus]], a legendary character in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Herodotus]] recounts this story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Herodotus |title=Histories |volume=Book 7 |chapter=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; devising a foreign son, Perses, from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently, the Persians themselves knew the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Herodotus |title=Histories |volume=Book 7 |chapter=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Xerxes I]] tried to use it to suborn the [[Argos|Argives]] during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.

===History of usage===
Although [[Persis]] was originally one of the provinces of ancient Iran,&lt;ref name="Arnold Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FocirvdZKjcC |title=The Persian Gulf (RLE Iran A) |author=Wilson, Arnold |page=71 |chapter=The Middle Ages: Fars }}&lt;/ref&gt; varieties of this term (e.g. ''Persia'') were adopted through Greek sources and used as an official name for [[Greater Iran|all of Iran]] for many years.&lt;ref name="Michael Axworthy"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGRuDQAAQBAJ |title=Iran: What Everyone Needs to Know |author=Axworthy, Michael |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the [[Western world]], the term ''Persian'' came to refer to all inhabitants of the country.&lt;ref name="Michael Axworthy"/&gt;

Some medieval and early modern Islamic sources also used cognates of the term ''Persian'' to refer to various Iranian peoples, including the speakers of the [[Khwarezmian language]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, Abu Rayhan [[Biruni]], a native speaker of the Eastern Iranian language Khwarezmian mentions in his ''Āthār al-bāqiyah ʻan al-qurūn al-xāliyah'' that "the people of [[Khwarizm]], they are a branch of the Persian tree." See Abu Rahyan Biruni, ''"Athar al-Baqqiya 'an al-Qurun al-Xaliyyah"'' ("Vestiges of the past: chronology of ancient nations"), [[Tehran]], Miras-e-Maktub, 2001. Original Arabic of the quote: "و أما أهل خوارزم، و إن کانوا غصنا ً من دوحة الفُرس"(pg 56)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mazanderani language]],&lt;ref&gt;The language used in the ancient [[Marzbānnāma]] was, in the words of the 13th-century historian [[Sa'ad ad-Din Warawini]], "the language of Ṭabaristan and old, original Persian (''fārsī-yi ḳadīm-i bāstān'')" See Kramers, J.H. "Marzban-nāma." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Ed: P. Bearman, Th. Bianqui,, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill Online. November 18, 2007 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-4990&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Old Azeri language]].&lt;ref&gt;The language of [[Tabriz]], being an Iranian language during the time of [[Qatran Tabrizi]], was not the standard Khurasani Parsi-ye Dari. Qatran Tabrizi(11th century) has an interesting [[couplet]] mentioning this fact:
Mohammad-Amin Riahi. “Molehaazi darbaareyeh Zabaan-I Kohan Azerbaijan”(Some comments on the ancient language of Azerbaijan), ‘Itilia’at Siyasi Magazine, volume 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; 10th-century [[Iraqis|Iraqi]] historian [[Al-Masudi]] refers to ''Pahlavi'', ''Dari'' and ''Azari'' as dialects of the Persian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Al Mas'udi|year=1894|title=Kitab al-Tanbih wa-l-Ishraf|editor=De Goeje, M.J.|publisher=Brill|pages=77–78|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1333, medieval Moroccan traveler and scholar [[Ibn Battuta]] referred to the people of [[Kabul]] as a specific sub-tribe of Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325-1354|last=Ibn Battuta|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-34473-5|location=|pages=180|quote=We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans. They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength, and are mostly highwaymen. Their principal mountain is called [[Sulaiman Mountains|Kuh Sulayman]]. It is told that the [[Islamic view of Solomon|prophet Sulayman [Solomon]]] ascended this mountain and having looked out over India, which was then covered with darkness, returned without entering it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Mary (Leonora Woulfe) Sheil, in her observation of Iran during the Qajar era, describes Persians, Kurds, and Leks to identify themselves as "descendants of the ancient Persians".[[Persian people#cite note-20|&lt;sup&gt;[20]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

On March 21, 1935, the former king of Iran, [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], issued a decree asking the international community to use the term ''Iran'', the native name of the country, in formal correspondence. However, the term ''Persian'' is still historically used to designate the predominant population of the Iranian peoples living in the [[Greater Iran|Iranian cultural continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=February 6, 2011|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/662699/Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Persian |title=Persian entry in the Merriam-Webster online dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=August 13, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition (2000). {{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/P0207200.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212223230/http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/P0207200.html |archivedate=2009-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bausani, Alessandro.

After a long struggle with Rome in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the [[Roman Republic]] as the province [[Bithynia and Pontus]], and the eastern half survived as a client kingdom.

Following the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|Macedonian conquests]], the Persian colonists in Cappadocia and the rest of Asia Minor were cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, but they continued to practice the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith of their forefathers.{{sfn|Boyce|2001|page=85}} [[Strabo]], who observed them in the [[Kingdom of Cappadocia|Cappadocian Kingdom]] in the first century BC, records (XV.3.15) that these "fire kindlers" possessed many "holy places of the Persian Gods", as well as fire temples.{{sfn|Boyce|2001|page=85}} Strabo, who wrote during the time of [[Augustus]] (r. 63 BC-14 AD), almost three hundred years after the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, records only traces of Persians in western Asia Minor; however, he considered Cappadocia "almost a living part of Persia".{{sfn|Raditsa|1983|page=107}}

Until the Parthian era, the Iranian identity had an ethnic, linguistic, and religious value. However, it did not yet have a political import.&lt;ref name="Gnoli"&gt;GHERARDO GNOLI, "IRANIAN IDENTITY" in Encyclopaedia Iranica". Excerpt 1: " All this evidence shows that the name arya '''Iranian''' was a collective definition, denoting peoples (Geiger, pp. 167 f.; Schmitt, 1978, p. 31) who were aware of belonging to the one ethnic stock, speaking a common language, and having a religious tradition that centered on the cult of Ahura Mazdā.". Excerpt 2: "The inscriptions of Darius I (see DARIUS iii) and Xerxes, in which the different provinces of the empire are listed, make it clear that, between the end of the 6th century and the middle of the 5th century B.C.E., the Persians were already aware of belonging to the ariya “Iranian” nation (see ARYA and ARYANS). Darius and Xerxes boast of belonging to a stock which they call “Iranian”: they proclaim themselves “Iranian” and “of Iranian stock,” ariya and ariya čiça respectively, in inscriptions in which the Iranian countries come first in a list that is arranged in a new hierarchical and ethno-geographical order, compared for instance with the list of countries in Darius’s inscription at Behistun" Excerpt 3: "Although, up until the end of the Parthian period, Iranian identity had an ethnic, linguistic, and religious value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an “Iranian” empire or kingdom is a purely Sasanian one". Excerpt 4:"It was in the Sasanian period, then, that the pre-Islamic Iranian identity reached the height of its fulfilment in every aspect: political, religious, cultural, and linguistic (with the growing diffusion of Middle Persian). Its main ingredients were the appeal to a heroic past that was identified or confused with little-known Achaemenid origins (Yarshater, 1971; Daryaee, 1995), and the religious tradition, for which the Avesta was the chief source.".

The intermingling of Persians, Medes, Parthians, [[Bactria]]ns, and indigenous "pre-Iranian" people of Iran (including the Elamites) gained more ground, and a homogeneous Iranian identity was created to the extent that all were just called Iranians, irrespective of clannish affiliations and regional linguistic or dialectal alterities. Furthermore, the process of incomers' assimilation which had been started with the [[Alexander the Great|Greeks]], continued in the face of [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab]], [[Ilkhanate|Mongol]], and [[Ghaznavids|Turkic]] invasions and proceeded right up to [[Islamization of Iran|Islamic times]].&lt;ref name="Iran in Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/history9.html |title=History of Iran |publisher=Iranologie.com |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301054243/http://www.iranologie.com/history/history9.html |archivedate=March 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic heritage of the Persians is eclectic, and includes major contributions from both the east and the west. Persian art borrowed heavily from the indigenous [[Elam]]ite civilization and [[Mesopotamia]], and later from the Hellenistic civilization. In addition, due to the  central location of [[Greater Iran]], it has served as a fusion point between eastern and western traditions.

Persians have contributed in various forms of art, including [[Persian carpet|carpet-waving]], [[Persian calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Persian miniature|miniature-painting]], illustrated manuscripts, glasswork, [[lacquer]]-work, [[khatam]] (a native form of [[marquetry]]), [[metalworking|metalwork]], [[pottery]], [[mosaic]], and [[textile design]].&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite book |title=Iran |first1=Andrew |last1=Burke |first2=Mark |last2=Elliot |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |pages=295 &amp; 114–5 (''for architecture'') and pp. 68–72 (''for arts'') |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEca_4iSNCUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by Persians in other languages—such as Arabic and Greek—to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of [[Persianate society|Persianate cultures]].

Prominent writers such as [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Ahmad Shamlou]], [[Simin Daneshvar]], [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] and [[Parvin E'tesami]] have also had major contributions to contemporary Persian literature.

The quintessential feature of [[Achaemenid architecture]] was its eclectic nature, with elements from Median architecture, Assyrian architecture, and Asiatic Greek architecture all incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to study architecture|author=Charles Henry Caffin|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|year=1917|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Persian+Architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SvM7TYOWDsWblgeUlYyYBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20Architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 BC, was a period of artistic growth that left a legacy ranging from [[Tomb of Cyrus|Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb]] at [[Pasargadae]] to the structures at [[Persepolis]], and such historical sites as [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Architecture|author=Marco Bussagli|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMfCkY6-9joC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=Achaemenid+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-kE7TZqdL8GblgevmsWkBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Sasanian era, multiple architectural projects took place, some of which are still existing, including the [[Palace of Ardashir|Palace of Ardeshir]], the [[Sarvestan Palace]], the castle fortifications in [[Derbent]] (located in [[North Caucasus]], now part of [[Russia]]), and the reliefs at [[Taq Bostan]]. The [[Arg e Bam|Bam Citadel]], a massive structure at {{convert|1940000|sqft|m2}} constructed on the [[Silk Road]] in [[Bam, Iran|Bam]], is from around the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land of Lion, Land of Sun|author=Rafie Hamidpour D E Dabfe, Rafie Hamidpour|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2010|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cP__ziIW39cC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=bam+citadel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5hlMTdyjOYSq8AaKhsCIDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bam%20citadel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern contemporary architectural projects influenced by the ancient Achaemenid architecture include the [[Tomb of Ferdowsi]] erected under the reign of [[Reza Shah]] in [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], the [[Azadi Tower]] erected in 1971 at a square in [[Tehran]], and the [[Dariush Grand Hotel]] located on [[Kish Island]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].

===Gardens===
{{Main article|Persian gardens}}

[[Xenophon]], in his ''[[Oeconomicus]]'',&lt;ref name=hobhouse&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardens of Persia|author1=Penelope Hobhouse |author2=Erica Hunningher |author3=Jerry Harpur |publisher=Kales Press|year=2004|pages=7–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMFRyiAxZ6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Persian+garden&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xhROTd-yLsT58AbDmt3YDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20garden&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:
{{quote|"The Great King [Cyrus II]...in all the districts he resides in and visits, takes care that there are ''paradeisos'' ("paradise", from [[Avestan]] ''pairidaēza'') as they [Persians] call them, full of the good and beautiful things that the soil produce."}}

For the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] monarchs, gardens assumed an important place.&lt;ref name=hobhouse/&gt; Persian gardens utilized the Achaemenid knowledge of water technologies,&lt;ref name=Mays&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|author=L.

The enclosure of this symmetrically arranged planting and irrigation, by an infrastructure such as a building or a palace created the impression of "paradise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Garden: Echoes Of Paradise|author1=Mehdi Khansari |author2=M.

Today, examples of these traditional gardens can be seen in such places as the [[Tomb of Hafez]], [[Afif-Abad Garden|Golshan Garden]], [[Qavam House]], [[Eram Garden]], [[Shazdeh Garden]], [[Fin Garden]], [[Tabātabāei House|Tabatabaei House]], and the [[Borujerdis House]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Persian traditional music}}
[[File:Dancers and musicians on a Sasanian bowl.jpg|thumb|Dancers and musical instrument players depicted on a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] silver bowl from the 5th-7th century AD.]]

According to the accounts reported by Xenophon, a great number of singers were present at the Achaemenid court. However, little information is available from the music of that era. The music scene of the Sasanian Empire has a more available and detailed documentation than the earlier periods, and is especially more evident within the context of [[Zoroastrian music|Zoroastrian musical rituals]].&lt;ref name=EI-mhphi&gt;{{harv|Lawergren|2009}} iv. First millennium C.E. (1) Sasanian music, 224-651.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[Sasanian music]] was influential, and was later adopted in the subsequent eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic art and spirituality|author=Seyyed Hossein Nasr

Iranian music, as a whole, utilizes a variety of musical instruments that are unique to the region, and has remarkably evolved since the ancient and medieval times. In traditional Sasanian music, the [[octave]] was divided into seventeen tones. By the end of the 13th century, Iranian music also maintained a twelve interval octave, which resembled the western counterparts.&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite book|title=The American history and encyclopedia of music|author1=Janet M. Green |author2=Josephine Thrall |publisher=I. Squire|year=1908|pages=55–58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FI5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=music+of+persia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DEFPTansI4qr8Aa5i8nmDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20of%20persia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional instruments used in Iranian music include the bowed spike-fiddle [[kamancheh|kamanche]], the goblet drum [[tonbak]], the end-blown flute [[ney]], the large frame drum [[daf]], the hammered dulcimer [[santur]], and the four long-necked lutes [[Tar (string instrument)|tar]], [[dutar|dotar]], [[setar]], and [[tanbur]]. The European string instrument [[violin]] is also used, with an alternative tuning preferred by Iranian musicians.

===Carpets===
{{Main article|Persian carpet}}

Carpet weaving is an essential part of the Persian culture,&lt;ref name=langton&gt;{{cite book|title=How to know oriental rugs, a handbook|author=Mary Beach Langton|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|year=1904|pages=57–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtcPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Persian+rugs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JSJMTdfWA8Gs8AbSq6DnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20rugs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Persian rugs are said to be one of the most detailed hand-made works of art.

Achaemenid rug and carpet artistry is well recognized. [[Xenophon]] describes the carpet production in the city of Sardis, stating that the locals take pride in their carpet production. A special mention of Persian carpets is also made by [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] in his ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', as he describes a "delightfully embroidered" Persian carpet with "preposterous shapes of [[griffin]]s".&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt;

The [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] carpet—a [[Scythians|Scythian]] pile-carpet dating back to the 4th century BC, which is regarded the world's oldest existing carpet—depicts elements of Assyrian and Achaemenid design, including stylistic references to the stone slab designs found in Persian royal buildings.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arts of Persia|author=Ronald W. Ferrier|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1989|pages=118–120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2Qkf0h2Pj4C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Pazyryk+Carpet+Persia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ud9NTZKiAcK88gaM1qjBDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pazyryk%20Carpet%20Persia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observances===
One of the most renowned traditions observed by the Persians is the festival of [[Nowruz]]. Considered the national [[New Year]] of the Iranian peoples, the festival of Nowruz has its roots in ancient Iranian traditions, and has been recognized within [[UNESCO]]'s [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intangible Heritage List|author=UNCESCO|year=2009|accessdate=March 9, 2011|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditional celebrations such as [[Charshanbe Suri]], [[Sizdah Be-dar|Sizde be Dar]], and the [[Yaldā Night|Night of Yalda]] are also widely observed by the Persian people.

There are currently 73,000 [[Poles|Polish]] nationals living in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. This includes autochthonous Poles as well as those forcibly deported during and after [[World War II]]; the total number of Poles in what was the former [[Soviet Union]] is estimated at up to 3 million.

== History ==
=== 1652, Smolensk Boyars from Polish-Lithuanian Commonweath ===
Zainsk, Kazan governate, was originally a fort occupied by Chelny strelsty, archers and servicemen, and 81 Polish Cossask prisoners from Smolensk area after the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;http://zainsk.tatarstan.ru/rus/zainsk/istoriya-raiyona.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1654, Potolsk Gentry from Polish-Lithuanian Commonweath ===
In 1654 the Poles were taken from Polotsk, 141 people from the Polish small gentry were evacuated to Tiinsk together with the Cossacks, who, before that, "universal servants of Polish kings carried serfdom". Another party of the Polish gentry was settled in the settlement of Old Kuvak [Старой Куваке] and Old Pismyanka [Старой Письмянке] of the future Bugulma district [Бугульминского уезда], Kazan governate. They became part of the Simbirsk Line. Polish gentry until 1830 were considered available soldiers for conscription or draft.

[[File:Zesłanie Studentów - Malczewski.jpg|thumb|Polish students in Russian exile]]
Many Poles [[Sybirak|were exiled to Siberia]], starting with the 18th-century opponents of the [[Russian Empire]]'s increasing influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (most notably the members of the [[Bar Confederation]]).&lt;ref name="DaviesE"&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'', Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-19-820171-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=Polish+Bar+Siberia&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=-Qnx4AN3txLWtn9WTfaMLO0RM4w Google Print, p.664]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the change in Russian [[penal law]] in 1847, exile and penal labor (''[[katorga]]'') became common penalties to the participants of national uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing number of [[Polish people|Poles]] being sent to Siberia for katorga, they were known as ''Sybiraks''. Some of them remained there, forming a Polish minority in Siberia. Most of them came from the participants and supporters of the 19th century [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]],&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =Dennis J.

Originally, 148 Polish exiles were stationed in the Orenburg province, but by the beginning of June 1864, 278 people had been sent to the Orenburg governate to take up residence under the supervision of the police, and by mid-1865, 506 people. In addition, 831 people were identified for establishment on the state lands of the Orenburg and Chelyabinsk districts, of which 754 people were allocated to Ufa.&lt;ref&gt;https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27127905&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century there was also a limited number of Polish voluntary settlers, attracted by the economic development of the region.&lt;ref name="HDoP"/&gt; Polish migrants and exiles, many of whom were forbidden to move away from the region even after finishing serving their sentence, formed a vibrant [[Polish diaspora|Polish minority]] there.&lt;ref name="HDoP"/&gt; Hundreds of Poles took part in the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].&lt;ref name="HDoP"/&gt; Notable Polish scholars studied in Siberia, among them [[Aleksander Czekanowski]], [[Jan Czerski]], [[Benedykt Dybowski]], [[Wiktor Godlewski]], [[Sergiusz Jastrzebski]], [[Edward Piekarski]], [[Bronisław Piłsudski]], [[Wacław Sieroszewski]], [[Mikołaj Witkowski]] and others.&lt;ref name="HDoP"/&gt;

Millions of Poles lived within the [[Russian Empire]] as the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] started followed by the [[Russian Civil War]]. While some Poles associated with the communist movement, the majority of the Polish population saw cooperation with Bolshevik forces as betrayal and treachery of Polish national interests.&lt;ref name="Władze"&gt;J.

Famous revolutionaries with Polish origins include [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], [[Julian Marchlewski]], [[Karol Świerczewski]] and [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], founder of the [[Cheka]] secret police which would later turn into the [[NKVD]]. However, according to their ideology they did not identify as Poles or with Poland, and members of the communist party viewed themselves as Soviet citizens without any national sentiments. The Soviet Union also organized Polish units in the [[Red Army]] and a Polish Communist government-in-exile.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Jordan}}
Jordan is a source and destination country for adults and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Trafficking victims in Jordan are primarily from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[East Africa]], [[Egypt]], and Syria. Syrian refugees in Jordan continue to be highly vulnerable to trafficking. There have been reported cases of Syrian refugee women and girls sold into "temporary" or forced marriages to Jordanians and men from the [[Persian Gulf]] for the purpose of forced commercial sex. For example, in 2016 the government reported a case involving three Syrian girls and one Syrian woman who were forced by their father into temporary marriages—for the purpose of sexual exploitation—with a national from [[Saudi Arabia]]. Syrian, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[North Africa]]n, and [[Eastern Europe]]an women may be forced into prostitution after migrating to Jordan to work in restaurants and nightclubs; some Jordanian women working in nightclubs may also be forced into prostitution. As reported by an NGO in 2016, some Egyptian women are forced into prostitution by their Jordanian husbands. Some out-of-status domestic workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]] have been reportedly forced into prostitution after fleeing their employers.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271214.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=17 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 anti-human trafficking law criminalizes all forms of sex and labor trafficking. Penalties for sex trafficking and forced labor of adults are a minimum of six months imprisonment and/or a fine ranging from 1,000-5,000 Jordanian Dinars ($1,410-$7,060).&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Jordan as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The '''Pyu language''' ({{lang-my|ပျူ ဘာသာ}}, {{IPA-my|pjù bàðà|IPA}}; also '''Tircul language''') is an extinct [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] that was mainly spoken in what is now [[Myanmar]] in the first millennium [[Common era|CE]]. It was the [[vernacular]] of the [[Pyu city-states]], which thrived between the second century [[Common era|BCE]] and the ninth century CE. Its usage declined starting in the late ninth century when the [[Bamar people]] of [[Nanzhao]] began to overtake the [[Pyu city-states]]. The language was still in use, at least in royal inscriptions of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] if not in popular vernacular, until the late twelfth century. It became extinct in the thirteenth century, completing the rise of the [[Burmese language]], the language of the Pagan Kingdom, in Upper Burma, the former Pyu realm.&lt;ref name=mha-51-52&gt;Htin Aung, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is principally known from inscriptions on four stone urns (7th and 8th centuries) found near the Payagyi pagoda (in the modern [[Bago Township]]) and the multi-lingual [[Myazedi inscription]] (early 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | given=C. Otto | surname=Blagden | title=The 'Pyu' inscriptions | journal=[[Epigraphia Indica]] | volume=12 | year=1913–14 | pages=127–132 | url=https://archive.org/stream/epigraphia-indica/epigraphia-indica-vol-12#page/n167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckwith"&gt;{{cite book | given=Christopher I. | surname=Beckwith | author-link=Christopher I. Beckwith | chapter=A glossary of Pyu | pages=159–161 | title=Medieval Tibeto-Burman languages | editor-given=Christopher I. | editor-surname=Beckwith | publisher=Brill | year=2002 | isbn=978-90-04-12424-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These were first deciphered by [[Charles Otto Blagden]] in the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Beckwith"/&gt;

The [[Pyu script]] was a [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic script]]. The most recent scholarship suggests the Pyu script may have been the source of the Burmese script.&lt;ref name=mat-167-177&gt;Aung-Thwin, pp. 167–177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|Pyu city-states circa 8th century; Pagan shown for comparison only, not contemporary to the Pyu cities]]

The Pyu language was a Sino-Tibetan language related to [[Burmese language|Old Burmese]],&lt;ref name=lang-list&gt;Language List, PYX&lt;/ref&gt; although the degree of proximity is debated. The language is tentatively classified within the [[Lolo-Burmese languages]] by Matisoff and thought to most likely be [[Luish languages|Luish]] by Bradley. Van Driem feels it is best treated as an independent branch of Sino-Tibetan pending further evidence.&lt;ref name="van Driem THD"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Driem|first=George|title=Trans-Himalayan Database|url=http://www.himalayanlanguages.org/trans_himalayan_database|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The language was the vernacular of the Pyu states. But [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] appeared to have co-existed alongside Pyu as the court language. The Chinese records state that the 35 musicians that accompanied the Pyu embassy to the Tang court in 800–802 played music and sang in the ''Fàn'' ({{link text|梵}} "Sanskrit") language.&lt;ref name=mat-35-36&gt;Aung-Thwin, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Henry Marriott''' (1879-1951) was an American electrical engineer, and one of the first persons to work in the field of radio communication. In 1902 he engineered the first commercial radiotelegraph link established in the United States by a U.S. company, connecting the island of Santa Catalina with the California mainland. He founded the Wireless Institute professional society in 1909, which was merged in 1912 with the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers to form the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE), and served as the IRE's first president.

==Early life==

Marriott was born on February 18, 1879 in Richwood, Ohio to Franklin Waters and Minerva Ann (Woodruff) Marriott. He attended the [[Ohio State University]], where he enrolled in the college's General Science course, majoring in physics. Inspired by reports of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s accomplishments in developing radio communication (then known as "wireless telegraphy"), in the spring of 1897 he began conducting his own experiments.&lt;ref&gt;"Reminiscences of Old Timers" (Robert H. Marriott section), ''Radio-Craft'', March, 1938, page 559.&lt;/ref&gt; He left college in February, 1901 to become an Assistant Engineer for the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company. In October, 1901, he participated in that company's construction of temporary radiotelegraph stations that were used, with limited success, to report the results of the International Yacht races held in New York.

==Avalon radiotelegraph link==
Acting as a parent company, American Wireless authorized regional subsidiaries, and in December, at the age of 22, Marriott became the Chief Engineer of the Pacific Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, headquartered in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;"Denver Wizard", ''The (Denver) Daily News'', March 30, 1902, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; American Wireless and its subsidiaries were primarily used for stock promotion, and had few legitimate business activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112109516671;view=1up;seq=19 "Fools and Their Money"] by Frank Fayant, ''Success Magazine'', January, 1907, pages 9-11, 49-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriott was originally expected to build a radiotelegraph link between Denver and Golden, Colorado, which would have had little practical use beyond selling overpriced shares of stock. However, he instead developed a plan to construct a link that would have actual commercial value, from the California mainland to Catalina Island, which was isolated because it lacked a telegraph cable connection.

Radio communication at this time employed spark transmitters, which were limited to sending messages in [[Morse code]]. Marriott determined that a [[coherer]] receiver was too insensitive to bridge the 40 kilometer (25 mile) gap, so he developed a form of a light-contact microphonic receiver which allowed for audio reception of the dot-and-dash signals. The equipment for the two stations was constructed by the Carstarphen Electric Company in Denver, and transported to the sites for installation. The coastal terminus was located at White's Point near San Pedro, where it connected to [[Western Union]]'s national telegraph system, while the island station was located on a seaside bluff north of Avalon.

Marriott encountered extensive skepticism among the residents of Santa Catalina about the feasibility of his project, to the point that a family acquaintance implied  that, if needed, he was willing to help Marriott quietly leave the island to avoid the embarrassment of failure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/radiobroadcast05unse#page/51/mode/1up "As It Was in the Beginning"] by Robert H. Marriott, ''Radio Broadcast'', May, 1924, pages 51-59.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August, 1902 regular service was begun, following a successful demonstration to representatives of the ''Los Angeles Herald''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19020803.2.329&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 "Wireless Telegraph to Catalina Island is in Working Order"], ''Los Angeles Herald'', August 3, 1902, Part 4, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; (Although this was the first commercial radiotelegraph link established in the United States by a U.S. company, the British-based Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company had previously established commercial stations on multiple islands in the Territory of Hawaii and at Nantucket Lightship, Massachusetts.)

In addition to regular commercial messages, the link was used to transmit content for a daily newspaper, known as ''The Wireless'', which was published by the ''Los Angeles Times'' beginning on March 25, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000055589642;view=1up;seq=345 "A 'Wireless' Newspaper"], ''Western Electrician'', April 25, 1903, page 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the radio link would change numerous times, but it was regularly updated and remained in service until its replacement in 1923 by an undersea cable.

==Later work==

In December, 1902, Marriott, newly married, returned to Denver, where he worked for the Carstarphen Electric Company. In the middle of 1905 he became an engineer for the American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company, and, when that company was reorganized in late 1906 as the [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]], he stayed on as Supervisor of Construction and Maintenance. In 1908-1909 he experimented with an arc radiotelephone, transmitting from United's New York station, DF.&lt;ref name="widow"&gt;"Merry Widow Waltz First Air Broadcast", ''The (Miami) Herald'', January 22, 1928, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 he founded and served as president of the Wireless Institute professional society in New York City, which was merged in 1912 with the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers to form the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), of which he was the first president. (In 1963 the IRE and the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) merged to create the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE).)

In 1912 United Wireless was taken over by the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]], where Marriott continued as an engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015064415915;view=1up;seq=164 "Robert Henry Marriott"], ''Who's Who in The Ohio State University'', 1912 edition, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1912 to 1915 he worked as a Radio Inspector for the U.S. Department of Commerce, initially posted in New York City, before transferring in late 1914 to Seattle, Washington. In 1915 he began ten years as a Radio Aide for the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b625969;view=1up;seq=846 "Robert Henry Marriott"],''Who's Who in Engineering: 1922-1923'', page 840.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time he experimented in the Puget Sound with a system for guiding ships that used an induction current carried by an underwater cable. In 1922 this approach was used by the Navy with the installation of the [[Ambrose Channel pilot cable]] at the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Woods1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. Woods|title=Signaling and communicating at sea|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1980|publisher=Arno Press|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he became a consulting engineer,&lt;ref name="widow"/&gt; and worked with the [[Federal Radio Commission]] in 1928-1929. During the opening years of World War Two, he served as a chief examiner of the United States-British Civilian Technical Corps and a radar examiner for the U.S. Navy, prior to his retirement in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert H. Marriott, 72, Pioneer in Field of Radio Engineering", ''Brooklyn Eagle'', November 1, 1951, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 1951, the IRE Board of Directors noted his passing with a resolution that stated: "His foresight in discerning the need for a society of radio engineers was a powerful stimulus to the formation of the Institute. His unselfish, skilled, and unlimited devotion to the conduct of the activities of the Institute in its earliest years contributed substantially to the creation of the firm foundation upon which the Institute has grown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4050760 "Robert H. Marriott: 1879-1951"], ''Proceedings of the I.R.E'', January, 1952, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">'''The Russian avos' ''' ({{lang-ru|русское авось}}) describes a philosophy of behavior, or attitude, of a person who ignores possible problems or hassles and, at the same time, expects or hopes for no negative results or consequences. It is an attitude that treats life as unpredictable and holds that the best one can do is count on luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wierzbicka |first=Anna |title=Semantics, Culture, and Cognition |date=1992 |isbn=0-19-507326-6 |page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Novicow |first=Jacques |author2=Yakov Aleksandrovich Novikov  |title=The Expansion of Russia: Problems of the East and Problems of the Far East |date=1904 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
"Avos" (авось) proper is a [[Russian language|Russian]] word that can be used either as a particle or a noun. As a particle, "avos" is close in meaning to "hopefully" or "maybe" (when talking of something hoped for and uncertain). When used as a noun, "avos" means "hit or miss", "hope against hope", or "something done under risk and in the hope for good result in the end". The avos' attitude is believed by many to be intrinsic to Russian character, just as is the notion of "sud'ba" (судьба) which roughly translates, depending on the context, as "destiny," "convocation," "fate," or "fatum."

This kind of attitude has been described in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s novel ''[[Oblomov]]''; earlier, [[Alexander Pushkin]] ironically called avos' "the Russian [[shibboleth]]" ([[Eugene Onegin]], chapter X).

The '''Sama language''', ''Sinama'' (''Sama'' + the [[infix]] ''-in-''; also known as Bahasa Bajau), is the language of [[Sama Bajau]] people of the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Philippines]]; [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] and parts of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bdl&lt;/ref&gt; The Sama are one of the most widely dispersed peoples in Southeast Asia.

==Classification==
The ''Ethnologue'' divides Sinama into 7 languages based on [[mutual intelligibility]]. The 7 Sinama languages are Northern Sinama, Central Sinama, Southern Sinama, Sinama Pangutaran from the island of [[Pangutaran, Sulu|Pangutaran]] off of Jolo island, Mapun, Bajau West Coast of Sabah and Bajau Indonesia.  Jama Mapun, a language from the island of [[Mapun, Tawi-Tawi|Mapun]], formerly known as Cagayan de Sulu, is a related language and sometimes also referred to as Sinama.  These classifications are rarely recognized by Sama themselves who instead classify their Sinama by the village or island it originates from.  The emic classification of a Sama person's language e.g. Silumpak, Laminusa, Tabawan generally form the different dialects of the 7 Sinama or Bajau languages.

==Phonology==
[[File:Sinama Reading Poster.jpg|thumb|A reading poster for the Sinama language created by Kauman Sama Online for free use.]][[File:Sama woman making a traditional mat.JPG|thumb|This woman making a traditional mat is a Sama from Siasi who now lives in Semporna, Malaysia.]]Sinama languages have 21 to 24 [[phoneme]]s.  All Sinama languages have 17 [[consonant]]s.  Each language has from 5 to 7 [[vowel]]s.

===Consonants===
The consonants of the Sinama languages are represented by the letters b, d, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, t, w, y and '.

Representation of the glottal stop in Sinama has not yet reached a consensus among Sinama speakers.  Linguists have suggested the use of an apostrophe like character (') for word final glottal stops.  Central Sinama has adopted this for glottal stops in between vowels as well (i.e. a'a, the Sinama word for human).  Other Sinama languages have chosen to follow Tagalog orthography and to leave this vowel medial glottal stop ambiguous.  Sinama speakers often spell the word final glottal stop with an h at the end.  Sinama speakers in Malaysia may also spell it with a ''k'' following the vowel softening patterns of [[Malay Language|Bahasa Melayu]].

In certain dialects of Sinama ''b'' becomes ''[[voiced bilabial fricative|β]]'' and ''g'' becomes ''[[voiced velar fricative|Ɣ]]'' when found between two vowels.

===Vowels===
The vowels a, e, i, o, u are found in all Sinama languages and dialects.  In addition to these 5 vowels ə, and ɤ are found in one or more Sinama language.

Many of the Sinama languages have contrastive vowel lengthening.  This is represented by a macron over the vowel (āēīōū).

===Stress===
Sinama pronunciation is quite distinct from other nearby languages such as [[Tausug language|Tausug]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] in that all of the Sinama languages primary stress occurs on the penultimate syllable of the word.&lt;ref name="Pallesen1985"/&gt;{{rp|124}}  Stress will remain on the penultimate syllable even with the addition of suffixes including enclitic pronouns.  In Northern Sinama (Balanguingi') the stress will shift to the ultima when the penult is the mid central vowel /ə/.

===Enclitic Pronouns===
The 1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd singular pronouns ''-ku'', ''-nu'' and ''-na'' respectively, the 1st plural inclusive pronouns ''-ta'' and ''-tam'', as well as the 2nd plural pronoun ''-bi'' are all enclitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurupan Sama Bahagiꞌ 1: Angay sinugpat saga pronoun ni kabtangan ma bihingna?|url=http://sinama.org/2012/08/hurupan-sama-bahagi%EA%9E%8C-1-vowel-karuwa-min-katapusan-kabtangan/|website=Kauman Sama Online: Sinama Social Network for Sama &amp; Bajau|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enclitic pronouns change the pronunciation by shifting the stress of a word through the addition of a syllable; a verb or noun combined with a suffixed one syllable enclitic pronoun.  Some Sinama orthographies represent this by writing both noun/verb and pronoun as one word e.g. ''luma'ta'' for "our house" in Central Sinama.  Other orthographies represent this with a hypen e.g. ''luma'-ta'' for "our house" in Southern Sinama.  Still others write this keeping the noun/verb separate from the prounoun e.g. ''luma' ta'' for "our house" in Northern Sinama.

==Cultural references==
The lyrics of the song called ''[[Kiriring Pakiriring]]'' (popularly known as ''Dayang Dayang'') were written in the Simunul dialect of the Southern Sinama language.

Central Sinama and Southern Sinama are 2 of 6 languages used in the 2012 Filipino drama film, [[Thy Womb]].

Sinama is featured on the 1991 edition of the [[Philippine one thousand peso bill]].  Langgal is written under a picture of a Sama place of worship.  Langgal is the Sinama for that place of worship.

'''Sistani Persian people''' or '''Sistanis''' are a Persian speaking ethnic Persian group who primarily inhabit [[Sistan]] in southeastern [[Iran]]. They live in the northern part of [[Sistan and Balouchistan province]], where they form a minority after [[Baluchis]]. Since recent decades many also have migrated to other parts of Iran such as [[Tehran Province|Tehran]] and [[Golestan province]]s in northern Iran. The largest city of Sistan region is [[Zabol]]. Sistanis speak a dialect of Persian known as [[Sistani Language|Zaboli]] or [[Sistani Language|Sistani]].

Sistani Persians are [[Shia Muslims]], in contrast to [[Baluchis]] who are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]s. The Iranian Shia cleric [[Ayatollah Sistani]], though from Mashhad, had an ancestor who moved to Sistan during the Safavid era to engage in religious activities in the region.
