The '''Ames Research Center''' ('''ARC'''), also known as '''NASA Ames''', is a major [[NASA]] research center at [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] in California's [[Silicon Valley]]. It was founded in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/about/history.html |title=NASA Ames Research Center History|last1=NASA |date=18 Aug 2006 |accessdate=13 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the second [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) laboratory. That agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) on October 1, 1958. NASA Ames is named in honor of [[Joseph Sweetman Ames]], a physicist and one of the founding members of NACA. At last estimate NASA Ames has over US$3 billion in capital equipment, 2,300 research personnel and a US$860 million annual budget.

Ames was founded to conduct wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, its role has expanded to encompass spaceflight and information technology. Ames plays a role in many NASA missions. It provides leadership in [[astrobiology]]; small satellites; robotic lunar exploration; the search for habitable planets; [[supercomputing]]; intelligent/adaptive systems; advanced thermal protection; and airborne astronomy. Ames also develops tools for a safer, more efficient national airspace. The center's current director is Eugene Tu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivegov.com/2015/05/eugene-tu-named-director-of-nasa-ames-research-center-charles-bolden-comments/ |title=Eugene Tu Named Director of NASA Ames Research Center; Charles Bolden Comments |first1=Jay |last1=Clemens |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is mission center for several key current missions ([[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]], the ''Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite'' ([[LCROSS]]) mission, [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA), [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]]) and a major contributor to the "new exploration focus"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004EO050003/abstract |title=New exploration focus will not diminish Earth science agenda, NASA says |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]] |publisher=American Geophysical Union |first=Randy |last=Showstack |volume=85 |issue=5 |page=46 |date=February 3, 2004 |doi=10.1029/2004EO050003|bibcode=2004EOSTr..85S..46S }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a participant in the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] crew exploration vehicle.

== Missions ==
Although Ames is a NASA Research Center, and not a flight center, it has nevertheless been closely involved in a number of astronomy and space missions.

The [[Pioneer program]]'s eight successful space missions from 1965 to 1978 were managed by Charles Hall at Ames, initially aimed at the inner solar system.  By 1972, it supported the bold flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn with [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]].  Those two missions were trail blazers (radiation environment, new moons, gravity-assist flybys) for the planners of the more complex  [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] missions, launched five years later.  In 1978, the end of the program brought about a return to the inner solar system, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

[[Lunar Prospector]] was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and construction as part of the [[Discovery Program]]. At a cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was put into a low polar orbit of the Moon, accomplishing mapping of surface composition and possible polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. Based on Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is indeed [[ice|water ice]] in the polar craters of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutron Spectrometer Results |url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |publisher=''[[NASA]]'' |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531054648/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |archivedate=31 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission ended July 31, 1999 when the orbiter was guided to an impact into a crater near the lunar south pole in an (unsuccessful) attempt to analyze lunar polar water by vaporizing it to allow spectroscopic characterization from Earth telescopes.

The 11-pound (5&amp;nbsp;kg) [[GeneSat-1]], carrying bacteria inside a miniature laboratory, was launched on December 16, 2006. The very small NASA satellite has proven that scientists can quickly design and launch a new class of inexpensive spacecraft—and conduct significant science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genesat.arc.nasa.gov |title=GeneSat-1 |publisher=Genesat.arc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018163450/http://genesat.arc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2010-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission to look for water on the moon was a 'secondary payload spacecraft.' LCROSS began its trip to the moon on the same rocket as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ([[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter|LRO]]), which continues to conduct a different lunar task. It launched in April 2009 on an Atlas V rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida.

The [[Kepler mission]] is NASA's first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets. The Kepler mission will monitor the brightness of stars to find planets that pass in front of them during the planets' orbits. During such passes or 'transits,' the planets will slightly decrease the star's brightness.

Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a joint venture of the U.S. and German aerospace agencies, NASA and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) to make an [[infrared]] telescope platform that can fly at altitudes high enough to be in the infrared-transparent regime above the water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. The aircraft is supplied by the U.S., and the infrared telescope by Germany. Modifications of the [[Boeing 747]]SP airframe to accommodate the telescope, mission-unique equipment and large external door were made by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems of [[Waco, Texas]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]] mission is a partnership with the [[Lockheed Martin]] Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory to understand the processes at the boundary between the Sun's [[chromosphere]] and [[corona]].  This mission is sponsored by the NASA [[Small Explorer program]].

The Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer ([[LADEE]]) mission has been developed by NASA Ames. This successfully launched to the Moon on September 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA Launch Schedule &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2014-04-18 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ames has played a support role in a number of missions, most notably the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and [[Mars Exploration Rover]] missions, where the Ames [[Intelligent Robotics Group|Intelligent Robotics Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent Robotics Laboratory [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ nasa.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130102527/http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; played a key role. NASA Ames was a partner on the Mars ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'', a [[Mars Scout Program]] mission to send a high-latitude lander to Mars, deployed a robotic arm to dig trenches up to 1.6 feet (one half meter) into the layers of water ice and analyzing the soil composition. Ames is also a partner on the [[Mars Science Laboratory]], a next generation Mars rover to explore for signs of organics and complex molecules.

==Air traffic control automation research==
The Aviation Systems Division conducts research and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow for up to three times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.

The center's flight simulation and guidance laboratory was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2017.

{{see also|Human-centered computing (NASA)}}
Ames is the home of NASA's large research and development divisions in [[NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division|Advanced Supercomputing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov |title=NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division |publisher=Nas.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Human Factors'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov |title=Human Factors |publisher=Human-factors.arc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Artificial Intelligence]] (Intelligent Systems&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent Systems [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov  ti.arc.nasa]&lt;/ref&gt;). These Research &amp; Development organizations support NASA's Exploration efforts, as well as the continued operations of the  [[International Space Station]], and the [[space science]] and [[Aeronautics]] work across NASA. The center also runs and maintains the E [[Root nameserver]] of the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] System.

The Intelligent Systems Division  is NASA's leading R&amp;D Division developing advanced intelligent software and systems for all of NASA Mission Directorates. It provides software expertise for aeronautics, space science missions, [[International Space Station]], and the Crewed Exploration Vehicle ([[Crew Exploration Vehicle|CEV]]. The first AI in space ([[Deep Space 1]]) was developed from Code TI, as is the MAPGEN software that daily plans the activities for the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], the same core reasoner is used for Ensemble to operate [[Phoenix Lander]], and the planning system for the [[International Space Station]]'s solar arrays. Integrated System Health Management for the [[International Space Station]]'s control moment gyroscopes, collaborative systems with semantic search tools, and robust software engineering round out the scope of Code TI's work.

The [[Human Systems Integration Division]]  "advances [[human-centered design]] and operations of complex aerospace systems through analysis, experimentation, and modelling of human performance and human-automation interaction to make dramatic improvements in safety, efficiency and mission success".&lt;ref&gt;[http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov human-factors.arc.nasa Human Systems Integration Division]&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the Human Systems Integration Division has been on the leading edge of human-centered aerospace research. The Division is home to over 100 researchers, contractors and administrative staff.

Ames operates one of the world's fastest [[supercomputer]]s, [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]], which will be further enhanced and is scheduled to reach 10 [[FLOPS|petaflops]] of [[processing power]] by 2012.

In September 2009, Ames launched NEBULA as a fast and powerful Cloud Computing Platform to handle NASA's massive data sets that complied with security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Ames Research Center [http://nebula.nasa.gov/ "NEBULA Cloud Computing Platform"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120105631/http://nebula.nasa.gov/ |date=2010-01-20 }}, Retrieved (January 17, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative pilot uses open-source components, complies with FISMA and can scale to Government-sized demands while being extremely energy efficient.  In July 2010, NASA CTO [[Chris C. Kemp]] open sourced Nova, the technology behind the NEBULA Project in collaboration with [[Rackspace]], launching [[OpenStack]].  OpenStack has subsequently become one of the largest and fastest growing [[Open-source software|open source projects]] in the [[history of computing]], and {{as of|2014|lc=y}} has been included in most major distributions of [[linux]] including [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]], [[Oracle Linux|Oracle]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[openSUSE|SUSE]], and [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]].

== Image processing ==
NASA Ames was one of the first locations in the world to conduct research on image processing of [[satellite]]-platform aerial photography. Some of the pioneering techniques of contrast enhancement using [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] analysis were developed at Ames in conjunction with researchers at [[ESL Inc.]]

== Wind tunnels ==

The [[NASA]] Ames Research Center [[wind tunnel]]s are known not only for their immense size, but also for their diverse characteristics that enable various kinds of scientific and engineering research.

===ARC Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel===
{{main|Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel}}
The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) was completed in 1956 at a cost of $27 million under the Unitary Plan Act of 1949. Since its completion, the UPWT facility has been the most heavily used [[NASA]] wind tunnel. Every major commercial transport and almost every military jet built in the United States over the last 40 years has been tested in this facility. Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft space shuttle models were also tested in this tunnel complex.

===National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC)===
Ames Research Center also houses the world's largest wind tunnel, part of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC): it is large enough to test full-sized planes, rather than scale models.  The complex of wind tunnels was listed on the National Register in 2017.

[[Image:20090422MSLtestparachute.jpg|right|thumb|230px|The [[Mars Science Laboratory]] landing parachute under test in the 80 by 120 foot wind tunnel. Note the people in the lower-right corner of the image.]]
The 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel circuit was originally constructed in the 1940s and is now capable of providing test velocities up to {{convert|300|kn}}.&lt;ref name="rotorcraft"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/Research/Facilities/windtunnels.html|title=40- by 80-/80- by 120-Foot Wind Tunnels|editor-last=Segall|editor-first=Meridith|access-date=22 July 2018|website=Aeromechanics|publisher=NASA Ames Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated with an emphasis on estimating the accuracy of computational methods. The tunnel is also used to investigate the aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions. Stability and control derivatives are also determined, including the static and dynamic characteristics of new aircraft configurations. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art, non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of aircraft. The 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel is primarily used for determining the low- and medium-speed aerodynamic characteristics of high-performance aircraft, rotorcraft, and fixed wing, powered-lift V/STOL aircraft.

The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is the largest wind tunnel test section in the world. This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was installed in the 1980s. It is currently capable of air speeds up to {{convert|100|kn}}.&lt;ref name="rotorcraft" /&gt; This section is used in similar ways to the 40 by 80 foot section, but it is capable of testing larger aircraft, albeit at slower speeds. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 Tilt Rotor, and Advance Recovery System Parafoil. The 80 by 120 foot test section is capable of testing a full size Boeing 737.

Although decommissioned by [[NASA]] in 2003, the NFAC is now being operated by the [[United States Air Force]] as a satellite facility of the [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] (AEDC).

== Arc Jet Complex ==
The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an advanced thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under a variety of simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven vacuum system, a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, data acquisition system, and other auxiliary systems.

The magnitude and capacity of these systems makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique in the world. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, is one of the highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples {{convert|203|by|508|mm|sp=us}} in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. [[Catalycity]] studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.

The Arc Jet Complex was listed on the National Register in 2017.

== Range complex ==

===Ames Vertical Gun Range===
The [[Ames Vertical Gun Range]] (AVGR) was designed to conduct scientific studies of lunar impact processes in support of the Apollo missions. In 1979, it was established as a National Facility, funded through the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program. In 1995, increased scientific needs across various disciplines resulted in joint core funding by three different science programs at NASA Headquarters (Planetary Geology and Geophysics, Exobiology, and Solar System Origins). In addition, the AVGR provides programmatic support for various proposed and ongoing planetary missions (e.g. Stardust, Deep Impact).

Using its 0.30 [[Caliber|cal]] light-gas gun and powder gun, the AVGR can launch projectiles to velocities ranging from {{convert|500|to|7000|m/s|abbr=on}}. By varying the gun's angle of elevation with respect to the target vacuum chamber, impact angles from 0° to 90° relative to the gravitational vector are possible. This unique feature is extremely important in the study of crater formation processes.

The target chamber is approximately {{convert|2.5|m|sp=us}} in diameter and height and can accommodate a wide variety of targets and mounting fixtures. It can maintain vacuum levels below {{convert|0.03|Torr|Pa}}, or can be back filled with various gases to simulate different planetary atmospheres. Impact events are typically recorded with high-speed video/film, or Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).

===Hypervelocity Free-Flight Range===
The [[Hypervelocity Free-Flight]] (HFF) Range currently comprises two active facilities: the Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) and the Gun Development Facility (HFFGDF). The HFFAF is a combined Ballistic Range and Shock-tube Driven Wind Tunnel. Its primary purpose is to examine the aerodynamic characteristics and flow-field structural details of free-flying aeroballistic models.

The HFFAF has a test section equipped with 16 shadowgraph-imaging stations. Each station can be used to capture an orthogonal pair of images of a [[hypervelocity]] model in flight. These images, combined with the recorded flight time history, can be used to obtain critical aerodynamic parameters such as lift, drag, static and dynamic stability, flow characteristics, and pitching moment coefficients. For very high [[Mach number]] (M &gt; 25) simulations, models can be launched into a counter-flowing gas stream generated by the shock tube. The facility can also be configured for hypervelocity impact testing and has an aerothermodynamic capability as well. The HFFAF is currently configured to operate the {{convert|1.5|in}} [[light-gas gun]] in support of continuing thermal imaging and transition research for NASA's hypersonics program.

The HFFGDF is used for gun performance enhancement studies, and occasional impact testing. The Facility uses the same arsenal of light-gas and powder guns as the HFFAF to accelerate particles that range in size from {{convert|3.2|to|25.4|mm|sp=us}} diameter to velocities ranging from 0.5 to 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s (1,500 to 28,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s). Most of the research effort to date has centered on Earth atmosphere entry configurations (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle), planetary entry designs ([[Viking]], [[Pioneer Venus]], [[Galileo]] and [[Mars Science Laboratory|MSL]]), and aerobraking (AFE) configurations. The facility has also been used for scramjet propulsion studies ([[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]]) and meteoroid/orbital debris impact studies ([[Space Station]] and [[Reusable launch vehicle|RLV]]). In 2004, the facility was utilized for foam-debris dynamics testing in support of the Return To Flight effort. As of March 2007, the GDF has been reconfigured to operate a cold gas gun for subsonic [[Crew Exploration Vehicle|CEV]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] aerodynamics.

===Electric Arc Shock Tube===
The [[Electric Arc Shock Tube]] (EAST) Facility is used to investigate the effects of radiation and ionization that occur during very high velocity atmospheric entries. In addition, the EAST can also provide air-blast simulations requiring the strongest possible shock generation in air at an initial pressure loading of {{convert|1|atm}} or greater. The facility has three separate driver configurations, to meet a range of test requirements: the driver can be connected to a diaphragm station of either a {{convert|102|mm|sp=us}} or a {{convert|610|mm|sp=us}} shock tube, and the high-pressure {{convert|102|mm|sp=us}} shock tube can also drive a {{convert|762|mm|sp=us}} shock tunnel. Energy for the drivers is supplied by a 1.25-MJ-capacitor storage system.

==United States Geological Survey (USGS)==
In September 2016, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) announced plans to relocate its West Coast science center from nearby [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] to the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The relocation is expected to take five years and will begin in 2017 with 175 of the USGS employees moving to Moffett. The relocation is designed to save money on the $7.5 million annual rent the USGS pays for its Menlo Park campus. The land in Menlo Park is owned by the [[General Services Administration]], which is required by federal law to charge market-rate rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noack|first1=Mark|title=USGS moving to new home at Moffett Field|url=http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2016/09/19/usgs-eyes-new-home-at-moffett-field|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=Mountain View Voice|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics Alliance Project ===
In 1999, Mark León developed NASA's Robotics Education Project&amp;nbsp;— now called the Robotics Alliance Project&amp;nbsp;— under his mentor Dave Lavery, which has reached over 100,000 students nationwide using [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST robotics]] and [[Botball|BOTBALL]] robotics competitions. The Project's FIRST branch originally comprised [[FIRST Robotics Competition|FRC]] [http://www.team254.com/ Team 254: "The Cheesy Poofs"], an all-male team from [[Bellarmine College Preparatory|Bellarmine High School]] in San José, California. In 2006, [http://spacecookies.org Team 1868: "The Space Cookies"], an all-female team, was founded in collaboration with the Girl Scouts.  In 2012, [http://frc971.org/ Team 971: "Spartan Robotics"] of [[Mountain View High School (Mountain View, California)|Mountain View High School]] joined the Project, though the team continues to operate at their school. All three teams are highly decorated. All three have won Regional competitions, two have won the [[FIRST Championship]], two have won the Regional Chairman's Award, and one is a Hall of Fame team. The three teams are collectively referred to as "House teams".

The mission of the project is "To create a human, technical, and programmatic resource of robotics capabilities to enable the implementation of future robotic space exploration missions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Robotics Alliance Project Mission|url=http://robotics.nasa.gov/mission.php | work=NASA Robotics Alliance Project | publisher=NASA | accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent events ==
Although the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] slightly increased funding
for [[NASA]] overall, the substantial realignment in research priorities that followed the announcement of the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] in 2004 led to a significant number of layoffs at Ames.

On October 22, 2006, NASA opened the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. The center continued work that [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] undertook, including the [[Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]].

In 2008, the [[Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project]] (LOIRP) was given space in the old [[McDonald's]] (the building was renamed McMoons) to digitize data tapes from the five 1966 and 1967 [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft that were sent to the [[Moon]].

Also in 2008, it was announced that former Ames director [[Henry McDonald (engineer)|Henry McDonald]] was a 60th Anniversary Class inductee of the Ames Hall of Fame for providing, "...exceptional leadership and keen technical insight to NASA Ames as the Center re-invented itself in the late 1990s."

In 2010, scientists at the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at Ames studied the aerodynamics of the [[Adidas Jabulani|Jabulani]] World Cup soccer ball, concluding that it tends to "[[knuckleball|knuckle under]]" at speeds of {{convert|45|to|50|mph}}.&lt;ref name='nasa_soccer'&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/nasalife/features/soccer_ball.html ''NASA Scores Big With Student Soccer Players in the U.S.A. and Canada''].  18 June 2010.

In March 2015, scientists at Ames announced that they had synthesized "...[[uracil]], [[cytosine]], and [[thymine]], all three components of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]], non-biologically in a laboratory under conditions found in space." &lt;ref&gt;[http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/03/05/nasa-scientists-create-ingredients-of-life-in-simulated-space-conditions/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public-private partnerships ==

The federal government has re-tasked portions of the facility and human resources to [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/business/index.html support] private sector industry, research, and education.

[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] became the first corporate affiliate of a new Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI); a collaborative venture established by the [[University of California Santa Cruz]] and NASA, based at Ames. The Bio|Info|Nano R&amp;D Institute is dedicated to creating scientific breakthroughs by the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology.

[[Singularity University]] hosts its leadership and educational program at the facility. The [[Organ Preservation Alliance]][http://www.organpreservationalliance.org/] is also headquartered there; the Alliance is a nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the [[Methuselah Foundation]]'s [[Methuselah Foundation#New Organ Prize|New Organ Prize]] "to catalyze breakthroughs on the remaining obstacles towards the long-term storage of organs" to overcome the drastic unmet medical need for viable organs for transplantation. [[Kleenspeed Technologies]] is headquartered there.

===Google===
On September 28, 2005, [[Google]] and Ames Research Center disclosed details to a long-term research partnership. In addition to pooling engineering talent, Google planned to build a {{convert|1000000|sqft|ha|adj=on}} facility on the ARC campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2005/05_50AR.html nasa.gov] NASA Takes Google on Journey into Space&lt;/ref&gt; One of the projects between Ames, Google, and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] is the [[Gigapan]] Project—a robotic platform for creating, sharing, and annotating terrestrial [[gigapixel]] images.

Announced on 10 November 2014, Planetary Ventures LLC (a Google subsidiary) will lease the [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] from NASA Ames, a site of about 1,000 acres formerly costing the agency $6.3 million annually in maintenance and operation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs Lease with Planetary Ventures LLC for Use of Moffett Airfield and Restoration of Hangar One|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/november/nasa-signs-lease-with-planetary-ventures-llc-for-use-of-moffett-airfield-and/#.Vp-ov5R4dvs|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Agency|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lease includes the restoration of the site's historic landmark [[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)|Hangar One]], as well as hangars Two and Three. The lease went into effect in March 2015, and spans 60 years.

== Living and working at Ames ==
There are a myriad of activities inside the research center and around for full-time workers and interns alike. There was a Parcourse trail, also known as a [[fitness trail]] inside the base, but sections of it are inaccessible due to changes in base layout since it was installed. An official NASA ID is required to enter Ames.

'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.&lt;ref name="Berger&amp;Calabrese"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, C. 1979. ''The contact hypothesis in ethnic relations''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|pages=|issn=0270-6075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Stephan&amp;Stephan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they don’t feel secure and they aren’t sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individuals’ distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].&lt;ref name="Doise"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/levels-of-explanation-in-social-psychology/oclc/13004532|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

• The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/45409297|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we're misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we're misinterpreting others' behavior but don't do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"&lt;ref name="Blalock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25192027|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|location=|pages=|oclc=651907062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co|isbn=978-0201523416|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18779775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|edition=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=914195352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, P., Evett, S., &amp; Vasquez-Suson, K. (1996). "Exploring the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup contact". In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition''. (Vol 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;423–464). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=305|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individualism And Collectivism|authorlink1=Harry C. Triandis|last=Triandis|first=Harry C.|date=1995-05-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780813318509|location=Boulder, Colo.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} whereas members of individualistic cultures usually only draw as sharp of distinctions among differing ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=307|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, G., &amp; Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–619). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt;.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177–193|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

A '''bigraph''' (often used in the plural '''bigraphs''') can be modelled as the superposition of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (the ''link graph'') and a set of [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the ''place graph'').&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;''[http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Introduction_To_Bigraphs A Brief Introduction To Bigraphs]'', [[IT University of Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;Milner, Robin.

==Anatomy of a bigraph==

Aside from nodes and ([[hyperedge|hyper-]])[[Edge (graph theory)|edges]], a bigraph may have associated with it one or more ''regions'' which are roots in the place forest, and zero or more  ''holes'' in the place graph, into which other bigraph regions may be inserted.  Similarly, to nodes we may assign ''controls'' that define identities and an arity (the number of ''ports'' for a given node to which link-graph edges may connect).  These controls are drawn from a bigraph ''signature''.  In the link graph we define ''inner'' and ''outer'' names, which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link.

==Foundations==

A bigraph is a 5-tuple:

&lt;math&gt;(V,E,ctrl,prnt,link) : \langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set of nodes, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a set of edges, &lt;math&gt;ctrl&lt;/math&gt; is the ''control map'' that assigns controls to nodes, &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is the ''parent map'' that defines the nesting of nodes, and &lt;math&gt;link&lt;/math&gt; is the ''link map'' that defines the link structure.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the bigraph has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ''holes'' (sites) and a set of inner names &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''regions'', with a set of ''outer names'' &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  These are respectively known as the ''inner'' and ''outer'' interfaces of the bigraph.

Formally speaking, each bigraph is an arrow in a symmetric partial [[monoidal category]] (usually abbreviated ''spm-category'') in which the objects are these interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

In bigraphs with sharing, the place graph is defined as a [[directed acyclic graph |directed acyclic graph (DAG)]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;prnt&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binary relation]] instead of a [[Function (mathematics)|map]]. The definition of link graph is unaffected by the introduction of sharing. Note that standard bigraphs are a sub-class of bigraphs with sharing.

{{Anthropology of art|Basic}}

'''Body culture studies''' describe and compare bodily practice in the larger context of [[culture]] and [[society]], i.e. in the tradition of [[anthropology]], [[history]] and [[sociology]]. As body culture studies analyse culture and society in terms of human bodily practices, they are sometimes viewed as a form of [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].
The significance of the body and of body culture (in German ''Körperkultur'', in Danish ''kropskultur'') was discovered since the early twentieth century by several historians and sociologists. During the 1980s, a particular school of body culture studies spread, in connection with – and critically related to – [[sport]]s studies. Body culture studies were especially established at Danish universities and academies and cooperated with Nordic, European and East Asian research networks.

Body culture studies include studies of [[dance]], play ([[play (activity)]]) and [[game]], outdoor activities, festivities and other forms of movement culture. The field of body culture studies is floating towards studies of medical cultures, of working habits, of [[gender]] and sexual cultures, of [[fashion]] and [[body decoration]], of popular [[festivity]] and more generally towards [[popular culture]] studies.

Body culture studies have shown useful by making the study of sport enter into broader historical and sociological discussion – from the level of subjectivity to civil society, state and market.

== Earlier studies in body and culture ==

Since early 20th century, sociologists and philosophers had discovered the significance of the body, especially [[Norbert Elias]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and some phenomenologists. Later, [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and the Stuttgart [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] delivered important inspirations for the new body culture studies.

The sociologist Norbert Elias (1939) wrote the first sociology, which placed the body and bodily practice in its centre, describing the change of table manners, shame and violence from the Middle Ages to Early Modern court society as a process of civilisation. Later, Elias (1989) studied the culture of duel in Wilhelminian Prussia, throwing light on particular traits of the German [[sonderweg]]. Elias' figurational sociology of the body became productive especially in the field of sport studies (Elias/ Dunning 1986; [[Eric Dunning]] et al. 2004). His concept of the "process of civilisation" received, however, also critique from the side of comparative [[anthropology]] of bodily practices (Duerr 1988/2005).

The [[Frankfurt School]] of [[Critical Theory]] turned towards the body with [[Marxist]] and [[Freudian]] perspectives. [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1947) described the Western "[[dialectics]] of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]" as including an underground history of the body. Body history lead from the living body to the dead body becoming a commodity under [[capitalism]]. A younger generation of the Frankfurt School launched the [[Neo-Marxist]] sports critique (Rigauer 1969) and developed alternative approaches to movement studies and movement culture (Lippe 1974; Moegling 1988). Historical studies about the body in industrial work (Rabinbach 1992), in transportation (Schivelbusch 1977), and in [[Fascist]] aesthetics ([[Theweleit]] 1977) as well as in the philosophy of [[space]] ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998/ 2004) had their roots in this critical approach.

Philosophical phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) paid attention to the body, too. [[Helmuth Plessner]] (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional body-mind dualism of [[René Descartes]]. [[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by "[[psychoanalysis]] of fire".

Based on phenomenological traditions, [[Michel Foucault]] (1975) studied the configurations of knowledge in the post-1800 society, launching the concept of modern panoptical control (→[[Panopticon]]). The body appeared as object of military discipline and of the panopticon as a mechanism of "the biopolitics of power". Foucault's approach became especially influential for studies in sport, space, and architecture (Vertinsky/ Bale 2004) as well as for studies in the discipline of [[gymnastic]] and sport ([[Vigarello]] 1978; Barreau/ Morne 1984; Vertinsky/ McKay 2004).

While Foucault's studies focused on top-down strategies of power, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] directed his attention more towards bottom-up processes of social-bodily practice. For analysing the class aspect of the body, Bourdieu (1966/67) developed the influential concept of habitus as an incorporated pattern becoming social practice by diverse forms of taste, distinction and display of the body. Some of Bourdieu's disciples applied these concepts to the study of sports and gymnastics (Defrance 1987).

In Germany, influences of phenomenology induced body culture studies in the historical field. The Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] focused from 1971 on [[gestures]] and laughter, [[martial arts]], sport and dance to analyze changes of society and differences between European and non-European cultures (Nitschke 1975, 1981, 1987, 1989, 2009; [[Henning Eichberg]] 1978).

These approaches met with tendencies of the late 1970s and 1980s, when [[humanities]] and [[sociology]] developed a new and broader interest in the body. Sociologists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists, scholars from sport studies and from medical studies met in talking about "the return of the body" or its "reappearance" (Kamper/ Wulf 1982). The new interest towards the body was soon followed up by the term "body culture" itself.

== The word and concept of "body culture" – alternative practice ==

The word "body culture" appeared for first time around 1900, but at that time signifying a certain form of physical practice. The so-called "life reform" (German ''[[Lebensreform]]'') aimed at the reform of clothing and of nurture and favoured new bodily activities, which constituted a new sector side by side with established gymnastics and sport. The main fields of this third sector of movement culture were [[nudism]], rhythmic-expressive gymnastics, [[yoga]] and [[body building]] (Wedemeyer-Kolwe 2004) as well as a new type of youth wandering. Though highly diverse, they found a comprehensive term in the German word ''Körperkultur'', in English [[physical culture]] (→[[physical education]]), in French ''culture physique'', and in Danish ''kropskultur''. Inspirations from the movement of body culture gave birth to early studies in the history of bodily positions and movements (Gaulhofer 1930; [[Marcel Mauss]] 1934).

In German Socialist workers' sport, the concept of ''Körperkultur'' had a prominent place. The concept also entered into Russian [[Socialism]] where ''fiskultura'' became an alternative to [[bourgeois]] sport, uniting the revolutionary fractions of more aesthetical ''[[Proletkult]]'' and more health-oriented "hygienism" (Riordan 1977). Later, [[Stalinism]] forced the contradictory terms under the formula "sport and body culture". This continued in the [[Soviet bloc]] after 1945.
When the 1968 [[student movement]] revived Marxism, the concept of body culture – ''Körperkultur'' in West Germany, "somatic culture" in America – re-entered into the sports-critical discourse, but received new analytical dimensions. ''Quel corps?'' (Which body?) was the title of a critical review of sports, edited by the French Marxist [[educationalist]] [[Jean-Marie Brohm]] in 1975-1997. In Germany, a series of books under the title ''Sport: Kultur, Veränderung'' (Sport: culture, change) marked the body cultural turn from 1981, with works of Rigauer, Elias, Eichberg and others.

== Body culture studies – a new critical school ==

In Denmark, a particular school of Body Culture Studies – ''kropskultur'' – developed since around 1980 in connection with the critique of sport (Korsgaard 1982; Eichberg 1998; Vestergård 2003; Nielsen 1993 and 2005). It had its background in Danish popular gymnastics and in alternative movement practices – outdoor activities, play and game, dance, [[meditation]]. In Finland, the concept ''ruumiinkulttuuri'' found a similar attention (Sironen 1995; Sparkes/ Silvennoinen 1999).

In international cooperation, "body anthropology" became the keyword for French, Danish and German philosophers, sociologists and educationalists who founded the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (IIAC)'' in 1987. They undertook case studies in traditional [[game]]s as well as in "scenes" of new urban body cultures (Barreau/ Morne 1984; Barreau/ Jaouen 1998; Dietrich 2001 and 2002).

Body culture studies found a particular interest in East Asian countries. In Japan, the sociologist Satoshi Shimizu from the University of Tsukuba established in 2002 a ''Centre for the Study of Body Culture'', publishing the review ''Gendai Sports Hyôron'' (Contemporary Sport Critique, in Japanese, since 1999). In Taiwan, Hsu I-hsiung from the National Taiwan Normal University founded in 2003 the ''Taiwan Body Culture Society'' (Taiwan shenti wenhua xiehui), publishing the reviews ''Sport Studies'' (in Chinese, since 2007) and ''Body Culture Journal'' (in Chinese, since 2005). And in Korea, Jong Young Lee from the University of Suwon published since 2004 the ''International Journal of Eastern Sport &amp; Physical Education'', focusing on body culture and traditional games.

These initiatives were connected with each other both by contents and by personal networks. In the English and American world, Allen Guttmann (1978, 1996, 2004), [[John Hoberman]] (1984), John Bale (1996, 2002, 2004), Susan Brownell (1995, 2008) and Patricia Vertinsky (2004) contributed by opening the history, sociology and geography of sports towards body culture studies.

While the concept of body culture earlier had denoted an alternative practice and was used in singular, it became now an analytical category describing body cultures in plural. The terms of physical culture (or [[physical education]]) and body culture separated – the first describing a practice, the second a subject of theoretical analysis.

== Questioning the "individual" body ==

Studies in body culture have shown that bodily existence is more than just "the body" as being an individual skin bag under control of an individual mind. Bodily practice happens between the different bodies. This questions current types of thinking "the [[individual]]": the [[epistemological]] [[individualism]] and the thesis of '[[Modern history#Late modern period|late-modern]] [[individualism|individualization]]'.

The methodological habit of counter-posing "the individual" and "the society" is largely disseminated in sociology. It was fundamentally criticized by [[Norbert Elias]] who underlined that there was no meaning in the separation between the individual as a sort of core of human existence and the society as a secondary environment around this core. Society was inside the human body. In contrast, the epistemological [[solipsism]] treated human existence as if the human being was alone in the world – and was only in a secondary process "socialized" ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998 vol. 1).

Another current assumption is the historical-sociological individualism. Sociologists as [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] have postulated that individualization during "high" or "late modernity" had replaced all earlier traditions – religion, nation, class – and left "the individual" alone with its body. The body, thus, got a central position as the only fix-point of "[[self-identity]]" left after the dissolution of the traditional norms. The individual chooses and makes its own body as a sort of "[[gesamtkunstwerk]] [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]".

Body-cultural studies have challenged this assumption ([[Henning Eichberg]] 2010: 58-79). They throw light on inter-bodily relations, within which the human individuality has a much more complex position.

== Social time ==

An important aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society is characterized by the significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern [[jogging]] as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the sport race of automobiles (→[[auto racing]]) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.

On the basis of [[transportation]] and [[urbanism]], [[blitzkrieg]] and sports, the French architect and cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] (1977) launched the terms of "dromology" (i.e. science of racing) and "dromocracy" (power or dominance of velocity) to describe the knowledge and the politics of modern social acceleration. But the concept of social time embraces many more differentiations, which can be explored by comparing time-dynamic movements of different ethnic cultures (Hall 1984).

== Social space ==

Another important aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space – physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→[[sports facilities]]) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called "sport scape". In movement, straight lines and the culture of the streamline were confronted by [[mazes]] and [[labyrinthine]] structures, by patterns of [[fractal]] geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the parcellation of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003). [[Proxemics]] (Hall 1966), the study of distance and space, has become a special field of body culture studies.

Body culture studies have also influenced the understanding of "nature". In the period around 1800, the "nature" of body culture – of outdoor life, [[naturism]] and green movements (→[[green politics]]) – became a world of liberation and opposition: "Back to nature!" In the course of modern industrial culture, this "other" nature became subjected to colonization and simulation, forming a "second nature". It even became a virtual world, which is simulating people's senses as a "third nature". The study of body culture contributed to a history of [[cultural ecology]] (Eichberg 1988).

Body cultural studies also contributed to a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as 'space' and 'place' whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] (see Bale 2004). Space can be described by coordinates and by certain [[choreographies]]. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which is the case with the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique – it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place – and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.

== Body culture and politics ==
Body culture can also be considered political such as how the [[body shape]] and appearance as well as sports, dance, and other recreational activities manifest and influence social change driven by politics. This is best demonstrated by [[practice theory]], which explains that, since body techniques serve as the means by which existing social order is produced and maintained, it, therefore, become important sites for challenging and transforming the social order when change does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training the Body for China: Sports in the Moral Order of the People's Republic|last=Brownell|first=Susan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0226076466|location=Chicago|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power plays, for instance, the body is used in sporting events as a form of rhetoric, articulating political causes. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the body became an important part of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[geopolitics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Post-9/11 American Sport: Power, Pedagogy and the Popular|last=Silk|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415873413|location=New York|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the projection of American power. On the other hand, the body was also used to condemn elitist and spectator sport within a mass physical culture starting this period in America, which evokes participation, inclusion, and populism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body is an integral component in the [[Feminist political theory|feminist politics]]. It is maintained that in order for this feminist initiatives to be effective, it is imperative that women's bodies, along with their works, labor, and voice, are present for everyone to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Suleiman|first=Susan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=0674298713|location=Cambridge|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilisation, discipline, modernity ==

Studies of body culture enriched the analysis of historical change by conflicting terms. [[Norbert Elias]] (1986) studied sport in order to throw light on the ''civilizing process'' (→[[The Civilizing Process]]). In sports, he saw a line going from original violence to civilized interlacement and pacification. Though there were undertones of hope, Elias tried to avoid [[evolutionism]], which since the nineteenth century postulated a 'progressive' way from 'primitive' to 'civilized' patterns.

While the concept of civilization normally had hopeful undertones, ''[[discipline]]'' had more critical undertones. Cultures of bodily discipline became visible – following [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and the [[Frankfurt School]] – in [[Baroque dance]] (Lippe 1974), in aristocratic and bourgeois pedagogy of the spinal column during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Vigarello 1978), and in [[hygienic]] strategies, school sanitation and school gymnastics during the twentieth century (Augestad 2003). Military exercise (→[[military drill]]) in Early Modern times was the classic field for body cultural discipline (Gaulhofer 1930; Kleinschmidt 1989).

In the field of sports, a central point of body-cultural dispute has been the question whether sport had its roots in Ancient Greek competitions of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] type or whether it was fundamentally linked to modernity. While nineteenth century's Neo-Humanism, Classicism and [[Olympism]] assumed the ancient roots of sport, body cultural studies showed that the patterns central to modern sports – quantification, rationalisation, principle of achievement – could not be dated before the industrial culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). What was practiced before, were popular games, noble exercises, festivities of different character, children's games and competitions, but not sport in modern understanding. The emergence of modern sport was an eruptive innovation rather than a logical prolongation of earlier practices. As a revolution of body culture, this transformation contributed to a deeper understanding of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory about the uniqueness of modern sport became, however, a matter of controversies and was opposed by other historians (Carter/Krüger 1990).

What came out of the controversies between the concepts of modernity, evolution, civilization, discipline and revolution was that "[[modernization]]" only can be thought as a non-lineal change with nuances and full of contradictions. This is how the history of sport (Nielsen 1993 and 2005) and of gymnastics (Defrance 1987; Vestergård Madsen 2003) as well as the history of [[running]] (Bale 2004) have been described in body-cultural terms.

One of the visible and at the same time deeper changes in relation to the modern body concerns the dress reform and the appearance of the naked body, especially in the years between 1900 and the 1920s. The change from noble pale skin to suntanned skin as a 'sportive' distinction was not only linked to sport, but had a strong impact on society as a whole. The change of appreciated body colour reversed the social-bodily distinctions between people and classes fundamentally, and nudism became a radical expression of this body-cultural change.

== Industrial body and production ==

Body culture studies have cast new light on the origins and conditions of the Industrial Revolution, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed people's everyday life in a fundamental way. The traditional common-sense explanations of [[industrialization]] by technology and economy as 'driving forces' have shown as insufficient. Economic interests and technological change had their basic conditions in human social-bodily practice. The history of sport and games in body cultural perspective showed that this practice was changing one or two generations, before the Industrial Revolution as a technological and economic transformation took place. What had been [[carnival]]-like festivities, [[tournaments]] and popular games before, became modern sport by a new focus on results, measuring and quantifying records (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). Under the aspect of the principle of achievement, there was no sport in ancient Egypt, in ancient Greece, among the [[Aztecs]] or [[Vikings]], and in European [[Middle Ages]], though there were games, competitions and festivities. Sport as a new type of body culture resulted from societal changes in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries.

The genesis of sport in connection with industrial [[productivity]] called to attention the historical-cultural relativity of "production" (→[[Manufacturing]]) itself. Studies in the history of "the human motor" and the "mortal engines" of sport showed reification (→[[reification (Marxism)]]) and technology as lines of historical dynamics (Rigauer 1969; Vigarello 1988; Rabinbach 1992; Hoberman 1992). Production became apparent not as a universal concept, but as something historically specific – and sport was its body-cultural ritual.

== Trialectics of body culture ==

Body culture as a field of contradictions demands a dialectical approach, but it is not dualistic in character. Body culture studies have revealed trialectical relations inside the world of sports (Eichberg 1998, 2010; Bale 1996, 2002 and 2004).

The hegemonic model of Western modern body culture is ''achievement sport'', translating movement into records. Sportive competition follows the logic of productivity by bodily strain and forms a ranking pyramid with elite sports placed at the top and the losers at the bottom. Through sportive movement, people display a theatre of production.

A contrasting model within modern body culture is delivered by ''mass sports''. In [[gymnastics]] and [[fitness training]], the body is disciplined by subjecting it to certain rules of "scientific", social geometrical or aesthetic order (Roubal 2007). By rhythmic repetition and formal homogenization, the individual bodies are integrated into a larger whole, which is recommended in terms of reproduction (→[[reproduction (economics)]]), as being healthy and educative. Through fitness sport, people absolve a ritual of reproductive correctness and integration.

A third model is present in ''popular festivity'', ''dance and play''. In carnival and folk sport, people meet people by festive movement. This type of gathering may give life to the top-down arrangements of both productive achievement sport and reproductive fitness sport, too. But the body experience of popular festivity, dance, play and game is a-productive in itself – it celebrates relation in movement.

Practices of sport in their diversity and their historical change, thus, clarify inner contradictions inside social life more generally – among these the contradictions between state, market and civil society. The trialectics of body culture throw light on the complexity of societal relations.

== Body cultures in plural ==

"Culture" in singular is an abstraction. The study of body culture is always a study of body cultures in plural. Body cultures show human life in variety and differences, assimilation and distinction, conflicts and contradictions. This demands a comparative approach to otherness, and this is the way several studies in body culture have gone.

Culture was studied as cultures already by the school of [[Cultural Relativism]] in American anthropology ([[American Anthropological Association]]) in the 1930s ([[Ruth Benedict]]). [[Postcolonial]] studies have taken this [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] perspective up again (Bale 1996 and 2004; Brownell 1995; Azoy 2003; Leseth 2004). The discourse in singular about "the body in our society" became problematic when confronted with body cultures in conflict and tension.

The plurality and diversity of body cultures is, however, not only a matter of outward relations. There are also body cultures in plural inside a given society. The study of different class habitus (→[[class culture]]), [[youth cultures]], gender cultures (→[[gender identity]]) etc. opened up for deeper insights into the differentiation of civil society.

== Configurational analysis ==

Body culture studies try to understand bodily practice as patterns revealing the inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. In order to analyze these connections, the study of body culture has turned attention to the configurations of movement in time and space, the energy of movement, its interpersonal relations and objectification (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]). Above this basis, people build a superstructure of institutions and ideas, organising and reflecting body culture in relation to collective actions and interests (Eichberg 1978; Dietrich 2001: 10-32; see keyword 2).

By elaborating the complex interplay between bodily practice and the superstructures of ideas and conscience, body cultures studies challenge the established history and sociology.

}}
"'''''[[Candidatus]]'' Brocadia anammoxidans"''' is a [[bacterial]] member of the order [[Planctomycetes]] and therefore lacks [[peptidoglycan]] in its [[cell wall]], and has a compartmentalized [[cytoplasm]].

"''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" was the first discovered organism capable of the [[Anammox|anaerobic oxidation of ammonium]], and it is the only organism known to produce [[hydrazine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1109_051109_rocketfuel.html&lt;/ref&gt; This process (dubbed the [[anammox]]-process) was discovered in the 1980s by the [[Gijs Kuenen]] lab in a [[List of waste water treatment technologies|waste water treatment]] plant in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. Ammonium [[oxidation]] is coupled to [[nitrite]] reduction to form the harmless [[dinitrogen]] gas.

The key [[enzyme]] involved in this reaction, [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]], is located in an [[organelle]]-like structure called the [[anammoxosome]]. The ability to oxidize ammonium anaerobically makes "''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" potentially useful for reducing&amp;mdash;or eliminating&amp;mdash;ammonium from waste water.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

== In waste treatment ==
Because of its ability to eliminate ammonium, a variety of uses have been found for this bacteria, particularly removal of [[nitrogen]] from waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kartal, G.J. Kuenen and M.C.M van Loosdrecht Sewage Treatment with Anammox, Science, 2010, vol 328 p 702-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first full scale experiment employing the anammox process in the world was built at the waste water treatment plant Dokhaven/Sluisjesdijk in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Existing treatment plants use bacteria that convert ammonium into [[nitrate]]. The bacteria that do this need oxygen, which must be supplied by electric pumps. [[Denitrifying bacteria]] convert the nitrate into nitrogen gas. These require adding [[methanol]]. This process consumes an average of 44 [[watt-hour]]s per day per person served by the [[sewage]] system.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Researchers estimate that a [[methanogenic]] digester coupled to a [[nitrification]]-anammox bioreactor could generate 24 watt-hours per person per day, a net swing of 70 watt-hours.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

'''Carl Troll''' (24 December 1899 in [[Gabersee]] – 21 July 1975 in [[Bonn]]), was a [[Germany|German]] geographer, brother of botanist [[Wilhelm Troll]]. From 1919 until 1922 Troll studied [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geography]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Munich|Universität in München]]. In 1921 he obtained his doctorate in [[botany]] and in 1925 his [[habilitation]] in geography. Between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the Geography Institute in [[Munich]]. Troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands: between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout [[South America]]n [[Andes|Andean]] countries where he visited [[Chile|northern Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]].  In 1933  and 1934 his research interests took him to East and South Africa; in 1937 Troll was in [[Ethiopia]]; and in 1954 he visited [[Mexico]]. 

In 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in [[Berlin]], and in 1938 professor of geography in Bonn. Troll, who utilised aerial photographs in his research, coined the term [[Landscape ecology]] in 1939. He developed this terminology and many early concepts of [[landscape ecology]] and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of Asia, Africa and South America, as well as his native Europe. He developed [[seasonal climatic charts]] and [[three-dimensional climatic classification]] from hydrological, biological and economical data. 

Carl Troll was president of the [[International Geographical Union]] from 1960 to 1964

==Andean research==
Compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century Troll's Andean work stands out by being free of [[developmentalism|developmentalist]] thought and there is "no evidence of triumphalism of Western science in his Andean work".&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; [[altitudinal zonation|Vertical zonation]] is the most acclaimed part of Trolls work in the Andes building upon the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

===The Inca Empire and the environment===
Carl Troll argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll did also argue that [[llama]]s, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between the Andean [[biome]]s of [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[páramo]], [[pastoralism]] and the Inca state is a matter of research.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed [[environmental determinism]] arguing that culture lied at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The '''coliform index''' is a rating of the purity of [[water]] based on a count of [[feces|fecal]] [[bacteria]]. It is one of many tests done to assure sufficient [[water quality]]. [[Coliform bacteria]] are [[microorganism]]s that primarily originate in the intestines of [[warm-blooded]] animals.  By testing for coliforms, especially the well known ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), which is a thermotolerant coliform, one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with human or animal feces. It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from human and animal feces to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them.   Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water.

The coliform index is used because it is difficult to test for pathogenic bacteria directly.  There are many different types of disease-causing bacteria, and they are usually present in low numbers which do not always show up in tests.  Thermotolerant coliforms are present in higher numbers than individual types of pathogenic bacteria and they can be tested relatively easily.

However, the coliform index is far from perfect.  Thermotolerant coliforms can survive in water on their own, especially in tropical regions, so they do not always indicate fecal contamination.  Furthermore, they do not give a good indication of how many pathogenic bacteria are present in the water, and they give no idea at all of whether there are pathogenic [[virus]]es or [[protozoan|protozoa]] which also cause diseases and are rarely tested for.  Therefore, it does not always give accurate or useful results regarding the purity of water.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">The '''Combs method''' is a method of writing [[fuzzy logic]] rules described by [[William E. Combs]] in 1997. It is designed to prevent [[combinatorial explosion]] in fuzzy logic rules.

The Combs method takes advantage of the [[propositional logic|logical]] equality &lt;math&gt;((p \land q) \Rightarrow r) \iff ((p \Rightarrow r) \lor (q \Rightarrow r))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Equality proof ==
The simplest proof of given equality involves usage of truth tables:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \land q \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow r) \lor (q \Rightarrow r)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| T || T || F || F || F || F || F 
|-
| T || F || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| T || F || F || T || F || T || T 
|-
| F || T || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| F || T || F || T || T || F || T 
|-
| F || F || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| F || F || F || T || T || T || T 
|}

== Combinatorial explosion ==
Suppose we have a fuzzy system that considers N variables at a time, each of which can fit into at least one of S sets. The number of rules necessary to cover all the cases in a traditional fuzzy system is &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the Combs method would need only &lt;math&gt;S \times N&lt;/math&gt; rules. For example, if we have five sets and five variables to consider to produce one output, covering all the cases would require 3125 rules in a traditional system, while the Combs method would require only 25 rules, taming the [[combinatorial explosion]] that occurs when more inputs or more sets are added to the system.

This article will focus on the Combs method itself. To learn more about the way rules are traditionally formed, see [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy associative matrix]].

== Example ==
Suppose we were designing an [[artificial personality]] system that determined how friendly the personality is supposed to be towards a person in a strategic video game. The personality would consider its own fear, trust, and love in the other person. A set of rules in the Combs system might look like this:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid THEN Enemies || Moderate Fear THEN Neutral || Afraid THEN Good Friends
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting THEN Enemies || Moderate Trust THEN Neutral || Trusting THEN Good Friends
|-
! Love
| Unloving THEN Enemies || Moderate Love THEN Neutral || Loving THEN Good Friends
|}

The table translates to:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Fear IS Unafraid THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Fear IS ModerateFear THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Fear IS Afraid THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Trust IS Distrusting THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Trust IS ModerateTrust THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Trust IS Trusting THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Love IS Unloving THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Love IS ModerateLove THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Love IS Loving THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In this case, because the table follows a straightforward pattern in the output, it could be rewritten as:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid || Moderate Fear || Afraid
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting || Moderate Trust || Trusting
|-
! Love
| Unloving || Moderate Love || Loving
|-
! Friendship
| ''Enemies'' || ''Neutral'' || ''Good Friends''
|}

Each column of the table maps to the output provided in the last row. To obtain the output of the system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] by any of the traditional means.

'''Computing with Memory''' refers to computing platforms where function response is stored in memory array, either one or two-dimensional, in the form of [[lookup table]]s (LUTs) and functions are evaluated by retrieving the values from the LUTs. These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two-dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or [[processor-in-memory]] (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The [[Berkeley IRAM project]] is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures.

Computing with memory platforms are typically used to provide the benefit of hardware reconfigurability.  Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, the basic structure of the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;K.Compton and S. Hauck, "Computing: A Survey of systems and software", ''ACM Surveys'', Vol. 34, No. 2, June, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture.&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;S. M. Trimberger, ''Field Programmable Gate Array Technology'', Norwell, MA: Kluwer, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;A. Rahman, S. Das, A. P. Chandrakasan, R. Reif, "Wiring Requirement and Three-Dimensional Integration Technology for Field Programmable Gate Arrays", ''IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems'', Vol. 11, No. 1, February, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra-cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com Xilinx Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 5"&gt;[http://www.altera.com Altera Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs.&lt;ref name="Ref 6"&gt;J. Cong and S. Xu, "Technology Mapping for FPGAs with Embedded Memory Blocks", Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Array, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects.

Contrary to the purely spatial computing model of FPGA, a reconfigurable computing platform that employs a temporal computing model (or a combination of both temporal and spatial) has also been investigated &lt;ref name="Ref 7"&gt;S. Paul and S. Bhunia, "Reconfigurable Computing Using Content Addressable Memory for Improved Performance and Resource Usage", Design Automation Conference, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 8"&gt;S. Paul, S. Chatterjee, S. Mukhopadhyay and S. Bhunia, "Nanoscale Reconfigurable Computing Using Non-Volatile 2-D STTRAM Array", International Conference on Nanotechnology, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of improving performance and energy over conventional FPGA. These platforms, referred as Memory Based Computing (MBC), use dense two-dimensional memory array to store the LUTs. Such frameworks rely on breaking a complex function (''f'') into small sub-functions; representing the sub-functions as multi-input, multi-output LUTs in the memory array; and evaluating the function ''f'' over multiple cycles.  MBC can leverage on the high density, low power and high performance advantages of nanoscale memory.&lt;ref name="Ref 8"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[:Image:Memory Logic Block.png]]  shows the high-level block diagram of MBC. --&gt;
Each computing element incorporates a two-dimensional memory array for storing LUTs, a small controller for sequencing evaluation of sub-functions and a set of temporary registers to hold the intermediate outputs from individual partitions. A fast, local routing framework inside each computing block generates the address for LUT access. Multiple such computing elements can be spatially connected using FPGA-like programmable interconnect architecture to enable mapping of large functions. The local time-multiplexed execution inside the computing elements can drastically reduce the requirement of programmable interconnects leading to large improvement in energy-delay product and better scalability of performance across technology generations.  The memory array inside each computing element can be realized by [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) to drastically reduce the memory requirement for certain applications.&lt;ref name="Ref 7"/&gt;

The '''[[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of feathers''' can be a real challenge for conservators and requires knowledge of specialized care procedures and potential environmental problems like pests.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Contour feather.jpg|thumb|The anatomy of a contour feather]]

=== Basic Overview ===
-Feathers are made of a protein commonly found in the bodies of many animals known as [[keratin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160539034/conservation-biologist-explains-why-feathers-matter|title=Conservation Biologist Explains Why 'Feathers' Matter|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-Feathers take on a protective function

-91% protein, 8% water, and 1% lipids&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdfs/cnsv-feathers.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout|last=|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-The most common types of feathers are contour and down&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/_includes/docs/research/lifeSciences/ornithology/Hudon1.pdf|title=Considerations in the Conservation of Feathers and Hair, Particularly their Pigments|last=Hudon|first=Jocelyn|date=2005|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Although there are many different parts to a feather, all of the parts fall into two subsections of the feather. The two main sections of the feather are the shaft and the vane.

==== Shaft&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Feathers|title=Feathers - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The shaft is composed of the calamus and the rachis. The calamus can also be called the quill and is the hollow portion of the shaft that enters the skin follicle. While the rachis is the solid portion of the shaft  where the barbs attach.

==== Vane&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====
The vane extends to either side of the rachis and is made up of interconnecting barbs. This is considered the most substantial portion of the feather.

== Conservation care ==

=== Cleaning ===
Removing debris and organic matter from feathers is a key step in the conservation process. Here are several of the ways that feathers are typically cleaned by conservators:

==== Vacuuming ====
Using a small vacuum allows conservators to clean off dust and other particulate debris that is not embedded on to the feather. This method cannot be done by conservators when dealing with fragile feathers due to the likelihood of damage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Effective Method for Cleaning Feather Bonnets|url=https://www.icom-cc.org/54/document/ethnographic-conservation-newsletter-31-february-2010/?action=Site_Downloads_Downloadfile&amp;id=769.|last=Fonicello|first=Nancy|website=|publisher=&lt;!--|date=January 2010--&gt;|date = February 2010|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solvents ====
Certain gentle solvents are typically used to "dry clean" feathers. One such solvent, isopropyl alcohol, is usually diluted to make it less caustic to the specimen. Isopropyl alcohol is also a fast drying solution that will not cause the feathers to remain wet for an extended period of time. Gentle soaps and solvents will often also be used on living specimens when approved by a vet or zoologist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Storage ===
The proper storage of feathers and other organic material is essential for the survival of the object. Relative humidity in the storage area is always kept in the 50% range and the ambient temperature is controlled at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|last=Buck|first=Rebecca|publisher=The AAM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0838911228|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative humidity is monitored with a climate control system or managed in a smaller range using silica gel packets that are added to individual storage boxes. Specially made acid free drawers or boxes are an ideal place for items containing feathers. Some of the best materials for storage of organic materials are made from "metal that is sulfur-free and painted using an electrostatic process to prevent off-gassing".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ideally, conservators would put dust covers over the items to prevent dust from building up on the object while in storage.

=== Repairing ===
A living specimen can sometimes lose some of their vital flight feathers and there are ways of repairing them to restore flight to the bird. Feathers from another source are placed in the hollow portion of the quill and securing them with small splints. In the aviary world this process is called imping. A procedure such as this allows a bird to resume flight until the old quill falls out and a new feather takes its place during molting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/gfas/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell.pdf|title=Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell|last=Glendell|first=Greg|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted birds and feathers are repaired with several simple steps. Feathers that are tattered or messy will be moved back into shape with the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.featherfolio.com/how-to-fix-a-tattered-frayed-feather/|title=How to fix a tattered, frayed feather - Featherfolio|website=Featherfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of feathers that are falling out of a mount or broken in two, the pieces are reattached with small amounts of adhesive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy|title=Conserving our taxidermy - Collections - Horniman Museum and Gardens|last=Gardens|first=The Horniman Museum and|website=www.horniman.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme care is always used to not get the adhesive stuck onto the barbs. A wheat starch paste adhesive is utilized in some cases to reattach feathers to skin or to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Special Issues ==
In the case of many of the issues contained in this section can be eliminated or reduced through the proper care instructions listed in the previous section.[[File:Dermestid beetle.png|thumb|121x121px|Dermestid Beetle also known as the Carpet Beetle]]

=== Pests&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
Due to the fact that feathers are mainly made of protein, they lend themselves a whole host of insect problems. Insects that like to eat protein based material will often feed on the feather causing serious damage.

==== Pests While Alive ====
While the birds are alive they are susceptible to several different pests including [[Louse|lice]] and [[mite]]s. Special sprays and soaps can kill these pests allowing the birds to regain feather growth and become healthy.

==== Pests In Collections ====
Once the feathers make it into a non-living collection atmosphere it is possible for them to fall victim to insects including the [[Dermestidae|carpet beetle]] and [[Clothes moth|clothing moths]].

=== Dust&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
When feathers are stored in a way that allows dust to accumulate on the object the relative humidity around the feather could rise. This rise in humidity and the addition of moisture accelerates the deterioration of the feather.

== Resources ==
There are many different sources both online and in person that can be museum workers use to learn more about feather conservation. The AIC Wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page|title=AIC WIKI Main Page|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a jumping point into a whole host of conservation topics, including the care of feathers. Many museums and conservation organizations are also providing classes in the conservation of feathers.

'''''De duodecim abusivis saeculi''''' ("On the Twelve Abuses of the World") is a treatise on social and political morality written by an anonymous [[Ireland|Irish]] author between 630 and 700. During the Middle Ages the work was very popular throughout Europe.

==Background==
The work was first propagated throughout Europe by Irish missionaries in the 8th century. Its authorship was attributed at different times to [[Saint Patrick]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], but mainly [[Cyprian of Carthage|Saint Cyprian of Carthage]] – men of such authority that it explains its acceptance and popularity. It was not until 1909 that [[Siegmund Hellmann]] revealed its Pseudo-Cyprian origins to an anonymous Irish author of the 7th century.

==Duodecim abusivis saeculi==
''De duodecim'' condemns the following twelve abuses:
{| class="wikitable"
!''Abusivis''
!Abuse
|-
|''sapiens sine operibus''
|the wise man without works
|-
|''senex sine religione''
|the old man without religion
|-
|''adolescens sine oboedientia''
|the young man without obedience
|-
|''dives sine elemosyna''
|the rich man without charity
|-
|''femina sine pudicitia''
|the woman without modesty
|-
|''dominus sine virtute''
|the nobleman without virtue
|-
|''Christianius contentiosus''
|the argumentative Christian
|-
|''pauper superbus''
|the proud pauper
|-
|''rex iniquus''
|the unjust king
|-
|''episcopus neglegens''
|the neglectful bishop
|-
|''plebs sine disciplina''
|the community without order
|-
|''populus sine lege''
|the people without a law
|}

==Influence==
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}
Hellmann points out the extensive influence of the work upon Carolingian writings, such as the [[mirrors for princes]], and later political literature.

There is some direct evidence for the text's popularity in tenth-century England. Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] is known to have donated a copy to the [[Peterborough]] house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1448 Sawyer no. 1448]. See Michael Lapidge, "Surviving booklists in Anglo-Saxon England." ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts. Basic Readings'', ed. Mary P. Richards. London, 1994. 87–167: 117–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] drew on a version included in [[Abbo of Fleury]]'s ''Collectio canonum'' for his Old English treatise ''De octo vitiis et de duodecim abusivis gradus'', in which the section on the ''rex iniquus'' was translated whole.

{{Featured article}}
[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|400px|Photograph of the [[crescent]] of the planet Neptune (top) and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (center), taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]'' during its 1989 flyby]]
The '''definition of ''planet''''', since the word was coined by the [[ancient Greeks]], has included within its scope a wide range of celestial bodies. [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] employed the term ''asteres planetai'' (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), "wandering stars", for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky. Over the millennia, the term has included a variety of different objects, from the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] to [[natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s.

By the end of the 19th century the word ''[[planet]]'', though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the [[Solar System]]. After 1992, however, astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], as well as hundreds of [[extrasolar planet|objects orbiting other stars]]. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be [[star]]s, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a ''planet'' could be.

The issue of a clear definition for ''planet'' came to a head in January 2005 with the discovery of the [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet, [[Pluto]]. In its August 2006 response, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of [[nomenclature]], released [[2006 definition of planet|its decision]] on the matter during a meeting in [[Prague]]. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System, states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is [[mass]]ive enough for its [[hydrostatic equilibrium|own gravity to make it round]], and has "[[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbourhood]]" of smaller objects around its orbit. Under this new definition, Pluto and the other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, and while many scientists have accepted the definition, some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright.

=== Planets in antiquity ===
[[File:Platon-2.jpg|thumb|upright|The philosopher [[Plato]]]]
While knowledge of the planets predates history and is common to most civilizations, the word ''planet'' dates back to [[ancient Greece]]. Most Greeks believed the Earth to be stationary and at the center of the universe in accordance with the [[geocentric model]] and that the objects in the sky, and indeed the sky itself, revolved around it (an exception was [[Aristarchus of Samos]], who put forward an early version of [[heliocentrism]]). Greek astronomers employed the term ''asteres planetai'' (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), "wandering stars",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/planet|title=Definition of planet|publisher=Merriam-Webster OnLine|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsources.info/words-mod-planets.html|title=Words For Our Modern Age: Especially words derived from Latin and Greek sources|publisher=Wordsources.info|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year, in contrast to the ''asteres aplaneis'' (ἀστέρες ἀπλανεῖς), the "[[fixed stars]]", which stayed motionless relative to one another. The five bodies currently called "planets" that were known to the Greeks were those visible to the naked eye: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]].

Graeco-Roman [[Timeline of cosmology|cosmology]] commonly considered seven planets, with the Sun and the Moon counted among them (as is the case in modern [[Planets in astrology|astrology]]); however, there is some ambiguity on that point, as many ancient astronomers distinguished the five star-like planets from the Sun and Moon. As the 19th-century German naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] noted in his work ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the seven cosmical bodies which, by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart, have ever since the remotest antiquity been distinguished from the "unwandering orbs" of the heaven of the "fixed stars", which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged, five only—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—wear the appearance of stars—"''cinque stellas errantes''"—while the Sun and Moon, from the size of their disks, their importance to man, and the place assigned to them in mythological systems, were classed apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe |author=Alexander von Humboldt |year=1849 |work=digitised 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3CEJAAAAIAAJ |page=297 |accessdate=2007-07-23 |publisher=H.G.

In his ''[[Almagest]]'' written in the 2nd century, [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] refers to "the Sun, Moon and five planets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Almagest by Ptolemy|author=R. Gatesby Taliaterro (trans.)|publisher= University of Chicago Press|year= 1952|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] explicitly mentions "the five stars which many have called wandering, and which the Greeks call Planeta."&lt;ref name=planeta&gt;{{cite web|title=Astra Planeta|author=theoi.com|url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Manilius]], a Latin writer who lived during the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] and whose poem ''Astronomica'' is considered one of the principal texts for modern [[astrology]], says, "Now the [[dodecatemory]] is divided into five parts, for so many are the stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=GP Goold (trans.)|title=Marcus Manilius: Astronomica|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1977|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single view of the seven planets is found in [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', written sometime around 53 BC, where the spirit of [[Scipio Africanus]] proclaims, "Seven of these spheres contain the planets, one planet in each sphere, which all move contrary to the movement of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dream of Scipio|author=Cicero|work=Roman Philosophy |others=Richard Hooker (translator)|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/SCIPIO.HTM|year=1996|accessdate=2007-06-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703203835/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/SCIPIO.HTM |archivedate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', written in 77 AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to "the seven stars, which owing to their motion we call planets, though no stars wander less than they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History vol 1|author=IH Rackham|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd.|year=1938|page= 177, viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonnus]], the 5th century Greek poet, says in his ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', "I have oracles of history on seven tablets, and the tablets bear the names of the seven planets."&lt;ref name=planeta /&gt;

=== Planets in the Middle Ages ===
[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|upright|John Gower]]
Medieval and Renaissance writers generally accepted the idea of seven planets. The standard medieval introduction to astronomy, [[Sacrobosco|Sacrobosco's]] ''[[De sphaera mundi|De Sphaera]]'', includes the Sun and Moon among the planets,&lt;ref&gt;Sacrobosco, "On the Sphere", in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 450.  "every planet except the sun has an epicycle."&lt;/ref&gt; the more advanced ''Theorica planetarum'' presents the "theory of the seven planets,"&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "The Theory of the Planets," in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  while the instructions to the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' show how "to find by means of tables the mean ''motuses'' of the sun, moon, and the rest of the planets."&lt;ref&gt;[[John of Saxony (astronomer)|John of Saxony]], "Extracts from the Alfonsine Tables and Rules for their use", in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', 14th-century poet [[John Gower]], referring to the planets' connection with the craft of [[Classical planets in Western alchemy|alchemy]], writes, "Of the planetes ben begonne/The gold is tilted to the Sonne/The Mone of Selver hath his part...", indicating that the Sun and the Moon were planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Heather|title=The Seven Planets|journal=Folklore|year=1943|pages=338–361|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1943.9717687|volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who rejected the geocentric model, was ambivalent concerning whether the Sun and Moon were planets. In his ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'', Copernicus clearly separates "the sun, moon, planets and stars";&lt;ref name=koper&gt;{{cite web|title=The text of Nicholas Copernicus' De Revolutionibus (On the Revolutions), 1543 C.E.|author=Edward Rosen (trans.)|work=Calendars Through the Ages|url=http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in his Dedication of the work to Pope Paul III, Copernicus refers to, "the motion of the sun and the moon... and of the five other planets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies to Pope Paul III|author=Nicolaus Copernicus|work=The Harvard Classics.  1909–14|url=http://www.bartleby.com/39/12.html|accessdate=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth ===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|Copernicus]]
Eventually, when Copernicus's [[heliocentric model]] was accepted over the [[geocentric]], [[Earth]] was placed among the planets and the Sun and Moon were reclassified, necessitating a conceptual revolution in the understanding of planets. As the [[historian of science]] [[Thomas Kuhn]] noted in his book, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, (1962) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 1st. ed., (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 115, 128–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Copernicans who denied its traditional title 'planet' to the sun ... were changing the meaning of 'planet' so that it would continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies ... were seen differently from the way they had been seen before... Looking at the moon, the convert to Copernicanism ... says, 'I once took the moon to be (or saw the moon as) a planet, but I was mistaken.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Copernicus obliquely refers to Earth as a planet in ''De Revolutionibus'' when he says, "Having thus assumed the motions which I ascribe to the Earth later on in the volume, by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth..."&lt;ref name=koper/&gt; [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] also asserts that Earth is a planet in the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'': "[T]he Earth, no less than the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly."&lt;ref name=gal&gt;{{cite web|title=Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|work=Calendars Through the Ages|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html|accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern planets ===
[[File:William Herschel01.jpg|thumb|upright|William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus]]
In 1781, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] was searching the sky for elusive [[stellar parallax]]es, when he observed what he termed a [[comet]] in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased in proportion to the power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt; However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his "comet", his colleague, British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]], wrote to him, saying, "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] or tail to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Herschel: Astronomer and Musician of 19 New King Street, Bath|author=Patrick Moore|publisher=PME Erwood|year=1981|page=8|isbn=0-907322-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "comet" was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named [[Uranus]] after the father of Saturn.

Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846, and presumed irregularities in Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find [[Pluto]] in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all.&lt;ref name=ken&gt;

=== Satellites ===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|Galileo Galilei]]
When Copernicus placed Earth among the planets, he also placed the Moon in orbit around Earth, making the Moon the first [[natural satellite]] to be identified. When [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] discovered his four [[Galilean moons|satellites]] of Jupiter in 1610, they lent weight to Copernicus's argument, because if other planets could have satellites, then Earth could too. However, there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were "planets"; Galileo referred to them as "four planets flying around the star of Jupiter at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siderius Nuncius|author=Galileo Galilei|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1989|page=26|others=Albert van Helden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Christiaan Huygens]], upon discovering Saturn's largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 1655, employed many terms to describe it, including "planeta" (planet), "stella" (star), "luna" (moon), and the more modern "satellite" (attendant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema Saturnium: Sive de Causis Miradorum Saturni Phaenomenon, et comite ejus Planeta Novo|author= Christiani Hugenii (Christiaan Huygens)|publisher=Adriani Vlacq|year= 1659|pages= 1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Cassini]], in announcing his discovery of Saturn's moons [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] in 1671 and 1672, described them as ''Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne'' ("New planets around Saturn").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Decouverte de deux Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne|author=Giovanni Cassini|publisher=Sabastien Mabre-Craniusy|year= 1673| pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the "Journal de Scavans" reported Cassini's discovery of two new Saturnian moons in 1686, it referred to them strictly as "satellites", though sometimes Saturn as the "primary planet".&lt;ref name="Cassini1686–1692"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1098/rstl.1686.0013| last = Cassini | first = G.

=== Minor planets ===
[[File:Giuseppe Piazzi.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Piazzi, discoverer of Ceres]]
One of the unexpected results of [[William Herschel|William Herschel's]] discovery of Uranus was that it appeared to validate [[Bode's law]], a mathematical function which generates the size of the [[semimajor axis]] of planetary [[orbit]]s. Astronomers had considered the "law" a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] found a miniature new world, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.&lt;ref name=Hilton&gt;{{cite web | author=Hilton, James L. | title=When did asteroids become minor planets? | work=U.S. Naval Observatory | url=http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/weaver_projects/GPD/Contributed_Talks/hilton_gpd_poster.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1802, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] discovered [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], a second "planet" at roughly the same distance from the Sun as Ceres. That two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking; even [[Shakespeare]] had ridiculed the idea ("Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King Henry the Fourth Part One in The Globe Illustrated Shakespeare: The Complete Works Annotated|author=William Shakespeare|publisher=Granercy Books|year= 1979|page= 559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, in 1804, another world, [[3 Juno|Juno]], was discovered in a similar orbit.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; In 1807, Olbers discovered a fourth object, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], at a similar orbital distance.

Herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification, [[asteroid]]s (meaning "starlike" since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled [[star]]s), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; This conception was entrenched by the fact that, due to the difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet-uncharted stars, those four remained the only asteroids known until 1845.&lt;ref name=18planets&gt;{{cite web

Ceres became "(1) Ceres", Pallas became "(2) Pallas", and so on. By the 1860s, the number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred, and observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them collectively as "[[minor planet]]s", or "small planets", though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; To this day, "minor planet" remains the official designation for all small bodies in orbit around the Sun, and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in the IAU's [[Minor Planet Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MPC Orbit (MPCORB) Database|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/MPCORB.html|accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluto ===
{{main article|Planets beyond Neptune}}
[[File:Clyde Tombaugh image.jpg|thumb|upright|Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto]]

The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is mirrored in the story of [[Pluto]], which was named a planet soon after its discovery by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto, a tiny and icy world in a region of [[gas giant]]s with an orbit that carried it high above the [[ecliptic]] and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto's largest moon, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which allowed them to determine its mass. Pluto was found to be much tinier than anyone had expected: only one sixth the mass of Earth's Moon.  However, as far as anyone could yet tell, it was unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar to Pluto in composition, size, and orbital characteristics. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised [[Kuiper belt]] (sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt), a band of icy debris that is the source for "short-period" comets—those with orbital periods of up to 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weissman, Paul R. | title=The Kuiper Belt|  bibcode=1995ARA&amp;A..33..327W|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.33.090195.001551 | year=1995 | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=33 | pages=327–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto's orbit lay within this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question.  Many scientists concluded that tiny Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet, just as Ceres had been a century earlier. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] suggested that a "planet" should be redefined as "any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Brown, Mike. | title=A World on the Edge | work=[[NASA]] Solar System Exploration | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | accessdate=2006-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427091759/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | archivedate=2006-04-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets. In 1999, [[Brian G. Marsden]] of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] suggested that Pluto be given the [[minor planet number]] 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet.&lt;ref name=comet&gt;{{cite web

The discovery of several other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s approaching the size of Pluto, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population.

In the immediate aftermath of the object's discovery, there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a "[[tenth planet]]". NASA even put out a press release describing it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA-Funded Scientists Discover Tenth Planet|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/newplanet-072905.html| year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acceptance of Eris as the tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set Pluto as an arbitrary minimum size. Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognise Pluto's historical identity as a planet by "[[grandfathering]]" it into the planet list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topic&amp;nbsp;— First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt; "From Darkness to Light: The Exploration of the Planet Pluto"|author= Bonnie Buratti|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/lectures/nov05.cfm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IAU definition ==
{{main article|IAU definition of planet}}The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] forced the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using [[approval voting]]. The definitions were:[[File:Michael E Brown 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael E Brown, discoverer of Eris]]
* A planet is any object in [[orbit]] around the Sun with a diameter greater than 2000&amp;nbsp;km. (eleven votes in favour)
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. (eight votes in favour)

Since no consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in [[Prague]] in August 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |title=Planet Definition |work=IAU |url=http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826193101/http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-26 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from two of the three proposals.

The IAU further resolves:

[[Pluto]] is a "dwarf planet" by the above definition and is recognised as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.}}
{{TNO imagemap}}

The IAU also resolved that "''planets'' and ''dwarf planets'' are two distinct classes of objects", meaning that dwarf planets, despite their name, would not be considered planets.&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt;

On September 13, 2006, the IAU placed Eris, its moon Dysnomia, and Pluto into their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]], giving them the official minor planet designations [[Pluto|(134340) Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|(136199) Eris]], and [[Dysnomia (moon)|(136199) Eris I Dysnomia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circular No. 8747 |author=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, International Astronomical Union |url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/08700/08747.html |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-07-03 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205035336/http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/special/08747.pdf web.archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[possible dwarf planets]], such as [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|2003 EL&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|2005 FY&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] and [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], were left in temporary limbo until a formal decision could be reached regarding their status.

On June 11, 2008, the IAU executive committee announced the establishment of a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned "new category of trans-Neptunian objects" to which Pluto is a prototype. This new class of objects, termed [[plutoid]]s, would include Pluto, Eris and any other future trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU also determined that, for naming purposes, only those TNOs with an [[absolute magnitude]] brighter than H = +1 would be allowed into the category.

Among the most vocal proponents of the IAU's decided definition are [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the discoverer of Eris; [[Steven Soter]], professor of astrophysics at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]; and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]].

In the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], when the Hayden Planetarium was undergoing a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused to refer to Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;Space.com (2001). [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/tyson_responds_010202.html Astronomer Responds to Pluto-Not-a-Planet Claim]&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Tyson [[The Pluto Files|wrote a book]] detailing the demotion of Pluto.

In an article in the January 2007 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Soter cited the definition's incorporation of current theories of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]]; that as the earliest [[protoplanet]]s emerged from the swirling dust of the [[protoplanetary disc]], some bodies "won" the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before the end of the initial formation period, both failed to win the accretion competition.

When the numbers for the winning objects are compared to those of the losers, the contrast is striking; if Soter's concept that each planet occupies an "orbital zone"{{Ref label|B|b|none}} is accepted, then the least orbitally dominant planet, Mars, is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100. Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, only accounts for one third of the material in its orbit; Pluto's ratio is even lower, at around 7 percent.&lt;ref name=Soter&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is a Planet?|author= Steven Soter|work=Department of Astrophysics, American Museum of Natural History|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0608359.pdf|format=PDF|date=2006-08-16|accessdate=2015-07-15|arxiv= astro-ph/0608359|bibcode = 2006AJ....132.2513S |doi = 10.1086/508861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves "absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eight Planets|author=Michael E. Brown|work=Caltech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/eightplanets/|year=2006| accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing controversies ==
Despite the IAU's declaration, a number of critics remain unconvinced. The definition is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of [[Pluto]]-as-planet proponents, in particular [[Alan Stern]], head of [[NASA|NASA's]] [[New Horizons]] mission to [[Pluto]], have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.&lt;ref name=britt&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto demoted in highly controversial definition| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto: Down But Maybe Not Out| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060831_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.

=== Clearing the neighbourhood ===
{{main article|Clearing the neighbourhood}}
One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of "cleared the neighbourhood around its [[orbit]]". [[Alan Stern]] objects that "it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Rincon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5283956.stm| title=Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt|work=BBC News|accessdate=2007-02-28 | date=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition.{{Ref label|C|c|none}}
[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|The asteroids of the inner Solar System; note the [[Trojan asteroid]]s (green), trapped into Jupiter's orbit by its gravity]]
Mike Brown counters these claims by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the [[Trojan asteroid]]s), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called [[plutino]]s, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

In October 2015, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of the [[University of California Los Angeles]] proposed a metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone of extent 2{{radic|3}} of its [[Hill radius]] in a specific time scale. This metric places a clear dividing line between the dwarf planets and the planets of the solar system.&lt;ref name=Margot&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=A Quantitative Criterion For Defining Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|pages=185|author=Jean-Luc Margot |arxiv=1507.06300|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation is based on the mass of the host star, the mass of the body, and the orbital period of the body. An Earth-mass body orbiting a solar-mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 [[astronomical unit]]s from the star.  A Mars-mass body at the orbit of Pluto clears its orbit. This metric, which leaves Pluto as a dwarf planet, applies to both the Solar System and to extrasolar systems.&lt;ref name=Margot/&gt;

Some opponents of the definition have claimed that "clearing the neighbourhood" is an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and organiser of the petition, expressed this opinion to [[National Public Radio]]. He believes that the definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location.  He believes that a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would not be considered a planet, because he believes that it would not have time to clear its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5788798| format=RealPlayer| title= Astronomers Prepare to Fight Pluto Demotion| first=Sykes| last=Mark| date=2006-09-08| accessdate=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown notes, however, that were the "clearing the neighbourhood" criterion to be abandoned, the number of planets in the Solar System could rise from eight to [[List of possible dwarf planets|more than 50]], with hundreds more potentially to be discovered.&lt;ref name=browndwarf/&gt;

[[File:Proteus (Voyager 2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], a moon of [[Neptune]], is irregular, despite being larger than the spheroidal [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].]]

=== Hydrostatic equilibrium ===
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own [[gravity]] to form them into a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; this means that they will reach a round, [[ellipsoid]]al shape. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point gravity begins to pull an object towards its own [[centre of mass]] until the object collapses into an ellipsoid. (None of the large objects of the Solar System are truly spherical.  Many are [[spheroid]]s, and several, such as the larger moons of Jupiter and Saturn and the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}}, have been further distorted into ellipsoids by rapid rotation or [[tidal force]]s, but still in hydrostatic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Brown, Michael E.| title=2003EL61| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/2003EL61| accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, "how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice."&lt;ref name=Soter /&gt; Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices,{{Ref label|D|d|none}} such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas.&lt;ref name=browndwarf&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|author=Mike Brown|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat energy, from [[gravitational collapse]], [[impact event|impacts]], tidal forces, or [[radioactive decay]], also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is.&lt;ref name="Thomas2010"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2010.01.025| last1 = Thomas| first1 = P.

=== Double planets and moons ===
{{main article|Double planet}}
[[File:Pluto and Charon from Hubble.jpg|thumb|A [[telescope|telescopic]] image of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]]]

The definition specifically excludes [[natural satellite|satellites]] from the category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term "satellite".&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt; In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for [[Pluto]] and its largest satellite, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which possess a [[barycenter]] outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto–Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, even though they are similar in relative size, only Pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet.&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt;

[[File:Moon trajectory1.png|thumb|A diagram illustrating the [[Moon]]'s co-orbit with the [[Earth]]]]

However, some have suggested that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, [[Isaac Asimov]] noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the [[ecliptic]], the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1975). ''Just Mooning Around'', In: Of time and space, and other things. Avon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. There are 19 moons in the Solar System that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and would be considered planets if only the physical parameters are considered.  Both Jupiter's moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are larger than Mercury, and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth's. Moons such as [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a [[magnetic field]]. Just as [[star]]s in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets.&lt;ref name=Buie2005&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is hard to make a consistent argument that a 400&amp;nbsp;km iceball should count as a planet because it might have interesting geology, while a 5000&amp;nbsp;km satellite with a massive atmosphere, methane lakes, and dramatic storms [Titan] shouldn't be put into the same category, whatever you call it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he goes on to say that, "For most people, considering round satellites (including our Moon) "planets" violates the idea of what a planet is."&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

[[Alan Stern]] has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term ''satellite planet'' for a planet-sized satellite.&lt;ref name="satelliteplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Stern, K. D. Runyon  et al. proposed a new geophysical definition of planet that defined a planet simply as an object large enough to be spherical under its own gravity but not large enough to fuse. This definition would add 19 moons to the list of planets in our Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Geophysical Planet Definition|author=K.D. Runyon, S.A. Stern, T.R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The material difference between a low-mass star and a large [[gas giant]] is not clearcut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and [[helium]], with trace levels of heavier [[chemical element|elements]] in their [[atmosphere]]s. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the "top down," out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the "bottom up," from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of [[silicate]]s or ices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2004| author=G. Wuchterl| title=Giant planet formation| work=Institut für Astronomie der Universität Wien| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6357423q7324013/| accessdate=2006-10-04| doi=10.1007/BF00613290|bibcode = 1994EM&amp;P...67...51W }}&lt;/ref&gt; As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores, though the [[Juno mission|''Juno'' mission]] to Jupiter could resolve the issue. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet.

[[File:Brown Dwarf Gliese 229B.jpg|thumb|left|The brown dwarf [[Gliese 229B]] in orbit around its star]]
Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object's ability to [[Nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[hydrogen]] in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse [[deuterium]]. However, due to the relative rarity of that [[isotope]], this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star's lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Basri | first=Gibor | title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=2000 | volume=38 | pages=485–519 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 | bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..485B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binary star]]s and other multiple-star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer [[Adam Burrows (astronomer)|Adam Burrows]] of the [[University of Arizona]] claims that "from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burrows, Adam |author2=Hubbard, W.B. |author3=Lunine, J. |author4=Leibert, James | year=2001 | title=The Theory of Brown Dwarfs and Extrasolar Giant Planets | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.73.719 | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=73 | issue=3 | pages=719–765 | arxiv=astro-ph/0103383|bibcode = 2001RvMP...73..719B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrows also claims that such stellar remnants as [[white dwarfs]] should not be considered stars,&lt;ref&gt;Croswell p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; a stance which would mean that an orbiting [[white dwarf]], such as [[Sirius B]], could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to sustain atomic fusion during its lifetime should be considered a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Croswell, Ken | year=1999 | title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems| publisher= Oxford University Press|page=119|isbn=0-19-288083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confusion  does not end with brown dwarfs. Maria Rosa Zapatario-Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young [[star cluster]]s of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2000|author1=Zapatero M.

[[File:hubbledwarf.jpg|left|thumb|upright|CHXR 73 b, an object which lies at the border between planet and brown dwarf]]
This definition makes location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a "sub-brown dwarf," whereas such an object in orbit around a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical. Further, in 2010, a paper published by Burrows, David S. Spiegel and John A. Milsom called into question the 13-Jupiter-mass criterion, showing that a brown dwarf of three times solar [[metallicity]] could fuse deuterium at as low as 11 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1008.5150 |author1=David S.

====Planetary-mass stellar objects====
The ambiguity inherent in the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] observed [[Cha 110913-773444]] (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own [[planetary system]]. Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| author= Clavin, Whitney| title=A Planet With Planets?

In September 2006, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] imaged [[CHXR 73 b]] (left), an object orbiting a young companion star at a distance of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's [[protoplanetary disc]], and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet or failed star?

In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the [[Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics]] of [[Grenoble]] in France announced the discovery of [[CFBDSIR 2149-0403]]; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the [[AB Doradus moving group]], less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a [[T dwarf|spectral class T brown dwarf]], Delorme speculates that it may be a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CFBDSIR2149-0403: a 4-7 Jupiter-mass free-ﬂoating planet in the young moving group AB Doradus?|author1=P.

In October 2013, astronomers led by Dr. Michael Liu of the [[University of Hawaii]] discovered [[PSO J318.5-22]], a solitary free-floating [[L dwarf]] estimated to possess only 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter, making it the least massive [[sub-brown dwarf]] yet discovered.&lt;ref name="liu_discovery"&gt;

=== Semantics ===
Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as ''not'' so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and '[[minor planet]]' are best considered [[compound noun]]s. [[Benjamin Zimmer]] of [[Language Log]] summarised the confusion: "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as '[[Welsh rabbit]]' (not really a rabbit) and '[[Rocky Mountain oysters]]' (not really oysters)."&lt;ref name=langlog&gt;{{cite web | last = Zimmer | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Zimmer |title=New planetary definition a "linguistic catastrophe"!| work=[[Language Log]]| url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003504.html| accessdate=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Dava Sobel]], the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with [[National Public Radio]], "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Travel Guide to the Solar System |year=2006 |work=National Public Radio |url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Oct/hour2_102706.html |accessdate=2006-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107104814/http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Oct/hour2_102706.html |archivedate=2006-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Brown noted in an interview with the Smithsonian that, "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word "dwarf planet," but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets."&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|title=Pluto's Planethood: What Now? |work=Air and Space |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2006/august-september/FEATURE-PlutoDebate.php?page=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101211205/http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2006/august-september/FEATURE-PlutoDebate.php?page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-01 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, astronomer Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, "The name 'minor planet' [has] been more or less synonymous with 'asteroid' for a very long time. So it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'."&lt;ref name=langlog /&gt;

In [[solid state physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], the '''density of states''' ('''DOS''') of a system describes the number of states per an interval of energy at each energy level available to be occupied. It is mathematically represented by a [[Probability density function|density distribution]] and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. A high 'DOS' at a specific energy level means that there are many states available for occupation. A DOS of zero means that no states can be occupied at that energy level. The DOS is usually represented by one of the symbols ''g, ρ, D, n, or N''.  

Generally, the density of the states of matter is continuous. In [[isolated system]]s however, like atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the [[Probability density function|density distribution]] is [[Discrete distribution|discrete]] like a [[spectral density]]. 

Local
variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called '''[[local density of states]]''' ('''LDOS'''). If the DOS of an undisturbed
system is zero, the LDOS can locally be non-zero due to the presence of a local potential.

==Introduction==

In quantum mechanical (QM) systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels . 

For example, the density of states of electrons at the bandedge between the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and the [[Valence and conduction bands|valence band]] in a semiconductor is shown in orange in Fig. 4 (in the subsequent section "Density of states and distribution functions"). For an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy causes more states to become available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that there are no states available for electrons to occupy within the bandgap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the bandgap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.

Depending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s, or [[phonon]]s, and can be given as a function of either energy or the [[wave vector]] ''k''. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between ''E'' and ''k'' must be known. 

In general, the topological properties of the system have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like [[neutronium]] in [[Neutron star|neutron stars]] and [[Free electron model|free electron gases in metals]] (examples of [[degenerate matter]] and a [[Fermi gas]]), have a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean topology]]. Less familiar systems, like [[Two-dimensional electron gas|two-dimensional electron gases]] (2DEG) in [[graphite]] layers and the [[quantum Hall effect]] system in [[MOSFET]] type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are [[carbon nanotubes]], the [[quantum wire]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] proceed.

==Definition==
In general the density of states, related to volume ''V'' and ''N'' countable energy levels, is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \cdot \sum _{i=1}^N \delta \left(E - E\left({\vec{k}}_i\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt; 

Using &lt;math&gt; (\Delta k)^d = \left(\frac{2\pi}{L}\right)^d &lt;/math&gt; (the smallest allowed change of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for a particle in a box of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) under the limit &lt;math&gt;L \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, one derives the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\pi)^d}} \cdot \delta \left(E - E\left(\vec{k}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of the spatial dimension of the considered system and &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; the wave vector.

Equivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function &lt;math&gt; Z_m (E)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the energy:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac {1}{V} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\mathrm{d} E}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of states with energy &lt;math&gt; E' &lt;/math&gt; (degree of degeneracy) is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; g\left(E'\right) = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} \int _{E'}^{E' + \Delta E} D(E) \mathrm{d} E = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} D\left(E'\right) \Delta E,&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.

==Symmetry==
[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|260px|First Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]
There is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.

Some condensed matter systems possess a [[symmetry]] of its [[Crystal structure|structure]] on its microscopic scale which simplifies calculations of its density of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of function are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. [[Fluid]]s, [[glass]]es or [[amorphous solid]]s are example of a symmetric system whose [[dispersion relations]] has a rotational symmetry. 

[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|150px|left|Octahedron.]]
Measurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole [[Domain of a function|domain]], most often a [[Brillouin zone]], of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or [[fundamental domain]].&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;
{{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 
|publisher=Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-486-66021-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Brillouin zone of the of a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] ''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' with full [[Octahedral symmetry#Achiral octahedral symmetry|octahedral symmetry]]. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystal structure periodic table]] shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like [[diamond]], [[silicon]] and [[platinum]] and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold [[Tetrahedral symmetry#Pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral symmetry]] of the point group ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''. The HCP structure has the 12-fold [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions#Examples|prismatic dihedral]] symmetry of the point group ''D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;''. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in [[List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups#Character tables|point group character tables]].

In general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.

In [[anisotropic]] condensed matter systems such as a [[single crystal]] of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.

==''k''-space topologies==

[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1: Spherical surface in ''k''-space for electrons in three dimensions.]]

The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Volume&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Area&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Length&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is important to note that the volume being referenced is the volume of ''k''-space; the space enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] of the system derived through a [[dispersion relation]] that relates ''E'' to ''k''. An example of a 3-dimensional ''k''-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system itself will confine the momentum of particles inside the system.

===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===
The calculation for DOS starts by counting the ''N'' allowed states at a certain ''k'' that are contained within {{nowrap|[''k'',  ''k + dk'']}} inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n, k}&lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensions at an arbitrary ''k'', with respect to ''k''. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical ''k''-spaces are expressed by
: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

for a n-dimensional ''k''-space with the topologically determined constants
: &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 2,\  c_2 = \pi,\  c_3 = \frac{4 \pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

for linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean ''k''-spaces respectively.

According to this scheme, the density of wave vector states ''N'' is, through differentiating &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''k'', expressed by
:&lt;math&gt;N_n(k) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(k)}{{\rm d}k} = n\; c_n\; k^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  N_1(k) &amp;= 2 \\
  N_2(k) &amp;= 2 \pi k \\
  N_3(k) &amp;= 4 \pi k^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength λ. The wavelength is related to ''k'' through the relationship.
: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In a quantum system the length of λ will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states ''N'' is multiplied by a factor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', where ''s'' is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then &lt;math&gt;s = 1&lt;/math&gt;. ''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.

===Density of energy states===
To finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; inside an interval &lt;math&gt;[E, E+dE]&lt;/math&gt;. The general form of DOS of a system is given as
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(E)}{{\rm d}E}&lt;/math&gt;
The scheme sketched so far ''only'' applies to ''monotonically rising'' and ''spherically symmetric'' dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express ''D'' as a function of ''E'' the [[Inverse function|inverse of the dispersion relation]] &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; has to be substituted into the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of ''k'' to get the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britneyspears.ac/physics/dos/dos.htm Sample density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_4.htm Another density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersion relations==

The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the [[electronic band structure]].
 
The [[kinetic energy]] of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the [[wave vector]] ''k'', the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] in a [[Fermi gas]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + \frac{\left(\hbar k\right)^2}{2m} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]]. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily. 

[[File:Monoatomic chain phonon dispersion.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation]]
For longitudinal [[phonon]]s in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional ''k''-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E =  2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\sin\left(\frac{ka}{2}\right)\right| &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{k_{\rm F} / m}&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator frequency, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the atoms, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; the inter-atomic force constant and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; inter-atomic spacing. For small values of &lt;math&gt;k \ll \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the dispersion relation is rather linear:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \hbar \omega_0 ka &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;k \approx \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the energy is
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\cos\left(\frac{\pi - ka}{2}\right)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

With the transformation &lt;math&gt;q = k - \pi/a &lt;/math&gt; and small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; this relation can be transformed to 
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left[1 - \left(\frac{qa}{2}\right)^2\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Isotropic dispersion relations===
The two examples mentioned here can be expressed like
:&lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + c_k k^p&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is a kind of [[dispersion relation]] because it interrelates two wave properties and it is [[isotropy|isotropic]] because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\right)^\frac{1}{p} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, the volume of n-dimensional ''k''-space containing wave vectors smaller than ''k'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E) = \frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\frac{n}{p}}\left(E - E_0\right)^\frac{n}{p}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac {d}{dE}\Omega_n(E) = \frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\frac{n}{p}} \left(E - E_0\right)^{\frac{n}{p} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Parabolic dispersion===
[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]
In the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (''p'' = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, &lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right)&lt;/math&gt;, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_k \left(E - E_0\right)}} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{c_k} \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \ .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;E &gt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;D(E) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E &lt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; drops to &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |author=Charles Kittel |page=Equation (37), p. 216 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the prefactor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', the expression for the 3D DOS is
:&lt;math&gt;N(E) = \frac {V}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{E - E_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the total volume, and &lt;math&gt;N(E-E_0)&lt;/math&gt; includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.

===Linear dispersion===
In the case of a linear relation (''p'' = 1), such as applies to [[photon]]s, [[acoustic phonon]]s, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{c_k} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{c_k^2}\left(E - E_0\right) \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{4 \pi}{c_k^3}\left(E - E_0\right)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Distribution functions==
{{main article|Kinetic theory of solids}}
The density of states plays an important role in the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. The product of the density of states and the [[Distribution function (physics)|probability distribution function]] is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties. 

[[File:Fermi-Dirac product with Density of States.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4: The {{colorbox|#5e81B5}}{{nbsp}}Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, {{colorbox|#e19c24}}{{nbsp}}density of states, and {{colorbox|#8FB131}}{{nbsp}}their product for a semiconductor. The lower green lobe depicts ''hole'' energy, and thus uses &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; as the distribution function.]]

[[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]: The Fermi–Dirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Fermion]]s are particles which obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_\mathrm{B} T}\right) + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] (also denoted as E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and called the [[Fermi level]] when ''T''=0), &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.

[[Bose–Einstein statistics]]: The Bose–Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Boson]]s are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_{\rm B} T}\right) - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

From these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the number of particles &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, [[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and [[thermal conductivity]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by &lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;D(E)&lt;/math&gt;, are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U &amp;= \int E\, f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  n &amp;= \int f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  C &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E\, f(E)\, g(E) \,{\rm d}E \\
  k &amp;= \frac{1}{d}\frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E f(E)\, g(E)\, \nu(E)\, \Lambda(E)\,{\rm d}E
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is dimensionality, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is sound velocity and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[mean free path]].

==Applications==
The density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.

===Quantization===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DOS multdim.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Density of states for electrons in bulk semiconductors (3D; in blue), quantum wells (2D; red), quantum wires (1D; green) and quantum dots (0D; black).]] --&gt;
Calculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For [[quantum wires]], the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for [[quantum dots]] the electrons become quantized to certain energies.

===Photonic crystals===
The photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic bandgap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as [[photonic crystals]]. In nanostructured media the concept of [[local density of states]] (LDOS) is often more relevant than that of DOS, as the DOS varies considerably from point to point.

==Computational calculation ==

Interesting systems are in general complex, for instance compounds, biomolecules, polymers, etc. Because of the complexity of these systems the analytical calculation of the density of states is in most of the cases impossible. Computer simulations offer a set of algorithms to evaluate the density of states with a high accuracy. One of these algorithms is called the [[Wang and Landau algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| title = Efficient, Multiple-Range Random Walk Algorithm to Calculate the Density of States

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Wang and Landau scheme any previous knowledge of the density of states is required. One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin ''i'' is reached one updates
a histogram for the density of states, &lt;math&gt;g(i)&lt;/math&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt; g(i) \rightarrow  g(i) + f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times
(10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt; f_{n+1} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} f_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' denotes the ''n''-th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance &lt;math&gt;f_n &lt; 10^{-8} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as [[multicanonical ensemble|multicanonical simulations]] and [[parallel tempering]]. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins.&lt;ref name="ojeda"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ojeda, P. |author2=Garcia, M. |title=Electric Field-Driven Disruption of a Native beta-Sheet Protein Conformation and Generation of a Helix-Structure  |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=595–599 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.040 |pmid=20643079|bibcode = 2010BpJ....99..595O |pmc=2905109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps.&lt;ref&gt;

"Domain Based Security", abbreviated to "DBSy", is a model-based approach to help analyse [[information security]] risks in a business context and provide a clear and direct mapping between the risks and the [[security controls]] needed to manage them. A variant of the approach is used by the UK government's [[HMG Infosec Standard No.1]] technical risk-assessment method.&lt;ref&gt;HMG IA Standard No. 1 "Technical Risk Assessment", Issue 3.51, October 2009,  {{cite web |url=http://www.cesg.gov.uk/publications/Documents/is1_risk_assessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526213309/http://www.cesg.gov.uk/publications/Documents/is1_risk_assessment.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2012 |df= }}  accessed 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; DBSy is a registered trade mark of [[QinetiQ]] Ltd.

DBSy was developed in the late 1990s by the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA). It is a model-based approach to [[information assurance]] that describes the requirements for security in an organisation, taking account of the business that needs to be supported. The model is based around the concept of a security domain, which represents a logical place where people work with information using a computer system, and which has connections with other security domains where this is necessary to support business activity. Hence the focus is on the information that needs protection, the people that work with it and the people they exchange information with. The model can also describe the physical environments where people work and the system boundaries where major system security measures are placed. A systematic method is then applied to the model to identify and describe the risks to which valuable information assets are exposed and specify security measures that are effective in managing the risks.

==History==
DBSy has its origins in the late 1990s, having been developed by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Initially called the Domain Based Approach, it was developed alongside [[Purple Penelope]] to support the MOD's increasing need for interconnections between systems operating at different security levels 
,&lt;ref&gt;B. Pomeroy and S. Wiseman, "Private desktops and shared store," Proc. of 14th Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 190–200, Phoenix, AZ, December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald R, "Purple Penelope and UK MOD's Emerging Strategy for Information Security", September 1997 http://www.opengroup.org/security/meetings/sep97/Group.pdf Accessed 27 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
It was recognised that the risks associated with such connections were directly related to the nature of the information exchange that was needed and that an effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for information sharing. It was also recognised that the controlled release of information from a system handling secret information (sometimes referred to at the time as 'down grading' or '[[Sanitization (classified information)|sanitisation]]') was not adequately described by any of the existing models of Information security (notably [[Bell-LaPadula]], [[Biba Model|Biba]] and the associated [[Information flow (information theory)|information flow]] models).

Information flow models were found to be unhelpful in understanding the risks when information has to be shared with people and systems that are not entirely trusted.  An effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for exchanging information both within and outside an organisation 
.&lt;ref&gt;Chiew Pheng Goh, "A Security Model for a Defence-Related Organization" University of Wales, Aberystwyth 30 November 2003 http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/MSc_dissertations/2003/Goh_Chiew_Pheng.pdf Accessed 26 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The modelling technique was applied to some major projects for the MOD and as a result of this experience the graphical modelling techniques were revised and a rigorous risk assessment method, based on the concepts of compromise paths was developed. An approach to IT security documentation through a project lifecycle was also created 
.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson C, Hughes K, “What are security documents for?- Objectives of MOD’s Accreditation Documents” Presented at the Annual Sunningdale Accreditor’s Conference, 23–24 September 2002 https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8e3e/c2654849e19be55571dfbab09899fef94674.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Domain Based Security conferences were held at [[QinetiQ]] Malvern in June 2005 and June 2006, promoting discussion of how it could be more widely used, both for defence

A variant of the DBSy method was subsequently developed and incorporated into the UK government's [[HMG Infosec Standard No.1]] Technical Risk Assessment method, the standard method to be used for security risk assessments for all government Information Technology [[system]]s.

==The DBSy model==
The DBSy approach uses simple models to represent the requirements for security in an organisation using two different but related viewpoints: the Infosec Business Model represents the security aspects of the business, while the Infosec Infrastructure Model represents the logical provision of strong boundaries that enforce separation. When combined, they make up an Infosec Architecture Model
.&lt;ref&gt;Ashenden D,  Warrener K, "Understanding Risk Dependencies in Information Systems", Proceedings of the 4th Australian Information Warfare and IT Security Conference, Adelaide, Nov 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This model forms the basis for conducting a systematic and rigorous risk assessment.

The Infosec business model defines security domains and the connections between them. The model specifies the limits of what information can be processed and exchanged between security domains and so forms the set of security requirements for the business. In particular, connections that are not explicitly modelled are not permitted and are required not to occur. A security domain is characterised by a set of information assets, which may be valuable to the organisation, as well as the people that work with the information and the applications and services that act on their behalf.   Connections between domains are characterised by the nature of the interaction that is required (such as interpersonal messages, or shared access to a database) and the sensitivity and integrity requirements of the information exchange. The model can also represent the kinds of physical environment from which a domain can be accessed.

The Infosec infrastructure model defines islands of computing infrastructure that are required to be logically separate, so that information cannot be exchanged between them except at identifiable and manageable points of connection, referred to as causeways. An island is characterised by the strength of separation between it and any other islands and by the people who manage its computing infrastructure.

An Infosec architecture model combines the business and infrastructure views, by showing which security domains are supported by which islands of infrastructure. Where there are connections between security domains that are hosted on different islands, the connections must be supported by an appropriate causeway.

==Risk assessment method==
The DBSy method uses a rational risk framework for describing the risks to which some information assets are exposed. Similar kinds of assets are grouped together as a focus of interest, and the risk assessment process is applied to each focus of interest in turn.

The key factors determining the risk to a particular focus of interest are:
* business Impact of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the focus of interest;
* sets of people who might wish to inflict damage (threat sources) and their motivation for doing so;
* groups of people with different opportunities to inflict damage (threat actors) and their capability to do so, who may also be threat sources or could be influenced by others;
* the means by which each threat actor might cause damage (causes of compromise);
* the defences in place (or planned) to protect the focus of interest.

This risk framework is applied in a systematic fashion to an organisation-specific Infosec architecture model, representing the security-relevant features of an organisation's business and IT systems. Through this process a set of Compromise Paths can be systematically described and the relative effectiveness of different countermeasures can be assessed 
.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes K, Wiseman S, "Analysis of Information Security Risks: Policy for Protection through to Implementation", Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Information Warfare and Security,  Academic Conferences Ltd.  {{ISBN|1-905305-02-8}}, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other IA risk methods==
DBSy differs from other [[IT risk management]] methods in that its primary focus is on people, the business drivers of an organisation and the way the business works, rather than on technical security measures. The analyst is required to systematically define the groups of people that pose a threat and the ways they might cause harm, providing a rigorous, business-oriented framework for the concepts of [[Threat (computer)|threat]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]]. The aim is to understand and analyse information security risks faced by an organisation, especially where the risks appear to conflict with needs for business efficiency across the organisation or in dealings with customers and business partners.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Elocutio''' is the term for the mastery of stylistic elements in Western classical [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''loqui'', "to speak". Although the word ''elocution'' is now associated more with eloquent speaking, it connoted "style" for the classical rhetorican.

It is the third of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing. Beginning in the [[Renaissance]], writers increasingly emphasized the stylistic aspects of rhetoric over the other divisions of rhetoric.

An orator or writer had a number of things to decide in developing a style for a particular discourse. First, there was the level of style; plain (''attenuata'' or ''subtile''), middle (''mediocris'' or ''robusta''), or high (''florida'' or ''gravis''). Writers were instructed to match the basic style to their subject matter and audience. For instance, [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' deemed the plain style suitable for instruction, the middle for moving oration, and the high for charming discourse. Today, elocution and rhetoric are associated with the last of the styles, but for rhetoricians, each style was useful in rhetoric.

The ancient authors agreed that the four ingredients necessary to achieve good style included correctness, clearness, appropriateness, and ornament.

Sometimes translated as "purity," correctness meant that rhetors should use words that were current and adhered to the grammatical rules of whatever language they wrote. Correctness rules are standards of grammar and usage drawn from traditional grammar.

In regard to clarity, most ancient teachers felt that clarity meant that rhetors should use words in their ordinary or everyday senses. The object of clarity was to allow meaning to "shine through" like light through a window.

Appropriateness probably derives from the Greek rhetorical notion to ''prepon'', meaning to say or do whatever is fitting in a given situation. Ancient teachers taught that close attention to kairos will help to determine the appropriate style.

The last and most important of the excellences of style is ornament, which is defined as extraordinary or unusual use of language. Ornamentation was divided into three broad categories: figures of speech, figures of thought, and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. Figures of speech are any artful patterning or arrangement of language. Figures of thought are artful presentations of ideas, feelings, concepts and figures of thought that depart from the ordinary patterns of argument. Tropes are any artful substitution of one term for another.

A great amount of attention was paid to [[figure of speech|figures of speech]], which were classified into various types and subtypes. One Renaissance writer, [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], enumerated 184 different figures of speech, but it could be argued that it was a manifestation of the increasing overemphasis on style that began in the Renaissance.

Also important to ''elocutio'' were subjects that would now be generally regarded as grammatical: the proper use of punctuation and conjunctions; the desirable order of words in a sentence (unlike English, many languages are not as dependent on word order to establish relationships between words and so choices of word order may revolve more around form than function); and the length of sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A '''fiction-writing mode''' is a manner of writing with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.

[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Some writing modes suggested include action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, description, background, exposition and transition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA143 143-65].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept goes back at least as far as Aristotle who, in ''Poetics'', referred to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, pp.  3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in ''The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing'' (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called ''fiction-writing modes''—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jessica Page Morrell, in ''Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing'' (2006), mentioned six ''delivery modes'': action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Peter Selgin, in ''By Cunning and Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers'' (2007), mentioned five writing ''methods'': action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, and description.&lt;ref&gt;Selgin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Mike Klaassen, in ''Fiction-Writing Modes: Eleven Essential Tools for Bringing Your Story to Life'' (2015), addressed eleven modes: action, summarization, narration, description, exposition, transition, conversation (dialogue), sensation, introspection, emotion, and recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
{{main article|Narration}}
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle mentions narration as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a fiction-writing mode, narration is how the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader. This contrasts with the use of the term "narration" as a [[rhetorical mode]] of discourse, where it has a broader meaning which encompasses all written fiction.

==Description==
[[Description]] is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story.  Together with [[dialogue]], narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.  Description is more than the amassing of details, it is bringing a scene to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposition==
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}
Broadly defined, exposition is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. Within the context of fiction-writing modes, exposition is used to convey information.  Exposition may be used to add [[drama]] to a story, but too much exposition at one time may slow the pace of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kernen|Kernen]], 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarization==
[[:wikt:summarisation|Summarization]], or narrative summary, condenses events to convey, rather than to show, what happens within a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA144 144-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "tell" in the [[axiom]] "[[Show, don't tell]]" is often in the form of summarization.  Summarization may be used to:

* connect parts of a story
* report details of less important events
* skip events that are irrelevant to the plot
* convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA145 145].&lt;/ref&gt;
* vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space than other fiction-writing modes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Selgin|Selgin]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective use of summarization requires a balance between showing and telling, action and summary, with rhythm, pace and tone playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA140 140-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introspection==
{{main article|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, or self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey the thoughts of a character, allowing the expression of normally unexpressed thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne, King &amp; Booth]], 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Introspection may also be used to:
* enhance a story by allowing the character's thoughts to deepen [[characterisation]]
* increase tension
* widen the scope of a story&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kress|Kress]], 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* play a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene and sequel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickham|Bickham]], 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA12 12-22], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzUo-KvpA2UC&amp;g=PA50 50-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recollection==
[[Recollection]] is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character [[Memory|remembers]] a detail or event. It plays a vital role in conveying [[Back-story|backstory]] by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story.  Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool.  Recollection could be considered a subset of [[#Introspection|introspection]], but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of a character.  Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique issues and challenges.  For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA113 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensation==
[[Sensation (fiction)|Sensation]] is used to portray a character's [[perception]]s. It can help draw the reader in by conveying the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA172 172].&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reader has experienced only a portion of the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O3CIkg9NDAC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA173 173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
The fiction-writing mode of [[emotion]] conveys the feelings of the character, and is a vital component of [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reid|Reid]], 1994, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecting the character to his own emotions allows the author to connect with the reader on an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kempton|Kempton]], 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayhE_0hlH34C&amp;pg=PA148 148].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Card|Card]], 1999, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNYtrafWhDwC&amp;pg=PA74 74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
In ''Poetics'', Aristotle refers to action as a mode, or manner of representing something.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Action (fiction)|Action]] is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ziBORQpTMD0C&amp;pg=PA142 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA127 127].&lt;/ref&gt; and may help readers feel as if they were participating in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition==
[[Transition (fiction)|Transitions]] in fiction are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or punctuation that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Fiction-writing modes may be classified into categories of modes with common features. 
* ''Interiority''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 6. &lt;/ref&gt; includes modes that reflect the inner workings of the character's mind: introspection, recollection, emotion, and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Exteriority'' includes modes that represent what is outside the character's mind: narration, description, exposition, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dialogue'' represents a character's speech: conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Activity'' includes modes used to portray story events: action and summarization.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Finnish Institute of International Affairs''' ('''FIIA''', {{lang-fi|Ulkopoliittinen instituutti}}, {{lang-sv|Utrikespolitiska institutet}}, UPI) is an independent [[research institute]] located in [[Töölö]], [[Helsinki]], that produces topical information on [[international relations]] and the [[European Union]].

== Organisation ==
[[File:Teija Tiilikainen - July 2015.jpg|thumb|Director Tiilikainen presenting a report on the [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] at Helsinki in 2015]]
The Institute has three research programmes: The European Union; The EU's Eastern Neighbourhood and [[Russia]]; and Global Security. The FIIA organises conferences, seminars and round-table meetings on topical subjects related to research programs. These seminars provide a forum for high level discussions between academics and decision-makers. The research findings and current analyses on international topics are published in the FIIA-Report and Briefing Paper –series. In addition, the Institute publishes ''[[Ulkopolitiikka]]'', a quarterly journal on international relations. The Institute also maintains the Archive and Chronology of Finnish Foreign Policy (Eilen Archive).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The staff of the new Finnish Institute of International Affairs consists of around 50 members. The Director of the Institute is Dr. [[Teija Tiilikainen]]. The work of the FIIA is directed by a nine-member board, appointed by the Parliament and chaired by Minister [[Antti Tanskanen]]. The Institute also has an advisory council. The Institute was set up at the centennial session of the Finnish Parliament in June 2006 and started to function 1 January 2007 under the auspices of the Parliament of Finland. Previously, the Finnish Institute of International Affairs functioned as a private research organization that was founded by the Paasikivi Society in 1961 and maintained by the Foundation for Foreign Policy Research. The core of the Institute's funding comes from the [[Parliament of Finland]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Forensic geology''' is the study of evidence relating to [[mineral]]s, [[oil]], [[petroleum]], and other materials found in the [[Earth]], used to answer questions raised by the [[legal system]].

In 1975, Ray Murray and fellow [[Rutgers University]] professor John Tedrow published ''Forensic Geology''.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Raymond C. and Tedrow, John C. F. (1975) ''Forensic Geology: Earth sciences and criminal investigation'' Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-0794-1}}; second edition 1992, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, {{ISBN|978-0-13-327453-0}}; replaced by Murray, Raymond C. (2004) ''Evidence from the Earth: Forensic geology and criminal investigation'' Mountain Press Publications, Missoula, Montana, {{ISBN|978-0-87842-498-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2008, Alastair Ruffell and Jennifer McKinley, both of Queen's University Belfast, UK, published ''Geoforensics''&lt;ref&gt;Ruffell, Alastair and McKinley, Jennifer (2008) ''[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470057351.html Geoforensics]'' John Wiley and Sons, West Sussex, England, {{ISBN|978-0-470-05735-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that focuses more on the use of [[geomorphology]] and [[geophysics]] for searches. In 2012, Elisa Bergslien, at SUNY Buffalo State, published a general textbook on the topic, ''An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience.'' &lt;ref&gt;Bergslien, Elisa (2012) ''[http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&amp;bcsId=7212&amp;itemId=1405160543 An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience]'' Wiley-Blackwell, West Sussex, England, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

== Early use of forensic geology ==
According to Murray, forensic geology began with [[Sherlock Holmes]] writer, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. The character Sherlock Holmes claimed to be able to identify where an individual had been by various methods, including his having memorized the exposed geology of London to such a degree that detecting certain clays on a person's shoe would give away a locale.  Georg Popp, of Frankfurt, Germany, may have been the first to use soil analysis for linking suspects to a crime scene.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Suzanne (2004) "geology, forensic" ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Forensic Science'' Infobase Publishing, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x0kmY7Bj1zYC&amp;pg=PA102 page 102], {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, [[Hans Gross]] used microscopic analysis of soils and other materials from a suspect's shoes to link him to the crime scene.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"&gt;Donnelly, Laurance (2011) [http://facstaff.buffalostate.edu/bergslet/ForensicGeology/Papers/Donnelly2011.pdf "The Renaissance in Forensic Geology"] ''Teaching Earth Sciences'' 36(1): pp. 46&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Funk art''' is an American [[art movement]] that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; An [[anti-establishment]] movement, Funk art brought [[figurative art|figuration]] back as subject matter in [[painting]] again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]] were depicting. The movement’s name was derived from the [[jazz]] musical term "[[funk]]y", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The term [[funk]] also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's [[Bay Area]] in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a [[collective]] art style or group.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"&gt;Karlstrom, Paul J. ''Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt;

==History==

===Bay Area===
The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in [[Northern California]]. Some notable cities where the Funk movement was concentrated in consisted of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Marin County]], [[Big Sur]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many Funk artists began as [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"&gt;Engelbach, Barbara ''Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68''. Köln König: Museum Ludwig, Köln, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically [[San Francisco]], was a free and spiritual environment due to its [[beatnik]] art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the [[Vietnam War]] going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"/&gt; A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the "Fetish Finish" sculptures made in [[Southern California]] and the "primary structures" constructed in New York at the time.&lt;ref name="Selz"&gt;Selz, Peter. ''Funk''. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s.  [[Jess Collins|Jess]], [[Wally Hedrick]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Viola Frey]], [[Wallace Berman]] and [[Bruce Conner]] were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; In 1967, [[Peter Selz]], the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; The exhibition featured works from [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Mowry Baden]] and [[Bruce Conner]], and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;Albright, Thomas. ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0520051939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter.

===Self-identification===
Unlike earlier movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], Funk art was not concerned with public [[morality]]. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions and processes and in this way their work had a closer [[nature v culture|relationship to nature rather than to culture]]. The works had creative freedom and demonstrated the artists' lives, personalities and experiences.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Funk artists treated their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality and [[autobiographical]] references.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and [[ironic]].  Although the works are humorous, they sometimes cover a more serious undertone.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Since there was no clear meaning in many pieces, Funk art contains a sense of ambiguity.

===Found objects===
Funk art was inspired by [[popular culture]], contains attitude and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics is that it incorporates found objects from [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. It was a part of the larger movement called [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]], which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; [[Bruce Conner]] was known for his assemblage works, including ''Arachne'', ''Spider Lady'', ''For Marilyn'', ''Cosmic Death Song'', and ''Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron''.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many of the Funk [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; [[Jess Collins|Jess]] and [[Wally Hedrick]] were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the [[Dada]] movement because both art movements use everyday objects and have a sense of freedom.The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay many of the time.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Due to the artists lack of concern with impeccable technique, durability or form, the works each possessed a somewhat sloppy finish.

==Ceramics==
Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina{{Where|date=June 2015}} and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate by artists belonging to other movements.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;  Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;Shields, Scott A. "California Funk." ''Ceramics Monthly 56.9'' (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;

===Robert Arneson===
[[Robert Arneson]] started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area.  Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally.{{cn|date=June 2015}} [[Robert Arneson]] created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by [[pop art]] sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that [[Robert Arneson]] also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; His works were playful and full of color.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;
[[Robert Arneson]], along with other Funk artists, such as [[Roy De Forest]], [[Manuel Neri]], and [[William T. Wiley]] taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], which was a center for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[University of California, Davis]], such as Margaret Dodd, [[David Gilhooly]], [[Victor Cicansky]], Chris Unterseher, and Peter Vandenberge, continued Arneson's ceramics tradition.

In 1967, [[Robert Arneson]] drafted ceramicist [[Clayton Bailey]] to cover his classes at [[University of California, Davis]] while he took a [[sabbatical]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

==Exhibitions==

Founded in [[Folsom, California]], in 1962, the [[Candy Store Gallery]] played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

The '''Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society'''  ('''GLIAS''') is the  [[industrial archaeology]] society for the [[Greater London]] area.

== Origins and Responsibilities==
Founded in 1968&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glias.org.uk/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by individuals who had been involved in the [[Thames Valley Observation Group]], it quickly established itself as the leading industrial archaeological and [[industrial history]] group in the London Area.

It is a member of the [[South East Regional Industrial Archaeological Conference]], the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]], and the [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage|TICCIH]].  It also works together with more locally directed history groups and projects supporting individual conservation projects, as well as raising industrial historical issues with national [[UK]] organisations such as [[English Heritage]] and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]].

In addition it comments on [[planning applications]] and developments likely to have an effect on the survival of industrial structures.  In this remit it acts as a [[statutory consultee]].

Its membership is crossed with many other similar organisations and bodies that have similar objectives such as the [[King's Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee]], the [[Newcomen Society]] and the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]].

== Activities ==
Every year it organises a series of half-a-dozen lectures (held in Central London) on industrial archaeology.  It provides a bi-monthly newsletter, which is still produced as [[hard copy]] in an [[A4 (paper size)|A4]] [[Gestetner]] form. It also hosts a series of popular walks around sites of industrial archaeological importance in London, often hosted by people who are expert about the matters in question.

An occasional journal is produced.

== Database ==
In the early 1990s  AIA developed a national standardised method for collecting industrial archaeology data. The result was the [[Index Record for Industrial Sites|IRIS]] (Index Record for Industrial Sites) booklet and forms, published in 1993.

In 1998, GLIAS began to develop a database which  could used to record site information in London.          The intention was to make the database compatible with the IRIS data standard, and the first version was essentially an electronic IRIS form.

An early version was demonstrated to a special committee of the society, the  Recording Group  and this was later presented to the AIA. This was favourably  received and the database has been in development ever since. In 2002 the society received  an award from them.

In [[computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], the '''halting problem''' is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary [[computer program]] and an input, whether the program will finish running (i.e., halt) or continue to run forever.

[[Alan Turing]] proved in 1936 that a general [[algorithm]] to solve the halting problem for ''all'' possible program-input pairs cannot exist. A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a [[Turing machine]]; the halting problem is ''[[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]'' over Turing machines. It is one of the first examples of a [[decision problem]].

Informally, for any program ''f'' that might determine if programs halt, a "pathological" program ''g'' called with an input can pass its own source and its input to ''f'' and then specifically do the opposite of what ''f'' predicts ''g'' will do.  No ''f'' can exist that handles this case.

[[Jack Copeland]] (2004) attributes the term ''halting problem'' to [[Martin Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;In none of his work did Turing use the word "halting" or "termination". Turing's biographer Hodges does not have the word "halting" or words "halting problem" in his index.  The earliest known use of the words "halting problem" is in a proof by Davis (1958, p.&amp;nbsp;70–71):
:"Theorem 2.2 ''There exists a Turing machine whose halting problem is recursively unsolvable''.
:"A related problem is the ''printing problem'' for a simple Turing machine Z with respect to a symbol S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;".
Davis adds no attribution for his proof, so one infers that it is original with him. But Davis has pointed out that a statement of the proof exists informally in Kleene (1952, p.&amp;nbsp;382). Copeland (2004, p 40) states that:
: "The halting problem was so named (and it appears, first stated) by Martin Davis [cf. Copeland footnote 61]... (It is often said that Turing stated and proved the halting theorem in 'On Computable Numbers', but strictly this is not true)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The halting problem is a decision problem about properties of computer programs on a fixed [[Turing-complete]] model of computation, i.e., all programs that can be written in some given [[programming language]] that is general enough to be equivalent to a Turing machine. The problem is to determine, given a program and an input to the program, whether the program will eventually halt when run with that input. In this abstract framework, there are no resource limitations on the amount of memory or time required for the program's execution; it can take arbitrarily long, and use an arbitrary amount of storage space, before halting. The question is simply whether the given program will ever halt on a particular input.

For example, in [[pseudocode]], the program

:&lt;tt&gt;while (true) continue&lt;/tt&gt;

does not halt; rather, it goes on forever in an [[infinite loop]]. On the other hand, the program

:&lt;tt&gt;[[Hello world program|print "Hello, world!"]]&lt;/tt&gt;

does halt.

While deciding whether these programs halt is simple, more complex programs prove problematic.

One approach to the problem might be to run the program for some number of steps and check if it halts. But if the program does not halt, it is unknown whether the program will eventually halt or run forever.

Turing proved no algorithm exists that always correctly decides whether, for a given arbitrary program and input, the program halts when run with that input. The essence of Turing's proof is that any such algorithm can be made to contradict itself and therefore cannot be correct.

=== Programming consequences{{anchor|Avoiding the halting problem}} ===

Some [[infinite loop]]s can be quite useful. For instance, [[event loop]]s are typically coded as infinite loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Code Complete|first=Steve|last=McConnell|edition=2nd|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2004|isbn=9780735636972|page=374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpVCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, most subroutines are intended to finish (halt).&lt;ref&gt;
Han-Way Huang.
[https://books.google.com/books?id=5atwJG7D_HMC "The HCS12 / 9S12: An Introduction to Software and Hardware Interfacing"].
p. 197.
quote: "... if the program gets stuck in a certain loop, ... figure out what's wrong."
&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, in hard [[real-time computing]],
programmers attempt to write subroutines that are not only guaranteed to finish (halt),
but are also guaranteed to finish before a given deadline.&lt;ref&gt;
David E. Simon.
[https://books.google.com/books?id=xG2ZD55_BJAC "An Embedded Software Primer"].
1999.
p. 253.
quote: "For hard real-time systems, therefore, it is important to write subroutines that always execute in the same amount of time or that have a clearly identifiable worst case."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes these programmers use some general-purpose (Turing-complete) programming language,
but attempt to write in a restricted style—such as [[MISRA C]] or [[SPARK_(programming_language)|SPARK]]—that makes it easy to prove that the resulting subroutines finish before the given deadline.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Other times these programmers apply the [[rule of least power]]—they deliberately use a computer language that is not quite fully Turing-complete, often a language that guarantees that all subroutines are guaranteed to finish, such as [[Coq]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}

=== Common pitfalls ===

The difficulty in the halting problem lies in the requirement that the decision procedure must work for all programs and inputs. A particular program either halts on a given input or does not halt. Consider one algorithm that always answers "halts" and another that always answers "doesn't halt". For any specific program and input, one of these two algorithms answers correctly, even though nobody may know which one. Yet neither algorithm solves the halting problem generally.

There are programs ([[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]) that simulate the execution of whatever source code they are given. Such programs can demonstrate that a program does halt if this is the case: the interpreter itself will eventually halt its simulation, which shows that the original program halted. However, an interpreter will not halt if its input program does not halt, so this approach cannot solve the halting problem as stated; it does not successfully answer "doesn't halt" for programs that do not halt.

The halting problem is theoretically decidable for [[linear bounded automaton|linear bounded automata]] (LBAs) or deterministic machines with finite memory. A machine with finite memory has a finite number of states, and thus any deterministic program on it must eventually either halt or repeat a previous state:
:...''any finite-state machine, if left completely to itself, will fall eventually into a perfectly periodic repetitive pattern''. The duration of this repeating pattern cannot exceed the number of internal states of the machine... (italics in original, Minsky 1967, p. 24)

Minsky warns us, however, that machines such as computers with e.g., a million small parts, each with two states, will have at least 2&lt;sup&gt;1,000,000&lt;/sup&gt; possible states:
:This is a 1 followed by about three hundred thousand zeroes ... Even if such a machine were to operate at the frequencies of cosmic rays, the aeons of galactic evolution would be as nothing compared to the time of a journey through such a cycle (Minsky 1967 p. 25):

Minsky exhorts the reader to be suspicious—although a machine may be finite, and finite automata "have a number of theoretical limitations":
:...the magnitudes involved should lead one to suspect that theorems and arguments based chiefly on the mere finiteness [of] the state diagram may not carry a great deal of significance. (Minsky p. 25)

It can also be decided automatically whether a nondeterministic machine with finite memory halts on none, some, or all of the possible sequences of nondeterministic decisions, by enumerating states after each possible decision.

== History ==
{{further|Algorithm#History: Development of the notion of "algorithm"}}

The halting problem is historically important because it was one of the first problems to be proved [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. (Turing's proof went to press in May 1936, whereas [[Alonzo Church]]'s proof of the undecidability of a problem in the [[lambda calculus]] had already been published in April 1936 [Church, 1936].) Subsequently, many other undecidable problems have been described.

===Timeline===

* 1900: [[David Hilbert]] poses his "23 questions" (now known as [[Hilbert's problems]]) at the Second [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris. "Of these, the second was that of proving the consistency of the '[[Peano axioms]]' on which, as he had shown, the rigour of mathematics depended". (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;83, Davis' commentary in Davis, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;108)
* 1920–1921: [[Emil Post]] explores the halting problem for [[tag system]]s, regarding it as a candidate for unsolvability. (''Absolutely unsolvable problems and relatively undecidable propositions&amp;nbsp;– account of an anticipation'', in Davis, 1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;340–433.) Its unsolvability was not established until much later, by [[Marvin Minsky]] (1967).
* 1928: Hilbert recasts his 'Second Problem' at the Bologna International Congress. (Reid pp.&amp;nbsp;188–189) Hodges claims he posed three questions: i.e. #1: Was mathematics ''complete''? #2: Was mathematics ''consistent''? #3: Was mathematics ''decidable''?  (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;91). The third question is known as the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (Decision Problem). (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;91, Penrose p.&amp;nbsp;34)
* 1930: [[Kurt Gödel]] announces a proof as an answer to the first two of Hilbert's 1928 questions [cf Reid p.&amp;nbsp;198]. "At first he [Hilbert] was only angry and frustrated, but then he began to try to deal constructively with the problem... Gödel himself felt—and expressed the thought in his paper—that his work did not contradict Hilbert's formalistic point of view" (Reid p.&amp;nbsp;199)
* 1931: Gödel publishes "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I", (reprinted in Davis, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;5ff)
* 19 April 1935: [[Alonzo Church]] publishes "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory", wherein he identifies what it means for a function to be ''effectively calculable''.

== Formalization ==

In his original proof Turing formalized the concept of ''[[algorithm]]'' by introducing [[Turing machine]]s.  However, the result is in no way specific to them; it applies equally to any other model of [[computation]] that is equivalent in its computational power to Turing machines, such as [[Markov algorithm]]s, [[Lambda calculus]], [[Post system]]s, [[register machine]]s, or [[Tag system#The 2-tag halting problem|tag systems]].

What is important is that the formalization allows a straightforward mapping of algorithms to some [[data type]] that the [[algorithm]] can operate upon.  For example, if the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] lets algorithms define functions over strings (such as Turing machines) then there should be a mapping of these algorithms to strings, and if the formalism lets algorithms define functions over natural numbers (such as [[computable function]]s) then there should be a mapping of algorithms to natural numbers. The mapping to strings is usually the most straightforward, but strings over an [[alphabet]] with ''n'' [[character (computing)|characters]] can also be mapped to numbers by interpreting them as numbers in an ''n''-ary [[numeral system]].

=== Representation as a set ===
{{main|Decision problem}}

The conventional representation of decision problems is the set of objects possessing the property in question. The '''halting set'''
: ''K'' := { (''i'', ''x'') | program ''i'' halts when run on input ''x''}
represents the halting problem.

This set is [[recursively enumerable]], which means there is a computable function that lists all of the pairs (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') it contains (Moore and Mertens 2011, pp. 236–237). However, the complement of this set is not recursively enumerable (Moore and Mertens 2011, pp. 236–237).

There are many equivalent formulations of the halting problem; any set whose [[Turing degree]] equals that of the halting problem is such a formulation.  Examples of such sets include:
*{ ''i'' | program ''i'' eventually halts when run with input 0 }
*{ ''i'' | there is an input ''x'' such that program ''i'' eventually halts when run with input ''x'' }.

=== Proof concept ===

The proof that the halting problem is not solvable is a [[proof by contradiction]]. To illustrate the concept of the proof, suppose that there exists a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] ''halts(f)'' that returns true if the subroutine ''f'' halts (when run with no inputs) and returns false otherwise. Now consider the following subroutine:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def g():
    if halts(g):
        loop_forever()
&lt;/source&gt;

''halts(g)'' must either return true or false, because ''halts'' was assumed to be [[total function|total]]. If ''halts(g)'' returns true, then ''g'' will call ''loop_forever'' and never halt, which is a contradiction. If ''halts(g)'' returns false, then ''g'' will halt, because it will not call ''loop_forever''; this is also a contradiction.  Overall, ''halts(g)'' can not return a truth value that is consistent with whether ''g'' halts. Therefore, the initial assumption that ''halts'' is a total computable function must be false. 

The method used in the proof is called ''diagonalization'' - ''g'' does the opposite of what ''halts'' says ''g'' should do. The difference between this sketch and the actual proof is that in the actual proof, the computable function ''halts'' does not directly take a subroutine as an argument; instead it takes the source code of a program.  The actual proof requires additional work to handle this issue. Moreover, the actual proof avoids the direct use of recursion shown in the definition of ''g''.

=== Sketch of proof ===

The concept above shows the general method of the proof; this section will present additional details. The overall goal is to show that there is no [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] that decides whether an arbitrary program ''i'' halts on arbitrary input ''x''; that is, the following function ''h'' is not computable (Penrose 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;57&amp;ndash;63):

:&lt;math&gt;h(i,x) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; \text{if } \text{  program }i\text{ halts on input }x, \\
  0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''program i'' refers to the ''i'' th program in an [[enumeration]] of all the programs of a fixed [[Turing-complete]] model of computation.

&lt;small&gt;
Possible values for a total computable function ''f'' arranged in a 2D array. The orange cells are the diagonal. The values of ''f''(''i'',''i'') and ''g''(''i'') are shown at the bottom; ''U'' indicates that the function ''g'' is undefined for a particular input value.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The proof proceeds by directly establishing that no total computable function with two arguments can be the required function ''h''.   As in the sketch of the concept, given any total computable binary function ''f'', the following [[partial function]] ''g'' is also computable by some program ''e'':
:&lt;math&gt;g(i) =
\begin{cases}
  0  &amp; \text{if } f(i,i) = 0,\\
  \text{undefined} &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The verification that ''g'' is computable relies on the following constructs (or their equivalents):
* computable subprograms (the program that computes ''f'' is a subprogram in program ''e''),
* duplication of values (program ''e'' computes the inputs ''i'',''i'' for ''f'' from the input ''i'' for ''g''),
* conditional branching (program ''e'' selects between two results depending on the value it computes for ''f''(''i'',''i'')),
* not producing a defined result (for example, by looping forever),
* returning a value of 0.

The following [[pseudocode]] illustrates a straightforward way to compute ''g'':

&lt;div style="width: 50%;"&gt;
&lt;!-- the following code is not Pascal, but that option makes the highlighting work correctly --&gt;
&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
procedure compute_g(i):
    if f(i,i) == 0 then
        return 0
    else
        loop forever
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Because ''g'' is partial computable, there must be a program ''e'' that computes ''g'', by the assumption that the model of computation is Turing-complete. This program is one of all the programs on which the halting function ''h'' is defined. The next step of the proof shows that ''h''(''e'',''e'') will not have the same value as ''f''(''e'',''e'').

It follows from the definition of ''g'' that exactly one of the following two cases must hold:
* ''f''(''e'',''e'') = 0 and so ''g''(''e'') = 0. In this case ''h''(''e'',''e'') = 1,  because program ''e'' halts on input ''e''.
* ''f''(''e'',''e'') ≠ 0 and so ''g''(''e'') is undefined. In this case ''h''(''e'',''e'') = 0,  because program ''e'' does not halt on input ''e''.
In either case, ''f'' cannot be the same function as ''h''. Because ''f'' was an ''arbitrary'' total computable function with two arguments, all such functions must differ from ''h''.

This proof is analogous to [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. One may visualize a two-dimensional array with one column and one row for each natural number, as indicated in the table above. The value of ''f''(''i'',''j'') is placed at column ''i'', row ''j''. Because ''f'' is assumed to be a total computable function, any element of the array can be calculated using ''f''. The construction of the function ''g'' can be visualized using the main diagonal of this array.  If the array has a 0 at position (''i'',''i''), then ''g''(''i'') is 0. Otherwise, ''g''(''i'') is undefined. The contradiction comes from the fact that there is some column ''e'' of the array corresponding to ''g'' itself. Now assume ''f'' was the halting function ''h'', if ''g''(''e'') is defined (''g''(''e'') = 0 in this case), ''g''(''e'') halts so ''f''(''e,e'') = 1.  But ''g''(''e'') = 0 only when ''f''(''e,e'') = 0, contradicting ''f''(''e,e'') = 1. Similarly, if ''g''(''e'') is not defined, then halting function ''f''(''e,e'') = 0, which leads to ''g''(''e'') = 0 under ''g'''s construction. This contradicts the assumption of ''g''(''e'') not being defined. In both cases contradiction arises. Therefore any arbitrary computable function ''f'' cannot be the halting function ''h''.

==Computability theory==
{{main|computability theory}}

The typical method of proving a problem to be undecidable is with the technique of ''[[reduction (complexity)|reduction]]''{{clarify|does halting problem use this technique or is this paragraph a digression?|date=December 2016}}.  To do this, it is sufficient to show that if a solution to the new problem were found, it could be used to decide an undecidable problem by transforming instances of the undecidable problem into instances of the new problem.  Since we already know that ''no'' method can decide the old problem, no method can decide the new problem either. Often the new problem is reduced to solving the halting problem. (Note: the same technique is used to demonstrate that a problem is [[NP complete]], only in this case, rather than demonstrating that there is no solution, it demonstrates there is no ''polynomial time'' solution, assuming [[P versus NP problem|P ≠ NP]]).

For example, one such consequence of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot be a general [[algorithm]] that decides whether a given statement about [[natural number]]s is true or not. The reason for this is that the [[proposition]] stating that a certain program will halt given a certain input can be converted into an equivalent statement about natural numbers. If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it could certainly find the truth value of this one; but that would determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.

[[Rice's theorem]] generalizes the theorem that the halting problem is unsolvable. It states that for ''any'' non-trivial property, there is no general decision procedure that, for all programs, decides whether the partial function implemented by the input program has that property. (A partial function is a function which may not always produce a result, and so is used to model programs, which can either produce results or fail to halt.)  For example, the property "halt for the input 0" is undecidable. Here, "non-trivial" means that the set of partial functions that satisfy the property is neither the empty set nor the set of all partial functions. For example, "halts or fails to halt on input 0" is clearly true of all partial functions, so it is a trivial property, and can be decided by an algorithm that simply reports "true." Also, note that this theorem holds only for properties of the partial function implemented by the program; Rice's Theorem does not apply to properties of the program itself. For example, "halt on input 0 within 100 steps" is ''not'' a property of the partial function that is implemented by the program—it is a property of the program implementing the partial function and is very much decidable.

[[Gregory Chaitin]] has defined a [[halting probability]], represented by the symbol [[Chaitin's constant|Ω]], a type of real number that informally is said to represent the [[probability]] that a randomly produced program halts.  These numbers have the same [[Turing degree]] as the halting problem. It is a [[normal number|normal]] and [[transcendental number]] which can be [[definable number|defined]] but cannot be completely [[computable number|computed]]. This means one can prove that there is no [[algorithm]] which produces the digits of Ω, although its first few digits can be calculated in simple cases.

While Turing's proof shows that there can be no general method or algorithm to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem may very well be susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact [[computer scientist]]s often do just that as part of a [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness proof]]. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no ''mechanical, general way'' to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated [[termination analysis]].

Since the negative answer to the halting problem shows that there are problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine, the [[Church–Turing thesis]] limits what can be accomplished by any machine that implements [[effective method]]s. However, not all machines conceivable to human imagination are subject to the Church–Turing thesis (e.g. [[oracle machine]]s). It is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic [[physical process]]es that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine, and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed in the form of a calculating machine (a [[hypercomputer]]) that could solve the halting problem for a Turing machine amongst other things. It is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the [[human brain]], and whether humans can solve the halting problem (Copeland 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;15).

=== Gödel's incompleteness theorems ===
{{trim|{{#lsth:Undecidable problem|Relationship with Gödel's incompleteness theorem}}}}

== Generalization ==

Many variants of the halting problem can be found in computability textbooks (e.g., Sipser 2006, Davis 1958, Minsky 1967, Hopcroft and Ullman 1979, Börger 1989). Typically their undecidability follows by [[Reduction (recursion theory)|reduction]] from the standard halting problem. However, some of them have a higher [[degree of unsolvability]]. The next two examples are typical.

=== Halting on all inputs ===

The ''universal halting problem'', also known (in [[recursion theory]]) as ''totality'', is the problem of determining, whether a given computer program will halt ''for every input'' (the name ''totality'' comes from the equivalent question of whether the computed function is [[total function|total]]).
This problem is not only undecidable, as the halting problem, but highly undecidable. In terms of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], it is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt;-complete (Börger 1989, p. 121).

This means, in particular, that it cannot be decided even with an [[oracle machine|oracle]] for the halting problem.

=== Recognizing partial solutions ===

There are many programs that, for some inputs, return a correct answer to the halting problem, while for other inputs they do not return an answer at all. 
However the problem ″given program ''p'', is it a partial halting solver″ (in the sense described) is at least as hard as the halting problem.
To see this, assume that there is an algorithm PHSR (″partial halting solver recognizer″) to do that. Then it can be used to solve the halting problem,
as follows:
To test whether input program ''x'' halts on ''y'', construct a program ''p'' that on input (''x'',''y'') reports ''true'' and diverges on all other inputs.
Then test ''p'' with PHSR.

The above argument is a [[Reduction (recursion theory)|reduction]] of the halting problem to PHS recognition, and in the same manner, 
harder problems such as ''halting on all inputs'' can also be reduced, implying that PHS recognition is not only undecidable, but higher in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], specifically &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt;-complete.

=== Oracle machines ===
{{See Also|Turing jump}}
A machine with an [[oracle machine|oracle]] for the halting problem can determine whether particular Turing machines will halt on particular inputs, but they cannot determine, in general, if machines equivalent to themselves will halt.

Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. 
In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the [[Standard cross-cultural sample]]. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J. Greene, "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", ''Ethnology'', Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1976), pp. 409-429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Gwen J., and Sarah J. Greene, (1980).

It was frequent in ancient Greece. However, in later cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]].

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social construct]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. [[John Boswell]] has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |date=1980 |title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

Among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities, these roles still exist.&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011.

[[File:Balboamurder.jpg|thumb|left|Balboa setting his [[war dog]]s upon Indian practitioners of sodomy in 1513; New York Public Library]]
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]s'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.&lt;ref name=coello&gt;Mártir de Anglería, Pedro.

==East Asia==
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''pleasures of the bitten peach,'' ''the cut sleeve,'' or ''the southern custom,'' has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors, not identities (recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term "brokeback," 斷背 ''duanbei'' to refer to homosexual men, from the success of director [[Ang Lee]]'s film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'').&lt;ref name=jongo&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |title=Most frequently used new coinages in daily Chinese |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |periodical=Jongo News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175158/http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present, as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.

[[Homosexuality in Japan#Ancient Japan|Homosexuality in Japan]], variously known as [[shudo]] or [[nanshoku]], has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic life and the [[samurai]] tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of [[Ukiyo-e|painting]] and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships.

Similarly, in [[Thailand]], ''[[kathoey]]'', or "ladyboys," have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While ''kathoey'' may encompass simple [[effeminacy]] or [[transvestite|transvestism]], it most commonly is treated in [[Thai culture]] as a [[third gender]]. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or [[freedman]]) adult male and a free-born [[adolescent]], was valued for its [[pedagogy|pedagogic benefits]] and as a means of [[population control]], though occasionally blamed for causing [[societal disorder|disorder]]. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings&lt;ref name=plato1&gt;[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but in his late works proposed its prohibition.&lt;ref name=plato2&gt;Plato, Laws, 636D &amp; 835E&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'' (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with [[democracy]], and its suppression with [[despotism]], saying that homosexuality "is shameful to [[barbarian]]s because of their despotic governments, just as [[philosophy]] and [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce".&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Aristotle, in his ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celt]]s accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the [[Cretan]]s used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Little is known of [[lesbianism|female homosexuality]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later [[Classical Greek people|Greeks]] in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (''sapphic'' and ''lesbian'') came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lesbian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sapphic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sappho's poetry centers on [[passion (emotion)|passion]] and love for various personages and both genders. The [[narrator]]s of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of [[sexual act|physical acts]] between women are few and subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that she ran an academy for girls.

In [[ancient Rome]], the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but [[pederasty|relationships]] were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Prioreschi, Plinio (1996). A History of Medicine. Horatius Press. pp. 21–23, 29. {{ISBN|1-888456-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Roman emperor|emperor]] with the exception of [[Claudius]] took male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward (1781). The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]]. However, by 390 A.D., Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: "All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Robert Thornton, Bowers v. Hardrick: An Incomplete Constitutional Analysis, 65 U.N.C. L. Rev. 1100, 1100 n. 11 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In 558, toward the end of his reign, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "[[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on [[brothels]] of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 618.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius: Secret History: XIX.

During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]]—[[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', {{ISBN|0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', {{ISBN|0-19-503465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the [[Officers of the Night]], were [[prosecution|prosecuting]], [[fine (penalty)|fining]], and [[imprisonment|imprisoning]] a good portion of that population.&lt;ref&gt;Florentine proverb, ca. 1480. After Sabadino degli Arienti in Le Porretane. Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford, 1996; p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The eclipse of this period of relative [[artistic freedom|artistic]] and [[sexual freedom|erotic freedom]] was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]].&lt;ref&gt;On homoeroticism in Florence and Savonarola's campaign against it, Michael Rocke, Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1996). More generally, on youth culture, see Richard Trexler, Public Life in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as [[Personal relationships of James I of England|King James I]] and the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: "The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede" &lt;ref&gt;''Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd'', 1691&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous ''Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson'' was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. "Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson." ''Issue 2; Issue 19 of Journal of Homosexuality Series: No. 19, N''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1749 edition of [[John Cleland]]'s popular novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill:_Memoirs_of_a_Woman_of_Pleasure ''Fanny Hill'' at WikiSource] (1749) by [[John Cleland]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Stephen J.

It includes the passage: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts."&lt;ref&gt;Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) ''In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified"'', Institute of Historical Research&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1785 [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Homosexuality ({{ISSN|0091-8369}}) Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Execution]]s for sodomy continued in the [[Netherlands]] until 1803 and in [[England]] until 1835.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the [[Congress of German Jurists]] in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of [[anti-homosexual law]]s. ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name=sexualinversion&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[medical text]]s like these (written partly in [[Latin]] to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', [[Socialist]] activist and poet [[Edward Carpenter]] wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and "came out" in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an [[anthology]] of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one. In a backlash to this, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] specifically [[History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|targeted LGBT people in the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Heger: ''Die Männer mit dem rosa Winkel.''

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Rouayheb|first=Khaled|title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-72988-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, [[Mauritania]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 ILGA:7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185853/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |date=2009-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], during his [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad#U.S. Visit and speech at Columbia University|2007 speech at Columbia University]], asserted that there were no gay people in Iran.

In many societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro people|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of [[Christianity]] by [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[missionaries]].&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace.jpg|thumb|Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing.]]
[[Homosexuality in ancient Egypt]] is a passionately disputed subject within [[Egyptology]]: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about [[homosexuality]]. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum|Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep]]. Both men lived and served under [[pharaoh]] [[Niuserre]] during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]] (c. 2494&amp;ndash;2345 BC).&lt;ref name=RPH&gt;Richard Parkinson: ''Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature''. In: ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA)'', vol. 81, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same [[mastaba]] tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the [[Eskimo kissing|nose-on-nose touching]] normally represented a kiss.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020071548/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/africa/niankhkhnum_and_khnumhotep.html Dena Connors-Millard: ''Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.?''] (English).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were [[twin]]s, even possibly [[conjoined twins]]. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

It remains unclear, what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT&gt;Emma Brunner-Traut: ''Altägyptische Märchen. Mythen und andere volkstümliche Erzählungen''. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, {{ISBN|3-424-01011-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century [[Mwanga II]] (1868–1903) the Kabaka of Buganda regularly had sex with his male page.&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Trade and Foreign Contact". Uganda. Library of Congress Country Studies. December 1990. Retrieved 6 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia Bieber (1909) “encountered Uranism” among the Semitic Harari people and noted that “sodomy is not foreign to the Harari. Albeit not as commonly, it also occurs among the Galla [Oromo] and Somal[i].” He also noted mutual masturbation by both sexes and all ages for all three peoples, and specified that among the Harari, Uranism was practiced as often between
men as between men and boys. More recently, Gamst (1969) reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking Qemant (Kemant) of central Ethiopia. Among Amhara peasants, Messing (1957) found (better-accepted) male transvestites, who they view as “god’s mistakes.” Wändarwäräd (“literally male-female”) with visible male sexual characteristics, but whose structure is popularly believed to be defective. Among the Maale of southern Ethiopia, “a small minority [of men] crossed over to feminine roles. Called ashtime, these (biological) males dressed like women, performed female tasks, cared for their own houses, and apparently had sexual relations with men,” according to Donald Donham (1990).

Cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. Needham (1973) described a religious leadership role called mugawe among the Meru of Kenya which includes wearing women's clothes and hairstyle. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are married to a man. Bryk (1964) reported active (i.e., insertive)
Kikuyu pederasts called onek. and also mentioned “homoerotic bachelors” among the pastoralist Nandi and Maragoli (Wanga).

== Historiographic considerations ==
The term ''homosexuality'' was invented in the 19th century, with the term ''heterosexuality''  invented later in the same century to contrast with the earlier term. The term ''bisexuality'' was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominate sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions.

Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as ''straight'', ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'', ''[[gay]]'' or ''[[queer]]''. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities.

However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like ''queer''. For example, in many societies same-sex sex acts were expected, or completely ignored, and no identity was constructed on their basis at all. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece}}
Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was.

Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships, which come from [[Ancient Greece]]. Often adolescent boys were favored over women. One ancient saying claimed that "Women are for business, boys are for pleasure." Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate, but there were exceptions (among whom [[Alexander the Great]]) He would be the ''erastes'' (lover) to a young ''eromenos'' (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover's theory suggests that [[#Outside Reading|questioned]] in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed semen to be the source of knowledge and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from the erastes to the eromenos.

The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped Roman homosexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male–male sex|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex between male citizens of equal status, including [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|soldiers]], was disparaged, and in some circumstances penalized harshly.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and entertainers or others considered ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' (of no social standing) were acceptable sex partners for the dominant male citizen to penetrate.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged.

=== The Middle Ages ===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Two males accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]
Through the medieval period, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[Philip II Augustus]], and [[William Rufus]] were engaged in same-sex relationships.

Also, historian Allan A. Tulchin recently argued that a form of male same-sex marriage existed in Medieval France, and possibly other areas in Europe, as well. There was a legal category called "enbrotherment" (affrèrement) that allowed two men to share living quarters, pool their resources, and effectively live as a married couple. The couple shared "one bread, one wine, one purse."&lt;ref&gt;Allan A. Tulchin, "Same-Sex Couples Creating Households in Old Regime France: The Uses of the Affrèrement," ''The Journal of Modern History''. Volume 79, Issue 3, Page 613–647, Sep 2007. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/doSearch?searchText=tulchin&amp;filter=all&amp;x=0&amp;y=0]&lt;/ref&gt; The article received considerable attention in the English-language press, since Tulchin may have discovered the earliest form of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph {{cite web|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126082839/http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|archivedate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-06-18|df=}}, NPR [https://www.npr.org/blogs/news/2007/08/could_the_idea_of_civil_unions.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tulchin's views have also sparked significant controversy, as they challenge the generally held view that the medieval period was one of the most anti-gay in history.

== Psychiatry ==
Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called "bisexuality" is the normal human condition thwarted by society.

In 1948 [[Alfred Kinsey]] publishes ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', popularly known as the [[Kinsey Reports]].

Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

== The sexual revolution ==
During the [[Sexual Revolution]], the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.

[[File:Table of Consanguinity showing degrees of relationship.svg|upright=1.3|right|thumb|The number next to each box indicates the degree of relationship relative to the given person.]]
The English word ''[[wikt:incest|incest]]'' is derived from the Latin ''incestus'', which has a general meaning of "impure, unchaste".
It was introduced into [[Middle English]], both in the generic Latin sense (preserved throughout the Middle English period&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] [[Ancrene Riwle]] (c. 1225) has ''Incest‥is bituȝe sibbe fleschliche'', where either the generic or the narrow sense may be intended. See also [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=incest&amp;searchmode=none inetymonline.comest]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the narrow modern sense.
The derived adjective ''incestuous'' appears in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', T. F. Hoad (ed.) (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the Latin term came in, incest was known in [[Old English]] as ''sib-leger'' (from ''sibb'' 'kinship' + ''leger'' 'to lie') or ''mǣġhǣmed'' (from ''mǣġ'' 'kin, parent' + ''hǣmed'' 'sexual intercourse') but in time, both words fell out of use.

===Antiquity===
In [[ancient China]], first cousins with the same surnames (i.e., those born to the father's brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born to the father's sisters) were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulik |first=Robert Hans van |title=Sexual Life in Ancient China: a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D. |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9MUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 |isbn=90-04-03917-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s married their siblings and had several children with them. For example, [[Tutankhamun]] married his half-sister [[Ankhesenamun]], and was himself the child of an incestuous union between [[Akhenaten]] and an unidentified sister-wife. It is now generally accepted that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous [[papyrus|papyri]] and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister, of the same father and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=N. |title=Life in Egypt under Roman Rule |isbn=0-19-814848-8 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

The fable of ''[[Oedipus]]'', with a theme of inadvertent incest between a mother and son, ends in disaster and shows ancient taboos against incest as Oedipus is punished for incestuous actions by blinding himself. In the "sequel" to Oedipus, ''[[Antigone]]'', his four children are also punished for their parents' incestuousness. Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of [[Adonis]], when his mother, [[Myrrha]] has sex with her father [[Cinyras]] during a festival, disguised as a prostitute.

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan King]] [[Leonidas I]], hero of the legendary [[Battle of Thermopylae]], was married to his [[niece]] [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]], daughter of his half-brother [[Cleomenes I]]. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that [[Elpinice]] was for a time married to her half-brother [[Cimon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |title=Elpinice |last=Lahanas |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Hellenic World encyclopaedia |publisher=Hellenica |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921025414/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law|Roman civil law]] prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity&lt;ref name="SRCL514"&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 513-4&lt;/ref&gt; but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line [[:wikt:ad infinitum|''ad infinitum'']].&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an [[:wikt:unemancipated|unemancipated]] daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved.&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Incestuous unions were discouraged and considered ''[[nefas]]'' (against the laws of gods and man) in [[ancient Rome]]. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of ''incestus'' into two categories of unequal gravity: the ''incestus iuris gentium,'' which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the ''incestus iuris civilis,'' which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters ([[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Agrippina the Younger]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2007|Potter]], 2007, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Claudius]], after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 2007, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.

In [[Norse mythology]], there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between [[Njörðr]] and his [[Sister-wife of Njörðr|unnamed sister]] (perhaps [[Nerthus]]), parents of [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]]. [[Loki]] in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.

In Genesis 19:30-38, living in an isolated area after the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s two daughters conspired to inebriate and seduce their father due to the lack of available partners to continue his [[Lineage (anthropology)|line of descent]]. Because of intoxication, Lot "perceived not" when his firstborn, and the following night his younger daughter, lay with him. (Genesis 19:32-35)

===From the Middle Ages onward===
[[File:Rey_Carlos_II.jpg|thumb|[[Charles II of Spain]] was born mentally and physically disabled due to centuries of inbreeding in the [[House of Habsburg]]]]
Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] royal houses. However, relations between siblings, which may have been tolerated in other cultures, were considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that [[Anne Boleyn]] and her brother [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.

Incestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient [[Japan]] and Korea,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, George Patrick (1998).

In a 1999 news story, ''BBC'' reported, "Close-knit family life in [[India]] masks an alarming amount of sexual abuse of children and teenage girls by family members, a new report suggests. Delhi organisation [[RAHI Foundation|RAHI]] said 76% of respondents to its survey had been abused when they were children—40% of those by a family member."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/259959.stm |title=India's hidden incest |date=January 22, 1999 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Center for Victims of Crime a large proportion of [[rape]] committed in the United States is perpetrated by a family member:
{{bq|1=Research indicates that 46% of children who are raped are victims of family members (Langan and Harlow, 1994). The majority of American rape victims (61%) are raped before the age of 18; furthermore, 29% of all rapes occurred when the victim was less than 11 years old. 11% of rape victims are raped by their fathers or stepfathers, and another 16% are raped by other relatives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32360 | title=Incest |work=National Center for Victims of Crime and Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center|year=1992|publisher=National Center for Victims of Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A study of victims of father–daughter incest in the 1970s showed that there were "common features" within families before the occurrence of incest: estrangement between the mother and the daughter, extreme paternal dominance, and reassignment of some of the mother's traditional major family responsibility to the daughter. Oldest and only daughters were more likely to be the victims of incest. It was also stated that the incest experience was psychologically harmful to the woman in later life, frequently leading to feelings of low self-esteem, very unhealthy sexual activity, contempt for other women, and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/3961672| jstor=3961672|title = Emotional Inheritance: A Dubious Legacy|journal = Science News| volume=111| issue=21| pages=326|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2009}}

Adults who as children were incestuously victimized by adults often suffer from low [[self-esteem]], difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and [[sexual dysfunction]], and are at an extremely high risk of many mental disorders, including [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Phobia|phobic avoidance reactions]], [[somatoform disorder]], [[substance abuse]], [[borderline personality disorder]], and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name= Courtois/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Barrett |first2=Mary Jo |title=Systemic Treatment of Incest: A Therapeutic Handbook |last=Trepper |first=Terry S. |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-87630-560-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Incest-Related Syndromes of Adult Psychopathology |first=Richard P. |last=Kluft |year=1990 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub, Inc. |pages=83, 89 |isbn=978-0-88048-160-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Leslie Margolin indicates that mother-son incest does not trigger some innate biological response, but that the effects are more directly related to the symbolic meanings attributed to this act by the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Margolin |first=Leslie |title=The effects of mother-son incest |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |year=1985 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=104–114 |doi=10.1007/BF01553341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Goler clan]] in [[Nova Scotia]] is a specific instance in which child sexual abuse in the form of forced adult/child and sibling/sibling incest took place over at least three generations.&lt;ref name="cruise"&gt;{{Cite book |title=On South Mountain: The Dark Secrets of the Goler Clan |last=Cruise |first=David |last2=Griffiths |first2=Alison |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-670-87388-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of Goler children were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, cousins, and each other. During interrogation by police, several of the adults openly admitted to engaging in many forms of sexual activity, up to and including full intercourse, multiple times with the children. Sixteen adults (both men and women) were charged with hundreds of allegations of incest and sexual abuse of children as young as five.&lt;ref name="cruise" /&gt; In July 2012, twelve children were removed from the [[Colt clan incest case|'Colt' family]] (a pseudonym) in [[New South Wales]], Australia, after the discovery of four generations of incest.&lt;ref name=ccnsw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/action/PJUDG?jgmtid=167373 |title=DFaCS (NSW) and the Colt Children [2013] NSWChC 5 |publisher=Children's Court, New South Wales |date=13 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217044158/http://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/action/PJUDG?jgmtid=167373 |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nca131210&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/the-case-of-incest-and-depravity-which-came-to-rest-in-the-hills-of-a-quiet-country-town/story-fnixwvgh-1226780575248 |title=The case of incest and depravity which came to rest in the hills of a quiet country town |first=Candace |last=Sutton |work=[[News Corp Australia]] |date=December 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child protection workers and psychologists said interviews with the children indicated "a virtual sexual free-for-all".&lt;ref name=nca131212&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/the-family-tree-of-the-depraved-family-who-live-in-the-hills-of-a-quiet-country-town/story-fnii5s3x-1226781805877 |title=The family tree of the depraved family who live in the hills of a quiet country town |first=Candace |last=Sutton |work=[[News Corp Australia]] |date=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, there is a popular misconception that mother-son incestuous contact is common, due to the manner in which it is depicted in the press and popular media. According to Hideo Tokuoka, "When Americans think of incest, they think of fathers and daughters; in Japan one thinks of mothers and sons" due to the extensive media coverage of mother-son incest there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokuoka |first1=Hideo |last2=Cohen |first2=Albert K.|title=Japanese Society and Delinquency|journal=International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice|year=1987|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=13–22|doi=10.1080/01924036.1987.9688852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western researchers assumed that mother-son incest is common in Japan, but research into victimization statistics from police and health-care systems discredits this; it shows that the vast majority of sexual abuse, including incest, in Japan is perpetrated by men against young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gough |first=David |title=Child Abuse in Japan |journal=[[Child and Adolescent Mental Health]] |date=February 1996 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-3588.1996.tb00003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While incest between adults and children generally involves the adult as the perpetrator of abuse, there are rare instances of sons sexually assaulting their mothers. These sons are typically mid adolescent to young adult, and, unlike parent-initiated incest, the incidents involve some kind of physical force. Although the mothers may be accused of being seductive with their sons and inviting the sexual contact, this is contrary to evidence.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtois |first=Christine  |title=Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy |year=2010 |publisher=W.

Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-39462-032-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such accusations can parallel other forms of rape, where, due to [[victim blaming]], a woman is accused of somehow being at fault for the rape. In some cases, mother-son incest is best classified as [[acquaintance rape]] of the mother by the adolescent son.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

===Between childhood siblings===
Childhood [[Sibling incest|sibling–sibling incest]] is considered to be widespread but rarely reported.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt; Sibling–sibling incest becomes [[child-on-child sexual abuse]] when it occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of [[coercion]]. In this form, it is believed to be the most common form of intrafamilial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalogerakis |first=Michael G. |author2=American Psychiatric Association.

Sibling abusive incest is most prevalent in families where one or both parents are often absent or emotionally unavailable, with the abusive siblings using incest as a way to assert their power over a weaker sibling.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite news|last=Leder |first=Jane Mersky |title=Adult Sibling Rivalry: Sibling rivalry often lingers through adulthood |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry |work=Psychology Today |volume=January/February 93 |publisher=Sussex Publishers |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of the father in particular has been found to be a significant element of most cases of sexual abuse of female children by a brother.&lt;ref name=rudd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudd |first=Jane M. |last2=Herzberger |first2=Sharon D. |title=Brother-sister incest—father-daughter incest: a comparison of characteristics and consequences |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=23 |issue=9 |date=September 1999 |pages=915–928 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaging effects on both childhood development and adult symptoms resulting from brother–sister sexual abuse are similar to the effects of father–daughter, including substance abuse, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=rudd /&gt;&lt;ref name=cyr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyr |first=Mireille |last2=Wrighta |first2=S John |last3=McDuffa |first3=Pierre |last4=Perron |first4=Alain |title=Intrafamilial sexual abuse: brother–sister incest does not differ from father–daughter and stepfather–stepdaughter incest |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=26 |issue=9 |date=September 2002 |pages=957–973 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00365-4 |pmid=12433139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual activity between adult close relatives is sometimes ascribed to [[genetic sexual attraction]].&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hari |first=Johann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4331603,00.html |title=Forbidden love |date=2002-01-09 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of incest has not been widely reported, but evidence has indicated that this behavior does take place, possibly more often than many people realize.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; Internet [[chatroom]]s and topical websites exist that provide support for incestuous couples.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

Proponents of incest between consenting adults draw clear boundaries between the behavior of consenting adults and rape, child molestation, and abusive incest.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; However, even consensual relationships such as these are still legally classified as incest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053600/http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-02-02 |author=Roffee, James |year=2015 |title=When Yes Actually Means Yes |pages=72–91 |doi=10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |journal=Rape Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminalized in almost all jurisdictions {{crossref| (see [[Laws regarding incest]] for exceptions)}}.

According to one incest participant who was quoted for an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'':

{{bq|1=You can't help who you fall in love with, it just happens. I fell in love with my sister and I'm not ashamed ... I only feel sorry for my mom and dad, I wish they could be happy for us. We love each other. It's nothing like some old man who tries to fuck his three-year-old, that's evil and disgusting ... Of course we're consenting, that's the most important thing. We're not fucking perverts. What we have is the most beautiful thing in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian2002"/&gt;}}

In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', [[William Saletan]] drew a legal connection between gay sex and incest between consenting adults.&lt;ref name="slate2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2081904/ |title=Incest Repellent? If gay sex is private, why isn't incest? |last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=2003-04-23 |publisher=''[[Slate Magazine]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he described in his article, in 2003, U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] commented on a pending U.S. Supreme Court case involving sodomy laws (primarily as a matter of [[Civil and political rights|constitutional rights]] to [[Right to privacy#United States|privacy]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection under the law]]):

{{bq|1="If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery."&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt;}}

Saletan argued that, legally and morally, there is essentially no difference between the two, and went on to support incest between consenting adults being covered by a legal right to privacy.&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt; [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]] law professor [[Eugene Volokh]] has made similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/2010/12/12/incest/ |title=Incest |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |date=December 12, 2010 |work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent article, Saletan said that incest is wrong because it introduces the possibility of irreparably damaging family units by introducing "a notoriously incendiary dynamic—sexual tension—into the mix".&lt;ref name="slt10"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |title=Incest Is Cancer |last=Saletan |first=William |date=Dec 14, 2010 |work=Slate |accessdate=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430151843/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |archive-date=30 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aunts, uncles, nieces or nephews====
{{see also|Avunculate marriage}}
In the [[Netherlands]], marrying one's nephew or niece is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of [[genetic defects]] among the offspring. Nephew-niece marriages predominantly occur among foreign immigrants. In November 2008, the Christian Democratic (CDA) party's Scientific Institute announced that it wanted a ban on marriages between nephews and nieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/11/gates-of-vienna-news-feed-11262008.html|title=Gates of Vienna News Feed 11/26/2008|first=Baron|last=Bodissey|date=26 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensual sex between adults (persons of 18 years and older) is always lawful in the Netherlands and Belgium, even among closely related family members. Sexual acts between an adult family member and a minor are illegal, though they are not classified as incest, but as abuse of the authority such an adult has over a minor, comparable to that of a teacher, coach or priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfri.be/incest-strafbaar |title=is incest strafbaar ? &amp;#124; Goede raad is goud waard - Advocatenkantoor Elfri De Neve |publisher=Elfri.be |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-07-30|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, consensual adult sexual intercourse with someone known to be your aunt, uncle, niece or nephew constitutes a felony of the third degree.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law - Page 200, John M. Scheb - 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also commonly prohibit marriages between such kin.&lt;ref&gt;Family Law in the USA - Page 207, Lynn Dennis Wardle, Laurence C.

Ludman - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, incest includes only sexual intercourse with a parent, grandparent, child or sibling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest by a man.|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/69/part/I/crossheading/incest|work=Sexual Offences Act 1956|publisher=National Archives UK|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the more recently introduced offence of "sex with an adult relative" extends also as far as half-siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/64|work=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives of United Kingdom|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term 'incest' however remains widely used in popular culture to describe any form of sexual activity with a relative.

====Between adult siblings====
{{main|Sibling incest}}
The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, [[Patrick Stübing]] and Susan Karolewski. Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all.

First- and second-cousin marriages are rare, accounting for less than 1% of marriages in Western Europe, North America and Oceania, while reaching 9% in South America, East Asia and South Europe and about 50% in regions of the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.{{dubious|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2008.02.008 |title=Consanguinity and child health |url=http://www.channel4.com/microsites/D/Dispatches/when_cousins_marry/cousins_10.pdf |year=2008 |last1=Saggar |first1=A |last2=Bittles |first2=A |journal=Paediatrics and Child Health |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=244–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities such as the Dhond and the [[Bhittani]] of Pakistan clearly prefer marriages between cousins as belief they ensure purity of the descent line, provide intimate knowledge of the spouses, and ensure that [[Property|patrimony]] will not pass into the hands of "outsiders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, Body, Sexuality and Health |first=Suad |last=Joseph |author-link=Suad Joseph |first2=Afsaneh |last2=Najmabadi |author2-link=Afsaneh Najmabadi |publisher=Brill |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-04-12819-4 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bzXzWgVajnQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parallel and cross cousins|Cross-cousin]] marriages are preferred among the [[Yanomami]] of Brazilian Amazonia, among many other tribal societies identified by anthropologists.

There are some cultures in Asia which stigmatize cousin marriage, in some instances even marriages between second cousins or more remotely related people. This is notably true in the culture of [[Korea]]. In South Korea, before 1997, anyone with the same last name and clan were prohibited from marriage. In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]]). [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture prohibits the marriage of anyone with the same last name – to do so would result in being shunned by the entire community, and they are usually stripped of their last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kgaGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Hmong+culture+prohibits+the+marriage+of+anyone+with+the+same+last+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e8m1_KU0qe&amp;sig=vXdn3cHbipJu-ldp-4b7PmtLh0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrOnUo-TdAhXm6oMKHcdSAEsQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hmong%20culture%20prohibits%20the%20marriage%20of%20anyone%20with%20the%20same%20last%20name&amp;f=false|title=Hmong Refugees in the New World: Culture, Community and Opportunity|last=Vang|first=Christopher Thao|date=2016-05-16|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9781476622620|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hindu]] communities in India prohibit cousin marriages.

In a review of 48 studies on the children parented by cousins, the rate of birth defects was twice that of non-related couples: 4% for cousin couples as opposed to 2% for the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Towie |first=Narelle |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |title=Most babies born to first-cousins are healthy |publisher=Perth Now |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202060753/http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defined through marriage====
Some cultures include relatives by marriage in incest prohibitions; these relationships are called [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] rather than [[consanguinity]]. For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollak |first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684–1814 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore MD |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=0-8018-7204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tann |first=Jennifer |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=May 2007 |chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728–1809)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles La Trobe]]. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to "raise up seed to him" (per {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5–6|HE}}).  Some societies have long practiced [[sororal polygyny]], a form of [[polygamy]] in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).

In Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.

==Inbreeding==
{{Main|Inbreeding}}
Offspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F. B. |year=1969 |title=Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45–62 |doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Inbreeding depression]]). Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.
* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a "healthier" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).
The closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding. This fact likely explains why inbreeding between close relatives, such as siblings, is less common than inbreeding between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar [[immune system]]s may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=moral&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lieberman |first1=D. |last2=Tooby |first2=J. |last3=Cosmides |first3=L. |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2290 |title=Does morality have a biological basis?

==Laws==
{{Main|Laws regarding incest}}

Laws regarding sexual activity between close relatives vary considerably between jurisdictions, and depend on the type of sexual activity and the nature of the family relationship of the parties involved, as well as the age and sex of the parties. Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sweden]] is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo]. BBC. 12 March 2007. retrieved 22 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While the legality of consensual incest varies by country, sexual assault committed against a relative is usually seen as a very serious crime. In some legal systems, the fact of a perpetrator being a close relative to the victim constitutes an [[aggravating circumstance]] in the case of sexual crimes such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|sexual conduct with a minor]] – this is the case in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;See Articles 218-221 of the [[Penal Code of Romania#The Penal Code of 2014|Romanian Penal Code]] [http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Jewish===

According to the Torah, per [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0318.htm Leviticus 18], "the children of Israel"—Israelite men and women alike—are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are "near of kin" (cf. verse 6), who are defined as:

# Parents and children (cf. verse 7)
# Siblings and half siblings (cf. verses 9 and 11). Relationships between these are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and they are of the only two kinds incestuous relationships that are among the particularly-singled-out relationships—with the other particularly-singled-out relationships being ones of non-incestuous family betrayal (cf. verse 20) and bestiality (cf. verse 21)
# Grandparents and grandchildren (cf. verse 10)
# Aunts and nephews, uncles and nieces, etc. (cf. verses 12–14).&lt;ref&gt;Also see  the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]]' [https://ccarnet.org/responsa/142-marriage-mothers-sister-or-half-sister-aunt-or/ Responsum 142].&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships between these are the second kind of relationships that are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and the explicit examples of children-in-law and mothers-in-law (cf. verse 23) serves to remind the Israelites that [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0436.htm the parents-in-law are also (or at least should be also) the children-in-laws' aunts and uncles]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: 'The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of [[Zelophehad]], saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among [[Chillul Hashem|''chillulim HaShem'']], acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0320.htm Leviticus 20].

In the 4th century BCE, the [[Soferim]] (''scribes'') declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed ''seconds'' (Hebrew: ''sheniyyot''), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.&lt;ref name="TosYeb23"&gt;''Yebamot' ([[Tosefta]]) 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these ''seconds'' of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a ''safeguard'' against infringing the biblical incest rules,&lt;ref name="Yeb21a"&gt;Yebamot 21a&lt;/ref&gt; although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of ''seconds''.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=incest|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&amp;letter=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriages that are forbidden in the Torah (with the exception of uncle-niece marriages) were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid – as if they had never occurred;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA"&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan 'Aruk]]'', ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 16, 1&lt;/ref&gt; any children born to such a couple were regarded as [[mamzer|bastards under Jewish law]],&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 94b&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as ''seconds'', and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt;

===Christian===
The [[Catholic Church]] does not generally permit the marriage if a doubt exists on whether the potential spouses are related by blood relations in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law]. Can. 1091&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of incest varied throughout history.  The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] held in 1215 attempted to codify that marriage was forbidden up to and including third cousins, though permissible beyond this for fourth cousins, third cousins once removed, etc.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriages are banned between second cousins or closer and between second uncles / aunts and second nieces / nephews (between first cousins once removed) or closer. Marrying one's godparent or deceased spouse's sibling is also prohibited, although marrying one's stepchild is not – e.g. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] exercised his right to marry his stepdaughter after her mother's (his first wife's) death.

The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] allows marriages up to and including first cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/|year=1962|place=Canada|title=Book of Common Prayer|chapter=A Table of Kindred and Affinity|chapterurl=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/kindred-and-affinity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s book ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', a 5th Century AD book of Christian philosophy, he claimed that the children of Adam and Eve must have married each other in order to produce offspring.

In [[Ancient Persia]], incest between cousins is a blessed virtue although in some sources incest is believed to be related to that of parent-child or brothers-sisters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=0qcdrMTprSMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sex and Punishment: Four Thousand Years of Judging Desire|last=Berkowitz|first=Eric|date=2012|publisher=Counterpoint Press|year=|isbn=9781582437965|location=|pages=21-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Zoroastrianism]] both royalty, priestly and commoners practiced incest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This tradition was called Xwedodah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bigwood|first=Joan M.|date=2009-12|title=‚Incestuous’ Marriage in Achaemenid Iran: Myths and Realities|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/klio.2009.91.issue-2/klio.2009.0015/klio.2009.0015.xml|journal=Klio|language=en|volume=91|issue=2|pages=311–341|doi=10.1524/klio.2009.0015|issn=0075-6334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|date=1996-09-01|title=Brother-sister and parent-child marriage outside royal families in ancient egypt and iran: A challenge to the sociobiological view of incest avoidance?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223430185_Brother-sister_and_parent-child_marriage_outside_royal_families_in_ancient_egypt_and_iran_A_challenge_to_the_sociobiological_view_of_incest_avoidance|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=17|pages=319–340|doi=10.1016/S0162-3095(96)00074-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García|first=María Olalla|date=2001|title="Xwedodah" : el matrimonio consanguíneo en la Persia Sásanida.

To what extent Xvaetvadatha was practiced in [[Sasanian]] Iran and before, especially outside the royal and noble families (“dynastic incest”) and, perhaps, the clergy, and whether practices ascribed to them can be assumed to be characteristic of the general population is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mitterauer, “The Customs of the Magians: The Problem of Incest in Historical Societies,” in Roy Porter and Mikuláš Teich, eds., Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality, Cambridge, UK, and New York, 1994, pp. 231-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[Dura-Europos]], however, combined with that of the Jewish and Christian sources citing actual cases under the Sasanians, strengthen the evidence of the Zoroastrian texts.  In the post-Sasanian Zoroastrian literature, Xvaetvadatha is said to refer to marriages between cousins which have always been relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;*Jakob Eduard Polak, Persien, das Land und seine Bewohner: ethnographische Schilderungen,  2 vols in one, Leipzig, 1865; tr.

===Hindu===
[[Rigveda]] regard incest to be "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger |title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology |page=7 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] speaks of incest in abhorrent terms. Hindus believe there are both [[karmic]] and practical bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both [[endogamy]] and [[exogamy]], in relation to the family tree (''[[gotra]]'') or bloodline (''[[Pravaras|Pravara]]'').
Marriage within the ''gotra'' (''swagotra'' marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system.&lt;ref&gt;"There can be no matrimony between the sects of Gehlawat and Kadiyan as they have a 'brotherhood' akin to consanguinity."[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/ "Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage"]. ''Indian Express''. July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People within the ''gotra'' are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest. Marriage with paternal cousins (a form of [[Parallel and cross cousins|parallel-cousin]] relationship) is strictly prohibited. 

Although generally marriages between persons having the same ''gotra'' are prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z'', James G. Lochtefeld, Rosen Publishing Group, 2002; p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; how this is defined may vary regionally.
Depending on culture and [[Indian caste system|caste]] of the population in the region, marriage may be restricted up to seven generations of ''gotra'' of father, mother, and grandmother.  In a few rural areas, marriage is banned within same local community is only allowed with those from outside of the community, as they consider a small village to be like brothers and sisters of one large family. These rules are strictly enforced and a couple breaking them is violently punished sometimes. &lt;ref&gt;"In India these rules are reproduced in the form of that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste" [http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm#Limitations "Limitations of Marriage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103062452/http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm |date=2010-11-03 }}. sanathanadharma.com&lt;/ref&gt; The seven-generation prohibition in some areas is only applied to paternal descent, with ''gotra'' is transferred down the male lineage; in these areas, the ''gotra'' of a female changes upon marriage (i.e., upon marriage a woman would belong to her husband's lineage).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', one of the two great [[Hindu Epics]], [[Arjuna]] took as his fourth wife his first and [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross cousin]] [[Subhadra]], the sister of [[Krishna]]. Arjuna had gone into exile alone after having disturbed [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Draupadi]] in their private quarters. It was during the last part of his exile, while staying at the Dvaraka residence of his cousins, that he fell in love with Subhadra. While eating at the home of [[Balarama]], Arjuna was struck with Subhadra's beauty and decided he would obtain her as his wife. Subhadra and Arjuna's son was the tragic hero [[Abhimanyu]]. According to Andhra Pradesh oral tradition, Abhimanyu himself married his first cross cousin Shashirekha, the daughter of Subhadra's brother [[Balarama]]. Cross-cousin marriages are evident from Arjuna's marriage with Subhadra, [[Pradyumna]]'s (Eldest son of Krishna) marriage with Rukmi's (brother of [[Rukmini]]) daughter. Also, Krishna married his cross cousin [[Mitravinda]] (daughter of [[Vasudeva]]'s sister Rajadhi who was queen of Avanti) and Bhadra (daughter of Vasudeva's sister Shrutakirti who was the queen of Kekaya Kingdom.)

[[Livestock]] breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with [[culling]] of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">'''Intrinsic aging''' and '''extrinsic aging''' are terms used to describe [[cutaneous]] aging of the [[skin]] and other parts of the [[integumentary system]], which while having [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[wikt: concomitant|concomitants]], seems to primarily involve the [[dermis]].&lt;ref&gt;YU RJ, Van Scott EJ: Alpha-hydroxy Acids: Science and Therapeutic Use. ''A Sup to Cosmetic Dermatology'', Oct 1994. 1(1):1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic aging is influenced by internal physiological factors alone, and extrinsic aging by many external factors.  Intrinsic aging is also called ''chronologic aging'', and extrinsic aging is most often referred to as ''photoaging''.

== Causes and effects ==
The effects of ''intrinsic aging'' are caused primarily by internal factors alone.  It is sometimes referred to as chronological aging and is an inherent degenerative process due to declining physiologic functions and capacities.  Such an aging process may include qualitative and quantitative changes and includes diminished or defective synthesis of [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] in the dermis.

''Extrinsic aging'' of skin is a distinctive declination process caused by external factors, which include ultra-violet radiation, cigarette smoking, air pollution, among others.  Of all extrinsic causes, radiation from sunlight has the most widespread documentation of its negative effects on the skin.  Because of this, extrinsic aging is often referred to as photoaging.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrest BA: Overview of skin aging.  ''J Cut Aging &amp; Cos Derm'' 1(1):1-2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klingman AM, Klingman LH: Photoaging. In: Fitzpatick TB, Eisen AZ, Wolff K, Freedberg IM, Austen KF (eds.): ''Dermatology in General Medicine, Vol. II''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, Inc.; 1993:2972-2970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uitto J, Fazio MJ, Olsen DR: Cutaneous aging: Molecular alterations in elastic fibers. ''J Cuta Aging &amp; Cos Derm 1(1):13-26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photoaging]] may be defined as skin changes caused by chronic exposure to UV light.  '''Photodamage''', implies changes beyond those associated with aging alone, defined as cutaneous damage caused by chronic exposure to solar radiation and is associated with emergence of [[neoplastic lesions]].

A '''low-carbon economy''' ('''LCE'''), '''low-fossil-fuel economy''' ('''LFFE'''),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://nanoparis.blogspot.com/2006/03/dye-sensitized-solar-cells.html Nanomech in Photovoltaics: Dye Sensitized Solar Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''decarbonised economy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/Decarbonised-Economy1/|title=Decarbonised Economy|work=Greenpeace India|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[economy]] based on [[low carbon power]] sources that therefore has a minimal output of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions into the [[biosphere]], but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas [[carbon dioxide]]. GHG emissions due to anthropogenic (human) activity are the dominant cause of observed [[global warming]] ([[climate change]]) since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf |title= IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

Shifting to low-carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial benefits both for developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018). ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-3-319-71769-2}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies (LEDS). These strategies seek to achieve social, economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_global_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion, as a means to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid catastrophic climate change]], and as a precursor to the more advanced, zero-carbon economy.

==Rationale and aims==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national [[climate change mitigation]] strategy.  A comprehensive strategy to mitigate [[climate change]] is through [[carbon neutrality]].

The aim of a LCE is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and power-generation, etc. around technologies that produce energy and materials with little GHG emission, and, thus, around populations, buildings, machines, and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently, and, dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of GHGs. Furthermore, it has been proposed that to make the transition to an LCE economically viable we would have to attribute a cost (per unit output) to GHGs through means such as [[emissions trading]] and/or a [[carbon tax]].

Some nations are presently low carbon: societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level, all nations considered [[carbon intensity|carbon intensive]] societies, and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies. Several of these countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via [[Carbon offset|offset]]ting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions ([[carbon neutrality]]); in other words, emitting will not cease but will continue and will be ''offset'' to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits, thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Emission Trading System(EU ETS) Factsheet |url=http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=European Union |accessdate=27 Oct 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715223057/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of low-carbon economies===
Low-carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience, trade, employment, health, energy security, and industrial competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/2016/06/presenting-co-benefits-of-leds/?loclang=en_gb|title=Presenting the benefits of low emission development strategies|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits to ecosystem resilience====
Low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions, but also to protect [[biodiversity]] and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty - all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems, according to a report by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]. [[REDD+]] and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve, sustainably manage, and restore these carbon rich ecosystems, which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration, and for building climate resilient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-boost-ecosystem-resilience/?loclang=en_gb|title=Boost ecosystem resilience to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job creation====
Transitioning to a low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice, and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments, workers, and employers’ organizations.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-green-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=Create green jobs to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates from the [[International Labour Organization]]’s Global Economic Linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change, with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers, will have negative effects on output in many industries, with drops in output of 2.4% by 2030 and 7.2% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/docs/WCMS_192582/lang--en/index.htm|title=Global Economic Linkages Model|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume, composition, and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers, approximately half the global workforce, will undergo major changes: agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource intensive manufacturing, recycling, buildings, and transport.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"/&gt;

====Business competitiveness====
Low emission industrial development and [[resource efficiency]] can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies, with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5–5 years, leveraging financial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-gain-competitive-edge/?loclang=en_gb|title=Gain the competitive edge to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improved trade policy====
Trade and trade policies can contribute to low-carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services. Removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies is one such measure. In a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times - a typical [[wind turbine]], for example, contains up to 8,000 components - even small tariff cuts would reduce costs. This would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market, particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-use-trade-policy/?loclang=en_gb|title=Use trade policy to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===

====Renewable energy and energy efficiency====

Recent advances in technology and policy will allow [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels, meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and, in conjunction with efficiency gains, can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009&gt;Janet L.

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). In 2008, about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables.&lt;ref name=r2010&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years.&lt;ref name=ren15/&gt; More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected [[photovoltaics]] increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy for power, heat, cooling, and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth, with energy security a prerequisite economic growth, making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy. Scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a country's energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports. It can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility, and improve the balance of trade for importing countries (noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas). Renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-ensure-energy-security/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Ensure energy security to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant, but there is still much more that can be achieved. With a concerted effort and strong policies in place, future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large. Heat is one of many forms of "energy wastage" that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009/&gt;

====Sustainable biofuels====
{{Main|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]]. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008). ''Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges'',  {{ISBN|978-0-85403-662-2}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sol&gt;Gordon Quaiattini. [http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= Biofuels are part of the solution]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canada.com'', April 25, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPFL Energy Center (c2007). ''[http://www.webcitation.org/5luiZYDX8?url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sustainabilitycenter/RSB_Intro.pdf Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels]'' Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of [[alternative energy]] sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, especially in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a [[sustainable transport]] strategy.

====Nuclear power====
[[Nuclear power]] has been offered as the primary means to achieve a LCE. In terms of large [[industrialized]] nations, mainland France, due primarily to [[nuclear power in France|75% of its electricity being produced by nuclear power]], has the [[List of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions|lowest carbon dioxide production]] per unit of [[GDP]] in the world and it is the [[List of countries by electricity exports|largest exporter of electricity in the world]], earning it approximately €3 billion annually in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|title=Privacy policy|work=Business &amp; Finance|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302010428/http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security; although the physical issues are not large, the political difficulties are significant. The [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] (LFTR) has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = N. | last2 = Minakata | first2 = D. | last3 = Begovic | first3 = M. | last4 = Crittenden | first4 = J. | title = Should We Consider Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors for Power Generation? | doi = 10.1021/es2021318 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 15 | pages = 6237 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2011EnST...45.6237C }} "LFTR can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly [[sustainable energy]] sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative [[environmental impact]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

France reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the [[La Hague site]] since 1976 and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

====Smart grid====
One proposal from Karlsruhe University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR8gEMpzos4|title=Fully renewable: biogas + wind + solar|date=29 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 Combined Power Plant&lt;/ref&gt; developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load. Hydro and biogas are used as [[grid energy storage]]. This requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production, thereby reducing the existing 5% grid loss.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon-neutral hydrocarbons===
{{main|Carbon-neutral fuel}}

====Methane cycle====
A further development of this is the use of the carbon capture, hydrogen and its conversion into methane (SNG synthetic natural gas) to act as a storage for intermittent renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-798-2.volltext.frei.pdf Bioenergy and renewable power methane in integrated 100% renewable energy system]&lt;/ref&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Sabatier reaction

This involves the use of the existing natural gas (methane) grid as the store. In this case, the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier. This "solar fuel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/the-challenge|title=Solar Fuel|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid, which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create synthetic or substitute natural gas SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy (and the heat used as well in CHP) on demand when there is not enough sun (photovoltaic, CSP...) or wind (turbines) or water (hydro, ocean current, waves,...).  The German natural gas grid, for example, has two months of storage, more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points.

====Ocean derived hydrocarbon fuels====
The concentration of [[Ocean acidification|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the upper layer of the world's oceans]] is higher than is found in air, and thus it is the most concentrated "[[mining|mine]]" from which zero-net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier [[A4W reactor|which generates 100 megawatts]] of electricity can produce 41,000 [[US gallon]]s(155,202 [[litre]]s) of [[jet fuel]] per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about $6 per gallon($1.58 per liter). While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Willauer]] of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] proof-tested the technology in 2013, fueling an internal combustion engine equipped [[model airplane]] with the [[synthetic fuel]].&lt;ref name=Parry2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/scale-model-wwii-craft-takes-flight-with-fuel-from-the-sea-concept |title=Scale Model WWII Craft Takes Flight With Fuel From the Sea Concept |last=Parry |first=Daniel |date=April 7, 2014 |work=Naval Research Laboratory News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbon capture and storage ====
The proposed strategy of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a LCE, either in a primary or supporting role. Major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement CCS worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the [[biosphere]].

====Combined heat and power====

[[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions; should the fuel be [[biomass]] or [[biogas]] or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option. CHP can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source; there are examples of such installations in the far North of the Russian Federation.

==Primary sector==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Low carbon diet}}

Most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification.  Rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains, but it also uses a lot of energy.  For this and other reasons (such as transport costs) in a low-carbon society, rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility's energy consumption.  In parts of California, it can be up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fypower.org/agri/|title=Thank You|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the low carbon economy, irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water.

====Crops====
Different crops require different amounts of energy input.  For example, glasshouse crops, irrigated crops, and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain, while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance.  Those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;New Zealand Energy Intensive Business Initiative, {{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232041/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasshouse crops
*environmental control systems
*heat recovery using condensers
*heat storage using buffer tanks
*heat retention using thermal screens
*alternative fuels (e.g., waste wood and trees)
*cogeneration (heat and power)
Irrigated arable crops
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*variable-speed drives on pumps

====Livestock====
Livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run.  Feed lots use animal feed made from corn, soybeans, and other crops.  Energy must be expended to produce these crops, process, and transport them.  Free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on.  The farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.

Many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock.  In the low-carbon economy, such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection, water cisterns, etc., and they will also pump/distribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources (most likely wind and solar).

Due to rural electrification, most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity.  In a low-carbon economy, farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency.  The dairy industry, for example, will incorporate the following changes:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Irrigated Dairy
*heat recovery on milk vats
*variable speed drives on motors/pumps
*heat recovery from hot water wash
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*biodigester with cogen (heat &amp; power)
*vat wrap
*solar water heating
*ripple control
*ice bank
*chemical substitute for hot-water wash

===Hunting and fishing===
Fishing is quite energy intensive.  Improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}

===Forestry===
{{Main|Wood economy}}
Protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all, ranging from increased food production, safeguarded local livelihoods, protected [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystems]] provided by forests, and reduced rural poverty. Adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_Forestry_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the low-carbon economy, forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much.  Specialized tree farms  will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{Main|Gas flare}}
Flaring and venting of [[natural gas]] in oil wells is a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tons/year, and in 2004 accounted for about 1/2 of one percent of all [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm Global, Regional, and National CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711043835/http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm |date=2007-07-11 }}. In ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change'', Marland, G., T.A. Boden, and R. J. Andres, 2005, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually (2010 datum), an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of [[Germany]] and [[France]] or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days.
This flaring is highly concentrated: 10 countries account for 70% of emissions, and twenty for 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=worldbank.org |publisher=The [[World Bank]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=previous redirect from web.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010, were (in declining order): [[Russia]] (26%), [[Nigeria]] (11%), [[Iran]] (8%), [[Iraq]] (7%), [[Algeria]] (4%), [[Angola]] (3%), [[Kazakhstan]] (3%), [[Libya]] (3%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (3%), and [[Venezuela]] (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,contentMDK:22137498~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:578069,00.html|title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction - Estimated Flared Volumes from Satellite Data, 2007-2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary sector==

===Retail===
Retail operations in the low-carbon economy will have several new features.  One will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent, halogen, and eventually LED light sources.  Many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays.  These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer.  These are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=35633 Grocery Store Sets California Solar Standard], Renewable Energy World, 22 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation services===
Sustainable, low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally (as well as socially and economically) sustainable mobility, improving transport technologies, fuels and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_transport_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Transport Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decarbonisation of (urban) mobility by means of:
* More energy efficiency and alternative propulsion:
** Increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations, with more [[vehicle electrification]], particularly through [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) or [[all-electric vehicle]]s
** More alternative and flex-fuel vehicles (based on local conditions and availability)
** Driver training for more fuel efficiency.
** Low-carbon [[biofuel]]s [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic]] ([[biodiesel]], [[bioethanol]], [[biobutanol]])
** Petroleum fuel [[fee|surcharge]]s will be a more significant part of consumer costs.
* Less international trade of physical objects, despite more overall trade (as measure by value of goods)
* Greater use of marine and [[electric rail transport]], less use of air and truck transport.
* Increased non-motorised transport (i.e. walking and cycling) and public transport usage, less reliance on private motor vehicles.
* More [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] capacity for common fluid commodities such as water, ethanol, butanol, natural gas, petroleum, and hydrogen (in addition to gasoline and diesel). See&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy Information Administration]] Industry Analysis Briefs, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/mecs/iab/index5e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, http://www.carbontrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf BERR - Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many co-benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], low carbon transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people’s time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

===Health services===
There have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world.  The Sustainable Development Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nhs.uk/|title=Sustainable Development Unit|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NHS in the UK is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area, whilst organisations such as the Campaign for Greener Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenerhealthcare.org/|title=Munin :: overview|author=Auto-generated Munin|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also producing influential changes at a clinical level.   This work includes
* Quantification of where the health services emissions stem from.
* Information on the environmental impacts of alternative models of treatment and service provision
Some of the suggested changes needed are:
* Greater efficiency and lower ecological impact of energy, buildings, and procurement choices (e.g., in-patient meals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment).
* A shift from focusing solely on cure to prevention, through the promotion of healthier, lower-carbon lifestyles, e.g. diets lower in red meat and dairy products, walking or cycling wherever possible, better town planning to encourage more outdoor lifestyles.
* Improving public transport and liftsharing options for transport to and from hospitals and clinics.

=== Tourism ===
Low-carbon tourism includes travels with low energy consumption, and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pollution emissions. Change of personal behavior to more low-carbon oriented activities is mostly influenced by both individual awareness and attitudes, as well as external social aspect, such as culture and environment. Studies indicate that educational level and occupation influence an individual perception of low-carbon tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Wenjie|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaolei|last3=Yang|first3=Zhaoping|last4=Wall|first4=Geoffrey|last5=Wang|first5=Fang|date=2017-06-04|title=Creating a low carbon tourism community by public cognition, intention and behaviour change analysisa case study of a heritage site (Tianshan Tianchi, China)|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0017/geo-2017-0017.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=197-210|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0017|issn=2391-5447|via=|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial steps==
A good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy, from its initial seed at the inaugural UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, has been given by David Runnals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D.

On the international scene, the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2050.nies.go.jp/|title=Low-Carbon Society Research Project|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Towards a low carbon economy | author = Margot Wallström | date = 11 March 2004 | location = Brussels | url = http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222229/http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | archivedate = 21 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, all member nations of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] except the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States]] have ratified the protocol.
Europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/climate-change/decarbonisation-challenge-us-european-perspectives/article-162796|title=The decarbonisation challenge - US and European perspectives|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] - an organisation advocating [[sustainable mobility]] and [[public transport]] - has an EU office, but less well developed contacts with, for example, the US. The European Union Committee of the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/news/pics/pdf/PR_Decarbonisation.pdf|title=News|work=UITP|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions, Europe is quickly losing ground to Asia, with countries such as China and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|title=E3G — Third Generation Environmentalism - Action on climate and energy|author=E3G, Third Generation Environmentalism|work=E3G - Third Generation Environmentalism|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730155101/http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the 2014 ''Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI)'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-Report2014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance, finding that the Nordic countries and Switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy.

===Countries===

====Australia====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Australia}}
Australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but [[carbon neutrality]] has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes, emissions have increased. The [[Second Rudd Government]] pledged to lower emissions by 5-15%. In 2001, The Howard Government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) scheme. In 2007, the Government revised the MRET - 20 percent of Australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Renewable energy sources provide 8-10% of the nation's energy, and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years. However coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of Australia as a low-carbon economy. Carbon-neutral businesses have received no incentive; they have voluntarily done so. Carbon-offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality. In Australia the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the Australian government's National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS) which includes a mandatory independent audit. Three of the four of Australia's top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-neutral/carbon-neutral-program/accredited-businesses#Certified_organisations . Businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco2 and transitioning to NCOS as the only one that is externally audited. Most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with NCOS such as Net Balance https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125415/http://www.netbalance.com/ , Pangolin Associates (who themselves are independently certified under NCOS) http://pangolinassociates.com/sustainability-services/ncos-carbon-neutrality/, Energetics http://energetics.com.au/home and the big four accounting firms.

In 2011 the Gillard Government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses. Although often characterised as a tax, it lacked the revenue-raising nature of a true tax. In 2013, on the election of the Abbott government, immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so-called carbon tax. The price on carbon was repealed on the 17th July 2014 by an act of parliament. As it stands Australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change.

====China====
{{Main|Renewable energy in China}}
In [[China]], the city of [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] is to be built to produce zero net greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Chinese State Council announced in 2009 it aimed to cut China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40%-45% in 2020 from 2005 levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2009-11/27/content_9060500.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However carbon dioxide emissions were still increasing by 10% a year by 2013 and China was emitting more carbon dioxide than the next two biggest countries combined (U.S.A. and India).&lt;ref&gt;Borenstein, Seth (12 April 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html China's Carbon Emissions Directly Linked To Rise In Daily Temperature Spikes, Study Finds] The Huffington Post, Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Total carbon dioxide emissions were projected to increase until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
[[Costa Rica]] sources much of its energy needs from renewables and is undertaking [[reforestation]] projects. In 2007, the Costa Rican government announced the commitment for Costa Rica to become the first [[carbon neutral]] country by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Costa Rica Aims to Be a Carbon-Neutral Nation | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19141333 | accessdate = 2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Costa Rica Aims to Become First "Carbon Neutral" Country | url =http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4958 | accessdate = 2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= País quiere ser primera nación con balance neutro de carbono | url =http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/febrero/21/aldea1002694.html | accessdate = 2008-02-18 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Iceland}}
Iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy. However, since dramatic economic growth, Iceland's emissions have increased significantly per capita. As of 2009, Iceland energy is sourced from mostly [[geothermal energy]] and [[hydropower]], [[renewable energy in Iceland]] and, since 1999, has provided over 70% of the nation's [[primary energy]] and 99.9% of Iceland's [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |title=Gross energy consumption by source 1987–2005 |publisher=''[http://www.statice.is/?PageID=583 Statistics Iceland]'' |accessdate=2007-05-14 |format=XLS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125021947/http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |archivedate=2007-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Iceland's carbon emissions per capita are 62% lower than those of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals Indicators |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2006-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite using more primary energy per capita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |title=Energy in Iceland |publisher=Icelandic Ministries of Industry and Commerce |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305070726/http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |archive-date=2007-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost. Iceland seeks [[carbon neutrality]] and expects to use 100% renewable energy by 2050 by generating [[hydrogen fuel]] from renewable energy sources.

====Peru====
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that economic losses related to climate change for Peru could reach over 15% of national gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Climate Change in Peru|url=http://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/climate-change-peru-seen-affecting-fishing-high-andes-livestock-and-agricultural|website=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a large country with a long coastline, snow-capped mountains and sizeable forests, Peru's varying ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat, leading to [[water scarcity]] in some areas. In the period between 1990 and 2015, Peru experienced a 99% increase in per capita carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, marking one of the largest increases amongst South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America and the Caribbean: Multi-level dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region |url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIP01771-CDKN_LEDS_LAC_Urbanization_final_updated_5-6-17_proof.pdf|website=LEDS GP|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru brought in a National Strategy on Climate Change in 2003. It is a detailed accounting of 11 strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research, mitigation of climate change effects on the poor, and creating Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mitigation and adaptation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/legislation/countries/peru/|website=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment published a Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation Against Climate Change (Peru)|url=http://theredddesk.org/countries/plans/action-plan-adaptation-and-mitigation-against-climate-change-peru|website=The REDD Desk|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups, including: reporting mechanisms on GHG emissions, mitigation, adaptation, research and development of technology of systems, financing and management, and public education. It also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change.

In 2014, Peru hosted the Twentieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP20) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP20|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php|website=UNFCCC COP20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called INFOCARBONO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDS GP Peru's National Climate Law|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CDKN_LEDS_PB_INFOCARBONO_FINAL_WEB.pdf|website=LEDS Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], INFOCARBONO is a major transformation of the country's greenhouse gas management system. Previously, the system was under the sole control of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. The new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Climate Change Act 2008]] outlining a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy became law on November 26, 2008.  This legislation requires an 80% cut in the UK's [[carbon emissions]] by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm|title=New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change|publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]|date=2007-03-13|accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000610/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the UK became the first country to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law.

A meeting at the [[Royal Society]] on 17–18 November 2008 concluded that an integrated approach, making best use of all available technologies, is required to move toward a low-carbon future. It was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low-carbon economy within a few decades, but that 'urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/document.asp?tip=0&amp;id=8174 Towards a low carbon future], [[Royal Society]], 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year. [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines|title=Rio's reprise must set hard deadlines for development|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-06-19|accessdate=2012-07-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120730141206/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines |archivedate = July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1643/contents/made |title=The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme Regulations 2014 |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires all large businesses in the UK to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/esos |title=ESOS: Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low carbon economy has been described as a "UK success story", accounting for more than £120 billion in annual sales and employing almost 1 million people. A 2013 report suggests that over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011/12 was likely to have come from green business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/low-carbon-entrepreneurs |title=Low Carbon Entrepreneurs: the new engines of growth |date=May 2013 |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cities===
Companies are planning large scale developments without using fossil fuels. Development plans such as those by [[World Wide Assets LLC]] for entire cities using only [[geothermal energy]] for electricity, [[geothermal desalination]], and employing full recycling systems for water and waste are under development (2006) in Mexico and Australia.

[[File:Hippocampus small.gif|thumb|The hippocampus regulates memory function.]]
'''Memory improvement''' is the act of improving one's memory.

Medical research of memory deficits and age-related [[memory loss]] has resulted in new explanations and treatment techniques to improve memory, including [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[stress management]], [[cognitive therapy]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical medications]].  [[Neuroimaging]] as well as [[cognitive neuroscience]] have provided [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] evidence supporting [[Holism|holistic]] ways in which one can improve memory.

==Memory function factors==

=== Neuro plasticity===
[[Neuroplasticity]] is the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience, learns new behaviours and relearns lost behaviour if the brain has been damaged.&lt;ref name="Kleim"&gt;Kleim, JA., &amp; Jones, TA. (2008). [http://www.bridgesnky.org/uploads/2016_Experience-Dependent_Neuroplasticity.pdf Principles of experience-dependent neural plasticity: implications for rehabilitation after brain damage]. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 51, S225-S239.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hackney carriage.jpg|thumb|London Taxicab]]Experience-dependent neuroplasticity suggests that the brain changes in response to what it experiences. [[London]] [[taxicab]] drivers provide a great example of this dynamic. They undergo extensive training for 2–4 years, learning and memorizing street names, layout of streets within the city and the quickest cross-city routes.  After studying London taxicab drivers over a period of time, it was found that the [[grey matter]] volume increased over time in the posterior [[hippocampus]], an area in the brain involved heavily in memory. The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.  This suggests a correlation between a healthy person's mental training or exercise and their brains capacity to manage greater volume and more complex information. It should be noted, however, that the increase in volume actually led to a ''decrease'' in the taxi drivers' ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information.&lt;ref name="Maguire"&gt;Maguire, EA., Woollett, K., &amp; Spiers, HJ. (2006). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugo_Spiers/publication/6769737_London_Taxi_Drivers_and_Bus_Drivers_A_Structural_MRI_and_Neuropsychological_Analysis/links/09e41508a947d83c7a000000.pdf London taxi drivers and bus drivers]: a structural MRI and neuropsychological analysis. ''Hippocampus'', 16, 1091-1101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===
Research has found that chronic and acute stress have adverse effects on memory processing systems. Therefore, it is important to find mechanisms in which one can reduce the amount of stress in their lives when seeking to improve memory.

* '''[[Chronic stress]]''' has been shown to have negative impacts on the brain, especially in [[Memory#Processes|memory processing]] systems.&lt;ref name="Mizoguchi"&gt;Mizoguchi, K., Mitsutoshi, Y., Ishige, A., et al. (2000). [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/20/4/1568.long Chronic Stress Induces Impairment of Spatial Working Memory Because of Prefrontal Dopaminergic Dysfunction]. The Journal of Neuroscience Vol 20(4) 1568-1574.&lt;/ref&gt; The hippocampus is vulnerable to repeated stress due to adrenal steroid stress hormones.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, L. &amp; Sapolsky, R.M.

==Strategies==

===Cognitive training===
Discovering that the brain can change as a result of experience has resulted in the development of [[Brain fitness|cognitive training]]. Cognitive training improves cognitive functioning, which can increase [[working memory]] capacity and improve [[Cognition|cognitive skills]] and functions in clinical populations with [[working memory]] deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Morrison, AB., &amp; Chein, JM. (2010). [http://www.highiqpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morrison_Chein2011.pdf Does working memory training work? the promise and challenges of enhancing cognition by training working memory]. Psychonomic Society, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cognitive training may focus on [[attention]], [[Mental chronometry|speed of processing]], [[neurofeedback]], [[Dual-task paradigm|dual-tasking]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] training.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

Cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive abilities for up to five years. In one experiment, the goal was to prove that cognitive training would increase the cognitive functions in older adults by using three types of training (memory, reasoning and speed of processing). It was found that improvements in cognitive ability not only was maintained over time but had a positive transfer effect on everyday functioning. Therefore, these results indicate that each type of cognitive training can produce immediate and lasting improvements in each kind of cognitive ability, thus suggesting that training can be beneficial to improving memory.&lt;ref name="Willis"&gt;Willis, SL., Tennstedt, SL., Marsiske, M., Ball, K., Elias, J., Koepke, KM., Morris, JN., Rebok, GW., Unverzagt, FW., Stoddard, AM., &amp; Wright, E. (2006). [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/204643 Long-term effects of cognitive training on everyday functional outcomes in older adults]. National Institutes of Health, 296(23), 2805-2814.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive training in areas other than memory has actually been seen to generalize and transfer to memory systems. For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4169294/ A Cognitive Training Program Based on Principles of Brain Plasticity: Results from the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) Study].  The American Geriatrics Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]
Two cognitive training methods are:

* '''Strategy training''' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;
* '''Core training''' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

The manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

The Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated. The system was created by Dr Peter Marshall for research purposes at Royal Holloway, University of London. The system involves 5 groups of 5 tactics designed to maximise storage and recall at each stage of the process of registering, short-term storage, long-term storage, consolidation and retrieval and was designed to test efficacy of including memory training in school curricula.  Each section is of equal text length so that it can be taught verbatim in the same amount of time by all competent teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall,P(2012) Improving Your Memory: The Unique 5 x 5 System, Bexley-on-Sea: Oakley Books {{ISBN|978-0-9569784-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopharmacology===
[[Psychopharmacology]] is the scientific study of the actions of drugs and their effects on [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[Sense|sensation]], [[thought]], and [[behavior]].

Evidence that aspects of memory can be improved by action on selective neurotransmitter systems, such as the [[cholinergic|cholinergic system]] which releases acetylcholine, has possible therapeutic benefits for patients with cognitive disorders.&lt;ref name="Robbins2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robbins|first1=T. W.|title=NEUROSCIENCE: Boosting Working Memory|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5500|year=2000|pages=2275–2276|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.290.5500.2275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from studies have indicated that acute administration of [[nicotine]] can improve cognitive performance (particularly tasks that require attention), short-term [[episodic memory]] and [[prospective memory]] task performance.  Chronic usage of low-dose nicotine in animals has been found to increase the number of [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] (nAChRs) and improve performance on learning and memory tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heishman | first1 = S.

Short-term nicotine treatment, utilising nicotine skin patches, have shown that it may be possible to improve cognitive performance in a variety of groups such as normal non-smoking adults, Alzheimer's disease patients, [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenics]], and adults with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Swan, G. E., &amp; Lessov-Schlaggar, C. N. (2007). The effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine on cognition and the brain. Neuropsychol Rev, 17:259–273.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, evidence suggests that smoking improves visuospatial working memory impairments in schizophrenic patients, possible explaining the high rate of tobacco smoking found in people with schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, K.

===Diet===
[[File:Milch-Jogurt-Früchte.jpg|thumb|Healthy fruits and vegetables]]

There is some evidence glucose consumption may have a positive impact on memory performance, though not in young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Korol DL |title=Enhancing cognitive function across the life span |journal=Ann.

===Stress management===
[[File:Trataka.JPG|thumb|150px|Meditation:attending to a flame]]
[[Meditation]], a form of mental training to focus attention,&lt;ref name="Slagter"/&gt; has been shown to increase the control over brain resource distribution, improving both [[attention]] and [[self control|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt; The changes are potentially long-lasting as meditation may have the ability to strengthen neuronal circuits as selective attentional processes improve.&lt;ref name="Xiong"&gt;Xiong, G.L. and Doraiswamy, M.

Vol 1172, pages 63-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meditation may also enhance [[LC4MP|cognitive limited capacity]], affecting the way in which stimuli are processed.&lt;ref name="Slagter"/&gt;

Meditation practice has also been associated with physical changes in brain structure. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of Buddhist insight meditation practitioners who practiced [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] meditation were found to have an increase in cortical thickness  and hippocampus volume compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Luders, E., Toga, A.W., Lepore, N., Gaser, C.

===Exercise===
{{main|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Long-term effects}}
In both human and animal studies, [[Physical exercise|exercise]] has been shown to improve cognitive performance on encoding and retrieval tasks. [[Morris water navigation task|Morris water maze]] and radial arm water maze studies of [[rodent]]s found that, when compared to [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] animals, exercised mice showed improved performance traversing the water maze and displayed enhanced memory for the location of an escape platform.&lt;ref name="Berchtold"&gt;Berchtold, N.

''Neuroscience'' 167, 588–597.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, human studies have shown that cognitive performance is improved due to [[Human physiology|physiological]] arousal, which speeded mental processes and enhanced memory storage and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, K., &amp; Tomporowski, P.

''Med. Sci. Sports Exerc.'' 37, 1967–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise has been found to positively regulate [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] [[neurogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;van Praag H, Kempermann G, Gage FH. 1999b. [http://www.rg-40.com/Running_Increases.htm Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus]. Nat Neurosci 2:266–270.&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered an explanation for the positive influence of physical activities on memory performance. Hippocampus-dependent learning, for example, can promote the survival of newborn neurons which may serve as a foundation for the formation of new memories.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Borght, K., Havekes, R., Bos, T., Eggen, B. J., &amp; Van der Zee, E. A. (2007).

''Behavioral Neuroscience'', 121 (2), 324–334.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exercise has been found to increase the level of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) protein in rats, with elevated BDNF levels corresponding with strengthened performance on memory tasks. Data also suggests that BDNF availability at the beginning of [[cognitive test]]ing is related to the overall acquisition of a new cognitive task and may be important in determining the strength of recall in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Berchtold"/&gt;

===Mental exercise===
[[Aristotle]] wrote a [[treatise]] about memory: ''[[On memory|De memoria et reminiscentia]]''.  To improve recollection, he advised that a systematic search should be made and that practice was helpful.  He suggested grouping the items to be remembered in threes and then concentrating upon the central member of each triad (group of three).&lt;ref name=Anne&gt;{{citation |title=Memory |author=Anne Whitehead |chapter=Memory and Inscription |pages=15–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music playing has recently gained attention as a possible way to promote brain plasticity. Promising results have been found suggesting that learning music can improve various aspects of memory. For instance, children who participated in one year of instrumental musical training showed improved verbal memory, whereas no such improvement was shown in children who discontinued musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, C. Y., &amp; Schlaug, G. (2010). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/?c=029 Music making as a tool for promoting brain plasticity across the life span].

[[Image:Black Brant.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant 12]] multistage [[sounding rocket]]]]
[[Image:minuteman 3 stage2.jpg|thumb|right|The second stage of a [[Minuteman&amp;nbsp;III]] rocket]]
A '''multistage rocket''', or '''step rocket''' is a [[launch vehicle]] that uses
two or more [[rocket]] ''stages'', each of which contains its own [[Rocket engine|engines]] and [[Rocket propellant|propellant]]. A ''tandem'' or ''serial'' stage is mounted on top of another stage; a ''parallel'' stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two-stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched.
By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is decreased. Each successive stage can also be optimized for its specific operating conditions, such as decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This ''staging'' allows the thrust of the remaining stages to [[Newton's First Law of Motion|more easily accelerate the rocket]] to its final speed and height. 

In serial or tandem staging schemes, the '''first stage''' is at the bottom and is usually the largest, the '''second stage''' and subsequent '''upper stages''' are above it, usually decreasing in size. In parallel staging schemes [[Solid rocket booster|solid]] or [[liquid rocket booster]]s are used to assist with launch. These are sometimes referred to as "stage 0". In the typical case, the first-stage and booster engines fire to propel the entire rocket upwards. When the boosters run out of fuel, they are detached from the rest of the rocket (usually with some kind of small [[explosive]] charge) and fall away. The first stage then burns to completion and falls off. This leaves a smaller rocket, with the second stage on the bottom, which then fires. Known in rocketry circles as '''staging''', this process is repeated until the desired final velocity is achieved. In some cases with serial staging, the upper stage ignites ''before'' the separation—the interstage ring is designed with this in mind, and the thrust is used to help positively separate the two vehicles.

==Performance==

[[File:Saturn V second stage.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of the second stage and how it fits into the complete rocket]]
The reason multi-stage rockets are required is the limitation the laws of physics place on the maximum velocity achievable by a rocket of given fueled-to-dry mass ratio. This relation is given by the [[classical rocket equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v_\text{e} \ln \left(\frac {m_0} {m_f}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v\ &lt;/math&gt; is [[delta-v ]] of the vehicle (change of velocity plus losses due to gravity and atmospheric drag);
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial total (wet) mass, equal to final (dry) mass plus [[propellant]]; 
:&lt;math&gt;m_f&lt;/math&gt; is the final (dry) mass, after the propellant is expended; 
:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective exhaust velocity (determined by propellant, [[engine]] design and throttle condition);
:&lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural logarithm]] function.

The delta v required to reach [[low Earth orbit]] (or the required velocity of a sufficiently heavy suborbital payload) requires a wet to dry mass ratio larger than can realistically be achieved in a single rocket stage. The multistage rocket overcomes this limit by splitting the delta-v into fractions. As each lower stage drops off and the succeeding stage fires, the rest of the rocket is still traveling near the burnout speed. Each lower stage's dry mass includes the propellant in the upper stages, and each succeeding upper stage has reduced its dry mass by discarding the useless dry mass of the spent lower stages.

A further advantage is that each stage can use a different type of rocket engine, each tuned for its particular operating conditions. Thus the lower-stage engines are designed for use at atmospheric pressure, while the upper stages can use engines suited to near vacuum conditions. Lower stages tend to require more structure than upper as they need to bear their own weight plus that of the stages above them. Optimizing the structure of each stage decreases the weight of the total vehicle and provides further advantage.

The advantage of staging comes at the cost of the lower stages lifting engines which are not yet being used, as well as making the entire rocket more complex and harder to build than a single stage. In addition, each staging event is a possible point of launch failure, due to separation failure, ignition failure, or stage collision. Nevertheless, the savings are so great that every rocket ever used to deliver a payload into [[orbit]] has had staging of some sort.

One of the most common measures of rocket efficiency is its specific impulse, which is defined as the thrust per flow rate (per second) of propellant consumption:&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Curtis, Howard. "Rocket Vehicle Dynamics." [[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]]. 2nd ed. Daytona Beach: Elsevier, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{sp} &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\ T/m_\mathrm{e}g_\mathrm{0} &lt;/math&gt;

When rearranging the equation such that thrust is calculated as a result of the other factors, we have:

&lt;math&gt; T = -I_\mathrm{sp}g_\mathrm{0} \times \frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations show that a higher specific impulse means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning for longer periods of time.  In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower specific impulse rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes.  Later stages of the rocket usually have a higher specific impulse rating because the vehicle is further outside the atmosphere and the exhaust gas does not need to expand against as much atmospheric pressure.

When selecting the ideal rocket engine to use as an initial stage for a launch vehicle, a useful performance metric to examine is the thrust-to-weight ratio, and is calculated by the equation

&lt;math&gt; TWR = \frac{T}{mg_\mathrm{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

The common thrust-to-weight ratio of a launch vehicle is within the range of 1.3 to 2.0.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;
Another performance metric to keep in mind when designing each rocket stage in a mission is the burn time, which is the amount of time the rocket engine will last before it has exhausted all of its propellant.  For most non-final stages, thrust and specific impulse can be assumed constant, which allows the equation for burn time to be written as

∆t = &lt;math&gt; \frac{I_\mathrm{sp}g_\mathrm{0}}{T} \times (m_\mathrm{0} - m_\mathrm{f}) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{f}&lt;/math&gt; are the initial and final masses of the rocket stage respectively.  In conjunction with the burnout time, the burnout height and velocity are obtained using the same values, and are found by these two equations

&lt;math&gt; h_\mathrm{bo} = \frac{I_\mathrm{sp}g_\mathrm{0}}{m_\mathrm{e}} \times ( m_\mathrm{f} ~ \mathrm{ln} (m_\mathrm{f}/m_\mathrm{0}) + m_\mathrm{0} - m_\mathrm{f}) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm{bo} = \frac{I_\mathrm{sp} g_\mathrm{0} m_\mathrm{0}} {m_\mathrm{f}} - \frac{g_\mathrm{0}}{m_\mathrm{e}} (m_\mathrm{0} - m_\mathrm{f})&lt;/math&gt;

When dealing with the problem of calculating the total burnout velocity or time for the entire rocket system, the general procedure for doing so is as follows:&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

1.  Partition the problem calculations into however many stages the rocket system comprises.

2.  Calculate the initial and final mass for each individual stage.

3.  Calculate the burnout velocity, and sum it with the initial velocity for each individual stage.  Assuming each stage occurs immediately after the previous, the burnout velocity becomes the initial velocity for the following stage.

4.  Repeat the previous two steps until the burnout time and/or velocity has been calculated for the final stage.
It is important to note that the burnout time does not define the end of the rocket stage's motion, as the vehicle will still have a velocity that will allow it to coast upward for a brief amount of time until the acceleration of the planet's gravity gradually changes it to a downward direction.  The velocity and altitude of the rocket after burnout can be easily modeled using the basic physics equations of motion.

When comparing one rocket with another, it is impractical to directly compare the rocket's certain trait with the same trait of another because their individual attributes are often not independent of one another.  For this reason, dimensionless ratios have been designed to enable a more meaningful comparison between rockets.  The first is the initial to final mass ratio, which is the ratio between the rocket stage's full initial mass and the rocket stage's final mass once all of its fuel has been consumed.  The equation for this ratio is

&lt;math&gt; \eta = \frac{m_\mathrm{E} + m_\mathrm{p} + m_\mathrm{PL}}{m_\mathrm{E} + m_\mathrm{PL}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{E} &lt;/math&gt; is the empty mass of the stage, &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{p} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the propellant, and &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{PL} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the payload.&lt;ref name="navid"&gt;[Nakhjiri, Navid, Ph.D, 2014.  Presented at Calpoly Astronautics Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  
The second dimensionless performance quantity is the structural ratio, which is the ratio between the empty mass of the stage, and the combined empty mass and propellant mass as shown in this equation&lt;ref name="navid" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \epsilon = \frac{m_\mathrm{E}}{m_\mathrm{E}+m_\mathrm{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

The last major dimensionless performance quantity is the payload ratio, which is the ratio between the payload mass and the combined mass of the empty rocket stage and the propellant.

&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{m_\mathrm{PL}}{m_\mathrm{E} + m_\mathrm{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

After comparing the three equations for the dimensionless quantities,  it is easy to see that they are not independent of each other, and in fact, the initial to final mass ratio can be rewritten in terms of structural ratio and payload ratio&lt;ref name="navid" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \eta = \frac{1 + \lambda}{\epsilon + \lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

These performance ratios can also be used as references for how efficient a rocket system will be when performing optimizations and comparing varying configurations for a mission.

==Component selection and sizing==
[[File:Apollo_11_Launch2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Saturn V]] multistage rocket carrying [[Apollo 11]] lifts off, seen from the [[Service structure|launch tower]] camera. The Saturn V's [[S-IC]] stage was designed to carry the rocket through the first 61 kilometres of ascent. Also visible is the [[launch escape system]], a single-stage solid fuel rocket designed for the crew to escape the Saturn V in the event of an impending [[catastrophic failure]].]]
For initial sizing, the rocket equations can be used to derive the amount of propellant needed for the rocket based on the specific impulse of the engine and the total impulse required in N*s.  The equation is

&lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{p} = I_\mathrm{tot} / (g*I_\mathrm{sp} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where g is the gravity constant of the planet (which is Earth in most cases).&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;  This also enables the volume of storage required for the fuel to be calculated if the density of the fuel is known, which is almost always the case when designing the rocket stage.  The volume is yielded when dividing the mass of the propellant by its density.  Asides from the fuel required, the mass of the rocket structure itself must also be determined, which requires taking into account the mass of the required thrusters, electronics, instruments, power equipment, etc.&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt; These are known quantities for typical off the shelf hardware that should be considered in the mid to late stages of the design, but for preliminary and conceptual design, a simpler approach can be taken.  Assuming one engine for a rocket stage provides all of the total impulse for that particular segment, a mass fraction can be used to determine the mass of the system.  The mass of the stage transfer hardware such as initiators and safe-and-arm devices are very small by comparison and can be considered negligible.  
For modern day solid rocket motors, it is a safe and reasonable assumption to say that 91 to 94 percent of the total mass is fuel.&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;  It is also important to note there is a small percentage of "residual" propellant that will be left stuck and unusable inside the tank, and should also be taken into consideration when determining amount of fuel for the rocket.  A common initial estimate for this residual propellant is five percent.  With this ratio and the mass of the propellant calculated, the mass of the empty rocket weight can be determined.  
Sizing rockets using a liquid bipropellant requires a slightly more involved approach because of the fact that there are two separate tanks that are required:  One for the fuel, and one for the oxidizer.  The ratio of these two quantities is known as the mixture ratio, and is defined by the equation

O/F  = &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{ox}/m_\mathrm{fuel} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{ox} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the oxidizer and &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{fuel} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the fuel.  This mixture ratio not only governs the size of each tank, but also the specific impulse of the rocket.  Determining the ideal mixture ratio is a balance of compromises between various aspects of the rocket being designed, and can vary depending on the type of fuel and oxidizer combination being used.  For example, a mixture ratio of a bipropellant could be adjusted such that it may not have the optimal specific impulse, but will result in fuel tanks of equal size.  This would yield simpler and cheaper manufacturing, packing, configuring, and integrating of the fuel systems with the rest of the rocket,&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt; and can become a benefit that could outweigh the drawbacks of a less efficient specific impulse rating.  But suppose the defining constraint for the launch system is volume, and a low density fuel is required such as hydrogen.  This example would be solved by using an oxidizer-rich mixture ratio, reducing efficiency and specific impulse rating, but will meet a smaller tank volume requirement.

==Optimal staging and restricted staging==

===Optimal===

The ultimate goal of optimal staging is to maximize the payload ratio (see ratios under performance), meaning the largest amount of payload is carried up to the required burnout velocity using the least amount of non-payload mass, which comprises everything else.  Here are a few quick rules and guidelines to follow in order to reach optimal staging:&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

1.  Initial stages should have lower Isp, and later/final stages should have higher Isp. &lt;br /&gt;
2.  The stages with the lower Isp should contribute more ΔV. &lt;br /&gt;
3.  The next stage is always a smaller size than the previous stage. &lt;br /&gt;
4.  Similar stages should provide similar ΔV. &lt;br /&gt;
The Payload ratio can be calculated for each individual stage, and when multiplied together in sequence, will yield the overall payload ratio of the entire system.  It is important to note that when computing payload ratio for individual stages, the payload includes the mass of all the stages after the current one.  The overall payload ratio is

λ = &lt;math&gt; \prod_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; λi

Where n is the number of stages the rocket system comprises.  Similar stages yielding the same payload ratio simplify this equation, however that is seldom the ideal solution for maximizing payload ratio, and ΔV requirements may have to be partitioned unevenly as suggested in guideline tips 1 and 2 from above.  Two common methods of determining this perfect ΔV partition between stages are either a technical algorithm that generates an analytical solution that can be implemented by a program, or simple trial and error.&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;  For the trial and error approach, it is best to begin with the final stage, calculating the initial mass which becomes the payload for the previous stage.  From there it is easy to progress all the way down to the initial stage in the same manner, sizing all the stages of the rocket system.

===Restricted===

Restricted rocket staging is based on the simplified assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, structural ratio, and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage.  Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage.  This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design.  
One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system.  Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages.  However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment.  The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number.&lt;ref name="navid" /&gt;  In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.

==Tandem vs parallel staging design==
A rocket system that implements tandem staging means that each individual stage runs in order one after the other.  The rocket breaks free from the previous stage, then begins burning through the next stage in straight succession.  On the other hand, a rocket that implements parallel staging has two or more different stages that are active at the same time.  For example, the space shuttle rocket has two side boosters that burn simultaneously.  Upon launch, the boosters ignite, and at the end of the stage, the two boosters are discarded while the main rocket tank is kept for another stage.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;  
Most quantitative approaches to the design of the rocket system's performance are focused on tandem staging, but the approach can be easily modified to include parallel staging.  To begin with, the different stages of the rocket should be clearly defined.  Continuing with the previous example, the end of the first stage which is sometimes referred to as 'stage 0', can be defined as when the side boosters separate from the main rocket.  From there, the final mass of stage one can be considered the sum of the empty mass of stage one, the mass of stage two (the main rocket and the remaining unburned fuel) and the mass of the payload.

==Upper stages==
An upper stage is designed to operate at high altitude, with little or no atmospheric pressure. This allows the use of lower pressure [[combustion chamber]]s and engine nozzles with optimal [[Rocket engine nozzle#Aerostatic back-pressure and optimum expansion|vacuum expansion ratios]]. Some upper stages, especially those using [[hypergolic]] propellants like [[Delta-K]] or [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5 ES]] second stage, are [[Pressure-fed engine|pressure fed]] which eliminates the need for complex turbomachinery. Other upper stages, such as the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] or [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage|DCSS]], use liquid hydrogen [[expander cycle]] engines, or [[Gas-generator cycle|gas generator]] cycle engines like the Ariane 5 ECA's [[HM7B]] or the [[S-IVB]]'s [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]]. These stages are usually tasked with completing orbital injection and accelerating payloads into higher energy orbits such as [[Geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]] or onto escape velocity. Upper stages such as [[Fregat]] used primarily to bring payloads from low Earth orbit to GTO or beyond are sometimes referred to as [[space tug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.russianspaceweb.com/fregat.html|title = Fregat|date = |accessdate = July 25, 2014|website = RussianSpaceWeb.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assembly ==

Each individual stage is generally assembled at its manufacturing site and shipped to the launch site; the term ''vehicle assembly'' refers to the mating of all rocket stage(s) and the spacecraft payload into a single assembly known as a [[space vehicle]]. Single-stage vehicles ([[suborbital flight|suborbital]]), and multistage vehicles on the smaller end of the size range, can usually be assembled directly on the launch pad by lifting the stage(s) and spacecraft vertically in place by means of a crane.

This is generally not practical for larger space vehicles, which are assembled off the pad and moved into place on the launch site by various methods. NASA's [[Apollo program|Apollo]]/[[Saturn V]] manned Moon landing vehicle, and  [[Space Shuttle]], were assembled vertically onto [[mobile launcher platform]]s with attached launch umbillical towers, in a [[Vehicle Assembly Building]], and then a special [[crawler-transporter]] moved the entire vehicle stack to the launch pad in an upright position. 
In contrast, vehicles such as the Russian [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] and the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] are assembled horizontally in a processing hangar, transported horizontally, and then brought upright at the pad.

==Passivation and space debris==
Spent upper stages of launch vehicles are a significant source of [[space debris]] [[:Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth|remaining in orbit in a non-operational state]] for many years after use, and occasionally, large debris fields created from the breakup of a single upper stage while in orbit.&lt;ref name=loftus1989/&gt;

After the 1990s, spent upper stages are generally [[Passivation (spacecraft)|passivated]] after their use as a launch vehicle is complete in order to minimize risks while the stage [[:Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth|remains derelict in orbit]].&lt;ref name=ss20111205&gt;
{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Nicholas |title=Space debris issues |date=2011-12-05 |url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1666 |work=audio file, @1:03:05-1:06:20 |publisher=The Space Show |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127055806/http://thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1666 |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Passivation means removing any sources of stored energy remaining on the vehicle, as by dumping fuel or discharging batteries.

Many early upper stages, in both the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] space programs, were not passivated after mission completion.  During the initial attempts to characterize the space debris problem, it became evident that a good proportion of all [[Space debris#Boosters|debris]] was due to the breaking up of rocket upper stages, particularly [[Passivation (spacecraft)|unpassivated]] upper-stage propulsion units.&lt;ref name=loftus1989&gt;

==History and development==
An illustration and description in the 14th century [[History of China|Chinese]] ''[[Huolongjing]]'' by [[Jiao Yu]] shows the oldest known multistage rocket; this was the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (火龙出水, huǒ lóng chū shuǐ), used mostly by the Chinese navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csonline.com.cn/zt/ztchangsha/ht/htz_2/t20031226_84913.htm|title=火龙出水（明）简介|publisher=星辰在线|date=2003-12-26|accessdate=July 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303144715/http://www.csonline.com.cn/zt/ztchangsha/ht/htz_2/t20031226_84913.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a two-stage rocket that had [[booster rocket]]s that would eventually burn out, yet before they did they automatically ignited a number of smaller rocket arrows that were shot out of the front end of the missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"/&gt; This multi-stage rocket may be considered the ancestor to the modern [[C-602|YingJi-62]] [[Anti-ship missile|ASCM]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shizheng.daqi.com/editor/slide/focus_huandeng/1635618/18.html#t|title=中国YJ-62新型远程反舰导弹|publisher=大旗网|date=2007-09-30|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]] points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the ''Huolongjing'', which can be dated roughly 1300–1350 AD (from the book's part 1, chapter 3, page 23).&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"/&gt;

Another example of an early multistaged rocket is the ''Juhwa (走火)'' of Korean development. It was proposed by medieval Korean engineer, scientist and inventor [[Choe Museon]] and developed by the Firearms Bureau (火㷁道監) during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ko:주화 (무기)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:ko:화통도감]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rocket had the length of 15&amp;nbsp;cm and 13&amp;nbsp;cm; the diameter was 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm. It was attached to an arrow 110&amp;nbsp;cm long; experimental records show that the first results were around 200m in range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=1608&amp;docId=550070&amp;mobile&amp;categoryId=1608|title =주화 (走火)|publisher= 한국민족문화대백과|date=1999-09-25|accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are records that show Korea kept developing this technology until it came to produce the [[Singijeon]], or 'magical machine arrows' in the 16th century. 
The earliest experiments with multistage rockets in Europe were made in 1551 by Austrian [[Conrad Haas]] (1509–1576), the arsenal master of the town of [[Hermannstadt]], [[Transylvania]] (now Sibiu/Hermannstadt, Romania). This concept was developed independently by at least four individuals:

The first high-speed multistage rockets were the [[RTV-G-4 Bumper]] rockets tested at the [[White Sands Proving Ground]] and later at [[Cape Canaveral]] from 1948 to 1950. These consisted of a V-2 rocket and a [[WAC Corporal]] sounding rocket. The greatest altitude ever reached was 393&amp;nbsp;km, attained on February 24, 1949, at White Sands.
[[File:Boosted Firework Rocket.png|thumb|upright|right|A primitive two-stage [[bottle rocket]] being launched, showing the rocket separating from a ground-mounted tube.]]
In 1947, the Soviet rocket engineer and scientist [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] developed a theory of parallel stages, which he called "packet rockets". In his scheme, three parallel stages were fired from [[takeoff|liftoff]], but all three engines were fueled from the outer two stages, until they are empty and could be ejected. This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second-stage engine is never just dead weight. In 1951, Soviet engineer and scientist [[Dmitry Okhotsimsky]] carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages. The design of the [[R-7 Semyorka]] emerged from that study.  The trio of rocket engines used in the first stage of the American [[Atlas I]] and [[Atlas II]] launch vehicles, arranged in a "row", used parallel staging in a similar way: the outer pair of engines existed as a jettisonable pair which would, after they shut down, drop away with the lowermost outer "skirt" structure, leaving the central "sustainer" engine to complete the first stage's engine burn towards apogee or orbit.

==Separation events==
Separation of each portion of a multistage rocket introduces additional [[risk]] into the success of the launch mission.  Reducing the number of separation events results in a reduction in [[complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falcon 1 – Stage Separation Reliability|url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#engine_reliability|publisher=[[SpaceX]]|accessdate=8 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430222417/http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#engine_reliability|archivedate=30 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Separation events occur when stages or strap-on boosters separate after use, when the [[payload fairing]] separates prior to orbital insertion, or when used, a [[launch escape system]]&lt;!-- this type of LES has been used, prior to the 2010s, only on some human-carrying missions.  in the 2010s multiple companies are designing pushier-type LES systems (e.g., [[Dragon V2]]) that do not require such a separation event; moreover, some will be available to be used even on cargo-transport missions, not merely human-passenger missions. --&gt; which separates after the early phase of a launch. [[Pyrotechnic fastener]]s or [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust#Vehicle description|pneumatic systems]] are typically used to separate rocket stages.

MusaNet is committed to overseeing the further development and monitoring of the implementation of The Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of ''Musa'' Genetic Resources (MusaNet 2016) &lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt; [https://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/global-strategy-for-the-conservation-and-use-of-musa-genetic-resources/ MusaNet 2016. Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of ''Musa'' Genetic Resources] | (B. Laliberté, compiler). Bioversity International, Montpellier, France&lt;/ref&gt; by meeting the following objectives:

*Ensure the secured conservation of the entire ''Musa'' [[genepool]] by assessing the diversity conserved and filling gaps in collections, with an emphasis on threatened material.
*Strengthen the capacity of partners for the cost-effective long-term conservation and management of [[germplasm]] collections and facilitate access to useful ''Musa'' genetic resources in improvement programmes and by other users.
*Enhance the value of ''Musa'' genetic resources for breeding, through effective collaborative characterization, evaluation and pre-breeding efforts.
*Raise awareness with key partners on the importance of ''Musa'' genetic resources conservation, documentation, exchange and sharing the benefits arising from their use. Set priorities for research, breeding, and use of ''Musa'' genetic resources, ensuring critical links with the four regional banana networks.

==Structure==

Members of MusaNet belong to one or more of the five thematic research groups focused on the following subjects: Diversity, Conservation, Evaluation, Genomics and Information. Each of these thematic groups has elected a Chair and Co-chair to represent the group at monthly Expert Committee meetings and has developed objectives and a workplan for the next 10 years. 

Also present in the Expert Committee are representatives of the four regional banana networks - [http://banana-networks.org/Bapnet/ BAPNET] (Asia and the Pacific), [http://banana-networks.org/barnesa/ BARNESA] (Eastern and Southern Africa), [http://banana-networks.org/innovate-plantain/ Innovate Plantain] (Western and Central Africa) and [http://banana-networks.org/musalac/ MUSALAC] (Latin America and the Caribbean), which geographically cover all the banana producing countries. A representative from the information platform [[ProMusa]] is also present at the meetings.

Part of the Diversity Thematic Group, the [https://sites.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/musanet/about-musanet/taxonomic-advisorary-group/ Taxonomic Advisory Group (TAG)] comprises 12 experts that work together on particular projects concerning banana taxonomy, such as developing morphological field descriptors and verifying the genetic integrity of banana germplasm.

==Membership==

Membership to MusaNet is based on individuals, not institutes, and is solicited by thematic group Chairs and Co-chairs. Members are active in banana genetic resources-related research with a commitment to fruitful collaboration and knowledge exchange.

==''Musa'' Collections==

There are more than 60 banana ''ex situ'' collections worldwide located mostly in banana producing countries. The majority of the collections are supported by national funding to conserve banana diversity and conduct related research. Detailed information of the collections can be found on the [https://www.musanet.org/ MusaNet] website.

==Activities==

Projects in MusaNet are developed within and among the five thematic groups. 

Some recent activities carried out by MusaNet members are:

The '''National Agricultural Technology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria}}), commonly known as '''INTA''', is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] federal [[extension agency]] in charge of the generation, adaptation and diffusion of technologies, knowledge and learning procedures for the [[agriculture]], forest and agro-industrial activities within an ecologically clean environment.

Even though the institute, created in 1956, depends on the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Food of the Ministry of Economy and Production, it has financial and operative autarkic autonomy given by law 25641/02 that provides the Institute with the 0.5% of the importations.

==Activities==

[[Image:Mesadalabmol1.jpg|thumb|240px|Molecular biology lab.]]
The INTA researches and produces information and technologies applied to processes and products, that are later forwarded to the producers. It works, for instance, in the genetic improvement and development of specific properties of diverse cereals, fruits, flowers, forest trees and vegetables, as well as the handling of cultivations and native forests.

Another important field is the sanity of the products; plagues control, weeds and diseases. It studies and researches the harvest, manipulation, packing, distribution and commercialisation of fruit and vegetables, as well as the handling and processing of meats and dairy products. 
The institute also observes market behaviours of internal and external consume, as well as the economical impact of the different applied technologies.

==Organization==
The INTA has a directive board composed of members of both the official and the private sector; they define the politics at national level. 
The national direction executes the planning of the board, assisted by the organization and administration technical areas.

Research and producers' capacitation takes place in 44 experimental agricultural stations and 240 extension units around the country.

The '''Natural Capital Initiative''' (NCI) is a partnership of UK organisations which promotes and supports decision-making across government, business and the private sector that results in the sustainable management of our [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=CEH&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural Capital Initiative|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/natural-capital-initiative|website=www.ceh.ac.uk|publisher=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2009, it is a partnership between two of the UK's learned societies and two of its scientific research institutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/public-policy/natural-capital-initiative/|publisher=British Ecological Society|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
*[[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]
*[[Royal Society of Biology]]
*[[British Ecological Society]]
*[[James Hutton Institute]].

==Aims==
Its stated mission is "to support decision-making that results in the sustainable management of our natural capital based on sound science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/about/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=National Capital Initiative|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide decision-makers from UK government, academia, business, and civil society with a high-level forum for cross-sectoral dialogue on how to realise the UK government's stated objective of embedding [[natural capital]] thinking in policy and practice, and it does this based upon sound evidence from across the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The four main objectives of the Natural Capital Initiative are to:

*Inform the Government's implementation of the [[Ecosystem Approach|ecosystems approach]] - a framework for looking at whole ecosystems in decision-making and valuing the services they provide.
*Identify gaps in science, policy and implementation that inhibit an ecosystems approach.
*Work with government, parliament, agencies, [[NGO]]s, the private sector, scientific bodies and the wider public.
*Inspire the next generation to engage in the sustainable use of the natural environment.

==History==
[[File:Natural Capital graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Natural Capital]] provides us with essential functions and [[ecosystem services]].The NCI supports the UK government and policy-makers in putting natural capital at the heart of economic decision-making.]]
The NCI was established in 2009 in response to the increasing global awareness of the need for more sustainable management of the world's limited natural resources,&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating human capital for the preservation of natural capital|url=http://consciouscomms.com/educating-human-capital-for-the-preservation-of-natural-capital/|website=consciouscomms.com|publisher=Conscious Communications|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted by the 2005 [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Milliennium Ecosystem Assessment|url=http://millenniumassessment.org/en/About.html|website=millenniumassessment.org|publisher=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in April 2009 at a three-day [[symposium]] held in London, entitled ''Valuing our Life Support Systems''. Its conclusions were published in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_full_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report Executive Summary|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_summary_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=Natural Capital Initiative|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEFRA&gt;{{cite web|title=What nature can do for you|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396840/pb13897-nature-do-for-you.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=DEFRA|accessdate=7 March 2016|page=23|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the James Hutton Institute announced it was joining the partnership.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite web|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=www.hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the NCI held a second major symposium/summit, entitled: ‘Valuing our Life Support Systems’ with the aim of pushing forward the shared natural capital agenda.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The Chair of the NCI (as at 2016) is Professor Alison Hester of the [[James Hutton Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Chair|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/secretariat/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Natural Capital Initiative has been recognised as one of the key groups or organisations in the UK now examining the main issues surrounding the depletion of natural resources and in encouraging the preservation of natural capital.&lt;ref name=Hutton/&gt; 

Its 2009 symposium recommendations are included in the UK government own recommendations and resource documents to senior policy-makers.&lt;ref name=DEFRA/&gt;

In recent years the NCI's support for the development of high-level policy based on sound science, and in line with an ecosystems approach to decision-making, has transferred into reality in a number of ways. In particular, the [[Natural Capital Committee]], supported by [[DEFRA]], evolved out of the UK Government's 2011 'Natural Environment White Paper', as did the 48 [[Local Nature Partnership]]s now established across England which focus on sustainable land management, greening economic growth and human health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

In 2014 the NCI called on the UK government to introduce a [[natural capital accounting]] element into its [[National accounts|national accounting framework]], and supported the Natural Capital Committee's own proposal for a 25-year Government plan for the UK Natural Environment, which is now under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative urges Government act now to reverse decline in natural capital|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/news/14-news/1122-natural-capital-initiative-urges-government-to-act-now-to-reverse-decline-in-natural-capital|website=www.rsb.org.uk|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government will produce a 25 year plan for the natural environment|url=http://esinternational.com/government-will-produce-a-25-year-plan-for-the-natural-environment/|website=esinternational.com|publisher=ESI|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the NCI published a symposium report, entitled 'Valuing our Life Support Systems', which was launched at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] event on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing our Life Support Systems Report Launch|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/valuing-our-life-support-systems-report-launch-/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was chaired by [[Barry Gardiner|Barry Gardiner MP]]. The report spelled out the need for a methodology to be established for valuing natural capital. It also raised concerns there was a danger that natural capital could be treated as a commodity unless an ethical framework was in place to ensure the process of natural capital valuation was applied fairly and evenly. It urged that all natural capital concepts needed to be clear, evidence-based and robust, and it welcomed the Government's proposal to extend the life of the Natural Capital Committee until at least the end of that current parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative: Valuing our Life Support Systems Report|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/Valuingourlifesupportsystemssummaryfinal.pdf|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Houses of Parliament|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|I love this report...I shall steal shamelessly [from it]...I thought the phrase "''The UK is a world leader in environmental science and in writing policy; it is not a world leader in taking subsequent action''" was just gorgeous; it should be written in capital letters over the entrance of [[DEFRA]]!...There has been avoidable failure by government.

      <comment>/* Density distribution */ Made sentence less ambiguous. Originally referred to total mass of the halo, when in fact they meant total mass within the virial radius.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">The '''Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile''' is a spatial mass distribution of [[dark matter]] fitted to dark matter halos identified in [[N-body]] simulations by [[Julio Navarro (astrophysicist)|Julio Navarro]], [[Carlos Frenk]] and [[Simon White]].&lt;ref name="NAVARROETAL1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Navarro, Julio F.|author2=Frenk, Carlos S.|author3=White, Simon D. M.|title=The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=462|pages=563|date=May 10, 1996|bibcode=1996ApJ...462..563N|doi=10.1086/177173|arxiv=astro-ph/9508025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFW profile is one of the most commonly used model profiles for dark matter halos.&lt;ref name="BERTONE2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bertone|first=Gianfranco|title=[[Particle Dark Matter|Particle Dark Matter: Observations, Models and Searches]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2010|pages=762|isbn=978-0-521-76368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Density distribution==

In the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho (r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1~+~\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the "scale radius", ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', are parameters which vary from halo to halo.

The integrated mass within some radius ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[
\ln\left(\frac{R_s+R_\max}{R_s}\right)-\frac{R_\max}{R_s+R_\max}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to be the [[Virial theorem#Galaxies and cosmology .28virial mass and radius.29|virial radius,]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;vir&lt;/sub&gt;, which is related to the "concentration parameter", ''c'', and scale radius via

: &lt;math&gt;
R_\mathrm{vir}=cR_s
&lt;/math&gt;

The virial radius is often referred to as &lt;math&gt; R_{200} &lt;/math&gt;, and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In this case, the total mass in the halo within &lt;math&gt; R_\mathrm{vir} &lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\mathrm{vir}} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[\ln(1+c) - \frac{c}{1+c}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''c'' is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40
for halos of various sizes.

The integral of the ''squared density'' is

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r)^2 \, dr=\frac{4\pi}{3} R_s^3 \rho_0^2
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

so that the mean squared density inside of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\max}=\frac{R_s^3\rho_0^2}{R_\max^3}
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

which for the virial radius simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\mathrm{vir}}=\frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
\left[1-\frac{1}{(1+c)^3}\right]
\approx \frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_s}=\frac{7}{8}\rho_0^2
&lt;/math&gt;

===Gravitational potential===
Solving Poisson's equation gives the gravitational potential
: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi(r) = - \frac{4\pi G \rho_0 R_s^3}{r} \ln \left( 1+ \frac{r}{R_s} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
with the limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to \infty} \Phi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to 0} \Phi=-4\pi G\rho_0 R_s^2&lt;/math&gt; .

===Radius of the maximum circular velocity===
The radius of the maximum circular velocity (confusingly sometimes also referred to as &lt;math&gt;R_\max&lt;/math&gt;) can be found from the maximum of &lt;math&gt;M(r)/r&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt;
R^\max_{\mathrm{circ}} = \alpha R_s
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx 2.16258&lt;/math&gt; is the positive root of 
: &lt;math&gt;
\ln \left( 1 + \alpha \right) =  \frac{\alpha (1+2\alpha)}{(1+\alpha)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dark matter simulations==
Over a broad range of halo mass and redshift, the NFW profile approximates the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration of dark matter halos produced in simulations of [[collision]]less dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y. P. Jing|title=The Density Profile of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 May 2000|volume=535|issue=1|pages=30–36|bibcode=2000ApJ...535...30J|doi=10.1086/308809|arxiv=astro-ph/9901340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the dark matter [[virial theorem|virializes]], the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos.

Alternative models, in particular the [[Einasto profile]], have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile by including an additional third parameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Merritt, David |author-link=David Merritt|display-authors=4|author2=Graham, Alister|author3=Moore, Benjamin|author4=Diemand, Jurg|author5=Terzić, Balsa|title=Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=20 December 2006|volume=132|issue=6|pages=2685–2700|doi=10.1086/508988|arxiv=astro-ph/0509417|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2685M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merritt|first1=David|authorlink1=David Merritt|display-authors=etal|title=A Universal Density Profile for Dark and Luminous Matter?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=May 2005|volume=624|issue=2|pages=L85–L88|doi=10.1086/430636|arxiv=astro-ph/0502515|bibcode=2005ApJ...624L..85M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.

Simulations assuming different cosmological initial conditions produce halo populations in which the two parameters of the NFW profile follow different mass-concentration relations, depending on cosmological properties such as the density of the universe and the nature of the very early process which created all structure. Observational measurements of this relation thus offer a route to constraining these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Navarro, Julio |author-link=Julio Navarro |author2=Frenk, Carlos |author3=White, Simon |title=A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=1 December 1997 |volume=490 |issue=2 |pages=493-508 |doi=10.1086/304888 |arxiv=astro-ph/9611107 |bibcode=1997ApJ...490..493N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations of halos==
The dark matter density profiles of massive galaxy clusters can be measured directly by gravitational lensing and agree well with the NFW profiles predicted for cosmologies with the parameters inferred from other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okabe|first1=Nobuhiro|display-authors=etal|title=LoCuSS: The Mass Density Profile of Massive Galaxy Clusters at z = 0.2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=June 2013|volume=769|pages=L35–L40|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1302.2728|bibcode=2013ApJ...769L..35O}}&lt;/ref&gt; For lower mass halos, gravitational lensing is too noisy to give useful results for individual objects, but accurate measurements can still be made by averaging the profiles of many similar systems. For the main body of the halos, the agreement with the predictions remains good down to halo masses as small as those of the halos surrounding isolated galaxies like our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Wenting|display-authors=etal|title=A weak gravitational lensing recalibration of the scaling relations linking the gas properties of dark haloes to their mass|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=March 2016|volume=456|pages=2301-2320|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2809/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1509.05784|bibcode=2016MNRAS.456.2301W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner regions of halos are beyond the reach of lensing measurements, however, and other techniques give results which disagree with NFW predictions for the dark matter distribution inside 
the visible galaxies which lie at halo centers.

Observations of the inner regions of bright galaxies like the [[Milky Way]] and [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] may be compatible with the NFW profile,&lt;ref name="KLYPIN2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klypin, Anatoly|author2=Zhao, HongSheng|author3=Somerville, Rachel S.|title=ΛCDM-based Models for the Milky Way and M31.

This is known as the cusp-core or [[cuspy halo problem]].
It is currently debated whether this discrepancy is a consequence of the nature of the dark matter, of the influence of dynamical processes during galaxy formation, or of shortcomings in dynamical modelling of the observational data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oman|first1=Kyle|display-authors=etal|title=The unexpected diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=October 2015|volume=452|pages=3650-3665|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1504|arxiv=1504.01437|bibcode=2015MNRAS.452.3650O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opus Anglicanum''' or '''English work''' is fine [[needlework]] of [[Medieval England]] done for ecclesiastical or secular use on [[clothing]], hangings or other [[textiles]], often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen grounds. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe, particularly from the late 12th to mid-14th centuries and was a luxury product often used for diplomatic gifts.

==Uses==
Most of the surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum were designed for liturgical use.  These exquisite and expensive [[embroidery]] pieces were often made as [[vestment]]s, such as [[cope]]s, [[chasuble]]s and [[orphrey]]s, or else as [[antependium|antependia]], shrine covers or other church furnishings. Secular examples, now known mostly just from contemporary inventories, included various types of garments, horse-trappings, book covers and decorative hangings.

==Manufacture==
Opus Anglicanum was usually [[embroidery|embroidered]] on [[linen]] or, later,  [[velvet]], in [[Backstitch|split stitch]] and [[couching (embroidery)|couching]] with [[silk]] and [[gold]] or [[goldwork (embroidery)|silver-gilt thread]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, S. M. and D. King, ''The Victoria and Albert Museum's Textile Collection Vol. 3: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750'', Victoria and Albert Museum, 1993, {{ISBN|1-85177-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold-wound thread, pearls and jewels are all mentioned in inventory descriptions.
Although often associated with nunneries, by the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reg. 1216–72), who purchased a number of items for use within his own court and for [[diplomatic gift|diplomatic gifting]], the bulk of production was in lay workshops, mainly centred on London. The names of various (male) embroiderers of the period appear in the [[Pipe Rolls|Westminster royal accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;Article: Opus Anglicanum, ''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Oxford, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

English needlework had become famous across Europe during the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period (though very few examples survive) and remained so throughout the Gothic era.  A Vatican inventory of 1295  lists over 113 pieces from England, more than from any other country;&lt;ref&gt;Remnant 1964:111; Bonnie Young, "Opus Anglicanum" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''29'''.7 (March 1971:291–298) p. 291; the article was occasioned by an exhibition at The Cloisters.&lt;/ref&gt; a request by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who had envied the gold-embroidered [[cope]]s and mitres of English priests, that Cistercian religious houses send more is reported  by the Benedictine [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] of [[St Albans]]: "This command of my Lord Pope did not displease the London merchants who traded in these embroideries and sold them at their own price."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Young 1971:291.&lt;/ref&gt; The high water mark of style and refinement is normally considered to have been reached in the work of the 13th and early 14th centuries. An influential exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from September–November 1963 displayed several examples of Opus Anglicanum from this period alongside contemporary works of wood and stone sculpture, metalwork and ivories.&lt;ref&gt;King, David (ed), ''Opus Anglicanum'' (exhibition catalogue), London, V&amp;A Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Survival rates for Opus Anglicanum are low (especially for secular works) as is clear from comparing the large number listed in contemporary inventories with the handful of examples still existing. Sometimes ecclesiastical garments were later modified for different uses, such as altar coverings or book covers. Others were buried with their owners, as with the vestments of the mid-13th century Bishops, [[Walter de Cantilupe]] and [[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]], fragments of which were recovered when their tombs in [[Worcester Cathedral]] were opened in the 18th century. The majority however were lost to neglect, destroyed by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] or else unpicked or burnt to recover the precious metals from the gold and silver threads.
Although fragmentary examples can be found in a number of museums, the most important specialised collections of Opus Anglicanum garments are at the [[Cloisters Museum]] in New York, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and in the Treasury of [[Sens Cathedral]].

Only a few [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] pieces have survived, including three pieces at [[Durham, England|Durham]] that had been placed in the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]], probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were however made in [[Winchester]] between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to a wall-painting fragment from Winchester, and an early example of [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|his Benedictional]], which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly fine example is ''The Adoration of the Magi'' [[chasuble]] from c.&amp;nbsp;1325 in red velvet embroidered in gold thread and pearls at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  It depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity]] scene with emphasis on decorative motifs, flowers, animals, birds, beasts, and angels.  [[The Butler-Bowden Cope]] at the Victoria and Albert Museum is another surviving example; the same collection has a late cope made for a set of vestments given by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">A '''rate ratio''' (sometimes called an '''incidence density ratio''') in [[epidemiology]], is a relative difference measure used to compare the [[incidence rate]]s of events occurring at any given point in time.  A common application for this measure in analytic epidemiologic studies is in the search for a causal association between a certain [[risk factor]] and an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellan|first=Steve|title=Study Design and Analysis in Epidemiology: Where does modeling fit?|url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/getzlab/people/Bellan%20-%20Study%20Design%20and%20Analysis%20in%20Epidemiology.ppt|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}}

A '''seat filler''' is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:

# a person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller [[audience]] and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house". &lt;br /&gt;Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
# a person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the [[Academy Awards]] in which many of the audience are either gaining awards, once they win the award the recipient needs to wait for an appropriate time to return to their seat, or because the member of the audience is involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots there are no empty seats.

==Benefits to the Shows==
* Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
* Higher concession sales 
* Fuller audience for a better show experience
* Marketing to a vocal audience
* Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales

==In popular culture==
*In the ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of his friends who works as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Summer of George]]", [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] works as a seat filler at the [[Tony Awards]].
*The plot of the 2004 movie ''[[The Seat Filler]]'' revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
*In the movie ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Call Girl (Family Guy)|Call Girl]]", [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] works as a seat filler for fetuses during [[ultrasounds]].
*In the [[87th Academy Awards]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]] mentions the seat fillers explaining its meaning and jokes with [[Steve Carell]] as if he were a seat filler.

The U.S. allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation, embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-national-automated-highway-system-that-almost-was-63027245/|title=The National Automated Highway System That Almost Was|last=Novak|first=Matt|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove {{convert|4,584|km}} across America in 1995, {{convert|4,501|km}} or 98% of it autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/slideshow/back_to_the_future_autonomous_driving_in_1995/|title=Back to the Future: Autonomous Driving in 1995 – Robotics Business Review|date=2015-04-03|work=Robotics Business Review|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navlab's record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an  Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over {{convert|5,472|km}} through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/delphi-autonomous-car-cross-country/|title=This Is Big: A Robo-Car Just Drove Across the Country|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the US states of [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Virginia]], and [[Michigan]], together with [[Washington, D.C.]], allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/article_b1168b67-3b2b-5274-8914-8a3304f2e417.html|title=Self-driving cars to be tested on Virginia highways|last=Ramsey|first=John|date=1 June 2015|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Audi stated that its latest [[Audi A8|A8]] would be automated at speeds of up to {{convert|60|km/h}} using its "Audi AI." The driver would not have to do safety checks such as frequently gripping the steering wheel.

==Definitions==

There is some inconsistency in terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.

Such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that "Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS at or above level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS)."

===Words definition and safety considerations===

Modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. Nonetheless, differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|driver assistance technologies]] on the other hand. According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44159581|title=Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?|first=Theo|last=Leggett|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word ''autonomous'' in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous, because car ads make motorists think 'autonomous' and 'autopilot' means a vehicle can drive itself, when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.

When some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are ''self-driving'', when they are only partly automated, drivers risk becoming excessively confident, leading to crashes, while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44439523|title=Insurers warning on 'autonomous' cars|first=Rory|last=Cellan-Jones|date=12 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autonomous vs. automated ===
''Autonomous'' means self-governing.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antsaklis|first1=Panos J.|last2=Passino|first2=Kevin M.|last3=Wang|first3=S.J.|year=1991|title=An Introduction to Autonomous Control Systems|url=http://neuron-ai.tuke.sk/hudecm/PDF_PAPERS/Intro-Aut-Control.pdf|journal=IEEE Control Systems|volume=11|issue=4|pages=5–13|doi=10.1109/37.88585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been ''automated'' (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.&lt;ref name="antsaklis1991introduction" /&gt;

One approach is to implement [[communication networks]] both in the immediate vicinity (for [[Collision avoidance system|collision avoidance]]) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.

Wood et al. (2012) wrote, "This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' " The term "autonomous" was chosen "because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver’s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts."&lt;ref name="Woodetal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=S. P.|last2=Chang|first2=J.|last3=Healy|first3=T.|last4=Wood|first4=J.|title=The potential regulatory challenges of increasingly autonomous motor vehicles.|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2734&amp;context=lawreview|journal=52nd Santa Clara Law Review|volume=4|issue=9|pages=1423–1502}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime.

Put in the words of one Nissan engineer, "A truly autonomous car would be one where you request it to take you to work and it decides to go to the beach instead."&lt;ref name="Autotrader"&gt;{{cite |title=Automated vs. Autonomous Vehicles: Is There a Difference? |url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/automated-vs-autonomous-vehicles-there-difference-273139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EuroNCAP defines autonomous in "Autonomous Emergency Braking" as: "the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident." which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/vehicle-safety/the-rewards-explained/autonomous-emergency-braking/|title=Autonomous Emergency Braking – Euro NCAP|website=www.euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous versus cooperative===

To make a car travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some system makers used a remote driver.

But according to SAE J3016, {{quote|Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.}}

===Self-driving car===

Techemergence says. {{quote|“Self-driving” is a rather vague term with a vague meaning|Techemergence&lt;ref name="techemergence"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techemergence.com/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/|title=The Self-Driving Car Timeline – Predictions from the Top 11 Global Automakers|date=29 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

PC mag definition is: {{quote|A computer-controlled car that drives itself.

NHTSA definition is: {{quote|These self-driving vehicles ultimately will integrate onto U.S. roadways by progressing through six levels of driver assistance technology advancements in the coming years.

NHTSA definition is: {{quote|Let’s be clear: fully automated or “self-driving” vehicles aren’t arriving in showrooms tomorrow; they’re likely years, maybe even decades, away.

According to Techemergence {{quote|This means the vehicle can safely drive itself under specific conditions but the driver will need to quickly intervene when called on. This is a car that could drive itself on the highway while you watch a movie but would need you to take control when you get off the highway. Some may view this as only partially self-driving. |Techemergence,&lt;ref name="techemergence" /&gt; July 2018}}

According to Techemergence {{quote| it will be useful to understand that most executives referring to “self-driving” are referring to levels 3 and 4.|Techemergence,&lt;ref name="techemergence" /&gt; July 2018}}

=== Classification ===
[[File:Tesla Autopilot Engaged in Model X.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Tesla Autopilot system is considered to be an SAE level 2 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bgr.com/2016/07/21/tesla-autopilot-crash-avoidance-report/ |title=Tesla Autopilot Crash Avoidance Model S Autopilot saves man’s life |first=Zach |last=Epstein |work=BGR |date=21 July 2016 |access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A classification system based on six different levels (ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems) was published in 2014 by [[SAE International]], an automotive standardization body, as J3016, ''Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files/adaptive/content/downloads/Deliverables%20%26%20papers/AdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|title=AdaptIVe system classification and glossary on Automated driving|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007124740/https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/index.php/deliverables_papers.html?file=files%2Fadaptive%2Fcontent%2Fdownloads%2FDeliverables%20%26%20papers%2FAdaptIVe-SP2-v12-DL-D2.1%20System%20Classification.pdf|archive-date=7 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|title=AUTOMATED DRIVING LEVELS OF DRIVING AUTOMATION ARE DEFINED IN NEW SAE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD J3016|date= 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120142825/http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle capabilities, although these are very loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Releases+Policy+on+Automated+Vehicle+Development|title=U.S. Department of Transportation Releases Policy on Automated Vehicle Development|date=30 May 2013|work=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|access-date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.&lt;ref&gt;SAE International&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levels of driving automation ====
In SAE's automation level definitions, "driving mode" means "a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)"&lt;ref name="SAE_definitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903105244/https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 September 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 0: Automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.
* Level 1 ("hands on"): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are [[Adaptive Cruise Control]] (ACC), where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed; and [[Automatic Parking|Parking Assistance]], where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assistance]] (LKA) Type II is a further example of level 1 self-driving.
* Level 2 ("hands off"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and [[lane centering|steering]]). The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand "hands off" is not meant to be taken literally. In fact, contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene.
* Level 3 ("eyes off"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. As an example, the 2018 Audi A8 Luxury Sedan was the first commercial car to claim to be capable of level 3 self-driving. This particular car has a so-called Traffic Jam Pilot. When activated by the human driver, the car takes full control of all aspects of driving in slow-moving traffic at up to {{convert|60|km/h}}. The function works only on highways with a physical barrier separating one stream of traffic from oncoming traffic.
* Level 4 ("mind off"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas ([[Geo-fence|geofenced]]) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.
* Level 5 ("steering wheel optional"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi.

In the formal SAE definition below, note in particular what happens in the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3: the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment. This is the final aspect of the "dynamic driving task" that is now passed over from the human to the automated system. At SAE 3, the human driver still has the responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.

==Legal definition==
In the District of Columbia (DC) code, {{quote|“Autonomous vehicle” means a vehicle capable of navigating District roadways and interpreting traffic-control devices without a driver actively operating any of the vehicle’s control systems. The term “autonomous vehicle” excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver- assistance systems, including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, lane-departure warning, or traffic-jam and queuing assistance, unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator.}}

In the same district code, it is considered that:

{{quote|An autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway; provided, that the vehicle:
* (1) Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time;
* (2) Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment; and
* (3) Is capable of operating in compliance with the District’s applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices.}}

== Semi-automated vehicles ==
Between manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of [[Vehicular automation|automation]]. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure is developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.

== Nature of the digital technology ==
Autonomous vehicles, as a digital technology, have certain characteristics that distinguishes them from other types of technologies and vehicles. Due to these characteristics, autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects: homogenization and decoupling, connectivity, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Homogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also implies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Due to homogenization, the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way. This implies that all digital information comes in the same form, which means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard- and software (Moore's law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the  marginal costs.;

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even (other) enterprises. In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other ‘devices’ in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connects and manages each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for...|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655&amp;videoChannel=6|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.;

=== Reprogrammable and smart ===
Another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, cause through machine learning (smart) autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can be continuously be improved.;

=== Digital traces ===
Autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles’ driving ability or safety.

=== Modularity ===
Traditional vehicles and their accompanying (traditional) technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.

* (1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides the control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;
* (2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables computational power of a network or platform.;
* (3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and
* (4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos the autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content's origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).
The consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop a more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.}}

== Human factor challenges ==
Alongside the many technical challenges that autonomous cars face, there exist many human and social factors that may impede upon the wider uptake of the technology. As things become more automated, the human users need to have trust in the automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Trust in Automation – Before and After the Experience of Take-over Scenarios in a Highly Automated Vehicle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915008483|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=3025–3032|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.847|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be a challenge in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/08/survey-data-suggests-self-driving-cars-could-be-slow-to-gain-consumer-trust/|title=Survey Data Suggests Self-Driving Cars Could Be Slow To Gain Consumer Trust|work=GM Authority|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weather may also affect the car sensors, which may affect the auto driving mode. When heavy rainfall, heavy storms, heavy snowfall affect or damage the car sensors. Because of this, the performance of the car decreases gradually and the chance of accidents increases.

== Testing ==
Testing vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be done physically, in closed environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.umich.edu/|title=Mcity testing center|date=8 December 2016|work=University of Michigan|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads (where permitted, typically with a license or permit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing|title=Adopted Regulations for Testing of Autonomous Vehicles by Manufacturers|date=18 June 2016|work=DMV|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or adhering to a specific set of operating principles)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automated-vehicle-technologies-testing-code-of-practice|title=The Pathway to Driverless Cars: A Code of Practice for testing|date=19 July 2015|access-date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or virtually, i.e. in computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/index|title=Automobile simulation example|date=18 June 2018|work=Cyberbotics|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and "take over" when needed. For example, New York State has strict requirements for the test driver so that at all times the vehicle can be corrected by a licensed driver; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company's application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.&lt;ref&gt;https://dmv.ny.gov/dmv/apply-autonomous-vehicle-technology-demonstration-testing-permit&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple is currently testing self-driven cars, and has increased the number of test vehicles from 3 to 27 in January 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=Andrew|title=Apple increases self-driving test fleet from 3 to 27|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-increases-self-driving-test-fleet-from-3-to-27/|website=Roadshow|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 45 in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Zac|title=Apple ramping self-driving car testing, more CA permits than Tesla and Uber|url=https://electrek.co/2018/03/20/apple-autonomous-car-testing-progress/|website= [[Electrek]] |access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to assess the progress of automated vehicles is to compute the average distance driven between "disengagements", when the automated system is turned off, typically by a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over {{convert|352545|mi}} of testing, or {{convert|5596|mi}} on average, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled more distance in total than any other. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} was an improvement from 0.2 disengagements per {{convert|1000|mi}} in 2016 and 0.8 in 2015. In March, 2017, Uber reported an average of {{convert|0.67|mi}} per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, [[Cruise Automation]] (now owned by [[General Motors|GM]]) averaged {{convert|5224|mi}} per disruption over {{convert|62689|mi}}.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/03/uber-self-driving-system-was-still-400-times-worse-waymo-in-2018-on-key-distance-intervention-metric.html|title=Uber' self-driving system was still 400 times worse [than] Waymo in 2018 on key distance intervention metric|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=25 March 2018|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car "Robocar" completed 1.8 kilometers track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/07/16/first-self-driving-race-car-completes-1-8-kilometre-track|title=First self-driving race car completes 1.8 kilometre track|date=2018-07-16|work=euronews|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of application==
=== Automated trucks ===
Several companies are said to be testing automated technology in [[Semi-trailer truck|semi]] trucks. [[Otto (company)|Otto]], a self-driving trucking company that was acquired by Uber in August 2016, demonstrated their trucks on the highway before being acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/uber-acquires-otto-to-lead-ubers-self-driving-car-effort-report-says|title=Uber acquires Otto to lead Uber's self-driving car effort|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|first=Romain|last=Dillet|date=18 August 2016|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, San Francisco-based startup Embark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embarktrucks.com/|title=Embark – Self-Driving Semi Trucks|website=www.embarktrucks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced a partnership with truck manufacturer [[Peterbilt]] to test and deploy automated technology in Peterbilt's vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/self-driving-truck-startup-embark-raises-15m-partners-with-peterbilt/|title=Self-driving truck startup Embark raises $15M, partners with Peterbilt|first=Darrell|last=Etherington|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=18 July 2017|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waymo has also said to be testing automated technology in trucks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-waymo-selfdriving-truck/waymo-working-on-self-driving-trucks-idUSKBN18T04V|title=Waymo working on self-driving trucks|last=|first=|date=1 June 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no timeline has been given for the project.

In March 2018, [[Starsky Robotics]], the San Francisco-based automated truck company, completed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=mid}} fully driverless trip in Florida without a single human in the truck. Starsky Robotics became the first player in the self-driving truck game to drive in fully automated mode on a public road without a person in the cab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccjdigital.com/starsky-robotics-autonomous-run-without-driver/#|title=Truck completes fully automated route without driver in cab|website=www.ccjdigital.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, truck [[Platoon (automobile)|platooning]] is being considered with the [[Safe Road Trains for the Environment]] approach.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Lockheed Martin with funding from the U.S. Army developed an automated truck convoying system that uses a lead truck operated by a human driver with a number of trucks following autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/2012/10/lockheed-martin-wins-contract-to-develop-autonomous-operation-of-tactical-vehicles/|title=Lockheed Martin Wins Contract to Develop Autonomous Operation of Tactical Vehicles {{!}} Unmanned Systems Technology|date=2012-10-25|work=Unmanned Systems Technology|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed as part of the Army's Autonomous Mobility Applique System (AMAS), the system consists of an automated driving package that has been installed on more than nine types of vehicles and has completed more than 55,000 hours of driving at speeds up to {{convert|64|km/h}} as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.military.com/defensetech/2017/03/30/driverless-convoy-technology-fielded|title=Driverless Convoy Technology May Be Fielded Soon|date=2017-03-30|work=Military.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 the Army was planning to field 100–200 trucks as part of a rapid-fielding program.

=== Transport systems ===
In Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/brief/rcn/10263_en.html|title=Driverless cars take to the road|publisher=E.U.CORDIS Research Program CitynetMobil|access-date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131227/POLITICS02/312270067/1148/rss25|title=Snyder OKs self-driving vehicles on Michigan's roads|date=27 December 2013|publisher=Detroit News|access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28551069|title=BBC News – UK to allow driverless cars on public roads in January|work=BBC News|access-date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic.

In China, [[Baidu]] and [[King Long]] produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China. Those minibuses should be at level 4, that is driverless in closed roads.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Potential advantages ==

=== Safety ===
Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, [[traffic collision]]s (and [[Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions|resulting deaths and injuries]] and costs), caused by [[human error]], such as delayed [[Stopping sight distance|reaction time]], [[Tail gating|tailgating]], [[rubbernecking]], and other forms of [[Distracted driving|distracted]] or [[aggressive driving]] should be substantially reduced.&lt;ref name="morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theenergycollective.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitwam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/business/economy/29view.html|title=Can I See Your License, Registration and C.P.U.?|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|date=28 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] estimated that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could "eliminate 90% of all auto accidents in the United States, prevent up to {{USD|190 billion}} in damages and health-costs annually and save thousands of lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-cut-down-on-accidents-study-says-1425567905|title=Self-Driving Cars Could Cut Down on Accidents, Study Says|last=Ramsey|first=Mike|date=3 May 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to motorist website "TheDrive.com" operated by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact were able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrive.com/opinion/7324/the-way-we-talk-about-autonomy-is-a-lie-and-thats-dangerous|title=The Way We Talk About Autonomy Is a Lie, and That's Dangerous|first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey|website=www.thedrive.com|date=8 March 2017|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners.

One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (~8,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 445% from 2,200&amp;nbsp;pc/h per lane) traveling safely at {{Convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}} with a following gap of about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} of each other. Currently, at highway speeds drivers keep between {{convert|40|to|50|m|abbr=on|ft}} away from the car in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/intelligent-cars-could-boost-highway-capacity-by-273|title=Study: Intelligent Cars Could Boost Highway Capacity by 273%|last=Ackerman|first=Evan|date=4 September 2012|work=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE)|publisher=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for authorities to manage [[traffic flow]] would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability&lt;ref name="Gibson" /&gt; combined with less need for [[traffic police]] and even [[road signage]].

===Lower costs===
Safer driving is expected to reduce the costs of [[vehicle insurance]].&lt;ref name="Light" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_lwq3BfkY|title=Autonomous Intersection Management – FCFS policy with 6 lanes in all directions|date=12 June 2009|publisher=YouTube|access-date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will also translate into better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel efficiency]].&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/self-driving-cars-could-cut-greenhouse-gas-pollution/|title=Self-Driving Cars Could Cut Greenhouse Gas Pollution|last=Pyper|first=Julia|date=15 September 2015|work=[[Scientific American]]|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ensia.com/features/are-self-driving-vehicles-good-for-the-environment/|title=ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?|last=Wang|first=Ucilia|date=17 August 2015|publisher=Ensia|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed (energy typically lost due to friction, in the form of heat and sound).

=== Parking space ===
Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4–5% time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95–96% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/spaced-out-perspectives-on-parking|title=Spaced Out parking report|website=www.racfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html|title="Cars are parked 95% of the time".

By reducing the (labor and other) cost of [[Transportation as a Service|mobility as a service]], automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/03/04/mckinsey-self-driving-benefits/24382405/|title=McKinsey study: Self-driving cars yield big benefits|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|date=5 March 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kpmg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/self-driving-cars-next-revolution.pdf|title=Self-driving cars: The next revolution|date=5 September 2013|publisher=kpmg.com|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects. Assuming the increased efficiency is not fully offset by increases in demand, more efficient traffic flow could free roadway space for other uses such as better support for pedestrians and cyclists.

The vehicles' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behavior, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, this may also lead to much expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.

Quote: "Drivers' response to all critical events was found to be much later in the automated driving condition, compared to manual driving."&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.

Ethical and moral reasoning come into consideration when programming the software that decides what action the car takes in an unavoidable crash; whether the automated car will crash into a bus, potentially killing people inside; or swerve elsewhere, potentially killing its own passengers or nearby pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Self-driving cars programmed to decide who dies in a crash|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/23/self-driving-cars-programmed-decide-who-dies-crash/891493001/|website=USA Today|publisher=Detroit Free Press|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A question that programmers of AI systems find difficult to answer (as do ordinary people, and ethicists) is "what decision should the car make that causes the ‘smallest’ damage to people's lives?" One proposed solution is the implementation of ethics bots in self-driving vehicles, which learn from user preferences to ultimately guide autonomous instruments in accordance with the owner's values and preferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|last2=Etzioni|first2=Oren|title=Incorporating Ethics into Artificial Intelligence|journal=The Journal of Ethics|date=December 2017|volume=21|issue=4|page=403–418|doi=10.1007/s10892-017-9252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of automated vehicles are still being articulated, and may lead to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodall|first1=Noah|title=Can you program ethics into a self-driving car?|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=June 2016|pages=25–28|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7473149|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7473149|access-date=29 November 2017|volume=53|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also require closer consideration of the variability, context-dependency, complexity and non-deterministic nature of human ethics. Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving, such as avoiding harm to themselves, or putting themselves at risk to protect others. These decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence, to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents, road rage and stress.

Human thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash, think through the ethical implications of the available options, or take an action to implement an ethical choice. Whether a particular automated vehicle's capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk, analyse the options or choose a 'good' option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular human's may be difficult to predict or assess. This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario, sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future, and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence, may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple, plain English 'human values' logic of parsable rules. The depth of understanding, predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement, and even harder to test or assess.

The scale of this challenge may have other effects. There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it, as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle, and the legal and 'government affairs' capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents. This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system opertors, and eroding the presently quite diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers.

== Potential changes for different industries ==
The traditional automobile is subject to changes that on the one hand are technology pushed, and on the other hand are demanded by the market. 
Where in the first case the technological discontinuity is fueled by the breakthrough technological innovation described, the second case is driven by the extent to which the market is used to adopting new technologies faster. 
In both cases the end of the era of incremental change was recognized, which is graphically displayed at the point where the transition is made to a new technology above. This point causes new entrants to the automotive industry to present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and nVidia. 
As new entrants to the industry will lead to a certain extent of uncertainty, due to the changing dynamics, the era of ferment will be the next phase in the Technology Life Cycle. With the entrance of tech giants, alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers are entered. This causes a variation in the innovation- and production process of autonomous vehicles. Besides that, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. The increasing extent to which these providers are present in the industry is supported by the flattening curve on the ‘vehicles per capita’ graph. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to this matter and allows forecasters to question whether private ownership of vehicles is still relevant when the dominant design is being selected.

=== Taxi industry ===
With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the private ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue when the dominant design is selected. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841090/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-ces-2018|title=You can take a ride in a self-driving Lyft during CES|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare-, repair-, and insurance industry ===
With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions. Numbers made available by the US government state that 94% of the vehicle accidents is due to human failures. With that in mind, it is safe to say that there is a major implication for the healthcare industry. Numbers of the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on U.S. roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident point out that an estimated 500-billion-dollar loss is accounted for the US healthcare industry only by the time autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. On the positive side, these numbers will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. As collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to preventively replace a part that will fail soon. This ‘Asset Efficiency Service’ would implicate a productivity gain for this business.
As fewer collisions implicate less money spend on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but on the other hand fewer payouts implicate a demand drop for insurances in general. The insurance industry has to come up with new insurance models in the near future.  An unexpected disadvantage would be a reduction in organs available for transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Ian |title=Self-Driving Cars Will Make Organ Shortages Even Worse |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/self-driving-cars-will-exacerbate-organ-shortages.html |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=[[Slate (magazine)]] |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rescue-, emergency- and military industry ===
The technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles within the rescue-, emergency- and military industry already leads to a decrease in death. Military personnel uses autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies, and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows AVs to become more and more autonomous. Also, another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/08/29/the-us-army-is-developing-autonomous-armored-vehicles/|title=The US Army is developing autonomous armored vehicles|last=Snow|first=Shawn|date=2017-08-29|work=Army Times|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interior design- and media-entertainment industry ===
For the interior design industry, there are exciting times ahead. The driver is decreasingly focused on the actual driving, this implies that the interior design- and media-entertainment industry has to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160405203131/https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|title=Driver-less car design: Sleep-walking into the future?|date=2016-04-05|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunication and energy industry ===
As autonomous vehicles are producing enormous amounts of data that need to be transferred and analyzed, the upcoming 5G cellular network will play a pivotal role in doing so. In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.
Since autonomous vehicles are solely going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. This causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication  depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem.

=== Restaurant, hotel and airline industry ===
Driver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/volvos-fully-autonomous-360c-concept-vehicle-even-lets-you-sleep-in-it|title=Volvo’s Fully Autonomous 360c Concept Vehicle Even Lets You Sleep In It|date=2018-09-06|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder, disabled and childcare industry ===
Autonomous vehicles will have a severe impact on the mobility options of persons that are not able to drive a vehicle themselves. To remain socially engaged with society or even able to do groceries, the elderly people of today are depending on caretakers to drive them to these places. In addition to the perceived freedom of the elderly people of the future, the demand for human aides will decrease. When we also consider the increased health of the elderly, it is safe to state that care centers will experience a decrease in the number of clients. Not only elderly people face difficulties of their decreased physical abilities, also disabled people will perceive the benefits of autonomous vehicles in the near future, causing their dependency on caretakers to decrease. Both industries are largely depending on informal caregivers, who are mostly relatives of the persons in need. Since there is less of a reliance on their time, employers of informal caregivers or even governments will experience a decrease of costs allocated to this matter. Children and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves, are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers. The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/why-autonomous-cars-could-be-the-change-disabled-people-1688864804|title=Why Autonomous Cars Could Be The Change Disabled People Need|last=McParland|first=Tom|work=Jalopnik|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercedes automated cruise control system ===
In 1999, Mercedes introduced Distronic, the first [[radar]]-assisted [[Adaptive cruise control system|ACC]], on the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-657477-1-814760-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-614232-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Mercedes-Benz S-Class, W 220 series (1998 to 2005)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-658451-1-1767861-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Innovation as a tradition|date=27 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229221136/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-658451-1-1767861-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|archivedate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mercedes-Benz C215|CL-Class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1090569-1-823389-1-0-0-0-0-1-11702-614318-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Technical highlights of the CL-Class and its predecessor series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Distronic system was able to adjust the vehicle speed automatically to the car in front in order to always maintain a safe distance to other cars on the road.

In 2005, Mercedes refined the system (from this point called "Distronic Plus") with the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221)]] being the first car to receive the upgraded Distronic Plus system. Distronic Plus could now completely halt the car if necessary on E-Class and most Mercedes sedans. In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', [[Jeremy Clarkson]] demonstrated the effectiveness of the cruise control system in the S-class by coming to a complete halt from motorway speeds to a round-about and getting out, without touching the pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clarkson, Jeremy|title=Radar Guided Cruise Control|date=4 July 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU83G3OaJuU|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Mercedes has vastly expanded its automated driving features on production cars: In addition to the standard Distronic Plus features such as an active brake assist, Mercedes now includes a steering pilot, a parking pilot, a cross-traffic assist system, night-vision cameras with automated danger warnings and braking assist (in case animals or pedestrians are on the road for example), and various other automated -driving features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/|title=Welcome to the Mercedes-Benz international website|work=Mercedes-Benz|date=|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/290478/mercedes-benz-e400-distronic-plus-with-steering-assist-demonstrated/|title=Mercedes-Benz E400: Distronic Plus with Steering Assist demonstrated|last=Ward|first=James|date=16 June 2014|website=www.caradvice.com.au|access-date=11 July 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.daimler.com/2015/03/18/einfach-technik-so-funktioniert-distronic-plus/|title=Daimler-Blog – Einfach Technik: So funktioniert DISTRONIC PLUS|last=Mercedes Blog-Team|first=|date=18 March 2015|website=Daimler-Blog|language=de|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbscottsdale.com/blog/how-to-use-distronic-plus-cruise-control-in-2016-mercedes-benz/|title=How to Use DISTRONIC PLUS Cruise Control in 2016 Mercedes-Benz|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 September 2015|website=www.mbscottsdale.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loebermotors.com/blog/how-to-use-mercedes-benz-distronic-plus/|title=How To Use Mercedes-Benz DISTRONIC PLUS|last=blogsadmin|first=|date=28 February 2016|website=www.loebermotors.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Mercedes also introduced its Active Brake Assist 4, which was the first emergency braking assistant with pedestrian recognition on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/ko/en/12367326|title=Mercedes-Benz Trucks: Safety: New assistance systems: Active Brake Assist 4 emergency: braking assistant featuring pedestrian recognition and: Sideguard Assist|last=Daimler AG|first=|date=2016|website=media.daimler.com|language=en-EN|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Mercedes' history of gradually implementing advancements of their automated driving features that have been extensively tested, not many crashes that have been caused by it are known. One of the known crashes dates back to 2005, when German [[news magazine]] "''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''" was testing Mercedes' old Distronic system. During the test, the system did not always manage to brake in time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stern.de/tv/stern-tv---rtl-mercedes-s-klasse--panne-bei-crash-test-3290156.html|title=Mercedes S-Klasse: Panne bei Crash-Test|last=|first=|date=16 November 2005|work=Stern|access-date=11 July 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Mellinghoff, then Head of Safety, NVH, and Testing at the Mercedes-Benz Technology Centre, stated that some of the tests failed due to the vehicle being tested in a metallic hall, which caused problems with the system's radar.

=== Tesla Autopilot ===
{{Main|Tesla Autopilot}}
In mid{{nbhyph}}October 2015, [[Tesla Motors]] rolled out version 7 of their software in the U.S. that included [[Tesla Autopilot]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20151014/OEM06/151019938/tesla-beams-down-autopilot-mode-to-model-s|title=Tesla beams down 'autopilot' mode to Model S|last=Nelson|first=Gabe|date=14 October 2015|work=Automotive News|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] update, adding a new "summon" feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-two-years-car-202858960.html|title=ELON MUSK: In 2 years your Tesla will be able to drive from New York to LA and find you|last=Zhang|first=Benjamin|date=10 January 2016|work=Automotive News|access-date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's automated driving features can be classified as somewhere between level 2 and level 3 under the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) five levels of vehicle automation.

On 20 January 2016, the first known fatal crash of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China's Hubei province. According to China's 163.com news channel, this marked "China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving (system)." Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car's absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver's otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.&lt;ref name="china-fatality"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/783009/the-scary-similarities-between-teslas-tsla-deadly-autopilot-crashes|title=There are some scary similarities between Tesla's deadly crashes linked to Autopilot|publisher=Quartz|first1=Josh|last1=Horwitz|first2=Heather|last2=Timmons|date=20 September 2016|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c.m.163.com/news/a/C0UBU2I0002580S6.html|title=China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving: not hitting the front bumper|language=Chinese|work=[[Media of China|China State Media]]|date=14 September 2016|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim's father documenting that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/two-years-on-a-father-is-still-fighting-tesla-over-aut-1823189786|title=Two Years On, A Father Is Still Fighting Tesla Over Autopilot And His Son's Fatal Crash|first=Ryan|last=Felton|website=jalopnik.com|date=27 February 2018|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in [[Williston, Florida]] on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S [[electric car]] was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel [[tractor-trailer]]. On 28 June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the [[Florida Highway Patrol]]. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck's trailer.&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash01"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk|title=Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode|last1=Yadron|first1=Danny|date=1 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Tynan|first2=Dan|location=[[San Francisco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutopilotCrash02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/self-driving-tesla-fatal-crash-investigation.html|title=Self-Driving Tesla Involved in Fatal Crash|last1=Vlasic|first1=Bill|date=30 June 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=1 July 2016|last2=Boudette|first2=Neal E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM530776/INOA-PE16007-7080.PDF|title=ODI Resume – Investigation: PE 16-007|author=Office of Defects Investigations, NHTSA|date=28 June 2016|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)|access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2016, the NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology.

According to Tesla, "neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S." Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla's first known autopilot death in over {{convert|130|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error.

=== Waymo ===
[[File:Google_driverless_car_at_intersection.gk.jpg|thumb|Google's in-house [[Waymo|automated car]].]]
Waymo originated as a self-driving car project within [[Google]]. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000&amp;nbsp;km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.hu/2012/08/the-self-driving-car-logs-more-miles-on.html Self-driving Car Logs More Miles], googleblog&lt;/ref&gt; In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqSDWoAhvLU&amp;list=PLcNF6Ihx2JoUoNKe4PxLqEcZMM0QW2yG-|title=A First Drive|date=27 May 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|03}}, Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of {{convert|1,500,000|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/lt//selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0316.pdf|title=Google Self-Driving Car Project, Monthly Report, March 2016|publisher=Google|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waymo.com|title=Waymo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/google-self-driving-car-waymo|title=Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready|last=Davies|first=Alex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Google's accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car's software caused a crash.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/02/29/for-the-first-time-googles-self-driving-car-takes-some-blame-for-a-crash/|title=For the first time, Google’s self-driving car takes some blame for a crash|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-cars-20150603-story.html|title=Google founder defends accident records of self-driving cars|date=3 June 2015|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light.

During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, "In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/googles-self-driving-car-may-caused-first-crash/|title=Google’s Self-Driving Car Caused Its First Crash|date=February 2016|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-google-self-driving-car-bus-collision-20160229-story.html|title=Passenger bus teaches Google robot car a lesson|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost" /&gt;

=== Uber ===
In March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in [[Tempe, Arizona]] when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-25/uber-autonomous-vehicle-gets-in-accident-in-tempe-arizona|title=Uber to Suspend Autonomous Tests After Arizona Accident|date=25 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 December 2017, Uber had completed {{convert|2|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} in automated mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/12/22/ubers-self-driving-cars-2-million-miles/#8028baea4fe4|title=Uber's Self-Driving Cars Hit 2 Million Miles As Program Regains Momentum|date=22 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2018, [[Death of Elaine Herzberg|Elaine Herzberg]] became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a [[Pedestrian crossing|crosswalk]], approximately 400 feet from an intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bensinger|first1=Greg|last2=Higgins|first2=Tim|title=Video Shows Moments Before Uber Robot Car Rammed Into Pedestrian|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-shows-final-seconds-before-fatal-uber-self-driving-car-crash-1521673182|access-date=25 March 2018|work=Wall Street Journal|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of the accidents include the following: nighttime, low visibility, pedestrian crossing from a shadowed portion of road, crossing a road that had high speed limit, and not checking for cars before crossing (blindly crossing street at night). This marks the first time an individual outside an auto-piloted car is known to have been killed by such a car. The first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzxq3y/self-driving-uber-killed-a-pedestrian-as-human-safety-driver-watched|title=Self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian as human safety driver watched|first=Alex|last=Lubben|publisher=[[Vice News]]|date=19 March 2018|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/video-said-to-show-failure-of-uber-s-tech-in-fatal-arizona-crash|title=Human Driver Could Have Avoided Fatal Uber Crash, Experts Say|date=22 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona Governor [[Doug Ducey]] later suspended the company's ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an "unquestionable failure" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=The Associated Press|author2=abc15.com staff|title=Governor Ducey suspends Uber from automated vehicle testing|url=https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/governor-ducey-suspends-uber-from-autonomous-vehicle-testing|access-date=27 March 2018|work=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-pulls-out-of-all-self-driving-car-testing-in-12785490.php | title=Uber puts the brakes on testing robot cars in California after Arizona fatality | first=Carolyn | last=Said | date=27 March 2018 | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | access-date=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2018 the National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY18MH010-prelim.pdf|title=Preliminary Report Released for Crash Involving Pedestrian, Uber Technologies, Inc., Test Vehicle|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navya automated bus driving system ===

On 9 November 2017, a [[Navya SAS|Navya]] automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply [[defensive driving]] such as flash headlights, sound the horn, or as one passenger commented "The shuttle didn't have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/self-driving-bus-crashes-two-hours-after-las-vegas-launch-truck-autonomous-vehicle|title=Self-driving bus involved in crash less than two hours after Las Vegas launch|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=9 November 2017|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy implications ==

===Urban planning===
According to a [[Wonkblog]] reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a [[disruptive innovation]] with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policy makers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt;

One fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.&lt;ref name="badger" /&gt; This may in turn encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership|title=Driverless cars will mean the end of mass car ownership|last1=Lee|first1=Timothy|date=31 January 2015|access-date=31 January 2015|publisher=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of [[smart highway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Randal, Policy Implications of Autonomous Vehicles (18 September 2014). Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 758. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2549392&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on [[Oil dependence|oil imports]] may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinto | first1 = Cyrus | title = How autonomous vehicle policy in California and Nevada addresses technological and non-technological liabilities | url = | journal = Intersect: The Stanford Journal of Science, Technology and Society | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 confounding questions that hold the key to the future of driverless cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=15 January 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policy makers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerra|first=Erick|date=1 June 2016|title=Planning for Cars That Drive Themselves: Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Regional Transportation Plans, and Autonomous Vehicles|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739456X15613591|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=210–224|doi=10.1177/0739456X15613591|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Todd. "Autonomous vehicle implementation predictions." ''Victoria Transport Policy Institute'' 28 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of right now the U.S. Government defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. [[Iyad Rahwan]], an associate professor in the MIT Media lab said, "Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs." Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/retail-revolution/|title=Retail Revolution|last=Humphreys|first=Pat|date=19 August 2016|work=Transport and Travel|access-date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the Convention has been the concept that a [[Driver (person)|driver]] is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050545/https://globalautoregs.com/rules/157-1968-vienna-convention-on-road-traffic|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 December 2017|title=GAR – 1968 Vienna Convention|date=1 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.

====Legal status in the United States====
[[File:Self Driving Cars Legalized States in USA.png|thumb|U.S. states that allow testing of driverless cars on public roads]]
In the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage — but do not necessarily prohibit — highly automated vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/automated-vehicles-are-probably-legal-united-states|title=Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in The United States|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=1 November 2012|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canis|first1=Bill|title=Issues in Autonomous Vehicle Deployment|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44940.pdf|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action|title=Automated Driving: Legislative and Regulatory Action|author=Bryant Walker Smith|date=|publisher=The Center for Internet and Society (CIS) at Stanford Law School|access-date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 7 states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the [[District of Columbia]], have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla's Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.

In September 2016, the US [[United States Department of Transportation|National Economic Council]] and [[Department of Transportation]] released federal standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/technology/self-driving-cars-guidelines.html|title=Self-Driving Cars Gain Powerful Ally: The Government|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=19 September 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 September 2016|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Nevada Legislature]] passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the [[Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NDMV) is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.&lt;ref name="GCC0611"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/ab511-20110625.html|title=Nevada enacts law authorizing autonomous (driverless) vehicles|date=25 June 2011|publisher=Green Car Congress|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes0611"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada Passes Law Authorizing Driverless Cars|author=Alex Knapp|date=22 June 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=25 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628165915/http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|archivedate=28 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/06/24/nevada-state-law-paves-the-way-for-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada state law paves the way for driverless cars|author=Christine Dobby|date=24 June 2011|work=[[Financial Post]]|access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was supported by [[Google]] in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its [[Google driverless car]].&lt;ref name="NYT0511"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/science/11drive.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1|title=Google Lobbies Nevada To Allow Self-Driving Cars|author=John Markoff|date=10 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nevada law defines an automated vehicle to be "a motor vehicle that uses [[artificial intelligence]], sensors and [[global positioning system]] coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator."

On 19 February 2016, [[Bill (law)|Assembly Bill]] No. 2866 was introduced in California that would allow automated vehicles to operate on the road, including those without a driver, steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal. The Bill states the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] would need to comply with these regulations by 1 July 2018 for these rules to take effect. This bill has yet to pass the house of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2866|title=Bill Text – AB-2866 Autonomous vehicles.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation released its Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/AV|title=Federal Automated Vehicles Policy|work=Department of Transportation|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California published discussions on the subject in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/b5ee940c-90e9-4f61-a48f-9be3a6e0e1bb/av_public_workshop_agenda_101916.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|title=Public Workshop Autonomous Vehicles|date=19 October 2016|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles]] ordered [[Uber]] to remove its self-driving vehicles from the road in response to two red-light violations. Uber immediately blamed the violations on "human-error", and has suspended the drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/uber-self-driving-cars-run-red-lights-san-francisco|title=Uber blames humans for self-driving car traffic offenses as California orders a halt|website=The Guardian|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation in Europe====

In 2013, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] permitted the testing of automated cars on public roads.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23330681|title=UK to road test driverless cars|date=16 July 2013|access-date=17 July 2013|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, all testing of robotic vehicles in the UK had been conducted on private property.&lt;ref name="UKTEST2013" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[Government of France]] announced that testing of automated cars on public roads would be allowed in 2015. 2000&amp;nbsp;km of road would be opened through the national territory, especially in Bordeaux, in Isère, Île-de-France and Strasbourg. At the 2015 ITS World Congress, a conference dedicated to intelligent transport systems, the very first demonstration of automated vehicles on open road in France was carried out in Bordeaux in early October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/des-vehicules-autonomes-sur-route-ouverte-a-bordeaux-en-octobre-2015.N338350|title=Des véhicules autonomes sur route ouverte à Bordeaux en octobre 2015|work=usine-digitale.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a preemptive lawsuit against various automobile companies such as GM, Ford, and Toyota accused them of "Hawking vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers who could hypothetically wrest control of essential functions such as brakes and steering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/selfdriving-cars-will-be-ready-before-our-laws-are|title=Self-Driving Cars Will Be Ready Before Our Laws Are|last=Greenblatt|first=Nathan|date=|website=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation in Asia====
In 2016, the Singapore Land Transit Authority in partnership with UK automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc will launch preparations for a test run of a fleet of [[automated taxi]]s for an on-demand automated cab service to take effect in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investvine.com/singapore-launch-self-driving-taxis-next-year/|title=Singapore to launch self-driving taxis next year {{!}} Investvine|last=Maierbrugger|first=Arno|date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|access-date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liability===
{{main|Self-driving car liability}}

Self-driving car liability is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons, or breaks road rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Laws on Autonomous Vehicles|first=Sean|last=Slone|url=http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/state-laws-autonomous-vehicles|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology, there may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury, and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants, system operator, insurers, and the public purse.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; Increases in the use of automated car technologies (e.g. [[advanced driver-assistance systems]]) may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving. It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents, although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ten ways autonomous driving could redefine the automotive world|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/ten-ways-autonomous-driving-could-redefine-the-automotive-world|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there was a dramatic improvement in safety, the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement.  However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.

In any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.

As higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketplace of change: Automobile insurance in the era of autonomous vehicles|url=https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vehicular communication systems ==
{{main|Vehicular communication systems}}Individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating [[Node (networking)|nodes]] in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79 percent of all traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2010/811381.pdf|title=Frequency of Target Crashes for IntelliDrive Safety Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents – future intersections for driverless cars (video)|date=22 March 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|publisher=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An efficient intersection management technique called Crossroads was proposed in 2017 that is robust to network delay of V2I communication and [[Worst-case execution time|Worst-case Execution time]] of the intersection manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/crossroads-time-sensitive-autonomous-intersection-management-tech|title=Crossroads: Time-Sensitive Autonomous Intersection Management Technique|date=18 June 2017|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion surveys ==
{{overly detailed|date=August 2016}}In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5146|title=Consumers in US and UK Frustrated with Intelligent Devices That Frequently Crash or Freeze, New Accenture Survey Finds|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Accenture|access-date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a "fully autonomous car". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost $3,000 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-57422698-48/many-car-buyers-show-interest-in-autonomous-car-tech/|title=Many car buyers show interest in autonomous car tech|last=Yvkoff|first=Liane|date=27 April 2012|publisher=CNET|access-date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorvision.de/service-ratgeber/selbstfahrende-autos-deutschland-22-prozent-deutschen-grosse-akzeptanz-roboterfahrzeuge-39281.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515125001/http://www.motorvision.de/service-ratgeber/selbstfahrende-autos-deutschland-22-prozent-deutschen-grosse-akzeptanz-roboterfahrzeuge-39281.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 May 2016|title=Große Akzeptanz für selbstfahrende Autos in Deutschland|date=9 October 2012|publisher=motorvision.de|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by [[Cisco Systems]] found 57% "stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosphere.ca/collisionmanagement/2013/05/22/autonomous-cars-found-trustworthy-in-global-study/|title=Autonomous Cars Found Trustworthy in Global Study|date=22 May 2013|publisher=autosphere.ca|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance.com/about-us/news-and-events/2014/07/autonomous-cars-bring-em-on-drivers-say-in-insurance.com-survey.html|title=Autonomous cars: Bring 'em on, drivers say in Insurance.com survey|date=28 July 2014|website=Insurance.com|access-date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partcatalog.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-predictions/|title=Autonomous Vehicle Predictions: Auto Experts Offer Insights on the Future of Self-Driving Cars|date=16 March 2015|website=PartCatalog.com|access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyriakidis|first1=M.|last2=Happee|first2=R.|last3=De Winter|first3=J.

In 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants' age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohenberger|first1=C.|last2=Spörrle|first2=M.|last3=Welpe|first3=I.

In 2016, a [[PwC]] survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that "66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/autonomous-cars-seen-as-smarter-than-human-drivers/|title=Autonomous cars seen as smarter than human drivers|first=Kristen|last=Hall-Geisler|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 December 2016|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pew Research Center survey of 4,135 U.S. adults conducted 1–15 May 2017 finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes—from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/|title=Automation in Everyday Life|last=Smith|first=Aaaron|last2=Anderson|first2=Monica |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moral issues ==
With the emergence of automated automobiles various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to an (untestable) potential for reduction of crashes by "up to" 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: Opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations.|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed. Those include, but are not limited to: the moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law; the decisions a car is to make right before a (fatal) crash; privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance; potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers; de-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users; exposure to hacking and malware; and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity, and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.

There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Responsibility for Crashes of Autonomous Vehicles: An Ethical Analysis|journal=Sci Eng Ethics|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices [who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts [who?] suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like: pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over 5 people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Trolley Problem|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=94|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it's driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Himmelreich|first=Johannes|date=2018-05-17|title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=669–684|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|issn=1386-2820}}&lt;/ref&gt;.There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Road vehicle automation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TxmfDAAAQBAJ}}|last=Meyer|first=G.|last2=Beiker|first2=S|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=93–102|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]] are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

(Many 'Trolley' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.)

Privacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual. This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/self-driving-cars-and-the-looming-privacy-apocalypse/474600/|title=How Self-Driving Cars Will Threaten Privacy|last=Lafrance|first=Adrienne|date=21 March 2016|work=|access-date=4 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jack|first=Boeglin|date=1 January 2015|title=The Costs of Self-Driving Cars: Reconciling Freedom and Privacy with Tort Liability in Autonomous Vehicle Regulation|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjolt/vol17/iss1/4|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Technology|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.

The implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-greenhouse-driverless-job-loss-20160922-snap-story.html|title=Autonomous vehicles could cost America 5 million jobs.

=== In literature ===
Intelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in [[science fiction]] literature. Examples include:
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s science-fiction short story, "[[Sally (short story)|Sally]]" (first published May–June 1953), automated cars have "[[positronic brain]]s" and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors, and save their human caretaker. Due to the high cost of the brain, few can afford a personal vehicle, so buses have become the norm.
* [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Robert A Heinlein]]'s novel, ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1980), Zeb Carter's driving and flying car "Gay Deceiver" is at first semi-automated and later, after modifications by Zeb's wife Deety, becomes sentient and capable of fully autonomous operation.
* In [[Edizioni Piemme]]'s series ''[[Geronimo Stilton]]'', a robotic vehicle called "Solar" is in the 54th book.
* [[Alastair Reynolds]]' series, ''[[Revelation Space]]'', features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.
* In [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]' novels ''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Freedom™]]'' (2010) driverless cars and motorcycles are used for attacks in a software-based [[open-source warfare]]. The vehicles are modified for this using [[3D printers]] and [[distributed manufacturing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t3n.de/news/3d-drucker-industrie-trend-453581/|title=3D-Drucker: Warum die Industrie wieder einen Trend verschläft|publisher=t3n News|language=de|access-date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are also able to operate as [[Swarm robotics|swarms]].

=== In television ===
* "[[CSI: Cyber]]" Season 2, episode 6, ''Gone in 60 Seconds'', features three seemingly normal customized vehicles, a 2009 [[Nissan Fairlady Z]] Roadster, a [[BMW M3]] E90 and a [[Cadillac CTS-V]], and one stock luxury [[BMW 7 Series]], being remote-controlled by a computer hacker.
* "[[Handicar]]", season 18, episode 4 of 2014 TV series ''[[South Park]]'' features a Japanese automated car that takes part in the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''-style car race.
* [[KITT]] and [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], the [[Pontiac Trans Am|Pontiac Firebird Trans-Am]]s in the 1982 TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', were sentient and autonomous. The KITT and KARR based [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustangs]] from [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|Knight Rider]] were also sentient and autonomous, like their Firebird counterparts.
* "Driven", series 4 episode 11 of the 2003 TV series [[NCIS (season 4)|''NCIS'']] features a robotic vehicle named "Otto", part of a high-level project of the Department of Defense, which causes the death of a Navy Lieutenant, and then later almost kills Abby.
* The TV series "[[Viper (TV series)|Viper]]" features a silver/grey armored assault vehicle, called ''The Defender'', which masquerades as a flame-red 1992 [[Dodge Viper]] RT/10 and later as a 1998 cobalt blue [[Dodge Viper GTS]]. The vehicle's sophisticated computer systems allow it to be controlled via remote on some occasions.
* "[[Black Mirror]]" episode "[[Hated in the Nation]]" briefly features a self-driving SUV with a touchscreen interface on the inside.
* ''Bull'' has a show discussing the effectiveness and safety of self-driving cars in an episode call E.J.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartermatt.com/237808/bull-episode-10-preview-self-driving-car-case-ginny-bretton/|title='Bull' episode 10 preview: The self-driving car case and Ginny Bretton|date=3 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25877">'''Sociotechnical  systems''' ('''STS''') in [[organizational development]] is an approach to complex organizational [[work design]] that recognizes the interaction between [[people]] and [[technology]] in [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s. The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behaviour. In this sense, society itself, and most of its substructures, are complex sociotechnical systems. The term sociotechnical systems was coined by [[Eric Trist]], Ken Bamforth and [[Fred Emery]], in the World War II era, based on their work with workers in English coal mines at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Susan Long|title=Socioanalytic Methods: Discovering the Hidden in Organisations and Social Systems|isbn=1780491328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociotechnical systems pertains to theory regarding the social aspects of [[people]] and [[society]] and technical aspects of organizational structure and processes. Here, technical does not necessarily imply material technology. The focus is on procedures and related knowledge, i.e. it refers to the ancient Greek term ''[[techne]]''. "Technical" is a term used to refer to structure and a broader sense of technicalities.  Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]] or the [[society]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter, see the use of ''sociotechnical'' in the works of sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]] and philosopher [[Günter Ropohl]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociotechnical theory therefore is about ''joint optimization'', with a shared emphasis on achievement of both excellence in technical performance and quality in people's work lives.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimisation. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organisation, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing.

==Overview==
Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]].  Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles:
* One is that the [[Social interaction|interaction]] of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational [[performance]].  This interaction consists partly of [[linear]] "cause and effect" relationships (the relationships that are normally "designed") and partly from "[[non-linear]]", [[Complexity|complex]], even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected).  Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work.
* The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, "un-designed" relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system's performance.

Therefore, sociotechnical theory is about ''joint optimization'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R., &amp; Foster, M. (1971). Sociotechical systems. American Psychologist, 26, 467-474. &lt;/ref&gt; that is, designing the social system and technical system in tandem so that they work smoothly together.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing, rather than the all too often case of new technology failing to meet the expectations of designers and users alike.

The scientific literature shows terms like ''sociotechnical'' all one word, or ''socio-technical'' with a hyphen, ''sociotechnical theory'', ''sociotechnical system'' and ''sociotechnical systems theory''. All of these terms appear ubiquitously but their actual meanings often remain unclear. The key term "sociotechnical" is something of a [[buzzword]] and its varied usage can be unpicked.  What can be said about it, though, is that it is most often used to simply, and quite correctly, describe any kind of organization that is composed of people and technology. But, predictably, there is more to it than that.

==Principles==
Some of the central principles of sociotechnical theory were elaborated in a seminal paper by [[Eric Trist]] and [[Ken Bamforth]] in 1951{{Human Relations; Feb1951, Vol. 4 Issue 1, p3-38, 36p}}. This is an interesting case study which, like most of the work in sociotechnical theory, is focused on a form of 'production system' expressive of the era and the contemporary technological systems it contained.  The study was based on the paradoxical observation that despite improved technology, productivity was falling, and that despite better pay and amenities, absenteeism was increasing.  This particular rational organisation had become irrational.  The cause of the problem was hypothesized to be the adoption of a new form of production technology which had created the need for a bureaucratic form of organization (rather like classic command-and-control).  In this specific example, technology brought with it a retrograde step in organizational design terms.  The analysis that followed introduced the terms "socio" and "technical" and elaborated on many of the core principles that sociotechnical theory subsequently became.

===Responsible autonomy===
Sociotechnical theory was pioneering for its shift in emphasis, a shift towards considering teams or groups as the primary unit of analysis and not the individual.  Sociotechnical theory pays particular attention to internal supervision and leadership at the level of the "group" and refers to it as "responsible autonomy".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The overriding point seems to be that having the simple ability of individual team members being able to perform their function is not the only predictor of group effectiveness.  There are a range of issues in team cohesion research, for example, that are answered by having the regulation and leadership internal to a group or team.&lt;ref&gt;Siebold, G. L. (1991). "The evolution of the measurement of cohesion". In: ''Military Psychology'', 11(1), 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

These, and other factors, play an integral and parallel role in ensuring successful teamwork which sociotechnical theory exploits.
The idea of semi-autonomous groups conveys a number of further advantages.  Not least among these, especially in hazardous environments, is the often felt need on the part of people in the organisation for a role in a small primary group.  It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited.  As Carvalho&lt;ref&gt;P.V.R. Carvalho (2006). "Ergonomic field studies in a nuclear power plant control room". In: ''Progress in Nuclear Energy'', 48, pp. 51-69&lt;/ref&gt;  states, this is because "...operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness...". The immediacy and proximity of trusted team members makes it possible for this to occur. The [[coevolution]] of technology and organizations brings with it an expanding array of new possibilities for novel interaction.  Responsible autonomy could become more distributed along with the team(s) themselves.

The key to responsible autonomy seems to be to design an organization possessing the characteristics of small groups whilst preventing the "silo-thinking" and "stovepipe" neologisms of contemporary management theory.  In order to preserve "...intact the loyalties on which the small group [depend]...the system as a whole [needs to contain] its bad in a way that [does] not destroy its good".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; In practice,&lt;ref&gt;A. Rice (1958). ''Productivity and social organisation: The Ahmedabad experiment''.  London: Tavistock.&lt;/ref&gt; this requires groups to be responsible for their own internal regulation and supervision, with the primary task of relating the group to the wider system falling explicitly to a group leader.  This principle, therefore, describes a strategy for removing more traditional command hierarchies.

===Adaptability===
Carvajal&lt;ref&gt;R. Carvajal (1983). "Systemic netfields: the systems' paradigm crises. Part I". In: ''Human Relations'' 36(3), pp.227-246.&lt;/ref&gt; states that "the rate at which uncertainty overwhelms an organisation is related more to its internal structure than to the amount of environmental uncertainty". Sitter in 1997 offered two solutions for organisations confronted, like the military, with an environment of increased (and increasing) complexity:
"The first option is to restore the fit with the external complexity by an increasing internal complexity. ...This usually means the creation of more staff functions or the enlargement of staff-functions and/or the investment in vertical information systems".&lt;ref&gt;Sitter, L. U., Hertog, J. F. &amp; Dankbaar, B., ''From complex organizations with simple jobs to simple organizations with complex jobs'', in: Human Relations, 50(5), 497-536, 1997. p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical information systems are often confused for "network enabled capability" systems (NEC) but an important distinction needs to be made, which Sitter et al. propose as their second option:
"...the organisation tries to deal with the external complexity by 'reducing' the internal control and coordination needs. ...This option might be called the strategy of 'simple organisations and complex jobs'". This all contributes to a number of unique advantages.
Firstly is the issue of "human redundancy"&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Clark (2005). "Human redundancy in complex, hazardous systems: A theoretical framework". In: ''Safety Science''. Vol 43. pp. 655-677.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which "groups of this kind were free to set their own targets, so that aspiration levels with respect to production could be adjusted to the age and stamina of the individuals concerned".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; Human redundancy speaks towards the flexibility, ubiquity and pervasiveness of resources within NEC.

The second issue is that of [[complexity]]. Complexity lies at the heart of many organisational contexts (there are numerous organizational paradigms that struggle to cope with it).  Trist and Bamforth (1951) could have been writing about these with the following passage: "A very large variety of unfavourable and changing environmental conditions is encountered ... many of which are impossible to predict.  Others, though predictable, are impossible to alter."&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many type of organisations are clearly motivated by the appealing "industrial age", rational principles of "factory production", a particular approach to dealing with complexity: "In the factory a comparatively high degree of control can be exercised over the complex and moving "figure" of a production sequence, since it is possible to maintain the "ground" in a comparatively passive and constant state".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; On the other hand, many activities are constantly faced with the possibility of "untoward activity in the 'ground'" of the 'figure-ground' relationship"&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; The central problem, one that appears to be at the nub of many problems that "classic" organisations have with complexity, is that "The instability of the 'ground' limits the applicability ... of methods derived from the factory".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;

In Classic organisations, problems with the moving "figure" and moving "ground" often become magnified through a much larger social space, one in which there is a far greater extent of hierarchical task interdependence.&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;  For this reason, the semi-autonomous group, and its ability to make a much more fine grained response to the "ground" situation, can be regarded as "agile".  Added to which, local problems that do arise need not propagate throughout the entire system (to affect the workload and quality of work of many others) because a complex organization doing simple tasks has been replaced by a simpler organization doing more complex tasks.  The agility and internal regulation of the group allows problems to be solved locally without propagation through a larger social space, thus increasing tempo.

===Whole tasks===
Another concept in sociotechnical theory is the "whole task".  A whole task "has the advantage of placing responsibility for the ... task squarely on the shoulders of a single, small, face-to-face group which experiences the entire cycle of operations within the compass of its membership."&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; The Sociotechnical embodiment of this principle is the notion of minimal critical specification.  This principle states that, "While it may be necessary to be quite precise about what has to be done, it is rarely necessary to be precise about how it is done".&lt;ref&gt;A. Cherns (1976). "The principles of sociotechnical design". In: ''Human Relations''. Vol 29(8), pp.783-792. p.786&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more illustrated by the antithetical example of "working to rule" and the virtual collapse of any system that is subject to the intentional withdrawal of human adaptation to situations and contexts.

The key factor in minimally critically specifying tasks is the responsible autonomy of the group to decide, based on local conditions, how best to undertake the task in a flexible adaptive manner. This principle is isomorphic with ideas like [[effects-based operations]] (EBO). EBO asks the question of what goal is it that we want to achieve, what objective is it that we need to reach rather than what tasks have to be undertaken, when and how. The EBO concept enables the managers to "...manipulate and decompose high level effects. They must then assign lesser effects as objectives for subordinates to achieve. The intention is that subordinates' actions will cumulatively achieve the overall effects desired".&lt;ref&gt;J. Storr (2005). ''A critique of effects-based thinking''. RUSI Journal, 2005. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the focus shifts from being a scriptwriter for tasks to instead being a designer of behaviours. In some cases, this can make the task of the manager significantly less arduous.

===Meaningfulness of tasks===
Effects-based operations and the notion of a "whole task", combined with adaptability and responsible autonomy, have additional advantages for those at work in the organization.  This is because "for each participant the task has total significance and dynamic closure"&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; as well as the requirement to deploy a multiplicity of skills and to have the responsible autonomy in order to select when and how to do so.  This is clearly hinting at a relaxation of the myriad of control mechanisms found in more classically designed organizations.

Greater interdependence (through diffuse processes such as globalisation) also bring with them an issue of size, in which "the scale of a task transcends the limits of simple [[spatio-temporal pattern|spatio-temporal structure]].  By this is meant conditions under which those concerned can complete a job in one place at one time, i.e., the situation of the face-to-face, or singular group". In other words, in classic organisations the "wholeness" of a task is often diminished by multiple group integration and spatiotemporal disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The group based form of organization design proposed by sociotechnical theory combined with new technological possibilities (such as the internet) provide a response to this often forgotten issue, one that contributes significantly to joint optimisation.

==Topics==
===Sociotechnical system===
A sociotechnical system is the term usually given to any instantiation of socio and technical elements engaged in goal directed behaviour. Sociotechnical systems are a particular expression of sociotechnical theory, although they are not necessarily one and the same thing. Sociotechnical systems theory is a mixture of sociotechnical theory, joint optimisation and so forth and general systems theory. The term sociotechnical [[system]] recognises that organizations have boundaries and that transactions occur within the system (and its sub-systems) and between the wider context and dynamics of the environment. It is an extension of Sociotechnical Theory which provides a richer descriptive and conceptual language for describing, analysing and designing organisations.  A Sociotechnical System, therefore, often describes a 'thing' (an interlinked, systems based mixture of people, technology and their environment) .

===Autonomous work teams===

Autonomous work teams also called self-managed teams, are an alternative to traditional assembly line methods. Rather than having a large number of employees each do a small operation to assemble a product, the employees are organized into small teams, each of which is responsible for assembling an entire product. These teams are self-managed, and are independent of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1980). Work redesign. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enrichment===
[[Job enrichment]] in organizational development, human resources management, and [[organizational behavior]], is the process of giving the employee a wider and higher level scope of responsibility with increased decision-making authority. This is the opposite of job enlargement, which simply would not involve greater authority.  Instead, it will only have an increased number of duties.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Steers and Lyman W. Porte, ''Motivation and Work Behavior'', 1991. pages 215, 322, 357, 411-413, 423, 428-441 and 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enlargement===
[[Job enlargement]] means increasing the scope of a [[Job (role)|job]] through extending the range of its job duties and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. This contradicts the principles of [[Departmentalization|specialisation]] and the [[division of labour]] whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall.

===Job rotation===
[[Job rotation]] is an approach to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth of exposure to the entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the scheduled exchange of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the [[German green party]] for some time but has been discontinued

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] in psychology refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Geen, R. G.  (1995), Human motivation: A social psychological approach. Belmont, CA: Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion.  Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual's state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behavior (e.g., anger, grief, happiness).

===Process improvement===
Process improvement in organizational development is a series of actions taken to identify, analyze and improve existing processes within an [[organization]] to meet new [[goal]]s and objectives. These actions often follow a specific [[methodology]] or [[strategy]] to create successful results.

===Task analysis===
[[Task analysis]] is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task. This information can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design, [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]].

===Job design===
[[Job design]] or work design in organizational development is the application of sociotechnical systems principles and techniques to the humanization of work, for example, through [[job enrichment]]. The aims of work design to improved job satisfaction, to improved through-put, to improved quality and to reduced employee problems, e.g., grievances, absenteeism.

===Deliberations===
[[Deliberations]] are key units of analysis in non-linear, knowledge work. They are 'choice points' that move knowledge work forward. As originated and defined by Cal Pava (1983) in a second-generation development of STS theory, deliberations are patterns of exchange and communication to reduce the equivocality of a problematic issue; for example, for systems engineering work, what features to develop in new software. Deliberations are not discrete decisions--they are a more continuous context for decisions. They have 3 aspects: topics, forums, and participants.

[[File:St Kentigerns Church HDR (8226826999).jpg|thumb|Tone mapped high-dynamic-range (HDR) image of St. Kentigerns Roman Catholic Church in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, UK]]

'''Tone mapping''' is a technique used in [[image processing]] and [[computer graphics]] to [[Map (mathematics)|map]] one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of [[High-dynamic-range imaging|high-dynamic-range images]] in a medium that has a more limited [[dynamic range]]. [[Print-out]]s, [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] or [[LCD]] monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes. Tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene [[radiance]] to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.

==Background==

The introduction of film-based photography created issues since capturing the enormous dynamic range of lighting from the real world on a chemically limited negative was very difficult. Early film developers attempted to remedy this issue by designing the film stocks and the print development systems that gave a desired [[Sigmoid function|S-shaped tone curve]] with slightly enhanced contrast (about 15%) in the middle range and gradually compressed highlights and shadows {{ref|hunt}}.  Photographers have also used [[dodging and burning]] to overcome the limitations of the print process {{ref|adams}}.

The advent of digital photography gave hope for better solutions to this problem. One of the earliest algorithms employed by Land and McCann in 1971 was Retinex, inspired by theories of lightness perception {{ref|land}}.This method is inspired by the eye’s biological mechanisms of adaptation when lighting conditions are an issue. Gamut mapping algorithms were also extensively studied in the context of color printing. Computational models such as CIECAM02 or iCAM were used to predict color appearance. Despite this, if algorithms could not sufficiently map tones and colors, a skilled artist was still needed, as is the case with cinematographic movie post-processing.

Computer graphic techniques capable of rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance as the main limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range.

==Purpose and methods==

The goals of tone mapping can be differently stated depending on the particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications might be to obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device is not able to reproduce the full range of luminance values.

Various tone mapping operators have been developed in the recent years.{{ref|devlin}} They all can be divided in two main types:
*''global'' (or ''spatially uniform'') operators: they are non-linear functions based on the luminance and other global variables of the image. Once the optimal function has been estimated according to the particular image, every pixel in the image is mapped in the same way, independent of the value of surrounding pixels in the image. Those techniques are simple and fast&lt;ref&gt;G. Qiu et al, [http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~qiu/webpages/Papers/icpr2006-hdri-camera.pdf "Tone Mapping for HDR Image using Optimization-A New Closed Form Solution"], Proc. ICPR 2006, 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, vol.1, pp.996-999&lt;/ref&gt; (since they can be implemented using [[look-up table]]s), but they can cause a loss of contrast.  Examples of common global tone mapping methods are contrast reduction and [[Negative (photography)|color inversion]].
*''local'' (or ''spatially varying'') operators: the parameters of the non-linear function change in each pixel, according to features extracted from the surrounding parameters. In other words, the effect of the algorithm changes in each pixel according to the local features of the image. Those algorithms are more complicated than the global ones; they can show artifacts (e.g. halo effect and ringing); and the output can look unrealistic, but they can (if used correctly) provide the best performance, since human vision is mainly sensitive to local contrast.

A simple example of global tone mapping filter is &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}=\frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{in}}+1},&lt;/math&gt; where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminance (relative)|luminance]] of the original pixel and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminance of the filtered pixel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinhard|first1=Erik|title=Photographic tone reproduction for digital images.|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|date=2002|volume= 21|issue= 3|url=http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~peyre/cours/x2005signal/hdr_photographic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This function will map the luminance ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; in the domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to a displayable output range of &lt;math&gt;[0,1).&lt;/math&gt; While this filter provides a decent [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] for parts of the image with low luminance (particularly when {{math|{{var|V}}{{sub|in}} &lt; 1}}), parts of the image with higher luminance will get increasingly lower contrast as the luminance of the filtered image goes to 1.

A perhaps more useful global tone mapping method is [[gamma compression]], which has the filter &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}=A\,V_{\text{in}}^{\gamma},&lt;/math&gt; where {{math|{{var|A}} &gt; 0}} and {{math|0 &lt; {{var|γ}} &lt; 1}}. This function will map the luminance ''V''{{sub|in}} in the domain &lt;math&gt;[0,A^{-1/\gamma}]&lt;/math&gt; to the output range &lt;math&gt;[0,1].&lt;/math&gt; ''γ'' regulates the contrast of the image; a lower value for lower contrast. While a lower constant ''γ'' gives a lower contrast and perhaps also a duller image, it increases the exposure of underexposed parts of the image while at the same time, if {{math|{{var|A}} &lt; 1}}, it can decrease the exposure of overexposed parts of the image enough to prevent them from being overexposed.

An even more sophisticated group of tone mapping algorithms is based on contrast or [[Gradient Domain Image Processing|gradient domain]] methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated by the fact that the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: [[gradient domain high dynamic range compression]]{{ref|fattal}} and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images{{ref|mantiuk}} (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).

Another approach to tone mapping of HDR images is inspired by the [[anchoring theory of lightness perception]].{{ref|gilchrist}} This theory explains many characteristics of the human visual system such as lightness constancy and its failures (as in the [[checker shadow illusion]]), which are important in the perception of images.  The key concept of this tone mapping method (Lightness Perception in Tone Reproduction{{ref|krawczyk}}) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated by merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. Particularly important is the anchoring—relating of the luminance to a known luminance, namely estimating which luminance value is perceived as white in the scene. This approach to tone mapping does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.

One simple form of tone mapping takes a standard image (not HDR – the dynamic range already compressed) and applies [[unsharp masking]] with a large radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening. See [[Unsharp masking#Local contrast enhancement|unsharp masking: local contrast enhancement]] for details.

One of the commonly used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 which is based on both the [[color appearance model]] and hierarchical mapping.{{ref|fairchild}} After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution{{ref|xiao}} to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.

==Digital photography==
[[Image:Dundus Square.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tone mapped HDR image of [[Dundas Square]]; Tone mapping was done as post-processing technique, using Photomatix photographic software.]]
Forms of tone mapping long precede digital photography. The manipulation of film and development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, although it is not usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via [[dodging and burning]], and is particularly advocated by and associated with [[Ansel Adams]], as described in his book ''The Print;'' see also his [[Zone System]].

The normal process of [[exposure compensation]], brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images as part of a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of tone mapping.

However, HDR tone mapping, usually using ''local operators,'' has become increasingly popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a tone mapping operator is then applied to the result. There are now many examples of locally tone mapped digital images, inaccurately known as "HDR photographs", on the internet, and these are of varying quality. This popularity is partly driven by the distinctive appearance of locally tone mapped images, which many people find attractive, and partly by a desire to capture high-contrast scenes that are hard or impossible to photograph in a single exposure, and may not render attractively even when they can be captured. Although digital sensors actually capture a higher dynamic range than film, they completely lose detail in extreme highlights, clipping them to pure white, producing an unattractive result when compared with negative film, which tends to retain colour and some detail in highlights.

In some cases local tone mapping is used even though the dynamic range of the source image could be captured on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, and the amount of shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.

==Display devices==

One of the original goals of tone mapping was to be able to reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem{{ref|mantiukdaly}}.

For this method, models for the Human Visual System (HVS) and the display are first generated, along with a simple tone mapping operator. The contrast distortions are weighted according to their individual visibilities approximated by the HVS. With these models, an objective function that defines the tone curve can be created and solved using a fast quadratic solver.

With the addition of filters, this method can also be extended to videos. The filters ensure that the rapid changing of the tone-curve between frames are not salient in the final output image.

==Example of the imaging process==

[[Image:Old saint pauls 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tone mapped [[high dynamic range imaging|High dynamic range image]] example showing stained glass windows in south alcove of [[Old Saint Paul's]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]

[[Image:HDRI-Example.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The six individual exposures used to create the previous image. In the low exposure images, the room is dark and unclear, but the details of the windows are visible. In the high exposure images, the windows are bright and unclear, but the details of the room are revealed.]]

The images on the right show the interior of a church, a scene which has a variation in radiance much larger than that which can be displayed on a monitor or recorded by a conventional camera. The six individual exposures from the camera show the radiance of the scene in some range transformed to the range of brightnesses that can be displayed on a monitor. The range of radiances recorded in each photo is limited, so not all details can be displayed at once: for example, details of the dark church interior cannot be displayed at the same time as those of the bright stained-glass window. An algorithm is applied to the six images to recreate the high dynamic range radiance map of the original scene (a [[high dynamic range image]]). Alternatively, some higher-end consumer and specialist scientific digital cameras are able to record a high dynamic range image directly, for example with [[Raw image format|RAW]] images.

In the ideal case, a camera might measure [[luminance]] directly and store this in the HDR image; however, most high dynamic range images produced by cameras today are not calibrated or even proportional to luminance, due to practical reasons such as cost and time required to measure accurate luminance values &amp;mdash; it is often sufficient for artists to use multiple exposures to gain an "HDR image" which grossly approximates the true luminance signal.

The high dynamic range image is passed to a tone mapping operator, in this case a local operator, which transforms the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is perceptually less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously.

==Visual effect==

Local tone mapping produces a number of characteristic effects in images. These include halos around dark objects, a "painting-like" or "cartoon-like" appearance due to a lack of large global contrasts, and highly saturated colours. Many people find the resulting images attractive and these effects to add an interesting new set of choices for post-processing in digital photography. Some people believe that the results stray too far from realism, or find them unattractive, but these are aesthetic judgements, and often concern the choices made by the photographer during the tone mapping process, rather than being a necessary consequence of using tone mapping.

Not all tone mapped images are visually distinctive. Reducing dynamic range with tone mapping is often useful in bright sunlit scenes, where the difference in intensity between direct illumination and shadow is great. In these cases the global contrast of the scene is reduced, but the local contrast maintained, while the image as a whole continues to look natural. Use of tone mapping in this context may not be apparent from the final image:
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Tone mapping can also produce distinctive visual effects in the final image, such as the visible halo around the tower in the Cornell Law School image below. It can be used to produce these effects even when the dynamic range of the original image is not particularly high. Halos in images come about because the local tone mapping operator will brighten areas around dark objects, to maintain the local contrast in the original image, which fools the human  visual system into perceiving the dark objects as being dark, even if their actual luminance is the same as that of areas of the image perceived as being bright. Usually this effect is subtle, but if the contrasts in the original image are extreme, or the photographer deliberately sets the luminance gradient to be very steep, the halos become visible.
