"'''Above-the-line'''" refers to the list of individuals who guide and influence the creative direction, process, and voice of a given narrative in a film and related expenditures. These roles include but are not limited to the [[screenwriter]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[Film director|director]], and [[actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film &amp; TV Production Roles and Departments|url=http://film.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/4897/Crew-Roles-and-Departments-Guide.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the term is used for matters related to the film's production budget. Above-the-line expenditures reflect the expected line item compensation for an official above-the-line member's role in a given film project. These expenditures are usually set, negotiated, spent and/or promised before [[principal photography]] begins. They include rights to secure the material on which the [[screenplay]] is based, production rights to the screenplay, compensation for the [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]], [[Director (film)|director]], principal [[actor]]s and other cost-related line items such as assistants for the producers, director or actors.

The distinction originates from the early studio days when the [[budget]] top-sheet would literally have a line separating the ''above-the-line'' and ''[[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]]'' costs.

'''[[Acharya]] Ramlochan Saran''' (born February 11, 1889 in [[Muzaffarpur]], d. May 14, 1971) was a [[Hindi language|Hindi]] littérateur, grammarian and publisher. He founded Pustak Bhandar, a publishing enterprise, in [[Laheriasarai]] in 1915 and moved his publishing office to [[Patna]] in 1929. He also founded a number of magazines — ''Balak magazine'' (1926&amp;ndash;1986), ''Himalaya'' (1946&amp;ndash;1948) and ''Honhar'' (Hindi and Urdu) (1939).

==Educational work==
His Hindi primer ''Manohar Balapothi'' attempted to teach the [[Devanagari]] alphabet to beginners. He also published ''Some Eminent Behar Contemporaries'' by [[Sachchidananda Sinha]],&lt;ref name="bihar"&gt;Sachchidananda Sinha, [https://www.amazon.com/eminent-Behar-contemporaries-Pioneer-English/dp/B0007JJ45G/ ''Some Eminent Behar Contemporaries''], 1944, 218 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; books by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and other Gandhian literature in both [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[English language|English]]. He published ''Tolstoy and Gandhi'' by Dr. [[Kalidas Nag]] in English&lt;ref name="kalidas"&gt;Kalidas Nag, [https://www.amazon.com/Tolstoy-Gandhi-Gandhis-foot-steps-Kalidas/dp/B0000CQWN8 ''Tolstoy and Gandhi'' ("In Gandhi's foot-steps" series)], 1950, 135 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and produced a [[Maithili language]] version of the books of [[Tulsidas]]. Having edited and published ''Sidhant Bhasya'', a four-volume commentary on Tulsidas's medieval retelling of the [[Ramayana]], the [[Ramacharitamanasa]], he was first to start printing [[Maithili language|Maithili]] books in Maithili script ([[Mithilakshar]]).

He died on 14 May 1971 in [[Darbhanga]], [[Bihar]].

'''Affection''' (also known as '''vowel affection''', '''infection''' or '''vowel mutation'''), in the [[linguistics]] of the [[Celtic languages]], is the change in the quality of a [[vowel]] under the influence of the vowel of the following final [[syllable]].

It is a type of [[assimilation (linguistics)#anticipatory assimilation at a distance|anticipatory (or regressive) assimilation at a distance]]. The vowel that triggers the change was later normally lost. Some grammatical suffixes cause i-affection. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], {{lang|cy|gair}} "word" and {{lang|cy|-iadur}} "device suffix" yield {{lang|cy|geiriadur}} "dictionary", with {{lang|cy|-ai-}} in {{lang|cy|gair}} becoming {{lang|cy|-ei-}}.

The two main types of affection are a-affection and i-affection.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction''. 2nd edition. Blackwell, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8895-1}}, p. 317, 321, 328.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also u-affection, which is more usually referred to as u-infection. I-affection is an example of [[i-mutation]] and may be compared to the [[Germanic umlaut]], and a-affection is similar to [[Germanic a-mutation]]. More rarely, the term "affection", like "umlaut", may be applied to other languages and is then a synonym for i-mutation generally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1375">'''Air cavity system''' (or '''ACS''') is a modern marine [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] design concept based upon capturing air beneath a vessel's hull to reduce drag and increase speed and fuel efficiency.
==How It Works==

The System works trapping a layer of air bubbles beneath the ship’s hull. A dedicated system or an air blower generates air bubbles that pass nonstop under the ship’s surface. Along the bottom of the hull, air bubble outlets are located at different sites equally on both the sides of the boat’s center.
A layer of bubbles is formed by blowing air at a constant rate, reducing the drag and resistance between the boat and the water.

'''Aisha E'ismat Taymur''' ({{lang-ar|عائشة عصمت تيمور&amp;lrm;}} or '''Aisha al-Taymuriyya''' {{rtl-lang|ar|عائشة التيمورية&amp;lrm;}}; 1840–1902) was an Egyptian social activist,&lt;ref name="sis2"&gt;[http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm Aisha Taymur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321015646/http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm|date=2012-03-21}} at Egyptian State Information Service&lt;/ref&gt; [[poet]], [[novelist]], and feminist&lt;ref name="sis2" /&gt; in the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman era]]. She was active in the early 19th century in the field of [[women's rights]]. Her writings came out in a period of time where women in Egypt were realizing that they were being deprived of some of the rights that Islam granted them.

In the assessment of Mervat Fayez Hatem,

{{quote|Taymur used her work of fiction, social commentary and poetry to expand the definition of the nation-building process to include different social classes, ethnic groups and women of different generations and nationalisties. In this sincere effort, she was able to transform her very narrow social class rootes putting them into the service of the larger community. As such, she deserved, not just her poetry, the title of the "Finest of Her Class", which was one translation of the title of her poetry, ''Hilyat al-Tiraz''.&lt;ref name="Hatem"&gt;Mervat Fayez Hatem, ''Literature, gender, and nation-building in nineteenth-century Egypt: the life and works of ʻAʼisha Taymur'', Literatures and cultures of the Islamic world (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Taymur is commemorated by having one of the newly discovered [[List of craters on Venus|craters]] on the planet [[Venus]] named after her.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Taymur was the daughter of [[Isma'il Taymur]], a member of the Royal [[Turkish people|Turkish]] entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goldschmidt|first=Arthur|title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt|year=2000|quote=Pioneer woman poet, writer, and feminist. Born in Bab al-Khalq, Cairo, she was the daughter of Isma'il Taymur, a Turkish-born official in Muhammad Ali's European chancery, and an upper-class Circassian women who tried to quash Aish'a literary leanings.|page=211|chapter=al-Taymuriyya, 'Aisha|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-229-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father provided Taymur with an education and when he died she assumed the education of her brother, Ahmed Pasha Taymur. At age 14, Taymur married and moved to Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aisha Taymur |url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321015646/http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm |archive-date= 2012-03-21 |publisher=Egyptian State Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Against Taymur's mother's attempts to teach her embroidery, Taymur's father educated her in the Quran, Islamic Jurisprudence, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. Her father also taught her composition, where she began her literary career with poetry in all three of her learned languages. Taymur was dedicated to education but because of gender at time in Egypt, she was restricted to only study in her home.&lt;ref name="WWH"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Taymuriyya, 'A'isha 'Ismat Al- (1840–1902) |first=Kate|last=Lang |work=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia |year=2002 |publisher=Gale Research}} via {{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/taymuriyya-aisha-ismat-al-1840-1902|title=Taymuriyya, 'A'isha 'Ismat al- (1840–1902) |work=Encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taymur voiced her anger with the segregation in poems when only 13. At age 14 she gave up her studies and writing when she married Mahmud Bey al-Islambuli. After the death of her daughter, father and husband, she returned to Egypt where she studied with female tutors on the subject of poetic composition.&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mosaicofmuslimwomen.com/2015/10/aisha-taymur-ottoman-era-poet-and-feminist/|title=Aisha Taymur- Ottoman Era Poet and Feminist |work=Mosaic of Muslim Women|last=Dahduli|first=Tasneem|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Taymur was born to a literary family; her brother [[Ahmed Taymour|Ahmed Pasha Taymur]] was a [[researcher]] and novelist. She also had two nephews: [[Mohammad Taymur]], a playwright and [[Mahmoud Taymur]], a novelist.

Taymur's father always wanted to provide his daughter with adequate education.&lt;ref name="sis2" /&gt; Taymur got married in 1854 when she was 14 to Mahmud Bey al-Islambuli, a Turkish notable, and left with her husband to [[Istanbul]]. In 1873, Taymur's daughter, Tawhida, died from an unknown illness.&lt;ref name="WWH"/&gt; Her father died in 1882, followed closely by the death of her husband in 1885, which prompted her to returned to Egypt where she resumed her writing. Her poems mourning her daughter are considered the best in that genre in modern times.&lt;ref name="sis2" /&gt;
==Activism==
After the death of her husband and daughter, Taymur started on her writings advocating for women's rights. Her works came out at the time of a socioeconomic transformation of Egypt where women realized they were being deprived of the rights Islam gave them. Taymur is referenced as the "mother of Egyptian feminism."&lt;ref name="WWH"/&gt; She worked with other female intellectuals and activists to campaign for education, do charitable work, and challenge colonialism. This was the start of early growth for Egyptian feminism.&lt;ref name="mosaic"/&gt;

==Writing==
Taymur wrote [[poetry]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="WWH"/&gt; She arguably had a fundamental influence on the emergence of Arabic women's writing. Her 1892 sixteen-page booklet ''Mir'at alTa'mulfi al-Umur'' (''A Reflective Mirror on Some Matters'' or, more eloquently, ''The Mirror of Contemplation'') reinterpreted the Koran to suggest that it was markedly less patriarchal in its requirements of Muslims than was traditionally thought.&lt;ref name="Hatem"/&gt;

In [[philately]] a '''backstamp''' is a [[postmark]] on the back of a [[cover (philately)|letter]] showing a post office or station through which the item passed in transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scheer |first=Frank |title=Mute oval canceling device handstamp |work= |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] |date=18 April 2006 |url=http://arago.si.edu/record_52376_img_1.html |accessdate=23 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of delivery may also backstamp a cover and this type of mark is known as a '''receiving mark'''.

Backstamps are often applied as documentation of transit times, lengthy ones in the case of ocean crossings or short ones in the case of [[airmail]] flights. [[Registered mail]] is often backstamped in order to show the [[chain of custody]].

Mail that has had complex routings can have a dozen or more backstamps. Although such covers may look positively blackened with the overlapping marks, they are not common and so are highly valued by collectors of [[postal history]], being described as "well travelled".

==Hawaiian==
The indigenous [[Hawaiian language]], which is still spoken, is to be distinguished from the modern [[Hawaiian Pidgin English]]. There are also [[Bible translations into Hawaii Pidgin]]. A [[Hawaiian language]] translation was done by [[New England]] Christian missionaries including Reverends [[Hiram Bingham I|Hiram Bingham]], [[Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston]], [[Lorrin Andrews]] and [[Sheldon Dibble]] from 1800-1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Papers of the Hawaiian Historical Society |year=1908 |title=The History of the Hawaiian Mission Press, with a Bibliography of the Earlier Publications |hdl=10524/968 |author1=Howard M.

==Māori==
The Bible was translated into the [[Māori language]] in the 19th century by missionaries sponsored by the [[New Zealand Church Missionary Society|Church Missionary Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130208042847/http://www.biblesociety.org.nz/about-us/translation Bible Society - Translation Work&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, the Rev. [[William Williams (bishop)|William Williams]] started work on the translation of the Bible into the Māori language. The Rev. [[Robert Maunsell]] worked with [[William Williams (bishop)|William Williams]] on the translation of the Bible. William Williams concentrated on the New Testament; Maunsell worked on the Old Testament, portions of which were published in 1827, 1833 and 1840 with the full translation completed in 1857.&lt;ref name="LMR1874"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite web| others= Transcribed by the Right Reverend Dr. Terry Brown Bishop of Malaita, Church of the Province of Melanesia, 2008. | title = Untitled article on Maori Bible translation|chapter=|date= 10 November 1858|publisher= The Church Journal, New-York | url= http://anglicanhistory.org/nz/maunsell_translation1858.html| accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 1827 [[William Colenso]] printed the first Māori Bible comprising three chapters of Genesis, the 20th chapter of Exodus, the first chapter of the Gospel of St John, 30 verses of the fifth chapter of the Gospel of St Matthew, the Lord’s Prayer and some hymns.&lt;ref name="LMR1874"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rogers |first1= Lawrence M. |title= Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams|url= |accessdate=  |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |location= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Gilbert Puckey]] also collaborated with [[William Williams (bishop)|William Williams]] on the translation of the New Testament, which was published in 1837 and its revision in 1844.&lt;ref name="LMR1874"/&gt; In 1845 the Book of Common Prayer was translated by a committee comprising William Williams, Robert Maunsell, James Hamlin and William Puckey.&lt;ref name="nzm45-2"&gt;{{cite web|title= New Zealand Mission|pages= 364–373|date= 1845|url=https://archive.org/details/1845CMSMissionaryRegister | publisher = Missionary Register| accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete editions of the New Testament, and the revisions, were published at the expense of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]].&lt;ref name="McS"&gt;{{cite web|title= Maori (or New Zealand) Version of the Scriptures|pages= |date= |url= http://www.biblicalcyclopedia.com/M/maori-(or-new-zealand)-version-of-the-scriptures.html| publisher = McClintock and Strong Biblical Cyclopedia| accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. William Williams and Rev. T. W. Meller M.A., the Editorial Superintendent of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], worked to revise the translation of the Bible.&lt;ref name="McS"/&gt; In the early 1860s [[Elizabeth Fairburn Colenso]] helped prepare the revised Māori [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] for the press. She correcting the printed copy, sometimes suggesting alternative translations.&lt;ref name="dnzb-EFC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Murray| first =Janet E.| work = Dictionary of New Zealand biography | title = Colenso, Elizabeth|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1c22/colenso-elizabeth|date = 30 October 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the full Māori Bible was published in 1868. Since then, there have been four revisions of the full Bible at intervals of 21 years, 36 years and finally 27 years up to the 1952 edition. The New Zealand Bible Society has a vision for a new translation of the Bible into modern colloquial Māori.

==Rarotongan==
[[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] translated the New Testament in the late 1820s through to the early 1830s. He left Rarotonga, Cook Islands in 1834 for England to conduct a series of fundraising lectures, publish his book ''Missionary Enterprises in the South Seas'' and to publish the Rarotongan Bible - New Testament. He came back to Rarotonga soon after, and left for the New Hebrides in 1839 where he was killed and eaten by cannibals at Erromanga on 20 November 1839. He was just 43 years of age. The complete Bible was published in 1851. [Insert by Tangata Vainerere, 2014]

==Samoan==
Samoan language first had a Gospel of John from 1841, then a Bible from 1844, mainly the work of [[George Pratt (missionary)|George Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;''To live among the stars: Christian origins in Oceania'' - Page 126 John Garrett - 1982 "The final form of the Bible, produced under the auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society, set standards for both written and spoken Samoan. Robert Louis Stevenson thought it "not only a monument of excellent literature, but also a desirable piece of typography."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tahitian==
[[Henry Nott]] (1774-1844) translated the Bible into Tahitian.&lt;ref&gt;Moon Handbooks ''Tahiti: Including the Cook Islands'' - Page 133 David Stanley - 2003   The Reverend Henry Nott (1774-1884), who translated the Bible into Tahitian, is buried directly behind the school (go around behind the building to see the ornate tomb). Nott arrived on the ship [[Duff (1794 ship)|''Duff'']] in 1796 and served with the London Missionary Society for 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tongan==
Although parts of the Bible were first translated into [[Tongan language|Tongan]] in 1844, the New Testament was first published in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldscriptures.org/pages/tongan.html The Bible in Tongan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete edition of the Bible was translated into Tongan by [[Methodism|Wesleyan]] missionaries; the translation was then revised and edited by Thomas West, and published in London by W.

According to the [[hacker]]s' ''[[Jargon File]]'', '''''Chainik''''' ([[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]: ''чайник'',  "teakettle", "teapot") is a term that implies both ignorance and a certain amount of willingness to learn (as well as a propensity to cause disaster), but does not necessarily imply as little experience or short exposure time as [[newbie]] and is not as derogatory as [[luser]]. Both a novice user and someone using a computer system for a long time without any understanding of the internals can be referred to as chainiks. &lt;ref&gt;{{JargonFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a widespread term in Russian hackish, often used in an English context by Russian-speaking hackers especially in [[Israel]] (e.g. "Our new colleague is a complete chainik"). [[FidoNet]] discussion groups often had a "chainik" subsection for newbies and old chainiks (e.g. SU.CHAINIK, RU.LINUX.CHAINIK). Public projects often have a chainik mailing list to keep the chainiks out the developers' and experienced users' discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into mainstream [[Russian language|Russian]] due to the Russian translation of the popular ''[[For Dummies]]'' series which uses "chainik" for "dummy".&lt;ref&gt;{{JargonFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Term can also apply to novice [[mountaineer]]s, [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]], drivers, etc., with such usage predating the usage in computing context. 

Some suggest the term is derived from a Russian folk custom to make a gift of a hollow thing – e.g., a pitted [[pumpkin]], a [[kettle]], or a [[teapot]] – to unsuccessful [[matchmaking|matchmaker]]s of an aspiring groom rejected by a bride. The unlucky groom was mockingly called ''chainik''. Over time the term entered other usages for unlucky, inept, or newbie people.&lt;ref&gt;''A Large Dictionary of Russian Nicknames'', by Harry Walter and Valery Mokiyenko (2007)  {{ISBN|5-373-00435-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lUEeuWZdUloC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA19,M1 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Ringette League|National Ringette League#NRL National Champions}}
In the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] or the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]], the "'''Elite Eight'''" (also called the “Great Eight”) are the final eight teams and, thus represent the regional finals, or national quarterfinals. In [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]], the Elite Eight consists of the two teams in each of the four regional championship games. The winners advance to the [[Final Four]].  Since 1997, when the NCAA trademarked the phrase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=74687330|title=Trademark record for serial no. 74687330 (Elite Eight)|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] the Elite Eight consists of the eight winners of the eight Division II regions.  Like the Division I Final Four, the Division II Elite Eight games are all held in one predetermined location.

In the men's Division I, the lowest-seeded team ever to reach this round in the modern 64 team tournament era was #12 [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] in [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]], who upset #5-seed [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami (Florida)]], #4-seed [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]], and #8-seed [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] before losing to #2-seed Oklahoma in the West regional that year. Eight #11 seeds have advanced to the Elite Eight: [[LSU Tigers men's basketball|LSU]] in [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]], [[Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball|Loyola Marymount]] in [[1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1990]], [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] in [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]], [[George Mason Patriots men's basketball|George Mason]] in [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]], [[VCU Rams men's basketball|Virginia Commonwealth]] in [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]], [[Dayton Flyers men's basketball|Dayton]] in [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2014]], [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] in [[2017 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2017]], and [[Loyola Ramblers men's basketball|Loyola Chicago]] in [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]].

On average, three of the four #1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year.  In men's play, the Elite Eight exists intact for less than 24 hours between the second Friday evening and the following Saturday afternoon of the tournament.  The Elite Eight also represents the halfway mark of the men's tournament since each qualifying team must win three rounds (games) to reach the national quarterfinals, with three rounds remaining to reach and win the national championship game.

Like "March Madness," the phrase "Elite Eight" originally referred to the [[Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship]], the single-elimination [[basketball#High school basketball|high school basketball]] tournament run by the [[Illinois High School Association]]. When the IHSA finals were reduced from sixteen to eight teams in 1956, a replacement nickname for [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] was needed, and Elite Eight won popular favor. The IHSA [[trademark]]ed the term in 1995; the trademark rights are now held by the March Madness Athletic Association, a joint venture between the NCAA and IHSA formed after a 1996 court case allowed both organizations to use "March Madness" for their own tournaments.

Elite Eight can also refer to the eight NCAA Division I baseball teams that reach the [[College World Series]].

==Notable Elite Eight teams in the men's Division I NCAA tournament==
* During the first 12 years of the tournament (1939-50, inclusive) only eight teams competed, meaning every team that qualified in those years was an automatic "Elite Eight" team. 
* [[Idaho State University|Idaho State]] in [[1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]], which defeated [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in the previous round to end the Bruins' streak of consecutive [[Final Four]] appearances at 10 to end the [[John Wooden]]-era dynasty&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/15/sports/sp-uclahoops15 Bruins were finally floored]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11-seed [[1989–90 Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team|Loyola Marymount]] in [[1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1990]]. One of the team's stars, [[Hank Gathers]], collapsed and died on the court during the WCC Tournament, and teammates (including [[Bo Kimble]], who shot his first free throw of each tournament game left-handed) honored Gathers during the tournament.
* 12-seed [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] and 10-seed [[Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball|Kent State]] in [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]]
* 10-seed [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence College]] in [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1997]]
* 10-seed [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] in [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]]
* 11-seed [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] finished the 2001 regular season on a remarkable run, won Atlantic-10 tournament behind play of Lynn Greer before succumbing to Michigan State.
* 11-seed [[2005–06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team|George Mason]] in [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]], which became the first 11-seed to advance to the Final Four since [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]], after defeating 1-seed [[Connecticut Huskies|Connecticut]] in overtime in the Elite Eight
* 10-seed [[2007–08 Davidson Wildcats men's basketball team|Davidson College]] in [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]]
* 11-seed [[2010–11 VCU Rams men's basketball team|Virginia Commonwealth]] in [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]] (the first [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|"First Four"]] team to advance to the Elite Eight)
* 11-seed [[2013–14 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team|Dayton]] in [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2014]]
* 10-seed [[2015–16 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] in [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2016]]
* 11-seed [[2016–17 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]] in [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2017]]
* 11-seed [[2017–18 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team|Loyola–Chicago]] in [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]]

'''"Gotcha journalism"''' is a pejorative term used by media critics to describe interviewing methods that appear designed to entrap interviewees into making statements that are damaging or discreditable to their cause, character, integrity, or reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Russell (2008). ''Two Cheers for Minority Government: The Evolution of Canadian Parliamentary Democracy.'' p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is rooted in an assertion that the interviewer may be supporting a hidden agenda, and aims to make film or sound recordings of the interviewee which may be selectively edited, compiled, and broadcast or published in order to intentionally show the subject in an unfavorable light.&lt;ref name="Chulanont"&gt;"Be A Freelance Writer". Surayud Chulanont. Global Media. {{ISBN|81-89940-33-3}}, {{ISBN|978-81-89940-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the word [[wikt:gotcha|gotcha]], a contracted form of "got you", and emerged in political journalism during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/10/453978299/gotcha-cant-politicians-handle-tough-questions|title=Gotcha! Can't Politicians Handle Tough Questions?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
"Gotcha" journalism can be used to get a subject with something genuinely discreditable to hide to reveal wrongdoing;{{huh?|date=April 2016}} there can be a fine line between robust and gotcha journalism. Some methods claimed to be gotcha journalism by those involved include moving away from the agreed upon topic of the interview and switching to an embarrassing subject that was agreed to be out-of-bounds and leading the interviewee to discuss it and commit to a certain answer, then, confronting them with prepared material designed to contradict or discredit that position.

Gotcha journalism is often designed to keep the interviewee on the defensive by, for example, being required to explain some of their own statements taken out of context thus effectively preventing the interviewee from clearly presenting their position.&lt;ref name=Chulanont/&gt; The intent of gotcha journalism is always premeditated and used to defame or discredit the interviewees by portraying them as self-contradictory, malevolent, unqualified or immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''With Malice Toward All?''
Patricia Moy, Michael Pfau. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used as an excuse to evade a question to which the interviewee does not know the answer, and where their lack of knowledge would make them appear foolish or uninformed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">Though an abundance of historical reminiscence and legend lay in the storehouse of Jewish literature, none of it was built into [[epic poetry|epic poem]]s until relatively recently. Religious and secular poets, it is true, often treated of such subjects as [[Abraham]] and [[Isaac]] and the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] on Mount Moriah, [[Jacob]] and [[Joseph (dreamer)|Joseph]] and the story of their lives, [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] and the departure from [[Egypt]], [[Joshua]] and the entrance into [[Canaan]], Jeremiah and the fall of [[Jerusalem]], [[Elijah]] the Prophet, etc. These, however, are often considered only poems with an epic coloring; a pure epic poem according to the rules of art was not produced during the Middle Ages.

The stern character of Jewish [[monotheism]] prevented the rise of [[hero]]-worship, without which real epic poetry is impossible. Spanish crypto-Jew, [[Antonio Enríquez Gómez]] is probably one of the first Jewish authors of whom an epic is known (''Sansón Nazareno: Poema heróico'', a Spanish-language heroic epic version of the Samson story),&lt;ref&gt;Enríquez Gómez, Antonio. ''Sansón Nazareno: Poema heróico''. Ed. Moshe Lazar. Lancaster, California: Labyrinthos, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is another modern edition of ''Sansón Nazareno'' edited and introduced in Spanish by María del Carmen Artigas. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=0GZUuYFRTWsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sanson+nazareno&amp;ei=yiR6S4aENoPkzASa3tGJCA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Artigas edition] can be previewed in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; followed closely by [[Solomon de Oliveira]]'s epic ("Elat Ahabim," Amsterdam, 1665). The first to produce an epic poem was [[N. H. Wessely]] with his Mosaide "Shire Tif'eret" (Berlin, 1789-1802), an epic on the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. The influence of a similar work by the German poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] is evident. Next to him stands [[Shalom Kohn]] with his "Ner David", an epic poem on King [[David]] (Vienna, 1834). The influence of these two epics on the readers and poets of that time was considerable.

In addition the following poets may be mentioned from that and the succeeding period: [[Issachar Bär Schlesinger]] ("Ha-Ḥashmona'im," Prague, 1817); [[Samuel Molder]] ("Beruriya," Amsterdam, 1825); [[Süsskind Raschkow]] ("Ḥayye Shimshon," Breslau, 1824); [[Gabriel Pollak]] ("Ha-Keritot," Amsterdam, 1834, and "Ḳiḳayon le-Yonah," ib. 1853); and [[Hirsch Wassertrilling]] ("Hadrat Elisha'," Breslau, 1857, and "Nezer Ḥamodot," ib. 1860). Works of this sort have been written by [[M. I. Lebensohn]], [[Judah Leib Gordon]] ("Ahavat David u-Mikal", Wilna, 1856, and vols. iii. and iv. of his collected works, [[St. Petersburg]], 1883), Chaim N. [[Bialik]], and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky|S. Tschernichowski]].

According to the official 2011 Census of India, there are 50,561 Hmar speakers in Assam, 48,375 in Manipur, 69,175 in Tripura, 1,700 in Meghalaya, 29,587 in Mizoram although Majority of the Hmars in Mizoram speak Duhlian.

Hmar is a recognised language in the School curriculum of Assam, Manipur and Mizoram, and also recently recognised as one of the [[Modern Indian Languages]] (MIL) at [[Manipur University]]. Board of Secondary Education, Assam has also included Hmar as an MIL in its matriculation syllabus from 2005. Both Manipur University and [[Assam University]], Silchar has also permitted HMAR LANGUAGE to be studied as Modern Indian Language in the Graduation level.

==Geographical distribution==
Hmar is spoken in the following locations

*[[Assam]]: [[Dima Hasao district]] (formerly North Cachar district), [[Karbi Anglong district]], Barak Valley ([[Hailakandi district]], [[Karimganj district]]  and [[Cachar district]])
*[[Manipur]]: [[Pherzawl district]], [[Churachandpur district]], [[Jiribam district]], [[Imphal]] and [[Moreh]]
*[[Mizoram]]: [[Aizawl district]], [[Champhai district]] and [[Kolasib district]]
*[[Tripura]]: In and around [[Darchawi]] and [[Jampui Hills]]
*[[Meghalaya]]: [[Shillong]] and Khaddum village 
*[[Myanmar]]: [[Tamu District|Tamu]]
*[[Bangladesh]]: [[Bawm people|Bawm]]


Since Hmar speakers are scattered over a vast area in [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], Tripura, Chittagong Hill tracts, NC Hills and Cachar districts of [[Assam]] state and Myanmar, there appears to be slight dialectal distinction. There is no homogeneous settlement of Hmar speakers alone.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In Manipur, Hmar exhibits partial mutual intelligibility with the other Kukish dialects of the area including [[Thadou language|Thadou]], [[Paite language|Paite]], [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Simte language|Simte]], [[Kom language (India)|Kom]] and [[Gangte language|Gangte]] languages.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Chungkham Yashawanta|title=The linguistic situation in Manipur|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|date=1995|volume=18|issue=1|pages=129–134|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/singh1995linguistic.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isarn''' or '''Izarn''' was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[missionary]], [[Medieval Inquisition|inquisitor]], and writer. Sometime before 1292 he wrote a 700-verse poetic dialogue in [[Occitan]] between himself and a fictitious [[Cathar]] bishop named Sicart de Figueiras. ''Novas del eretge'' ("News of the heretic"), or ''The Controversy of Izarn, with an Albigense Theologian'', as it is known, is a long diatribe against Catharism and its alleged doctrines. Isarn is sometimes inaccurate, but his ignorance, and that of many Catholics, as to the particulars of Cathar dogma, is probably the result of the meetings in thickets and bushes which he describes. The Cathars, in order to preach in the vernacular from vernacular Scriptures, often went into the woods to escape notice; their meetings being held in secret.

Isarn seems to believe that Cathars and [[Waldensians]] both believe some form of [[Manichaeism]]. He defends marriage against virginity as the supreme chastity. He is convinced moreover that the ''Ja no fara crezens heretje ni baudes / Si agues bon pastor que lur contradisses'': Yet they would not believe heretics (Cathars) or Waldensians / If they had a good pastor to contradict them [the heretics]. At the end of the dialogue, the Cathar bishop is converted. Isarn initially portrays the converted heretic as desirous to keep his conversion a secret so that he may easily teach his followers the true faith. Isarn does not let this play out; he soon portrays the bishop as a copy of his own rabid Catholicism.

Lulling’s initial contributions to enhancing the language took place between 2000 and 2002, when he compiled the language’s first computer spellchecker as part of his Ph.D. dissertation at the [[Université Paul Valéry de Montpellier]]. The spellchecker, which consisted of 125,000 words, was known as Projet C.ORT.IN.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibnet.lu Projet CORTINA: Spellchecker fir d'Lëtzebuergescht - Lulling Jérôme Actes du Cycles de conférences Lëtzebuergesch Quo Vadis 2004 (61-78)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids-mannheim.de/pub/extern/eurogerm/eug20.html Ausarbeitung einer luxemburgischen Wörterliste für einen Spellchecker: Projekt CORTINA: Lulling Jérôme in Eurogermanistik Band 20 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lulling, working in partnership with fellow linguists François Schanen and Manfred Peters, compiled and edited the first Luxembourgish-French dictionary, ''Dictionnaire Bilingue Français-Luxembourgeois'', which was published in 2005. The text consisted of 48,000 translated words and phrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundp.ac.be/recherche/publications/page_view/54484/ Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]&lt;/ref&gt; Lulling is also the co-author of Luxdico, the Luxembourgish online dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEn-3LtkFsw August 2, 2003, interview with RTL.lu Radio-Télé Lëtzebuerg (interview in Luxembourgish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lulling has also co-authored two academic papers relating to Luxembourgish: ''Eng Kleng Hëllef fir Lëtzebuergesch ze schreiwen'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.men.public.lu/publications/periodiques/cen_numeros_speciaux/eng_kleng_hellef_letz_schreiwen/eng_kleng_version_web.pdf ''Eng Kleng Hëllef fir Lëtzebuergesch ze schreiwen'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Introduction à l’orthographe luxembourgeoise''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpll.lu/ortholuxs_l.html ''Introduction à l’orthographe luxembourgeoise''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606201848/http://www.cpll.lu/ortholuxs_l.html |date=2007-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Lulling published a DVD to learn Luxembourgish called 'LuxDVD - learning luxembourgish with videos'&lt;ref&gt;[http://luxdvd.wordpress.com/luxdvd-international/ ''LuxDVD'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
Deshpande's critical essays on Marathi literature were published in two volumes as ''Marathi Kadambariche Pahile Shatak'' (मराठी कादंबरीचे पहिले शतक) in 1954 by the [[Sahitya Akademi]].

Four collections of her short essays and short stories have been published:

He joined the Anglo-Vernacular school in [[Thirthahalli]] to continue his middle school education. Kuvempu's father died when he was only twelve. He finished his lower and secondary education in Kannada and English languages in Thirthahalli and moved to [[Mysore]] for further education at the [[Hardwick High School and College|Wesleyan High School]]. Thereafter, he pursued college studies at the [[Maharaja College of Mysore]] and graduated in 1929,  majoring in [[Kannada language|Kannada]].

=== Family ===

Kuvempu has two sons, [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]] and Kokilodaya Chaitra, and two daughters,  Indukala and Tharini. Tharini is married to [[K. Chidananda Gowda|k.Chidananda gowda]] the former Vice-Chancellor of [[Kuvempu University]]. His home in Mysore is called ''Udayaravi'' ("Rising Sun").

== Works and message ==
Kuvempu started his literary work in English, with a collection of poetry called ''Beginner's Muse'' but later switched to his native Kannada. He spearheaded the movement to make Kannada the medium for education, emphasizing the theme "Education in the Mother tongue". To cater to the needs of Kannada research, he founded the ''Kannada Adhyayana Samsthe'' ("Institute of Kannada Studies") in the Mysore University, which has since been renamed after him as "Kuvempu Institute of Kannada Studies". As Vice-Chancellor of Mysore University, he pioneered the study of sciences and languages. He championed the publishing of ''Knowledge for the laymen'' with by G. Hanumanta Rao.

Kuvempu was more than a writer for his life was in itself a 'great message'. He was against [[caste]]ism, meaningless practices and religious ritual. Kuvempu's writings reflect his resentment against these practices. The ''Shoodra Tapaswi'' ("untouchable saint") was one such writing. Kuvempu gave a perspective to the ancient epic [[Ramayana]] that was quite unlike the portrayal of the characters by the original author [[Valmiki]]. Kuvempu's version of the epic called ''[[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]]'' won him the prestigious [[Jnanpith Award]]. His epic underscores his vision of ''Sarvodaya'' ("upliftment of all"). The protagonist of his epic, the Hindu god [[Rama]], personifies this when he tests himself along with his consort [[Sita]] by jumping into the fire.

The speech he made during the convocation ceremony of [[Bangalore University]] was published in the book ''Vichaarakranthige Aahwaana''. It calls for a re-assessment of developmental policies. Though it was delivered in 1974, the message is still considered relevant to modern society. In the year 1987, The Government of Karnataka started the Kuvempu University in the [[Shimoga district]], Karnataka. This is located in the ''Jnana Sahyadri'' campus, 28&amp;nbsp; km from [[Shimoga, Karnataka|Shimoga]] city.

[[France]] has one [[official language]], the [[French language]].  The [[French government]] does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications.  In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the [[European Union]] and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]].  The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Besides French, there exist many other vernacular minority [[languages of France]], both in [[European France]], in [[Overseas France]], and in French [[overseas territories]].  These languages are recognized by article 75-1 of the [[Constitution of France|French constitution]].&lt;ref name="regionsqu"&gt;Article 75-1: (a new article): "Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France" ("Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France"). See [[:fr:Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008|Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In France proper, [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have an official status in the regions where they are spoken.  The 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/lang-reg/rapport_cerquiglini/langues-france.html Les langues de la France, Report of Bernard Cerquiglini]&lt;/ref&gt; written for the French government by [[Bernard Cerquiglini]] identified 75 languages (including just [[#Endangered_languages|eight]] in continental France proper) that would qualify for recognition were the government to ratify the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (currently only signed but not ratified).

== History ==
The [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] of 1539 made French the administrative language of the kingdom of France for legal documents and laws. Previously, official documents were written in medieval [[Latin]], which was the language used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

===Académie française===
The [[Académie française]] was established in 1635 to act as the official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, and to publish an [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|official dictionary of the French language]]. Its recommendations however carry no legal power and are sometimes disregarded even by governmental authorities. In recent years the Académie has tried to prevent the [[Anglicisation]] of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/index.html La langue française » La politique linguistique aujourd'hui] on the site of [[Académie française]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
Prior to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, French kings did not take a strong position on the language spoken by their subjects. However, in sweeping away the old provinces, [[parlement]]s and laws, the Revolution strengthened the unified system of administration across the state. At first, the revolutionaries declared liberty of language for all citizens of the Republic; this policy was subsequently abandoned in favour of the imposition of a common language which was to do away with the other languages of France. Other languages were seen as keeping the peasant masses in [[obscurantism]].

The new idea was expounded in the ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the [[patois]] and to universalise the use of the French language''. Its author, [[Henri Grégoire]], deplored that France, the most advanced country in the world with regard to politics, had not progressed beyond the [[Tower of Babel]] as far as languages were concerned, and that only three million of the 25 million inhabitants of France spoke a pure [[Parisian French]] as their native tongue. The lack of ability of the population to understand the language in which were the political debates and the administrative documents was then seen as antidemocratic.

The report resulted the same year in two laws which stated that the only language tolerated in France in public life and in schools would be French. Within two years, the French language had become the symbol of the national unity of the French State. However, the Revolutionaries lacked both time and money to implement a language policy.

===Third Republic===
In the 1880s, the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] sought to modernize France, and in particular to increase [[literacy]] and general knowledge in the population, especially the rural population, and established free compulsory [[primary education]]. The choice of French for education seemed natural, given that it was the only language widely spoken in France in which a sizable number of newspapers and historical, scientific etc. books were available. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The only language allowed in primary school was French. All other languages were forbidden, even in the schoolyard, and transgressions were severely punished.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge 2001: 218&lt;/ref&gt; After 1918, the use of [[German language|German]] in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was outlawed. In 1925, [[Anatole de Monzie]], Minister of public education, stated that "for the linguistic unity of France, the [[Breton language]] [[language death|must disappear]]." As a result, the speakers of minority languages began to be [[vergonha|ashamed when using their own language]] – especially in the educational system – and over time, many families stopped teaching their language to their children and tried to [[language shift|speak only French with them]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In neighbouring [[Belgium]], a parallel [[Francization of Brussels|policy to expand the use of standard French also took place]].

===Fourth Republic===
The 1950s were also the first time the French state recognised the right of the regional languages to exist. A law allowed for the teaching of [[regional language]]s in secondary schools, and the policy of repression in the primary schools came to an end. The Breton language began to appear in the media during this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Fifth Republic===
The French government allowed in 1964 for the first time one and a half minutes of Breton on regional television. But even in 1972, president [[Georges Pompidou]] declared that "there is no place for minority languages in a France destined to make its mark on Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language and Nationalism in Europe |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Barbour |editor2-first=Cathie |editor2-last=Carmichael |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780191584077 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the constitution was amended to state explicitly that "the language of the Republic is French."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture |editor-last=Hewitt |editor-first=Nicholas |last= |first= |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521794657 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qczzKXFmPCYC&amp;pg=PA141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/evenement/revision/92-554.html |title=Loi constitutionnelle n° 92-554 du 25 juin 1992 |author= |language=French |year=2013 |origyear=1992 |publisher=[[Senate of France]] |work=Senat.fr |accessdate=28 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for providing software and related technical documentation to its employees in English only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report: French court fines US company for not using French language in France |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Toubon Law]].

In 2008, a revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles.&lt;ref name="regionsqu" /&gt;

==== The debate about the Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ====
In 1999 the Socialist government of [[Lionel Jospin]] signed the [[Council of Europe]]’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but it was not ratified. The [[Constitutional Council of France]] declared that the Charter contains  unconstitutional provisions since the Constitution states that the language of the Republic is French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/1999/99-412-dc/decision-n-99-412-dc-du-15-juin-1999.11825.html Décision n° 99-412 DC du 15 juin 1999]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European [[Treaty|convention]] (ETS 148) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language|minority]] languages in [[Europe]], ratified and implemented by 25 States, but not by France, {{As of|2014|lc=on}}. The charter contains 98 articles of which signatories must adopt a minimum of 35 (France signed 39).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The signing, and the failure to have it ratified, provoked a public debate in French society over the charter.

More recently, in a letter to several deputies dated 4 June 2015, [[François Hollande]] announced the upcoming filing of a constitutional bill for the ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vers un projet de loi constitutionnelle pour ratifier la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/06/04/vers-un-projet-de-loi-constitutionnelle-pour-ratifier-la-charte-des-langues-regionales_4647527_823448.html |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30 July 2015, the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] gave an unfavorable opinion on the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Montvalon |first1=Jean-Baptiste |title=Nouvel obstacle à la ratification de la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/08/01/les-langues-regionales-bientot-reconnues-par-la-constitution_4707451_3224.html |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected the draft law on ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405 |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=franceinfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority languages and endangered languages ==
Excluding the languages spoken in the [[Région d'outre-mer|overseas regions]] and other overseas territories, and the languages of recent immigrants, the following languages are spoken by sizeable minorities in France:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=FR Languages of France]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Romance languages]]: [[Caló language|Caló]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Langue d'oïl|Oïl languages]] (other than French), [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish]]), [[Gallo language|Gallo]].
* [[Germanic languages]]: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Flemish]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]].
* [[Celtic languages]]: [[Breton language|Breton]].
* [[Vasconic languages]]: [[Basque language|Basque]].
* [[Romani languages]].

The non-French [[Oïl languages]] and Franco-Provençal are highly endangered; because of their similarity to standard French, their speakers conformed {{clarify|text=in orthography, or in phonological production?|date=October 2017}} much more readily. The other languages are still spoken but are all considered endangered.

In the 1940s, more than one million people spoke Breton as their main language. The countryside in western [[Brittany]] was still overwhelmingly Breton-speaking. Today, about 170,000 people are able to speak Breton (around 8% of the population in the traditionally Breton speaking area), most of whom are elderly. Other regional languages have generally followed the same pattern; Alsatian and Corsican have resisted better, while Occitan has followed an even worse trend.

Accurate information on the state of language use is complicated by the inability (due to constitutional provisions) of the state to ask language use questions in the [[census]].

Since the rejection of ratification of the European Charter, French governments have offered token support to regional languages within the limits of the law. The ''Délégation générale à la langue française'' ([[General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France|General delegation of the French tongue]]) has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had "et aux langues de France" (...and languages of France) added to its title.

The French government hosted the first ''Assises nationales des langues de France'' in 2003{{citation needed span|text=|date=January 2012}}, but this national round table on the languages of France served to highlight the contrast between cultural organisations and language activists on the one hand and the state on the other.

The [[decentralization]] has not extended to giving power in language policy to the regions.

== Opposition to language policy ==
[[Image:Col de Teghime et D81.jpg|thumb|This roadsign in Corsica has had the non-Corsican placenames defaced by [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica|FLNC]] supporters ]]
France presents itself as a big country struggling for [[cultural diversity]] against the predominance of [[English language|English]] in international affairs. According to French republican ideology (see also [[Laïcité]]), all ''citizens'' are equal and therefore no ''groups'' may exercise extra rights; this is an idea stemming from the [[French Revolution]], contrasting with the previous situation in which many groups had special rights and privileges.

This policy of cultural homogeneity has been challenged from both the right wing and the left wing. In the 1970s, nationalist or regionalist movements emerged in regions such as Brittany, Corsica and Occitania. Even though they remain a minority, networks of schools teaching France's regional languages have arisen, such as the [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]] in [[Brittany]], the [[Ikastola]] in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], the [[Calandreta]] in [[Occitania]], and the [[La Bressola]] schools in [[Northern Catalonia]].

Despite popular demand for official recognition, regional language teaching is not supported by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 Meet the French, strong supporters of regional languages – Eurolang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109222240/http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 |date=2014-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in certain areas, such as Brittany, regional councils maintain bilingual public schools as far as it is within the law. Other Breton education is provided by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] schools and private schools, Dihun and [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]], respectively.  In 2011, only 14,000 pupils were enrolled in French-Breton bilingual schools, although this number reflected an increase of around 30% from the year 2006, when the number of pupils was just over 11,000.  The Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg also reported in 2011 that a further 16,000 students from early childhood to adulthood were learning Breton as a second language (at primary schools, collèges, lycées, university or evening courses), bringing the total number of Breton learners to at least 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofis-bzh.org/fr/enseignement/index.php Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg - L'enseignment]&lt;/ref&gt;

A long campaign of defacing road signs led to the first bilingual road signs in the 1980s. These are now increasingly common in Brittany, because of the help given by the [[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]] in bilingualizing many road, town hall and other official signs.

As far as the media are concerned, there is still little Breton to be found on the airwaves, although since 1982 a few Breton-speaking radio stations have been created on an associative basis. The launching of the Breton [[TV Breizh]] in 2000 was intended to offer wider coverage of Breton. However, Breton-language programme schedules gradually decreased in favour of French-language broadcasting, until in 2010 they totally disappeared.

In Corsica, the 1991 "Joxe Statute", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsu. At the primary school level Corsu is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level,&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.ac-corse.fr/lcc_20/file/1890/ Dispositif académique d’enseignement de la langue corse dans le premier degré, année scolaire 2010-2011], Academy of Corsica&lt;/ref&gt; but is required at the [[University of Corsica Pascal Paoli|University of Corsica]].

There is some opposition to the [[Loi Toubon]] mandating the use of French (or at least a translation into French) in commercial advertising and packaging, as well as in some other contexts.

[[Idioms]] in the [[Thai language]] are usually derived from various natural or cultural references. Many include rhyming and/or alliteration, and their distinction from [[aphorism]]s and proverbs are not always clear. This is a list of such idioms.

'''Muhammad Mansuruddin''' (31 January 1904 – 19 September 1987) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] author, literary critic, essayist, lexicographer and biographer from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite web|author=Wakil Ahmed|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mansuruddin,_Muhammad|title=Mansuruddin, Muhammad|accessdate=June 15, 2015|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an authority on folklore and was famous for a huge collection of age-old folk songs, mostly anthologised in thirteen volumes under the title [[Haramoni]]. In recognition of his lifelong contribution to folklore collection and research, the [[Rabindra Bharati University]] awarded him [[D.Litt.]] degree in 1987.

==Early life and education==
On 31 January 1904 Mansuruddin  was born to Muhammad Jaider Ali (father) and Jiarun Nisa (mother) in the Muraripur village under Sujanagar thana of Pabna district of [[East Bengal]] of the [[British India]], now in Bangladesh. His education started in a rural school called Madhabchandra Nandi Pathshala. He matriculated from the Khalilpur High School 1921. He did ISc from the [[Pabna Edward College]] in 1923 and then IA from the [[Rajshahi College]] in 1924, both IA and ISc being equivalent to [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|HSC]]. He obtained his bachelor's degree (BA) from the [[Rajshahi College]] in 1926. He studied in the department of Indian Vernacular of the [[Calcutta University]] from where he secured M. A. (Master of Arts) with a First Class in 1928.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; While a student of the Rajshahi College, he was married to Sharifun Nisa in 1925. They had six sons and six daughters.

==Teaching career==
In 1929 he joined government service as a school sub-inspector. While posted in Naogaon, he came to meet with [[Annadashankar Roy]] who was then the sub-divisional officer (SDO). His career as a teacher commenced in 1932 when he joined the [[Dhaka Islamic Intermediate College]] to teach English language and literature. From 1935 to 1938 he taught at the Howrah Intermediate College, [[Calcutta]]. From 1938 to 1941, he taught Bengali language and literature in the [[Chittagong College]]. Then he joined the Rajshahi College and taught from 1941 to 1943. He was a professor of Bengali language and literature at the Murray Chand College in Sylhet from 1948 to 1952. Professor Monsooruddin taught at the [[Dhaka College]] since 1952 from where he retired in 1959. During the same time, he taught in the Bengali Department of the [[Dhaka University]] as a part-time faculty-member. Also, he served for some time as an instructor at the [[Police Academy, Sardah]]. As a teacher he was very interesting and attractive to his pupils.

==Literary career==
Mansuruddin started to write at a very early stage. Although collection of folklore remains his greatest work, he wrote literary essays and fiction all through his life. His most notable literary contribution is however collection of over six thousand folk songs from different rural areas of Bengal. In 1952 he worked as editor of monthly literary [[Mah-e Now]] for about six months (on deputation from government service).

He spent fifty to sixty years in collecting [[Baul]] songs and other rural songs. He transcribed without caring for lexical accuracy. He took down as he heard from the mouth of the singers. He collected a huge number of folklore poems and songs many of which were collected in thirteen volumes during his lifetime. He also collected songs of [[Lalon Fakir]] and wrote on him. Also, in 1974, he translated some songs of Lalon Fakir for the international audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=79564 The long tradition of Bengal mysticism&lt;/ref&gt; He often encouraged younger folklorists to research following internationally recognised scientific conventions. At the same time he advised folklore researchers to travel to the rural sources of the folklore items to discover the life behind it.

==Life style, personality, dream==
He was an humble person with firm personality. He pursued a simple life. Long shirt and pyjama constituted his principal attire. He worked with conviction and confidence. As a teacher he was very devoted. It has been said that Professor Monsooruddin was a maverick and had his own style of teaching. In teaching Bengali language and literature, he chose English as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aide Memoire -Dacca/1954 by Hasnat Abdul Hye
{{cite web |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2005/dec/05/oped.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070730212853/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/dec/05/oped.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was very warm and friendly but when it came to literary criticism he was always very objective and outspoken. He was reputed for his unabashed comments on literary scenario. He was not a family man. Also, his focus on earthly gains was little. After settling down in Dhaka in 1932, he resided in an ordinary house in Shanti Nagar area of Dhaka city. This is known as ''Monsoor Bhavan'. Personally a devout [[Muslim]], he took deep interest in [[Sufism]], [[Yoga]] and [[tantra|Tantric]] cults. He was an unassuming person and never boasted of his achievements. He collected folklore materials in original and unedited form and dreamt that a Folklore Institute will be established for institutional research. He emphasised the need for translation for sensitising the international readers of the richness of Bengali folk music.

==Important works==
Apart from Haramoni ('হারামণি'), his notable collection was Lalon Fakir-er Gaan ('লালন ফকিরের গান' : Songs of Lalan Fakir), published in 1948. ''Lalan Geetika'' ('লালন গীতিকা') was published subsequently. Folksongs of Lalan Shah in English rendering was published in 1974. Introduction of different volumes of Haramoni are revealing and educative. In the Introduction of Volume V of Haramoni, he wrote, "No contemporary poet is to be compared with Lalon. The song of Lalon Shah bears the quaking of life and delightful reason why the rural indigent people preserve it. This song quenches the spiritual musical thirst, in fact, though Lalon is unlettered but his songs are full of refulgent. The language of Shah is more glorious than Dasharoti Ray, Modhu Kanan even than the language of Ram Prasad-No other his contemporary Muslim poet can be compared with him, even the poem of great litterateur [[Meer Mosharraf Hossain]] is not as lofty as that of Lalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshmoves.com/literature.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822122143/http://www.bangladeshmoves.com/literature.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of [[Vaishnab]] Kabita was published in 1942. He wrote two novels which were ''First July'' ('পহেলা জুলাই') (1932) and  ''Satashey March''('সাতাশে মার্চ') (1958). He produced three volumes of folktales, namely, ''Shirni'' (1932), ''Agar baati'' (1935) and ''Shiropa'' (1938). He published translation of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1940. His essays were published in several volumes. These included ''Dhaner Manjari'' (1933) and ''Kabya Samput'' (1948). His notable work is ''Muslim Contribution in Bengali Literature'' was published in 3 volumes between 1960 and 1981. Other prose works are ''Conflict between the Hindus and the Mussalmans''  (1981) and  ''Vaishnab Kabita by Muslim composers'' (1942). Muhammad Monsooruddin, another prominent folklorist of Bangladesh, took up the task of collecting Baul songs, which had been started by Tagore. After the publication of the first volume (1939) with perface form Tagore, in 1942, Calcutta University published his second volume of Hara-Mani (Lost Gems), which included a few hundred songs. Since then 12 additional volumes of his collections have been published in Dacca. Jassim Uddin, who started his career as a collections of folksongs and folktales. He was, however, most famous for his use of folklore themes in dramas and in poetry. His published folksong collections include Rangila Nayer Majhi (The Boatman of the Green Boat) in 1938. His collection of humorous folktales, published in Bengali as Bangalir Hashir Galpa (1960) appeared along with English translation. He also published Jarigan (1968) and many other publications. Special mention should be made of Late Abbas Uddin, a scholar, accomplished singer, and collector of folksongs. His influence in the contemporary folklore movement of our country is immense. Hundreds of his genuine folksong records pressed by commercial recording companies sold like hot cakes. Popularly known as the father of Bengali Folk-songs Abbas Uddin has made folksongs popular and has created a school of folksingers in Bangladesh. These three scholars, Muhammad Monsooruddin, Jassim Uddin and Abbas Uddin, represented the country at Folklore Conferences held in London, at Indian a University in Bloomington and the Germany, in past years.

He wrote several biography books including ''Iraner Kobi'' (1968), biography of prophet [[Muhammad]] titled ''Hazrat Muhammader Jiboni O Sadhona'', ''Hazrat Shah Waliullah'' and ''Harun Rashid''. His books for children included ''Bokami'' (1952), ''Thokami'' (1958) and ''Mushkil Ahsan'' (1958). He compiled a dictionary of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] idioms under the title ''Hashir Ovidhan'' in 1957.

He is one of the pioneers of Bengali folklore collection and research. Owing to rural origin, he was aware of folklore ballads and songs of oral tradition. He was impressed by the richness of [[Bengali folk music]] and decided to collect them before they are fully lost into oblivion. Starting from 1920s, he travelled from place to place and met people to collect folk songs that spread through oral medium. For Haramoni, he visited hundreds of villages of [[Rajshahi]], [[Pabna]], [[Nadia district|Nadia]], [[Murshidabad]], [[Mymensingh]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], [[Barisal]], [[Noakhali]] and Dhaka. He was encouraged by the works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Kshitimohan Sen]], Pallikobi [[Jasimuddin]], singer [[Abbas Uddin]] and painter [[Zainul Abedin]]. He was inspired when his collection of a song of Lalon Fakir sung by Premdasa Bairagi was published in the Haramoni section of the monthly literary magazine [[Probashi]]. It is quoted below.

===Haramoni===
''Haramoni'' was the name of a regular section of monthly literary magazine Probashi that was dedicated for publishing folk songs collected from rural areas. Mansoor uddin picked up this name for publishing his collection of folklore. The first volume of Haramoni (''Lost Jewels'' in English translation), essentially an anthology of Baul songs, was published in 1931. Mansoor uddin himself published this volume which was printed by Karim Box Brothers. Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote the preface of the book when its first volume was published. In 1942, the second volume was published by the Calcutta University. In 1948, Mansoor uddin took initiative to publish the third volume of Haramoni. The [[University of Dhaka]] published the fourth volume in 1959. The manuscript contained 400 songs and as many as 300 of them got lost. The fourth volume contained many songs of [[Pagla Kanai]]. The fifth volume was edited by Professor [[Muhammad Abdul Hye]] and published by the Department of Bengali, Dhaka University, in 1961. It contained many songs of Lalon Fakir and Pagla Kanai. Again it is Mansoor uddin who at his own initiative published the sixth volume of Haramoni in 1967. However, by then [[Bangla Academy]] had published the seventh volume in 1964. The sixth volume contained nearly two hundred songs of Lalon Fakir. The seventh contained about seven hundred songs many of which were collected from Sylhet area. Also there was some of Panjeri Shah or Panju Shah. Mansuruddin added an 84 pages long introduction to this volume that focused on the life of Hason Raja, Panju Shah, Shitalansha Shah, Arkum Shah, Monomhon, Radharaman, Dwija Das, Sheikh Bhanu, Qurban, Abdul Jabber, Madan Ganbi, Shah Mohammad Yasin, Ram Gopal, Kala Chand Pagla, Ananta Goshai and Abdul Wahed, among others. The eighth volume contained more than eight hundred songs collected from Kushtia, Faridpur, Pabna and Dhaka. It was published in 1976. It is the Bangla Academy that published the ninth volume in 1988. However, the tenth volume was already published in 1984. The 13th volume was published in 1984 by the Bangladesh Folklore Parishad. As many as eight more volumes remain to be published by the Bangla Academy, Dhaka. Apart from Baul songs, Haramoni contains a huge number of rural songs of different categories like ''Meyeli gaan'', ''Baro maishya'' and ''Deha Tatwa''.&lt;ref&gt;http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2009/07/24/news0854.htm A lyricist of mystic heart&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5448">"'''Nation language'''" is the term coined by scholar and poet [[Kamau Brathwaite]]&lt;ref name=Voice /&gt;&lt;ref name=McArthur&gt;McArthur, Tom,
 [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-NATIONLANGUAGE.html "Nation language"], ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and now commonly preferred to describe the work of writers from the [[Caribbean]] and the [[African diaspora]] in non-standard [[English language|English]], as opposed to the traditional designation of it as "[[dialect]]", which Brathwaite considered carries pejorative connotations that are inappropriate and limiting.&lt;ref name=McArthur /&gt; 

In the words of [[Kamau Brathwaite]], who is considered the authority of note on nation language and a key exemplar of its use:&lt;ref&gt;Montague Kobbe, [http://montaguekobbe.com/index.php/2010/12/26/caribbean-identity-and-nation-language/ "Caribbean Identity and Nation Language in Kamau Brathwaite's Poetry"], ''MEMO FROM LA-LA LAND'', 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;We in the Caribbean have a [...] kind of plurality: we have [[English language|English]], which is the imposed language on much of the archipelago. It is an imperial language, as are [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. We also have what we call [[creole English]], which is a mixture of English and an adaptation that English took in the new environment of the Caribbean when it became mixed with the other imported languages. We have also what is called nation language, which is the kind of English spoken by the people who were brought to the Caribbean, not the official English now, but the language of slaves and labourers, the servants who were brought in.&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;Brathwaite, ''History of the Voice: The Development of Nation Language in Anglophone Caribbean Poetry'' ([[New Beacon Books]], 1984), pp 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writers who also notably use nation language include [[Samuel Selvon]], [[Louise Bennett]], [[John Figueroa]], [[Archie Markham]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], [[Marc Matthews]], [[John Agard]], [[Jean Binta Breeze]], as well as others of a younger generation. Poet and scholar [[Mervyn Morris]] ("one of the first academics to espouse the importance of nation language in helping to define in verse important aspects of Jamaican culture", according to [[Ralph Thompson (poet)|Ralph Thompson]])&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=52317 "Professor Mervyn Morris Named First Poet Laureate In 60 Years"], ''The Gleaner'', 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[V. S. Reid]]'s 1949 novel ''[[New Day (novel)|New Day]]'' as the first literary work to use [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican vernacular]] as the language of narration.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Mervyn, "Introduction" to V. S. Reid’s ''New Day''. Caribbean Writers Series 4. Kingston &amp; London: Heinemann, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brathwaite's ''History of the Voice'' (1984), he discusses the prominence of pentameter in English poetic tradition, claiming that since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and with a few notable exceptions, pentameter has been the prevailing rhythm of English poetry. Brathwaite suggests that such imported literary forms may not be suitable to express the Caribbean experience. He writes, "The hurricane does not roar in pentameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brathwaite|first1=|title=History of the Voice|date=1984|publisher=|location=|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is here that nation language becomes of use to the Caribbean poet:
{{Quote|text=It is ''nation language'' in the Caribbean that, in fact, largely ignores the pentameter. Nation language is the language which is influenced very strongly by the African model, the African aspect of our New World/Caribbean heritage. English it may be in terms of some of its lexical features. But in its contours, its rhythm and its timbre, its sound explosions, it is not English, even though the words, as you hear them, might be English to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brathwaite|first1=|title=History of the Voice|date=1984|publisher=|location=|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brathwaite describes reading an article by the [[Martinique|Martinician]] poet and critic [[Édouard Glissant]], in which Glissant describes nation language as a "forced poetics" because it was used strategically by slaves in order to both disguise and maintain their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brathwaite|first1=|title=History of the Voice|date=1984|publisher=|location=|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ethnopoetics.com/pdf/Alcheringa_New-2-2_1976.pdf|last1=Glissant|first1=Édouard|title=Free and Forced Poetics|journal=Alcheringa: Ethnopoetics: A First International Symposium|date=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Esperanto speakers''' ([[Esperanto]]: ''denaskuloj'' or ''denaskaj esperantistoj'') are people who have acquired [[Esperanto]] as one of their [[native language]]s.  As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Corsetti, Renato (1996). [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/lplp/1996/00000020/00000003/art00004 A mother tongue spoken mainly by fathers]. Language Problems and Language Planning 20: 3, 263-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergen" /&gt; Estimates from associations indicate that there were around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Corsetti, Pinto, &amp; Tolomeo (2004) "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/lplp/2004/00000028/00000003/art00003 Regularizing the regular]: The phenomenon of overregularization in Esperanto-speaking children", ''Language Problems and Language Planning,'' 28:261–282&lt;/ref&gt;  In all known cases, speakers are natively [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], or multilingual, raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.&lt;ref name=Bergen&gt;Benjamin Bergen (2001), "[http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/papers/NEJCL.pdf Nativization processes in L1 Esperanto]", ''Journal of Child Language'' 28:575–595 doi:10.1017/S0305000901004779&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lindstedt"&gt;{{Cite journal

Raising children in Esperanto occurred early in the history of the language, notably with the five children of [[Montagu C. Butler|Montagu Butler]] (1884–1970).  Because of this, some families have passed Esperanto on to their children for several generations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Klünder family [http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/3rd-gen-native-esperanto-speaker-nils/ (interview with a second&lt;!--not third! see the comment by his father--&gt;-generation native Esperanto-speaker], ''Esperanto Language Blog'', 2013 Jun 13)&lt;/ref&gt;  A famous native speaker of Esperanto is businessman [[George Soros]], son of [[Tivadar Soros]], publisher and writer in Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Do You Say 'Billionaire' in Esperanto?|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/how-do-you-say-billionaire-in-esperanto/|date=December 16, 2010|first=Alison Leigh|last=Cowan|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also notable are young Holocaust victim [[Petr Ginz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ginz, Petr.

Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region, outside of temporary gatherings (such as conventions like the [[World Congress of Esperanto]]) and isolated offices (such as the [[World Esperanto Association]]'s central office in [[Rotterdam]]). Consequently, native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged.  For this reason, many parents consider it important to bring their children regularly to Esperanto conventions such as the annual "Renkontiĝo de Esperanto-familioj" (or "Esperantistaj familioj"; REF, since 1979). Similarly, the annual {{Interlanguage link multi|Children's Congress of Esperanto|2=eo|3=Internacia Infana Kongreseto|preserve=1}} happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention, the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] (''Universala Kongreso'').

==Grammatical characteristics==
{{see also|Esperanto grammar}}
The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents.  In some cases this is due to interference from their other native language (the [[adstrate]]), but in others it appears to be an effect of [[language acquisition|acquisition]].

Bergen (2001) found the following patterns in a study of eight native-speaking children, aged 6 to 14, who were bilingual in Hebrew (two siblings), Slovak (two siblings), French, Swiss German, Russian, and Croatian.&lt;ref name="Bergen" /&gt;

*Phonological reduction (usually to [[schwa]]) of vowels in common grammatical suffixes and one-syllable grammatical words. This occurred about 5% of the time.  The reduced grammatical suffixes were mostly the ''-o'' of nouns and ''-as'' of present-tense verbs, but occasionally also the ''-a'' of adjectives.  Reduced grammatical words included personal pronouns (which all end in ''i''), the article ''la'' 'the', and prepositions such as ''al'' 'to' and ''je'' (a generic preposition). The article ''la'' was sometimes omitted with the Slavic speakers, as might be expected as a contact effect. 
*Proper nouns were generally unassimilated, either to Esperanto grammatical suffixes or to stress patterns.  Proper nouns are common exceptions to grammatical rules in many languages, and this patterns in common among L2-speakers of Esperanto as well.  However, stress was also observed to vary in native words, for example ''nómiĝas'' 'is/am called' and ''ámikoj'' 'friends' (stress expected on the ''i'' in both cases).
*Children were not observed to use compound tenses (''esti'' + a participle) or aspectual affixes (''ek-, -iĝi, -adi, re-, el-'') on verbal roots.  Except for simple passives, the parents were not observed to use compound tenses either.  However, they did use aspectual affixes (at least in the formal context of Bergen's interviews), but nonetheless the children did not use such affixes even when their other language was Slavic, where aspectual affixes are important.  The closest thing to such forms that the children were observed to use were ''fini'' + verb 'stop doing something', ''komenci'' + verb 'start doing something', ''ankoraŭ'' 'still', and ''kaj poste'' 'and then'; but even then, usage was not as common as equivalents in the adstrate language.  ''-Iĝi'' was, however, used on adjectival roots:
::''Malheliĝas kaj ili ankoraŭ estas ĉe la plaĝo.'' – It's becoming dark and they are still on the beach.
*The word order was mostly [[subject-verb-object|SVO]]. [[object-subject-verb|OSV]] order was also attested, but half of all instances were with the Swiss German-speaking child, and Swiss German allows preposing the object.
*Related to the fixed word order, there is evidence that the [[accusative case]] has become redundant.  Usage closely reflects the role of case in the adstrate language, being used only where consistent with the other language, but not always ever there.  Usage ranged from ≈100% with the Slovak-speaking children, to 0% with the French-speaking child,&lt;ref&gt;Bergen did not count the set expression ''saluton!'' 'hello!', which was used by all the children but involves no active grammar.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the French mother consistently used the accusative case in her own speech.  Slovak has an accusative case on nouns, French does not.  Other children used the accusative in only some of the contexts required by standard Esperanto, largely reflecting usage in their other language.  There were other patterns to emerge as well. The Croatian child, for example, used the accusative only on personal pronouns immediately following a verb (underlined):
::''En la sepa, unu infano &lt;u&gt;prenis&lt;/u&gt; lia'''n''' ŝtrumpo.'' (Standard: ''lia'''n''' ŝtrumpo'''n''') – At seven o'clock, a child &lt;u&gt;took&lt;/u&gt; hi'''s''' sock.
:but
::''Poste li iris kaj poste li &lt;u&gt;prenis&lt;/u&gt; en unu mano lia simio.'' (Standard: ''lia'''n''' simio'''n''') – Then he went and then he &lt;u&gt;took&lt;/u&gt; in one hand his monkey.

Among children that do use the accusative, its usage may be regularized from adult usage, at least at young ages. For example, when a screw dropped out of a lock, a young (≤ 5-year-old) child said it ''malvenis la pordo'''n'''.'' Besides the novel use of ''mal-'' with ''veni'' 'to come' to mean 'come away from', the accusative is not used in adult speech for motion away, but only motion towards.  However, in this case the child generalized the usage of the accusative for direct objects.&lt;ref name=Corsetti/&gt;

Lindstedt, on the other hand, referencing Bergen's study, contends that "it is difficult to find convincing examples of changes introduced by the process of nativisation. All examples proposed seem rather to be due to (1) transfers from the children’s other native languages, (2) differences between the spoken and written register of Esperanto and, in some cases, (3) incomplete acquisition." Some of the features, such as phonological reduction, can be found in the speech of some fluent non-native speakers, while some other, such as the attrition of the accusative, are completely absent from the speech of some native-speaking children.&lt;ref name="lindstedt"/&gt;

==Word derivation==
{{see also|Esperanto vocabulary}}
Native-speaking children, especially at a young age, may coin words that do not exist in the speech of their parents, often for concepts for which Esperanto has a word they do not yet know, by exploiting the morphology of the language.  This is analogous to what adult speakers do for concepts where Esperanto lacks a word, and indicates that some of the grammatical alterations that adult learners may find difficult come easily to native-speaking children.  For example,&lt;ref name=Corsetti&gt;Corsetti, Pinto, &amp; Tolomeo (2004) "Regularizing the regular The phenomenon of overregularization in Esperanto-speaking children", ''Language Problems &amp; Language Planning,'' 28:3, pp. 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;

*Antonyms in ''mal-''
:The prefix ''mal-'' is extremely productive, and children extend it beyond the usage they hear:
::''malmiksi'' 'to separate' (''miksi'' to mix)
::''malpluvi'' 'to stop raining' (''pluvi'' to rain)
::''malscias'' 'is ignorant of' (''scias'' knows)
::''malnuna'' 'past' (''nuna'' present)
::''malfari'' 'to break (un-make)' (''fari'' to make)
::''maltie'' 'here' (''tie'' there)
::''malstartas'' 'turn off (an engine)' (''startas'' 'starts', standard Esperanto ''ŝaltas'' 'switches on')
::''malĝustigis'' 'broke' (''ĝustigis'' repaired, made right)
::''malsandviĉiĝis'' 'became (a shape) which isn't a sandwich anymore' (''sandviĉ-iĝis'' 'became a sandwich', of a brother playing with cushions)
::''malstelita'' 'not surrounded by stars' (of the moon; from ''stelita'' 'starred')
::''malmateno'' 'evening' (''mateno'' morning)
::''malio'' 'nothing' (''io'' 'something'; standard Esperanto ''nenio'' 'nothing')
::''malinterne'' 'externally' (''interne'' internally)
::''malgraveda'' 'no longer pregnant' (''graveda'' pregnant)

::''elektrujo'' 'a battery' (''elektro'' electricity)

*Tendencies in ''-ema''
::''ventrema'' 'fat' (tending to belly-ness, from ''ventro'' 'belly')

*Feminine in ''-ino''

::''langeti'' 'to give a little lick' (diminutive, from ''lango'' tongue)
::''dentumado'' 'activity with teeth' (''dento'' tooth, ''-umi'' doing something undefined with, ''-ado'' noun of action)
::''kuvi'' 'to have a bath' (''kuvo'' 'tub'; standard Esperanto ''bani sin'' 'to bathe oneself')
::''mukis'' '(my nose) was running' (''muko'' 'snot', by analogy with ''sangis'' 'bled', from ''sango'' 'blood')

::''mi superruliĝos vin'' 'I will roll over you' (an intransitive verb ending in ''-iĝos'' won't normally take an object in the accusative case, but here it is necessary because the preposition ''super'' 'over' has been moved to the verb ''rul'' 'roll'.  Without the suffix ''-iĝos'', however, the meaning would be a transitive 'I will roll you over'.)

*Adverbs from verbs
::''Ege halte, ege paŭze, ege salte'' 'very stoppingly, very pausingly, very jumpily'

*Adverbs from nouns and prepositions
::''Ene estas akve'' 'inside is wet' (''akvo'' 'water'; standard Esperanto is ''malseke'', an adverb being required because no specific thing is wet.)

# Absence of ''tanwīn'' and its residues.
# Absence of affricated variants of /g/ (&lt; */q/) and /k/.
# Absence of final /n/ in the imperfect, 2nd person feminine singular, 2nd person masculine plural, and 3rd person masculine plural.

'''Parween Pazhwak''' (born in 1967 in [[Kabul]]) is an Afghan artist from Afghanistan and a modern  poet and writer of the [[Persian literature|Persian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/3070764-the-youth-and-citizenship-in-the-democratic-society-of-afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Parween was born to the Pazhwak literary and political family, her father and mother being Ne'matulla Pazhwak and Afifah Pazhwak, respectively. Parween is the grand daughter of [[Abdul Rahman Pazhwak]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hozhaber.com/HozhaberPublications/ParweenPazhwak_Home.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

She went to the French-taught Malalai school and completed studying medicine in the Avicenna Medical Institute. Following the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union]]'s invasion of Afghanistan, she spent two years in Pakistan as a [[Afghan refugees|transit refugee]] before moving to Canada as an asylum seeker. She now lives in Ontario together with her husband and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.211toronto.ca/Gatekeeper?WebAppId=apt&amp;RequestedSubmitAction=OrgInfo&amp;searchKey=orgid&amp;searchValue=BRA0103&amp;toPrint=true&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Pazhwak considers the best time in her life to be her days as a student and life in exile to be among her most difficult times. Her works of literature include modern [[Persian poetry]], short stories, and paintings for children. She has eleven works of art in total so far. Two of her most famous published books are ''Darya dar Shabnam'' (''Oceans in Dew'') and  ''Negin-ha wa Setara-ha'' (''Gems and Stars'').

'''Pijin''' (Solomons Pidgin or Neo-Solomonic) is a [[language]] spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is closely related to [[Tok Pisin]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Bislama]] of [[Vanuatu]]; these might be considered dialects of a single language. It is also related to [[Torres Strait Creole]] of [[Torres Strait]], though more distantly.

In 1999 there were 307,000 second- or third-language speakers with a literacy rate in first language of 60%, a literacy rate in second language of 50%.&lt;ref name="Language of Solomon Islands"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=pis |title=Pijin, A language of Solomon Islands |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Ethnologue |author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.) |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== 1800–1860 ===
During the early nineteenth century, an English [[Jargon]], known as [[Beach-la-Mar|Beach-La-Mar]], developed and spread through the Western Pacific as a language used among traders ([[Lingua franca]]) associated with the [[whaling]] industry at the end of the 18th century, the [[sandalwood]] trade of the 1830s, and the ''[[Sea cucumber (food)|bêche-de-mer]]'' trade of the 1850s.&lt;ref name="BeachLaMar"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jargon of the Western Pacific |pages=295 |journal=Nature |issue=2200 |year=1911 |volume=88  |author=William Churchill | doi= 10.1038/088295a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1860–1880 ===
Between 1863 and 1906, [[blackbirding]] was used for the [[sugar cane]] plantation labour trade in [[Queensland]], [[Samoa]], [[Fiji]] and [[New Caledonia]]. At the beginning of the trade period, the Australian planters started to recruit in the [[Loyalty Islands]] early 1860s, [[Kingsmill Islands]] and the [[Banks Islands]] around the mid-1860s, [[New Hebrides]] and the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in the early 1870s, and [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]] from 1879 when recruiting became difficult. Around 13,000 Solomon Islanders were taken to Queensland during this labour trade period.&lt;ref name="My nephew is my aunt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Features and transformations of kinship terminology in Solomon Islands Pijin'. In Processes of Language Contact: Studies from Australia and the South Pacific |pages=99–122 |author=ed Jeff Siegel |year=2000 |publisher=Fides |location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (Kanaka) pidgin language was used on the plantations and became the lingua franca spoken between Melanesian workers (the Kanakas, as they were called) and European overseers. When Solomon Islanders came back to the Solomons at the end of their contract, or when they were forcefully repatriated at the end of the labour trade period (1904), they brought pidgin to the Solomon Islands. Old people today still remember the stories that were told by the old former Queensland hands many years after their return
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jourdan|first=Christine|author2=Roger Keesing |title=From Fisin to Pijin: Creolization in process in the Solomon Islands|journal=Language in Society|year=1997|volume=26|pages=401–420|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=4180792&amp;jid=LSY&amp;volumeId=26&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=4180784|doi=10.1017/s0047404500019527}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jourdan|first=Christine|title=Legitimacy of Solomon Island Pijin|journal=Anthropological Notebooks |volume=2|pages=43–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1880–1900 ===
Plantation languages continued into the 20th century even though the process of blackbirding had ceased. Due to the changing nature of labour traffic there was a divergence of Samoan plantation Pijin and New Guinea [[Tok Pisin]] and also other plantation Pijin and Oceanic Pijins such as [[Bislama]] and Solomon Pijin.

=== After 1900 ===
In 1901, there were approximately 10,000 Pacific Islanders working in Australia, most in the sugar cane industry in Queensland and northern New South Wales, many working as [[indentured labourers]]. The [[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]], [[Parliament of Australia]] was the facilitation instrument used to deport approximately 7,500 Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref name="hrc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/forum/Erace/history.html |title=A history of South Sea Islanders in Australia |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |author1=Tracey Flanagan |author2=Meredith Wilkie |author3=Susanna Iuliano |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 1911 approximately 30,000 Solomon Islanders were indentured labourers to Queensland, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="maggie"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginners Pijin Handbook |pages=3 |author=Maggie Wateha'a |publisher=RAMSI |location=Honiara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Pijin by churches and missionaries assisted in the spread of Pijin.

With Pax Britannica and the advent of the local plantation system in the Solomon Islands, the use of Pijin was reactivated and the language started to spread in the country.  It also acquired more Solomonic linguistic characteristics.  Throughout the 20th century Pijin kept spreading: historical events such as Maasina Rule and WWII, and social changes such as urbanisation, played a central role in the transformation of the language. It is now the lingua franca of the country, though it has no official status.

=== 2000s ===
Despite being the lingua franca of the Solomon Islands, Pijin remains a spoken language with little to no effort made thus far on the part of the national government toward standardising its orthography and grammar. Efforts at standardisation have been made by Christian Associations such as SITAG. There exist a partial dictionary since 1978 (Simons and Young 1978), a full dictionary of Pijin since 2002 (Jourdan 2002), a spelling list (Beimers 2010) and a complete description of its grammar (Beimers 2009). This being the case Pijin remains a very flexible language where the main focus is on message delivery irrespective of the niceties of formal sentence construction.  A translation of the Bible into pijin also represents a standardisation of some aspects of Pijin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ringer|first1=David|title=Solomon Islands government celebrates Pijin Bible release|url=http://www.wycliffe.net/Stories/tabid/67/Default.aspx?id=1082&amp;country=BP|accessdate=8 October 2014|agency=Wycliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pijin, like other languages to which it is related, involves a distinction between singular, dual, trial, and plural pronouns. Dual forms refer to two people or things, trial forms refer to three, and plural forms refer to three or more. These pronoun forms are not present in English, but are common in many other South Pacific languages.

Clusivity:

Pijin pronouns also use different forms to distinguish between inclusive and exclusive pronouns. The inclusive and exclusive features are only realised in the first person dual, trial, and plural pronoun forms. For example, the first person dual inclusive pronoun, ''iumitufala'', means ‘we’ (you and me, including the listener), whereas the first person dual exclusive pronoun, ''mitufala'', means ‘we’ (him/her and me, excluding the listener). This dual inclusive pronoun is used quite frequently in the Solomon Islands. It is most often used in religious sermons when the speaker is referring to a relationship between himself/herself and a specific individual in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pacific Languages in Education|year=1996|publisher=Bluebird Printery Ltd|location=Suva, Fiji|pages=191–205|author=Ernest W.

== Linguistic topics ==
{{Empty section|date=May 2013}}

== Transitive verb suffix ==
In comparison to their original English forms Pijin transitive verbs have an additional morpheme in the form of a suffix. To the English speaker, these morphemes sound like VERB + 'him' or 'them.' The suffix is realised through the morphemes -m, -im, and -em. For example, the Pijin word for 'love' would be ''lavem''.

== Epenthesis ==
Another linguistic phenomena that occurred in the transitions from English to Solomand Islands' Pijin is the addition of vowels in the interior and final positions of a word. Like most languages in the Solomon Islands consonant clusters and consonant-final words do not occur in Pijin. Therefore, speakers of the language add vowels in between consonants in and word finally to adapt the English forms to Pijin grammar. The selection of the extra vowels is usually made in accordance with vowel harmony rules. For example, the word 'business' ({{IPA|[bɪznɛs]}}) becomes ''bisinis'' or ''bisinisi'' (depending on the age and dialect of the Pijin speaker).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Englishes|year=1989|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Great Britain|pages=25–35|author=Christine Jourdan|edition=Vol. 8, No. 1|authorlink=Nativization and Anglicization in Solomon Islands Pijin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poula''' is an [[Angami–Pochuri languages|Angami-Pochuri language]] that is predominantly spoken by the [[Poumai Naga]] people in [[Senapati district]] in [[Manipur]] and [[Phek district]] in [[Nagaland]].

==History==
There is a dearth of written literature in Poula language. Some written Poula appeared in form of the Bible and Christian hymns, translated by the Bible Society of India in 2009. Prior to that a Poumai Literary Society was formed in 2007 with the intention of producing reading materials in the language. In order to standardize the language, the Poumai Literary Society has attempted [[koineization]], which was not successful as it was not possible to account for all the varieties of the language. This was partly due to the fact that the Poula language and its varieties have not been identified, described or analyzed yet. To standardize the orthography, we first need to understand the phonlogy of the language. &lt;br&gt;
==Phonetics and phonology==
[[Phonology]] of Poula lacks [[syllable coda]] and also disallow [[consonant clusters]] in [[Syllable onset|onset]] position. There are 25 consonant [[phonemes]] in Poula. &lt;br&gt;
===Consonants===

In Poula, the phoneme /ə/ is written with the [[grapheme]] '[[ü]]' (now, many use it as 'ii') in Bible and Hymns which was devised by Bible Society of India. In addition Poula lacks high back round vowel [u] as a monophthong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Veikho|first1=Sahiinii Lemaina|last2=Sarmah|first2=Priyankoo|title=Vowels and tones in Poula|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area, 41(1),22-45.|date=2018|url=https://benjamins.com/catalog/ltba.16022.lem}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but [u] is present in nexus of diphthong; for example pou [pəu] `father'.

===Tones===
Poula is a [[tonal language]], however tone is still not marked in the [[orthography]]. There are four [[tonemes]] in Poula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Veikho|first1=Sahiinii Lemaina|last2=Khyriem|first2=Barika|title=Poula phonetics and phonology: An initial overview|journal=North East Indian Linguistics 7,47-62, Canberra, Australian National University: Asia-Pacific Linguistics Open Access.|date=2015|url=https://www.academia.edu/20383374/Poula_phonetics_and_phonology_An_Initial_overview_Poumai_Naga_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King George III's Royal Proclamation '''For the Encouragement of Piety and Virtue, and for the Preventing and Punishing of Vice, Profaneness and Immorality''' exhorted the British public against sexually explicit material.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} It called for the suppression of all 'loose and licentious Prints, Books, and Publications, dispersing Poison to the minds of the Young and Unwary and to Punish the Publishers and Vendors thereof'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Groups which promoted it included the Proclamation Society, which became The [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]] which was instituted in 1802 to 'check the spread of open vice and immorality, and more especially to preserve the minds of the young from contamination by exposure to the corrupting influence of impure and licentious books, prints, and other publications...'.{{Cite quote|date=July 2011}} This had little effect, because they had no power to destroy the material.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

It was issued on 1 June 1787 – after [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Beilby Porteus|Bishop Porteous]] agreed to solicit (in the words of one source) "a Royal Proclamation such as earlier sovereigns had used in times of moral crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rupp |first=Ernest Gordon |title=Religion in England, 1688-1791 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-826918-2}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to once source, it was first made a "made a legal document" during the reign of Queen Anne,&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiArAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22WE+most+seriously+and+religiously+considering%22&amp;ei=qMlcSsHWM5bozAShsdAL&amp;client=firefox-a |title=The Republican |volume=II|publisher= |editor=Richard Carlile|date=January–April 1820 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;—it was "Given at our court at St. James" on 25 February 1702-3 by Queen Anne in the first year of her reign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUEyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT192&amp;lpg=PT192&amp;dq=%22WE+most+seriously+and+religiously+considering%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7OVwG37bEV&amp;sig=3lJBOzrKSRJ3ZkCVugwXoM7JaXo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lslcSrj3DaTIMrmbgZIH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 |title=Cobbett's complete collection of state trials and proceedings for high |authors=William Cobbett, David Jardine |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and secretary Lord Bolingbroke was "the instrument of introducing it into the House of Commons".:&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;*This version issued by King George III was to be read four times a year in churches, was still being published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in ?1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofliquorl020144mbp/historyofliquorl020144mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "History of liquor licensing in England principally from 1700 to 1830." |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorialist writing in 1820 commented that:
::"This proclamation is now considered, both by its deliverer and receiver, as a mere usual and common place document. Those who have been present at the opening of an assize, must have perceived that the clerk of the court yawns over it two or three times whilst reading it; and it ever puts the priests to the blush, when they find it necessary to read it."{{Cite quote|date=July 2011}}

==Overruled==
The next law on sexually explicit material, the [[Obscene Publications Act]] (introduced in September 1857 by Lord Campbell, the Lord Chief Justice) replaced this proclamation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

He was at the forefront in the endeavour to revive literature in Nepal Bhasa that had become stagnant as a result of official suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Contributions to Nepalese Studies, Volume 22| work = | publisher =Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| year=1995| accessdate =}} Page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been honored with the title Great Poet.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed).

==Early life==
Mahaju was born in Kel Tol, [[Kathmandu]] to father Laxmi Narayan and mother Harsha Laxmi. He studied at home under various tutors, and married Ganga Devi at an early age.

==Career==

Mahaju looked after his family's cloth shop as a young man after a stint in government service in 1886. He had to travel frequently to [[Kolkata]], India to purchase stock, and he took advantage of the opportunity to browse libraries and book stores.

In Kathmandu, he spent more time composing poetry than looking after business, and his cloth shop suffered. Finding it difficult to make ends meet, he went to [[Birgunj]] to work for a trader as a freight forwarder. Mahaju returned to Kathmandu after a few years when business dried up. His economic condition worsened; and in 1927, he got a job as an assistant at a medicine shop.

Distressed by an unhappy family life and bad health, Mahaju went to live with his sister during his final days. He died at [[Pashupati]].&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed). ''Jheegu Sahitya ("Our Literature").'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Mahaju wrote more than 44 books of poetry, epics, short stories and essays. ''Sajjan Hridayabharan'', a book of poems on morals, was the only one published during his lifetime. It was published from [[Bettiah]], India in 1920. Mahaju composed ''Siddhi Ramayana'', a translation of the epic [[Ramayana]] in Nepal Bhasa, in 1913. It was published by Thaunkanhe Prakashan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Amatya, Siddhidas (2010). ''Siddhi Ramayana.'' Kathmandu: Thaunkanhe Prakashan. {{ISBN|9789937228220}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable works include ''Satyasati'' (an epic on female education and considered to be his best work, written in 1913) and ''Siddhi Vyakaran'' (a grammar of Nepal Bhasa, written in 1927).&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

==Legacy==
In 1980, the Postal Service Department of the government of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp of Mahaju.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.rajan.com/stamps/st1980.htm| title =List of Nepali Postage Stamps Issued| work = | publisher =| year=| accessdate = 1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A street in central Kathmandu was named Siddhidas Marg in his honor by [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg| title =Addressed Road Network Map| work =| publisher =Kathmandu Metropolitan City| date =| accessdate =1 January 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111006214525/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg| archivedate =6 October 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Mahaju was erected in [[Hetauda]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.mankakhalah.org.np/mankapau/page5.jpg | title = Hetauday Mahakavi Siddhidasya Jhwata (Statue of Great Poet Siddhidas in Hetauda)| work = Manka Pau: Newsletter of Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala | publisher =Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala | year= September 2006| accessdate = 19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], a '''substitution cipher''' is a method of [[encrypting]] by which units of plaintext are replaced with [[ciphertext]], according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.

Substitution ciphers can be compared with [[transposition cipher]]s. In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.

There are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a '''simple substitution cipher'''; a cipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed '''polygraphic'''. A '''monoalphabetic cipher''' uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a '''polyalphabetic cipher''' uses a number of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.

==Simple substitution==
[[Image:ROT13.png|thumb|300px|right|[[ROT13]] is a [[Caesar cipher]], a type of substitution cipher. In ROT13, the alphabet is rotated 13 steps.]]

Substitution of single letters separately—'''simple substitution'''—can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet in some order to represent the substitution. This is termed a '''substitution alphabet'''. The cipher alphabet may be shifted or reversed (creating the [[Caesar cipher|Caesar]] and [[Atbash]] ciphers, respectively) or scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a ''mixed alphabet'' or ''deranged alphabet''. Traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order.

Using this system, the keyword "&lt;tt&gt;zebras&lt;/tt&gt;" gives us the following alphabets:
{|
|''[[Plaintext]] alphabet:''
| &lt;tt&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|''[[Ciphertext]] alphabet:''
| &lt;tt&gt;ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY&lt;/tt&gt;
|}
A message of

 flee at once. we are discovered!

''enciphers to''

 SIAA ZQ LKBA. VA ZOA RFPBLUAOAR!

Traditionally, the ciphertext is written out in blocks of fixed length, omitting punctuation and spaces; this is done to help avoid transmission errors and to disguise word boundaries from the [[plaintext]]. These blocks are called "groups", and sometimes a "group count" (i.e., the number of groups) is given as an additional check. Five-letter groups are traditional, dating from when messages used to be transmitted by [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]:

 SIAAZ QLKBA VAZOA RFPBL UAOAR

If the length of the message happens not to be divisible by five, it may be padded at the end with "[[Null character|null]]s". These can be any characters that decrypt to obvious nonsense, so the receiver can easily spot them and discard them.

The ciphertext alphabet is sometimes different from the plaintext alphabet; for example, in the [[pigpen cipher]], the ciphertext consists of a set of symbols derived from a grid. For example:
&lt;div align="center"&gt;[[Image:A-pigpen-message.svg|320px|An example pigpen message]]&lt;/div&gt;
Such features make little difference to the security of a scheme, however – at the very least, any set of strange symbols can be transcribed back into an A-Z alphabet and dealt with as normal.

In lists and catalogues for salespeople, a very simple encryption is sometimes used to replace numeric digits by letters.

He said it was derived from the phrase "Make Profit," with the phrase's 10 letters corresponding to the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0. Thus, with the letter A standing for 2 and P standing for 5, a reference to "file this in the APP file" meant a bribe was authorized at 2.55 percent of sales. - A spokesman for Siemens said it has no knowledge of a "Make Profit" encryption system."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security for simple substitution ciphers===
Although the traditional keyword method for creating a mixed substitution alphabet is simple, a serious disadvantage is that the last letters of the alphabet (which are mostly low frequency) tend to stay at the end. A stronger way of constructing a mixed alphabet is to perform a [[transposition cipher#Columnar transposition|columnar transposition]] on the ordinary alphabet using the keyword, but this is not often done.

Although the number of possible [[key (cryptography)|key]]s is very large (26! ≈ 2&lt;sup&gt;88.4&lt;/sup&gt;, or about [[key size|88 bits]]), this cipher is not very strong, and is easily broken. Provided the message is of reasonable length (see below), the [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by analyzing the [[frequency distribution]] of the ciphertext. This allows formation of partial words, which can be tentatively filled in, progressively expanding the (partial) solution (see [[frequency analysis#An example|frequency analysis]] for a demonstration of this). In some cases, underlying words can also be determined from the pattern of their letters; for example, ''attract'', ''osseous'', and words with those two as the root are the only common [[English language|English]] words with the pattern ''ABBCADB''. Many people solve such ciphers for recreation, as with [[cryptogram]] puzzles in the newspaper.

According to the [[unicity distance]] of [[English language|English]], 27.6 letters of ciphertext are required to crack a mixed alphabet simple substitution. In practice, typically about 50 letters are needed, although some messages can be broken with fewer if unusual patterns are found. In other cases, the plaintext can be contrived to have a nearly flat frequency distribution, and much longer plaintexts will then be required by the cryptanalyst.

== Homophonic substitution==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Homophonic substitution cipher]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
[[Image:Babington postscript.jpg|thumbnail|right|The forged nomenclator message used in the [[Babington Plot]]]]
An early attempt to increase the difficulty of frequency analysis attacks on substitution ciphers was to disguise plaintext letter frequencies by '''[[homophony (writing)|homophony]]'''. In these ciphers, plaintext letters map to more than one ciphertext symbol. Usually, the highest-frequency plaintext symbols are given more equivalents than lower frequency letters. In this way, the frequency distribution is flattened, making analysis more difficult.

Since more than 26 characters will be required in the ciphertext alphabet, various solutions are employed to invent larger alphabets. Perhaps the simplest is to use a numeric substitution 'alphabet'. Another method consists of simple variations on the existing alphabet; uppercase, lowercase, upside down, etc. More artistically, though not necessarily more securely, some homophonic ciphers employed wholly invented alphabets of fanciful symbols.

One variant is the '''nomenclator'''. Named after the public official who announced the titles of visiting dignitaries, this [[cipher]] combines a small [[codebook]] with large homophonic substitution tables. Originally the [[code (cryptography)|code]] was restricted to the names of important people, hence the name of the cipher; in later years it covered many common words and place names as well. The symbols for whole words (''[[codeword]]s'' in modern parlance) and letters (''cipher'' in modern parlance) were not distinguished in the ciphertext. The [[Rossignols]]' [[Great Cipher]] used by [[Louis XIV of France]] was one.

Nomenclators were the standard fare of [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] correspondence, [[espionage]], and advanced political [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] from the early fifteenth century to the late eighteenth century; most conspirators were and have remained less cryptographically sophisticated. Although [[government]] [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] [[cryptanalyst]]s were systematically breaking nomenclators by the mid-sixteenth century, and superior systems had been available since 1467, the usual response to [[cryptanalysis]] was simply to make the tables larger. By the late eighteenth century, when the system was beginning to die out, some nomenclators had 50,000 symbols.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Nevertheless, not all nomenclators were broken; today, cryptanalysis of archived ciphertexts remains a fruitful area of [[history|historical research]].

The [[Beale ciphers]] are another example of a homophonic cipher. This is a story of buried treasure that was described in 1819–21 by use of a ciphered text that was keyed to the Declaration of Independence. Here each ciphertext character was represented by a number.  The number was determined by taking the plaintext character and finding a word in the Declaration of Independence that started with that character and using the numerical position of that word in the Declaration of Independence as the encrypted form of that letter.  Since many words in the Declaration of Independence start with the same letter, the encryption of that character could be any of the numbers associated with the words in the Declaration of Independence that start with that letter. Deciphering the encrypted text character ''X'' (which is a number) is as simple as looking up the Xth word of the Declaration of Independence and using the first letter of that word as the decrypted character.

Another homophonic cipher was described by Stahl&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, Fred A., ''On Computational Security'', University of Illinois, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, Fred A. "[http://www.computer.org/plugins/dl/pdf/proceedings/afips/1973/5081/00/50810565.pdf?template=1&amp;loginState=1&amp;userData=anonymous-IP%3A%3AAddress%3A+67.188.203.8%2C+%5B172.16.161.5%2C+67.188.203.8%2C+127.0.0.1%5D%20 A homophonic cipher for computational cryptography]", afips, pp. 565, 1973 Proceedings of the National Computer Conference, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first{{Citation needed|reason=An early method, sure, but the first...?|date=June 2014}} attempts to provide for computer security of data systems in computers through encryption. Stahl constructed the cipher in such a way that the number of homophones for a given character was in proportion to the frequency of the character, thus making frequency analysis much more difficult.

The [[book cipher]] and [[straddling checkerboard]] are types of homophonic cipher.

[[Francesco I Gonzaga]], [[Duke of Mantua]], used the earliest known example of a homophonic substitution cipher in 1401 for correspondence with one Simone de Crema.&lt;ref&gt;David Salomon.

== Polyalphabetic substitution==
{{Main article|Polyalphabetic cipher}}
Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were first described in 1467 by [[Leone Battista Alberti]] in the form of disks. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in his book ''Steganographia'' ([[Ancient Greek]] for "hidden writing") introduced the now more standard form of a ''tableau'' (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). A more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] in his book, ''De Furtivis Literarum Notis'' ([[Latin]] for "On concealed characters in writing").

In a polyalphabetic cipher, multiple cipher alphabets are used. To facilitate encryption, all the alphabets are usually written out in a large [[table (information)|table]], traditionally called a ''tableau''. The tableau is usually 26×26, so that 26 full ciphertext alphabets are available. The method of filling the tableau, and of choosing which alphabet to use next, defines the particular polyalphabetic cipher. All such ciphers are easier to break than once believed, as substitution alphabets are repeated for sufficiently large plaintexts.

One of the most popular was that of [[Blaise de Vigenère]]. First published in 1585, it was considered unbreakable until 1863, and indeed was commonly called ''le chiffre indéchiffrable'' ([[French language|French]] for "indecipherable cipher").

In the [[Vigenère cipher]], the first row of the tableau is filled out with a copy of the plaintext alphabet, and successive rows are simply shifted one place to the left. (Such a simple tableau is called a ''[[tabula recta]]'', and mathematically corresponds to adding the plaintext and key letters, [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 26.) A keyword is then used to choose which ciphertext alphabet to use. Each letter of the keyword is used in turn, and then they are repeated again from the beginning. So if the keyword is 'CAT', the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet 'C', the second under 'A', the third under 'T', the fourth under 'C' again, and so on. In practice, Vigenère keys were often phrases several words long.

In 1863, [[Friedrich Kasiski]] published a method (probably discovered secretly and independently before the [[Crimean War]] by [[Charles Babbage]]) which enabled the calculation of the length of the keyword in a Vigenère ciphered message. Once this was done, ciphertext letters that had been enciphered under the same alphabet could be picked out and attacked separately as a number of semi-independent simple substitutions - complicated by the fact that within one alphabet letters were separated and did not form complete words, but simplified by the fact that usually a ''tabula recta'' had been employed.

As such, even today a Vigenère type cipher should theoretically be difficult to break if mixed alphabets are used in the tableau, if the keyword is random, and if the total length of ciphertext is less than 27.67 times the length of the keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toemeh|first=Ragheb|year=2014|title=Certain investigations in Cryptanalysis of classical ciphers Using genetic algorithm|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/26543|journal=Shodhganga|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are rarely understood in practice, and so Vigenère enciphered message security is usually less than might have been.

Other notable polyalphabetics include:
* The Gronsfeld cipher. This is identical to the Vigenère except that only 10 alphabets are used, and so the "keyword" is numerical.
* The [[Beaufort cipher]]. This is practically the same as the Vigenère, except the ''tabula recta'' is replaced by a backwards one, mathematically equivalent to ciphertext = key - plaintext. This operation is ''self-inverse'', whereby the same table is used for both encryption and decryption.
* The [[autokey cipher]], which mixes plaintext with a key to avoid [[periodic function|periodic]]ity.
* The [[running key cipher]], where the key is made very long by using a passage from a book or similar text.

Modern [[stream cipher]]s can also be seen, from a sufficiently abstract perspective, to be a form of polyalphabetic cipher in which all the effort has gone into making the [[keystream]] as long and unpredictable as possible.

== Polygraphic substitution==
In a polygraphic substitution cipher, plaintext letters are substituted in larger groups, instead of substituting letters individually. The first advantage is that the frequency distribution is much flatter than that of individual letters (though not actually flat in real languages; for example, 'TH' is much more common than 'XQ' in English). Second, the larger number of symbols requires correspondingly more ciphertext to productively analyze letter frequencies.

To substitute ''pairs'' of letters would take a substitution alphabet 676 symbols long —(&lt;math&gt;26^2 = 676&lt;/math&gt;)—{{DEFAULTSORT:}}. In the same ''De Furtivis Literarum Notis'' mentioned above, della Porta actually proposed such a system, with a 20 x 20 tableau (for the 20 letters of the Italian/Latin alphabet he was using) filled with 400 unique [[glyph]]s. However the system was impractical and probably never actually used.

The earliest practical '''digraphic cipher''' (pairwise substitution), was the so-called [[Playfair cipher]], invented by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1854. In this cipher, a 5 x 5 grid is filled with the letters of a mixed alphabet (two letters, usually I and J, are combined). A digraphic substitution is then simulated by taking pairs of letters as two corners of a rectangle, and using the other two corners as the ciphertext (see the [[Playfair cipher]] main article for a diagram). Special rules handle double letters and pairs falling in the same row or column. Playfair was in military use from the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] through [[World War II]].

Several other practical polygraphics were introduced in 1901 by [[Felix Delastelle]], including the [[bifid cipher|bifid]] and [[four-square cipher]]s (both digraphic) and the [[trifid cipher]] (probably the first practical trigraphic).

The [[Hill cipher]], invented in 1929 by [[Lester S. Hill]], is a polygraphic substitution which can combine much larger groups of letters simultaneously using [[linear algebra]]. Each letter is treated as a digit in [[numeral system|base 26]]: A = 0, B =1, and so on. (In a variation, 3 extra symbols are added to make the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] [[prime number|prime]].) A block of n letters is then considered as a [[vector space|vector]] of n [[dimension]]s, and multiplied by a n x n [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 26. The components of the matrix are the key, and should be [[random]] provided that the matrix is invertible in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{26}^n&lt;/math&gt; (to ensure decryption is possible). A mechanical version of the Hill cipher of dimension 6 was patented in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message Protector patent US1845947|date=February 14, 1929|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US1845947|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hill cipher is vulnerable to a [[known-plaintext attack]] because it is completely [[linear]], so it must be combined with some [[non-linear]] step to defeat this attack. The combination of wider and wider weak, linear [[confusion and diffusion|diffusive]] steps like a Hill cipher, with non-linear substitution steps, ultimately leads to a [[substitution-permutation network]] (e.g. a [[Feistel cipher]]), so it is possible – from this extreme perspective – to consider modern [[block cipher]]s as a type of polygraphic substitution.

==Mechanical substitution ciphers==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:HGM Enigma.jpg|thumb|[[Enigma cipher]] machine as used by the German military in World War II]]
Between circa [[World War I]] and the widespread availability of [[computer]]s (for some governments this was approximately the 1950s or 1960s; for other organizations it was a decade or more later; for individuals it was no earlier than 1975), mechanical implementations of polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were widely used. Several inventors had similar ideas about the same time, and [[rotor machine|rotor cipher machine]]s were patented four times in 1919. The most important of the resulting machines was the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], especially in the versions used by the [[Wehrmacht|German military]] from approximately 1930. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] also developed and used rotor machines (e.g., [[SIGABA]] and [[Typex]]).

All of these were similar in that the substituted letter was chosen [[electric]]ally from amongst the huge number of possible combinations resulting from the rotation of several letter disks. Since one or more of the disks rotated mechanically with each plaintext letter enciphered, the number of alphabets used was substantially more than astronomical. Early versions of these machine were, nevertheless, breakable. [[William F. Friedman]] of the US Army's [[Signals Intelligence Service|SIS]] early found vulnerabilities in [[Hebern rotor machine|Hebern's rotor machine]], and [[GC&amp;CS]]'s [[Dillwyn Knox]] solved versions of the Enigma machine (those without the "plugboard") well before [[World War II|WWII]] began. Traffic protected by essentially all of the German military Enigmas was broken by Allied cryptanalysts, most notably those at [[Bletchley Park]], beginning with the German Army variant used in the early 1930s. This version was broken by inspired mathematical insight by [[Marian Rejewski]] in [[Poland]].

No messages protected by the [[SIGABA]] and [[Typex]] machines were ever, so far as is publicly known, broken.

==The one-time pad==
{{Main article|One-time pad}}
One type of substitution cipher, the [[one-time pad]], is quite special. It was invented near the end of World War I by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] in the US. It was mathematically proven unbreakable by [[Claude Shannon]], probably during World War II; his work was first published in the late 1940s. In its most common implementation, the one-time pad can be called a substitution cipher only from an unusual perspective; typically, the plaintext letter is combined (not substituted) in some manner (e.g., [[XOR]]) with the key material character at that position.

The one-time pad is, in most cases, impractical as it requires that the key material be as long as the plaintext, ''actually'' [[random]], used once and ''only'' once, and kept entirely secret from all except the sender and intended receiver. When these conditions are violated, even marginally, the one-time pad is no longer unbreakable. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] one-time pad messages sent from the US for a brief time during World War II used non-random key material. US cryptanalysts, beginning in the late 40s, were able to, entirely or partially, break a few thousand messages out of several hundred thousand. (See [[Venona project]])

In a mechanical implementation, rather like the [[Rockex]] equipment, the one-time pad was used for messages sent on the [[Moscow]]-[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] [[Moscow–Washington hotline|''hot line'']] established after the [[Cuban missile crisis]].

== Substitution in modern cryptography ==
Substitution ciphers as discussed above, especially the older pencil-and-paper hand ciphers, are no longer in serious use. However, the cryptographic concept of substitution carries on even today. From a sufficiently abstract perspective, modern bit-oriented [[block cipher]]s (e.g., [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], or [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]) can be viewed as substitution ciphers on an enormously large [[Binary numeral system|binary]] alphabet. In addition, block ciphers often include smaller substitution tables called [[S-box]]es. See also [[substitution-permutation network]].

== Substitution ciphers in popular culture ==
*[[Sherlock Holmes]] breaks a substitution cipher in "[[The Adventure of the Dancing Men]]". There, the cipher remained undeciphered for years if not decades; not due to its difficulty, but because [[steganography|no one suspected it to be a code]], instead considering it childish scribblings.
*The [[Al Bhed]] language in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' is actually a substitution cipher, although it is pronounced phonetically (i.e. "you" in English is translated to "oui" in Al Bhed, but is pronounced the same way that "oui" is pronounced in [[French Language|French]]).
*The [[Minbari]]'s alphabet from the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' series is a substitution cipher from English.
*The language in ''[[Starfox Adventures]]: Dinosaur Planet'' spoken by native Saurians and [[List of characters in the Star Fox series#Krystal|Krystal]] is also a substitution cipher of the [[English alphabet]].
*The television program ''[[Futurama]]'' contained a substitution cipher in which all 26 letters were replaced by symbols and called [http://www.gotfuturama.com/Interactive/AlienCodec/ "Alien Language"]. This was deciphered rather quickly by the die hard viewers by showing a "Slurm" ad with the word "Drink" in both plain English and the Alien language thus giving the key. Later, the producers created a second alien language that used a combination of replacement and mathematical Ciphers. Once the English letter of the alien language is deciphered, then the numerical value of that letter (0 for "A" through 25 for "Z" respectively) is then added (modulo 26) to the value of the previous letter showing the actual intended letter. These messages can be seen throughout every episode of the series and the subsequent movies.
*At the end of every season 1 episode of the cartoon series ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', during the credit roll, there is one of three simple substitution ciphers: A -3 [[Caesar cipher]] (hinted by "3 letters back" at the end of the opening sequence), an [[Atbash|Atbash cipher]], or a letter-to-number simple substitution cipher. The season 1 finale encodes a message with all three. In the second season, [[Vigenère cipher]]s are used in place of the various monoalphabetic ciphers, each using a key hidden within its episode.
*In the [[Artemis Fowl series]] by [[Eoin Colfer]] there are three substitution ciphers; Gnommish, Centaurean and Eternean, which run along the bottom of the pages or are somewhere else within the books.
*In ''Bitterblue'', the third novel by [[Kristin Cashore]], substitution ciphers serve as an important form of coded communication.
*In the 2013 video game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', there are substitution ciphers hidden throughout the game in which the player must find code books to help decipher them and gain access to a surplus of supplies.
*In the anime adaptation of ''[[The Devil Is a Part-Timer!]]'', the language of Ente Isla, called Entean, uses a substitution cipher with the ciphertext alphabet &lt;tt&gt;AZYXEWVTISRLPNOMQKJHUGFDCB&lt;/tt&gt;, leaving only A, E, I, O, U, L, N, and Q in their original positions.

{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}
[[File:MV Ascension in Port Canaveral.jpg|thumb|The superstructure of this cargo ship is in the back and includes a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat.]]]]
[[File:Mega smeralda bastia.JPG|right|thumb|The [[cruiseferry]] ''[[MS Mega Smeralda|Mega Smeralda]]''.  The blue and white part of the ship is the superstructure and the yellow part of the ship is the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]].]]

A '''superstructure''' is an upward extension of an existing structure above a baseline. This term is applied to various kinds of physical structures such as [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, or [[ship]]s having the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] zero (in the terms of theory of machines). The word "superstructure" is a combination of the [[Latin]] [[prefix]], ''super'' (meaning ''above, in addition'') with the Latin [[word stem|stem word]], ''structure'' (meaning ''to build'' or ''to heap up'').

In order to improve the [[seismic performance|response during earthquakes]] of buildings and bridges, the superstructure might be separated from its [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] by various [[civil engineering]] [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]s or [[machinery]]. All together, these implement the system of earthquake protection called [[base isolation]].

=={{anchor|Ships}}Aboard ships and large boats==
As stated above, superstructure consists of the parts of the ship or a [[boat]], including [[sailboat]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, [[passenger ship]]s, and [[submarine]]s, that project above her main deck. This does not usually include its [[guyed mast|mast]]s or any [[armament]] [[gun turret|turret]]s. Note that in modern times, turrets do not always carry [[naval artillery]], but they can also carry [[missile launcher]]s and/or [[antisubmarine warfare]] weapons.

The size of a watercraft's superstructure can have many implications in the performance of ships and boats, since these structures can alter their structural rigidity, their displacements, and/or stability. These can be detrimental to any vessel's performance if they are taken into consideration incorrectly.

The height and the weight of superstructure on board a ship or a boat also affects the amount of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] that such a vessel requires along its sides, down to her [[waterline]]. In broad terms, the more and heavier superstructure that a ship possesses (as a fraction of her length), the less the freeboard that is needed.

==Bridges==
On a bridge, the portion of the structure that is the span and directly receives the live load is referred to as the superstructure.  In contrast, the [[abutment]], [[pier]]s, and other support structures are called the substructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Waddell |first=J. A.

'''Talofa''' is a [[salutation (greeting)|salutation]] or [[greeting habits|greeting]] in the [[Samoan language]] of the [[Samoan Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptk9xUamLeUC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=ali'i+Polynesian+word&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SpZDn7s_k_&amp;sig=aR0w9kFPt6OzyKpskgRNioNcsLg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M84yTOa8EYztnQeFvd39Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ali'i&amp;f=false|title=Linguistic anthropology|first=Alessandro|last=Duranti|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|page=217|isbn=1-4051-2632-9|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Talofa'' echoes in such phrases as ''ta'alofa'' in [[Tuvalu]], ''[[aloha]]'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] and ''[[aro'a]]'' in [[Cook Islands Māori]].  Another Samoan salutation ''To life, live long!'' properly translated ''Ia ola!'' also echoes in places such as [[Aotearoa]] ([[New Zealand]]), where the formal greeting in [[Māori language|Māori]] is [[Kia ora]] and in [[Tahiti]] ([[French Polynesia]]) where it is [['Ia orana]].

''Talofa'' is also the greeting of the island of [[Lifou]] ([[New Caledonia]]), and of the island state of [[Tuvalu]]. The word was brought to [[Lifou]] by the Samoan teachers of the [[London Missionary Society]] who converted the population from 1841.

==Etymology==
The Official Government Website of American Samoa says: "Talofa is short for 'Si o ta alofa atu,' -- which means, 'I am happy and delighted to give you my love.' When you respond, 'Talofa lava!' you are reciprocating with a full grant of your love and affection." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100528153743/http://americansamoa.gov/speeches/speech-open-art-fest2008.htm American Samoa Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imaginary''' order is one of a triptych of terms in the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], along with the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]] and the [[The Real|real]].  Each of the trio of terms emerged gradually over time, and underwent an evolution during the development of Lacan's thought.  "Of these three terms, the 'imaginary' was the first to appear, well before the Rome Report of 1953 ... [when t]he notion of the 'symbolic' came to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, looking back at his intellectual development from the vantage point of the 1970s, Lacan epitomised it as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I began with the Imaginary, I then had to chew on the story of the Symbolic ... and I finished by putting out for you this famous Real.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar 22, quoted in James M. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (Albany 2006) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, "Lacan's work is often divided into three periods: the Imaginary (1936–1953), the Symbolic (1953–1963), and the Real (1963–1981)".&lt;ref&gt;D. Hoens and Ed Pluth, in Mellard, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first of these, "Lacan regarded the 'imago' as the proper study of psychology and identification as the fundamental psychical process.  The imaginary was then the ...  dimension of images, conscious or unconscious, perceived or imagined";&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in the decade or two following his delivery of ''Le stade du miroir'' at Marienbad in 1936 that Lacan's concept of the Imaginary was most fully articulated.

==The Imaginary order==
The basis of the Imaginary order is the formation of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] in the "[[mirror stage]]"; by articulating the ego in this way "the category of the imaginary provides the theoretical basis for a long-standing polemic against ego-psychology"&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; on Lacan's part. Since the ego is formed by identifying with the counterpart or specular image, "[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]" is an important aspect of the imaginary. The relationship whereby the ego is constituted by identification is a locus of "alienation", which is another feature of the imaginary, and is fundamentally [[Narcissism|narcissistic]]: thus Lacan wrote of "the different phases of imaginary, narcissistic, specular identification - the three adjectives are equivalent"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; which make up the ego's history.

If "the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real are an unholy trinity whose members could as easily be called Fraud, Absence and Impossibility",&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bowie, ''Lacan'' (London 1991) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; then the Imaginary, a realm of surface appearances which are inherently deceptive, is "Fraud".

==The fragmented body==
For Lacan, the driving-force behind the creation of the ego as mirror-image was the prior experience of the phantasy of the fragmented body.  "Lacan was not a Kleinian, though he was the first in France ... to decipher and praise her work",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Microscopia", in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p.xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; but "the threatening and regressive phantasy of 'the body-in-pieces' ... is explicitly related by Lacan to [[Melanie Klein]]'s paranoid position".&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'' p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  Klein's "specific phantasy ... that something inside the person is seeking to pull him apart and render him dead by dismemberment"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; fuelled for Lacan "the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image ... to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; — to the ego as other-identification, as "Fraud".

==The Symbolic==
With the increasing prominence of the Symbolic in Lacan's thought after 1953, the Imaginary becomes viewed in a rather different light, as structured by the [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]]. It is still the case that "the body in pieces finds its unity in the image of the other ... [or] its own specular image" but no longer does "analysis consist in the imaginary realisation of the subject ... to make it well-rounded, this ego, to ... have definitely integrated all its disjointed fragmentary states, its scattered limbs, its pregenital phases, its partial drives".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 54 and p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, "one finds a guide beyond the imaginary, on the level of the symbolic plane".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar Of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

It also became apparent that the imaginary involves a linguistic dimension: whereas the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] is the foundation of the symbolic, the "signified" and "signification" belong to the imaginary. Thus language has both symbolic and imaginary aspects: "words themselves can undergo symbolic lesions and accomplish imaginary acts of which the patient is the subject. ... In this way speech may become an imaginary, or even real object".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'' p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Lacan of the fifties, "the entire analytic experience unfolds, at the joint of the imaginary and the symbolic",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter as the central key to growth: "the goal in analysizing neurotics is to eliminate the interference in symbolic relations created by imaginary relations ... dissipating imaginary identifications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The Imaginary was the problem, the Symbolic the answer, so that "an entire segment of the analytic experience is nothing other than the exploration of blind alleys of imaginary experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is "in the disintegration of the imaginary unity constituted by the ego that the subject finds the signifying material of his symptoms",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; the "identity crisis ... [when] the false-self system disintegrates".&lt;ref&gt;D. Freshwater and C. Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the late Lacan==
Just as the early predominance of the Imaginary was eclipsed after the Rome Report, so too by the end of the Sixties the Symbolic in turn  would increasingly come to play second fiddle to the Real, as from "this point on, Lacan downplays the Oedipus complex, seen as a mythical – and so imaginarized – version of unconscious organization".&lt;ref&gt;V. Voruz and B Wolf eds., ''The Later Lacan: An Introduction'' (Albany 2007) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lacan could still claim that the "objective of my teaching ... is to dissociate ... what belongs to the imaginary and ... what belongs to the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Encore", in Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, ''Female Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Borromean rings|Borromean knots]], he considered he had found a possible topological counterpart to the interconnections of Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real.  "Lacan's seminar was at times now little more than a silent demonstration of the properties of the interlocking knots which illustrated the imbrication of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==French culture==&lt;!-- This section is linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis' and 'Henri Lefebvre'--&gt;
Use of "the adjective [imaginary] as a noun can ... be traced to the works of the novelist [[André Gide]] ... [and] was probably given greater currency by [Sartre's] ''[[The Imaginary (Sartre)|L'Imaginaire]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lacan's hands, the Imaginary came close to being an omnivorously colonising interpretive machine: thus [[René Girard]] regretted that "To the Lacanian, whatever I call mimetic must correspond to ... 'capturé par l'imaginaire'".&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''To Double Business Bound: Essays on Literature, Mimesis, and Anthropology'' (Baltimore 1988) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[post-Lacanian]] fissiparous tendencies of his "schools", the term can perhaps return to the general culture, as when the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] defines the imaginary "by games of mirroring, of duplication, of reversed identification and [[Psychological projection|projection]], always in the mode of the double",&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1972, 172)&lt;/ref&gt; or when [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] defines the imaginary as the capacity humans have to create other forms of individual and social existence.&lt;ref&gt;"''[L]'apparition chez les humains de l'imaginaire aussi bien au niveau de l'être humain singulier (imagination) qu'au niveau social (imaginaire social ou imaginaire instituant)''." (C. Castoriadis, ''La société et vérité dans le monde social-historique. Séminaires 1986-1987. La création humaine I'', Paris, Seuil, 1996, p. 20; as quoted in: Sophie Klimis, Laurent Van Eynde, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya6xExymbegC&amp;pg= ''L'imaginaire selon Castoriadis: thèmes et enjeux''], Publications Fac St Louis, 2006, p. 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

They are customarily constructed with sidewalls of varying thicknesses held apart by steel or aluminum spreaders.  Spreaders can be interchanged to match the width of the trench.  The different materials and building designs lead to a variety of depth ratings, i.e. the depth of a trench that the shield can withstand a collapse without buckling.  Depth ratings are determined by registered [[professional engineer]]s.

A shield should not be confused with a shore.  While they may serve the same function, [[trench shoring]] is a different physical application that holds up the walls of a trench to prevent collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=David|title=What is Trench Shoring?|url=http://www.iconjds.com/what-is-trench-shoring/|publisher=ICON Equipment|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, use of a trench shield is governed by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] 29 CFR Part 1926.650-.652 Subpart P-Excavations

[[File:Rivera 020.jpg|thumb|250px|Border of Peace between [[Rivera]] and [[Santana do Livramento|Livramento]].]]

'''Uruguayan Portuguese''' ({{lang|pt|português uruguaio}}, {{IPA-pt|poɾtuˈɣes uɾuˈɣwajo|local}}), also known as '''{{lang|pt|fronteiriço}}''' ({{IPA-pt|fɾõteˈɾiso|local}}) and '''{{lang|pt|portunhol riverense}}''' ({{IPA-pt|poɾtuˈɲɔɫ riveˈɾẽse|local}}), is a variety of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with influences from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It is spoken in northern [[Uruguay]], near the Brazilian border, mainly in the region of the twin cities of [[Rivera]] (Uruguay) and [[Santana do Livramento]] (Brazil). This section of the frontier is called ''Frontera de la Paz'' (Border of Peace), because there is no legal obstacle to crossing the [[border]] between the two countries.

The varieties of Uruguayan Portuguese share many similarities with the countryside dialects of the southern Brazilian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], such as the [[denasalization]] of final unstressed [[nasal vowels]], replacement of [[palatal lateral approximant|lateral palatal]] {{IPA|/ʎ/}} with [[semivowel]] {{IPA|/j/}}, no raising of final unstressed {{IPA|/e/}}, [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|/r/}} instead of the [[guttural R]], and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] realization of coda {{IPA|/l/}} instead of [[L-vocalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carvalho|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in Uruguayan Portuguese include the urbanization of this variety, acquiring characteristics from urban [[Brazilian Portuguese]] such as distinction between {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, [[affrication]] of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ĩ/}}, and other features of [[television in Brazil|Brazilian broadcast media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carvalho|2004|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of Portuguese in Uruguay can be traced back to the time of the dominion of the kingdoms of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and the [[Empire of Brazil]]. In those times, the ownership of those lands was not very well defined, passing back and forth from the hands of one crown to the other. Before its independence after the [[Cisplatine War]] in 1828, Uruguay was one of the provinces of the [[Empire of Brazil]].

Portuguese was the only language spoken throughout northern Uruguay until the end of the 19th century. To assure the homogeneity of the newly formed country, the government made an effort to impose the Spanish language into [[lusophone]] communities through educational policies and language planning, and the [[bilingualism]] became widespread and [[diglossic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carvalho|2004|p = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The varieties of Uruguayan Portuguese vary in [[dialect continuum]] which range from [[Rioplatense Spanish]] to [[Brazilian Portuguese]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Nevertheless, it has one variant which is the most used, and could be taken as a case study: this variant is geographically located on the area having the cities of Rivera and Santana do Livramento as its center, and expanding over a strip of several kilometers parallel to the border, including territory of both nations.

==Phonology and orthography==
{{Unreferenced section|date = November 2015}}
The Riverense language does not possess a formally defined orthography, but in this article an orthography of Portuñol will be presented in order to enable its [[phoneme]]s to be represented in the most accurate and consistent possible way, highlighting the [[phonology|phonologic]] features of this language variety. It should be noted that not all Portuñol-speaking persons use the same pronunciation for the same words (as is the case with most languages). Nevertheless, the script that is chosen is very representative of the most frequent and distinctive features.

The chosen representation is the closest to the one that would be used if we tried to transcribe the phonemes to the [[Spanish language]] (because this is the language taught to Uruguayans, which is the nationality of the majority of speakers of this dialect), except for the phonemes that can't be represented through the Spanish alphabet, like, for example the [[nasal vowel]]s.

===Spanish vowels===
The Spanish vowels are the ones which are pronounced like the five vowels of the Spanish language (they also exist in Portuguese):

|-----------------
|''ac'''u'''á''|| {{IPA|[aˈk'''w'''a]}} || ladrar ||latir/ladrar||to bark
|}

===Portuguese vowels===
These vowels are found in Portuguese, but not in Spanish.

====Semiopen vowels====
They are like the vowels '''''e''''' and '''''o''''', but pronounced in a more [[open vowel|open]] way, closer to an '''''a'''''.

{|class="wikitable"
|- style="background-color: #ccf" |
!letter!![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]!!Portuñol!!Pronunciation ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])!!Spanish!!Portuguese!!English
|-----------------
|rowspan="3" | é||rowspan="3" | {{IPA|ɛ}}||''t'''é''''' || {{IPA|[t'''ɛ''']}} ||té||chá||tea
|-----------------
|''p'''é'''l'' || {{IPA|[p'''ɛ'''l]}} ||piel||pele||skin

|-----------------
|''p'''ó'''so'' || {{IPA|[ˈp'''ɔ'''so]}} ||puedo||posso|| (I) can
|}

Distinguishing the open-mid vowels (''é'', ''ó'') is very important because they can completely change the meaning of a word, like in the following examples:

: ''avó'' {{IPA|[aˈvɔ]}} (grandmother) and ''avô'' {{IPA|[aˈvo]}} (grandfather)
: ''véio'' {{IPA|[ˈvɛjo]}} (old (m.)) and ''veio'' {{IPA|[ˈvejo]}} (he came - from the verb ''ví'' [to come])
: ''véia'' {{IPA|[ˈvɛja]}} (old (f.)) and ''veia'' {{IPA|[ˈveja]}} (vein)
: ''póso'' {{IPA|[ˈpɔso]}} ((I) can) and ''poso'' {{IPA|[ˈposo]}} (well)

====Nasal vowels====
The [[nasal vowel]]s are the vowels which are produced by expiring the air partly through the nose and partly through the mouth. They do not exist in Spanish and therefore are generally derived from Portuguese words.

&lt;small&gt;
(*) before s, sh, y, z, ce, ci.

(**) before s, sh, y, z, ce, ci, or when it is the first syllable and is not followed by ga, gue, gui, go, gu, ca, que, qui, co, cu or k.
&lt;/small&gt;

Distinguishing nasal vowels is very important, because they can completely change the meaning of the word, like in the following examples:

: ''paũ'' {{IPA|[ˈpaw̃]}} (bread) and ''pau'' {{IPA|[ˈpaw]}} (stick)
: ''nũ'' {{IPA|[nũ]}} (in a (m.)) and ''nu'' {{IPA|[nu]}} (in the (m.))
: ''nũa'' {{IPA|[ˈnũ.a]}} (in a (f.)) and ''núa'' {{IPA|[ˈnu.a]}} (naked (f.))
: ''ũ'' {{IPA|[ũ]}} (one, a (m.)) and ''u'' {{IPA|[u]}} (the (m.))
: ''cũ'' {{IPA|[kũ]}} (with) and ''cu'' {{IPA|[ˈku]}} (anus - vulgar term)
: ''ũs'' {{IPA|[ũs]}} (some (m.)) and ''us'' {{IPA|[us]}} (the (m.pl.))

====Consonants====
In the next table, when there is a reference to Spanish, it refers to the [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense Spanish dialect]], and where there is a reference to Portuguese, it refers to [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and more specifically the Gaúcho dialect (from the Brazilian Southern state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]).

'''William Henry Harris''' (28 April 1884 &amp;ndash; 23 January 1956) was a British Welsh-speaking priest, academic and translator. Ordained in 1914, he served for most of his life (1919-1941) as a teacher of theology at [[St David's College, Lampeter]], becoming a professor of theology at the college in 1940 and Professor of Welsh in 1941. At the same time he served at [[St David's Cathedral]] as precentor (1933), canon (1937) and treasurer (1948). He translated several hymns and liturgical texts into Welsh. As a theologian he valued the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] inheritance in the reformed churches and fostered this inheritance within the [[Church in Wales]]. He also served as professor of Welsh at [[St David's College, Lampeter]].&lt;ref name="llgc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-HARR-HEN-1884.html|publisher=yba.llgc.org.uk|title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography|accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born on 28 April 1884 at Pantysgellog, [[Dowlais]], [[Glamorgan, Wales]].&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times|articlename=Canon W. H. Harris|section=Obituaries|date=3 February 1956|page_number=11|issue=53445|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were John and Anne Harris, and he attended Merthyr County School. He went on to gain a first-class [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree from [[St David's College, Lampeter]] in 1910, and then a B.Litt. in 1913 and M.A. i 1914 from [[Jesus College, Oxford]], where he held the [[Edmund Meyrick|Meyrick]] Research Scholarship and the Powis Exhibition.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Harris was ordained a deacon in 1913 and a priest in 1914. After first being [[curate]] in [[Ystradgynlais]] in the Swansea Valley, he moved to Christ Church, [[Swansea]], in 1917 and then to All Saints, [[Oystermouth]], Swansea, in the following year.

In 1919 he took the post of lecturer in theology at St David's College, Lampeter.  He was also [[Precentor]] of [[St David's Cathedral]] (1933), becoming a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral in 1937. He accepted the post of Professor of Theology at St David's College in 1940, and in 1941 that of Professor of Welsh. In 1948 he became treasurer of St David's cathedral.

==Career==
After his ordination in 1913, he served as curate in [[Ystradgynlais]] until 1917, when he returned to St. David's College to become a lecturer in theology. He continued in the College, becoming professor of Welsh in 1941 and then senior tutor in 1945.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

He was also a Fellow of the [[British Esperanto Association]] and a keen internationalist.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Harris was a supporter of the catholicity of the Church in Wales and was a founder member of the St David's Society which was set up to promote this. He wrote on this and on other theological topics and served on committees for the Welsh Church Hymnary (translating some of the hymns himself) and the Book of Common Prayer. He was a member of the [[Gorsedd of Bards]], with his [[bardic name]] being "Arthan". He also translated the office of [[Compline]] into Welsh in 1941.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris, William Henry (1884&amp;ndash;1956), priest, Professor of Welsh, St David's College, Lampeter|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-HARR-HEN-1884.html|last=Ellis|first=Mary Gwendoline|year=2007|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calloch - A Genoux.djvu|thumb|''A genoux'' - [[lai breton]]s de Jean-Pierre Callloc'h, 1921]]
'''Yann-Ber Kalloc'h''' (born ''Jean-Pierre Calloc'h'' in [[French language|French]]) (21 July 1888 – 10 April 1917) was a [[France|French]] writer in [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[French language|French]]. He died in combat in [[World War I]], near [[Urvillers]]/[[Cerizy]] ([[Aisne]]).

The [[Bleimor (Scouting)|Breton Scouting organization ''Bleimor'']] is named in his honor.

==Life==
Yann-Ber Kalloc'h was born on the island of [[Groix]] as the son of a fisherman (who died in October 1902) and his wife. He describes his childhood in the autobiographical poem ''{{Interlanguage link multi|I was born in the middle of the sea|fr|3=Me zo ganet e kreiz ar mor}}''. Kalloc'h at first wanted to become a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and entered the minor [[seminary]] of St Anne d'Auray in 1900, then the [[major seminary]] at [[Vannes]] in October 1905. He was forced to renounce his vocation after his two sisters and his younger brother revealed signs of [[mental illness]], since [[canon law]] forbade the priesthood to those who had relatives suffering from such diseases. He became tutor in various cities including Paris. Taking the [[bardic name]] of ''Bard Bleimor'' ([[European sea bass|Sea Bass]]), Kalloc'h wrote for various regionalist and autonomist newspapers in the [[Breton language]].

On October 12, 1915, he wrote a letter to [[Achille Collin]] which became the basis for a 1919 petition in favor of Breton.

In [[Brittany]], at least six streets bear his name.&lt;ref&gt;The names that have made the history of Brittany, 1997{{clarify|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yann-Ber Kalloc'h enlisted in the [[French Army]] during [[World War I]] and was killed in action; his name appears in the [[Panthéon]] with those of 546 other writers who were killed in the war.

==Writings==
The literary work which reveals him to be one of the greatest Breton authors is a posthumous collection, of poems often mystical, as in ''Ar deulin'' (Kneeling, War daoulin year in KLT) published by his friend Pierre Mocaer in 1925. This collection includes the famous poem ''Me 'zo Ganet kreiz ar e mor'' (I was born in the middle of the sea).

In these poems composed in large part to the front, he expresses his deep [[Roman Catholic]] faith, love of his native language and feelings in favor of Breton political autonomy.

{{Japan-company-stub}}
{{nihongo|'''Zebra Co., Ltd.'''|ゼブラ株式会社|Zebura Kabushiki gaisha}} is a Japanese manufacturer of [[writing instruments]]. '''Zebra Pen Corporation''' (the American branch) was founded in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1982 as an independent corporation wholly owned by Zebra Co. Ltd. The company sells a wide range of [[Pen|pens]], [[pencils]], and [[highlighter]]s through retail stores, wholesalers and mail order. The Zebra Pen Corporation offers a line of writing instruments that include ball point pens, gel pens, roller ball pens, fountain pens, mechanical pencils and highlighters.

==Origin of name==
{{Copypaste|date=August 2018}}
The Zebra trademark was adopted in 1914. Legend has it that Mr. Ishikawa, founder of Zebra Co. Ltd., wanted a company name that would be memorable and also appropriate for their export business to other countries. He took an English/Japanese dictionary and, opening it Japanese style from the back, started with the "Z" words. He stopped at ''[[zebra]]''.{{fact|date=June 2014}}

Upon further research, Ishikawa found that zebras are gentle animals with a strong family herding instinct. This was an important attribute, since he wanted to build a business in which employees and customers were all part of a family-like culture. The fact that the zebra looks like it is decorated with large calligraphic pen strokes may have also appealed to the visual image he was seeking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zebrapen.com/about-zebra-pen/ About Zebra "How We Earned Our Stripes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Zebra's line of pens and pencils include "The Original pen" F-301 and the M-301, which have [[stainless steel]] barrels and textured grips. The Jimnie line includes plastic gel-ink pens that are in more vibrant colors as well as a correction pen, while the award-winning Saskatchewpen was designed for use in temperatures down to -50 degrees Celsius.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Other product lines include Zazzle highlighters,Mildliners (mild colored highlighters), Sarasa retractable gel-ink pens, Surari hybrid ink ballpoint pens, and the Z-Grip line.

In late 2010 Zebra announced production of the V-301, a stainless steel fountain pen that features a cartridge filling system, silver steel nib and stainless steel barrel.

=== STEEL ===
The STEEL line of pens include the F-301, F-301 Compact, F-401, and the F-701.  The 301 series is characterized by stainless steel shafts and hardened plastic grips.  The 401 has the same stainless steel shaft with a rubber grip.  Finally, the flagship pen, the 701 has a [[Knurling|knurled]] grip and is completely stainless steel.

=== DelGuard ===
A mechanism employed in the ''DelGuard'' system developed by Zebra, causes the lead sleeve in a mechanical pencil to extend outward when excessive pressure is applied at an angle. When excess vertical pressure is applied on the lead, the lead is automatically retracted inwards. Thus, the lead is protected (within certain limits) in both cases. In Japan, 0.3 and 0.7 versions of the DelGuard is available alongside the 0.5 version, whereas in the US, only the 0.5 version is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zebrapen.com/product/delguard-mechanical-pencil/|title=DelGuard Mechanical Pencil {{!}} Zebra Pen|work=Zebra Pen|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
