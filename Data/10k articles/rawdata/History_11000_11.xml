== Inventions, discoveries, introductions ==
* [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], at its peak, covered an area of around 480,000&amp;nbsp;km² (298 258.172&amp;nbsp;mi²). Its heartland lay in the [[Indus River]] in [[Pakistan]], but settlements spread as far as the Makran coast, [[Balochistan]], [[Afghanistan]], eastern [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]], [[Kutch district|Kutch]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. They included cities like [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Dholavira]], ports like [[Lothal]], [[Sutkagen-dor]] and [[Sokhta Koh]] and numerous villages as well. They used irrigation to farm and constructed cities. The two main cities had sewage systems, bronze, trade tokens (early coins), and hieroglyphs. There were even baths at one of the villages, besides the great baths of brick in each city. Geometry of shrines and altars tends to identify these with the cities of the [[Yajurveda]]: they might easily be a thousand years older than this conservative date.

He strictly made the difference between spontaneous generation, which he did not accept, and the possibility of the evolution of matter from inert to living, without any influence of life. [...] Since the end of the nineteenth century, evolutive abiogenesis means increasing complexity and evolution of matter from inert to living state in the abiotic context of evolution of primitive Earth.

Researchers study abiogenesis through a combination of [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[astrobiology]], [[oceanography]], [[biophysics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], and aim to determine how pre-life [[chemical reaction]]s gave rise to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voet|Voet|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abiogenesis can be [[geophysics|geophysical]], [[Chemistry|chemical]], or [[biology|biological]],&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Davies, Paul |date= 1998 |title= The Fifth Miracle, Search for the origin and meaning of life |publisher= Penguin |page= | isbn= }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of [[carbon]] and [[water]] and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: [[lipids]] (fatty cell walls), [[carbohydrates]] (sugars, cellulose), [[amino acid]]s (protein metabolism), and [[nucleic acids]] (self-replicating DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ward, Peter|author2= Kirschvink, Joe |date= 2015 |title= A New History of Life: the radical discoveries about the origins and evolution of life on earth |publisher= Bloomsbury Press |pages= 39–40 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[molecule]]s, or their components, came into existence.

{{Main|Timeline of the evolutionary history of life}}
{{Life timeline}}
The Hadean Earth is thought to have had a [[secondary atmosphere]], formed through [[Degasification|degassing]] of the rocks that accumulated from [[planetesimal]] [[impact event|impactors]]. At first, it was thought that the Earth's [[atmosphere]] consisted of hydrogen compounds—[[methane]], [[ammonia]] and [[Water vapor|water vapour]]—and that life began under such [[redox|reducing]] conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of [[water vapour]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with smaller amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |date=12 February 1993 |title=Earth's Early Atmosphere |url=http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=259 |issue=5097 |pages=920–6 |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11536547 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074651/http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fesenkov|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Earth lacked the [[gravity]] to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly [[acid]]ic, giving it a [[pH]] of about 5.5.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory."&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to {{convert|500|km|mi}} in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sleep |first=Norman H. |last2=Zahnle |first2=Kevin J. |authorlink2=Kevin J.

The most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota of what is referred to as the "traditional tree of life" based on several molecular studies starting with C.

Studies of [[meteorite]]s suggests that [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] such as [[aluminium-26]] with a [[half-life]] of 7.17×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (717 thousand) years, and [[potassium-40]] with a half-life of 1.250×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (1.25 billion) years, isotopes mainly produced in [[supernova]]e, were much more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007|pp=61–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal heating as a result of [[Convection#Gravitational or buoyant convection|gravitational sorting]] between the [[Earth core|core]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] would have caused a great deal of [[mantle convection]], with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.

The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;Ga.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Belief in spontaneous generation of certain forms of life from non-living matter goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, i.e., that one form of life derived from a different form (e.g., bees from flowers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vartanian|1973|pp=307–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that [[aphid]]s arise from the dew that falls on plants, [[fly|flies]] from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs at the bottom of bodies of water, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lennox|2001|pp=229–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] published his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (subtitled ''Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths''), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His contemporary, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], erroneously refuted him, stating: "To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to ''[[Egypt|Ægypt]]'', and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of ''[[Nile|Nylus]]'', to the great calamity of the Inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balme |first=D. M. |authorlink=David Mowbray Balme |year=1962 |title=Development of Biology in Aristotle and Theophrastus: Theory of Spontaneous Generation |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=7 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1163/156852862X00052 |issn=0031-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] published the first drawings of a [[microorganism]]. Hooke was followed in 1676 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobell|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for [[sexual reproduction]], and [[asexual reproduction]] through [[mitosis|cell division]] had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from [[putrefaction]], and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bondeson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when [[Francesco Redi]] showed that no [[maggot]]s appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be [[biogenesis]]: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (''omne vivum ex ovo'', Latin for "every living thing from an egg").

In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] demonstrated that [[microorganism|microbes]] were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, [[Louis Pasteur]] performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.

The belief that self-ordering by spontaneous generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By the middle of the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. [[John Desmond Bernal]], a pioneer in [[X-ray crystallography]], suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{Main|Biogenesis}}
The term ''biogenesis'' is usually credited to either [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] or to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=eohtBiogenesis&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Hmolpedia |title=Biogenesis |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |accessdate=2014-05-19 |publisher=WikiFoundry, Inc. |location=Ancaster, Ontario, Canada |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520001148/http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |archivedate=20 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with [[John Tyndall]] to mean "life-origination or commencement". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], delivered an address entitled ''Biogenesis and Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968"&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he introduced the term ''biogenesis'' (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as ''abiogenesis'':

:And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of ''Biogenesis''; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of ''Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968" /&gt;

Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, ''The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:

:A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term ''Archebiosis''. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word ''Biogenesis'' to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word ''Biogenesis'' has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word ''Abiogenesis''. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word ''Biogenesis'', and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871|p=[https://ia902701.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/23/items/modesoforiginofl00bast/modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2.zip&amp;file=modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2/modesoforiginofl00bast_0015.jp2&amp;scale=4&amp;rotate=0 xi–xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur and Charles Darwin ===
[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait, increasingly bald with rather uneven bushy white eyebrows and beard, his wrinkled forehead suggesting a puzzled frown|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1879]]
[[Louis Pasteur]] remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyndall Fragments2"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1905|loc=IV, XII (1876), XIII (1878)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had come from somewhere else in the universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a theory, Bernal said, was unscientific. A theory popular around the same time was that life was the result of an inner "[[Vitalism|life force]]", which in the late 19th century was championed by [[Henri Bergson]].

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] put an end to these metaphysical theologies. In a letter to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] on 1 February 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |title=Origin and Evolution of Life on a Frozen Earth |last=Priscu |first=John C |authorlink=John Charles Priscu |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |location=Arlington County, VA |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218070241/http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin discussed the suggestion that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes." He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." He had written to Hooker in 1863 stating that, "It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter." In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he had referred to life having been "created", by which he "really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term "creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=30 18]}}: "It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." — [[Charles Darwin]], 1 February 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Primordial soup" hypothesis ===
{{anchor | Haldane and Oparin: The Primordial Soup Theory}}&lt;!--This section is linked from [[The Selfish Gene]]--&gt;
{{Main|Primordial soup}}
{{further|Miller–Urey experiment}}
[[File:Aleksandr Oparin and Andrei Kursanov in enzymology laboratory 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Oparin]] (right) in his laboratory, 1938]]
No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when [[Alexander Oparin]] reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his book ''The Origin of Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|loc=[http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf ''The Origin of Life'' (A. I. Oparin, 1924), pp. 199–234]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oparin proposed that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Louis Pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of [[sunlight]]. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed [[coacervate]] droplets. These droplets would "[[cell growth|grow]]" by fusion with other droplets, and "[[reproduction|reproduce]]" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive [[metabolism]] in which factors that promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

[[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in its "mature form" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|1987|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The early Earth had a chemically [[reducing atmosphere]].
# This atmosphere, exposed to [[energy]] in various forms, produced simple organic compounds ("[[monomer]]s").
# These compounds accumulated in a "soup" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic vents]] etc.).
# By further transformation, more complex organic [[polymer]]s – and ultimately life – developed in the soup.

About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea ''biopoiesis'' or ''biopoesis'', the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules,&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryson|2004|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.

One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. [[Stanley Miller|Stanley L. Miller]] and [[Harold Urey|Harold C. Urey]] performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] used a highly reducing mixture of gases – [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], as well as [[water vapor|water vapour]] – to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |authorlink=Stanley Miller |date=15 May 1953 |title=A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |bibcode=1953Sci...117..528M |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=13056598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a [[racemic mixture]] of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]s. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centres.

Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.&lt;ref name="pmid21422282"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Eric T. |last2=Cleaves |first2=Henderson J. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |last4=Glavin |first4=Daniel P. |last5=Callahan |first5=Michael |last6=Aubrey |first6=Andrew |last7=Lazcano |first7=Antonio |last8=Bada |first8=Jeffrey L. |display-authors=3 |date=5 April 2011 |title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich spark discharge experiment |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5526.full.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proc.

More recent studies, in October 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the Earth was formed as RNA molecules emerging from "warm little ponds".&lt;ref name="IND-20171002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Ian |title=Life first emerged in 'warm little ponds' almost as old as the Earth itself - Charles Darwin's famous idea backed by new scientific study |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |date=2 October 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003003027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |archivedate=3 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteinoid microspheres ===
{{Main|Proteinoid}}
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, [[Sidney W. Fox]] in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of [[peptide]] structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic [[Peptide|polypeptide]] molecules now named "[[Proteinoid|proteinoid microspheres]]".&lt;ref name="foxexp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html |title=Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life |last=Walsh |first=J.

In another experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a [[cinder cone]] in [[Hawaii]]. He discovered that the temperature was over {{convert|100|C}} just {{convert|4|in}} beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. The amino acids had combined to form [[proteinoid]]s, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called "microspheres". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of [[cyanobacteria]], but they contained no functional [[nucleic acid]]s or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, [[Colin Pittendrigh|Colin S. Pittendrigh]] stated in December 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=wPNPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22&amp;dq=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22 287]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current models ==
There is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses, which share some common elements. While differing in the details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and by J. B. S. Haldane (in 1925), who postulated the molecular or chemical evolution theory of life.&lt;ref name="bah2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahadur |first=Krishna |year=1973 |title=Photochemical Formation of Self–sustaining Coacervates |url=http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy |volume=39B |issue=4 |pages=455–467 |issn=0370-0046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172800/http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}

According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and sulfur compounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=920}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. In the atmosphere proposed by Oparin and Haldane, electrical activity can produce certain small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] reported in 1953 demonstrated this.

Bernal coined the term ''biopoiesis'' in 1949 to refer to the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three "stages":

# the origin of biological monomers
# the origin of biological polymers
# the evolution from molecules to cells

Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage – discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary – as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that [[cell membrane]]s self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates may be a halfway house towards the development of independent free-living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Martin |first= William F. |authorlink= William F.

Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] before 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chyba |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Chyba |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |authorlink2=Carl Sagan |date=9 January 1992 |title=Endogenous production, exogenous delivery and impact-shock synthesis of organic molecules: an inventory for the origins of life |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6356 |pages=125–132 |bibcode=1992Natur.355..125C |doi=10.1038/355125a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11538392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furukawa |first1=Yoshihiro |last2=Sekine |first2=Toshimori |last3=Oba |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kakegawa |first4=Takeshi |last5=Nakazawa |first5=Hiromoto |display-authors=3 |date=January 2009 |title=Biomolecule formation by oceanic impacts on early Earth |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |bibcode=2009NatGe...2...62F |doi=10.1038/NGEO383 |issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of metres. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller-Urey experiments (see below). In the deep [[hydrothermal vent]]s, Everett Shock has found "there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as [[seawater]] and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100 – 150 degrees Celsius, precisely the temperatures at which the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] bacteria and [[Thermoacidophile|thermoacidophilic]] [[archaea]] have been found, at the base of the [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic tree of life]] closest to the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bock|Goode|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic
molecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on Earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;

=== Chemical synthesis ===
While features of [[self-organization]] and [[self-replication]] are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Palasek |first=Stan |eprint=1305.5581v1 |title=Primordial RNA Replication and Applications in PCR Technology |class=q-bio.BM |date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]] self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life,&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |last2=Senkevich |first2=Tatiana G. |last3=Dolja |first3=Valerian V. |date=19 September 2006 |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |page=29 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-29 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1594570 |pmid=16984643}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid16044244"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vlassov |first1=Alexander V. |last2=Kazakov |first2=Sergei A. |last3=Johnston |first3=Brian H. |last4=Landweber |first4=Laura F. |display-authors=3 |date=August 2005 |title=The RNA World on Ice: A New Scenario for the Emergence of RNA Information |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=264–273 |doi=10.1007/s00239-004-0362-7 |issn=0022-2844 |pmid=16044244|bibcode=2005JMolE..61..264V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nussinov |first1=Mark D. |last2=Otroshchenko |first2=Vladimir A. |last3=Santoli |first3=Salvatore |year=1997 |title=The emergence of the non-cellular phase of life on the fine-grained clayish particles of the early Earth's regolith |journal=[[BioSystems]] |volume=42 |issue=2–3 |pages=111–118 |doi=10.1016/S0303-2647(96)01699-1 |issn=0303-2647 |pmid=9184757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; Computer simulations also suggest that [[cavitation]] in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325 Cavitation-Induced Synthesis of Biogenic Molecules on Primordial Earth].

Sci., September 11, 2017, 3 (9), pp 1041–1049. {{doi|10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for [[carbon fixation]] (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCOOH&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and {{convert|100|C}}. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.  In particular, experiments by [[Alexander Butlerov|Butlerov]] (the [[formose reaction]]) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959.  Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.

[[Formamide]] produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Crestini |first2=Claudia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=March 2012 |title=Formamide and the origin of life. |journal=[[Physics of Life Reviews]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |bibcode=2012PhLRv...9...84S |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2011.12.002 |issn=1571-0645 |pmid=22196896|hdl=2108/85168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Botta |first2=Giorgia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=July 2012 |title=From the one-carbon amide formamide to RNA all the steps are prebiotically possible |journal=[[Biochimie]] |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1451–1456 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.018 |issn=0300-9084 |pmid=22738728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects [[aerobic organism]]s ([[eukaryote]]s and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist.

=== Autocatalysis ===
{{Main|Autocatalysis}}
[[Autocatalysis|Autocatalysts]] are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are "molecular replicators." The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological [[macromolecule]]s and in small organic molecules.&lt;ref name="Paul2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Natasha |last2=Joyce |first2=Gerald F. |date=December 2004 |title=Minimal self-replicating systems |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=634–639 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.09.005 |issn=1367-5931 |pmid=15556408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bissette2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bissette |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Fletcher |first2=Stephen P. |date=2 December 2013 |title=Mechanisms of Autocatalysis |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=52 |issue=49 |pages=12800–12826 |doi=10.1002/anie.201303822 |issn=1433-7851 |pmid=24127341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of [[micelle]]s and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]], have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Bissette2013" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and [[Peter Schuster]] examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] in a prebiotic soup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eigen|Schuster|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hypercycle, the [[information]] storing system (possibly RNA) produces an [[enzyme]], which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.

[[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]] has shown that an early error-prone translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as "Orgel's paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=Geoffrey W. |authorlink=Geoffrey W.

Hoffmann has furthermore argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Geoffrey William|title=A network theory of the origin of life|date=24 December 2016|biorxiv=096701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.

=== Homochirality ===
{{Main|Homochirality}}
Homochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of [[chirality|chiral]] units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Rojas|Tureanu|2014|pp=353–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral [[Catalysis|catalyst]], they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystals]], or the Earth's rotation, [[statistical fluctuations]] during racemic synthesis,&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-assembled [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] are essential components of primitive cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt; The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the universe move in a direction in which [[entropy]] increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization.

Chen and Jack W.

Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the [[phospholipid]]s of today.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Such [[micro-encapsulation]] would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased [[solubility]] of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of a [[electrochemical gradient]].

Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the [[genetic code]] arose.&lt;ref name="Noller2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noller |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

[[Eugene Koonin]] said, "Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of [[eternal inflation]] could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite [[multiverse]] with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable."&lt;ref name="pmc1892545"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koonin |first=Eugene V. |date=31 May 2007 |title=The cosmological model of eternal inflation and the transition from chance to biological evolution in the history of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=2 |page=15 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-2-15 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1892545 |pmid=17540027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA synthesis and replication ===
A number of hypotheses of formation of RNA have been put forward. {{As of|1994}}, there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=October 1994 |title=The origin of life on Earth|journal=Scientific American |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=76–83 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1094-76 |issn=0036-8733 |pmid=7524147|bibcode=1994SciAm.271d..76O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b" /&gt; Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on [[clay]] substrates or on the surface of the mineral [[pyrite]].

Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Wendy K. |last2=Unrau |first2=Peter J. |last3=Lawrence |first3=Michael S. |last4=Glasner |first4=Margaret E. |last5=Bartel |first5=David P. |authorlink5=David Bartel |display-authors=3 |date=18 May 2001 |title=RNA-Catalyzed RNA Polymerization: Accurate and General RNA-Templated Primer Extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–1325 |bibcode=2001Sci...292.1319J |doi=10.1126/science.1060786 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11358999|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur.

Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: [[heritability]], variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries.

One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Wächtershäuser's iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by [[Christian de Duve]] based on the chemistry of [[thioester]]s. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] in the early 1980s and [[Stuart Kauffman]]'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.

Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or some other mineral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=7 November 2000 |title=Self-organizing biochemical cycles |journal=Proc.

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]/[[CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase|acetyl-CoA synthase]], harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step.

Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits]] (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the [[Archean]] Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), with additions of [[galena]] (PbS) and [[alabandite]] (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.

The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and [[Origin of eukaryotes|proto-eukaryotes]] evolved. [[Archibald Macallum]] noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macallum |first=A.

The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow "Darwin ponds" lined with porous [[silicate minerals]] mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphorus compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mulkidjanian |first1=Armen Y. |last2=Bychkov |first2=Andrew Yu. |last3=Dibrova |first3=Daria V. |last4=Galperin |first4=Michael Y. |last5=Koonin |first5=Eugene V. |display-authors=3 |date=3 April 2012 |title=Origin of first cells at terrestrial, anoxic geothermal fields |journal=Proc.

The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see [[Iron–sulfur world theory]]. These are highly [[exothermic reaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Reaction 1''': Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen''
:3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 2''': ''Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentine''
:3Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 3''': ''Forsterite + water → serpentine + brucite''
:2Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Reaction 3 describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] and Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[brucite]]). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, ([[calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]) phases formed along with [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in hardened [[Portland cement]] paste after the hydration of [[belite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.

Analogy of reaction 3 with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement: ''Belite + water → C-S-H phase + portlandite''
:2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic [[Proton electromotive force|proton motive force]] (PMF) [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] gradient,&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules," composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as [[mackinawite]], endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by Wächtershäuser.&lt;ref name="Lane 2009" /&gt; This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# [[Diffusion]] force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—[[cations]] like [[proton]]s H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, [[anions]] in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an [[electrochemical gradient]], providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).

Jack W. Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains [[bicarbonate]] and [[calcium]] ions has the most optimal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ignatov |first=Ignat |last2=Mosin |first2=Oleg V. |year=2013 |title=Possible Processes for Origin of Life and Living Matter with modeling of Physiological Processes of Bacterium ''Bacillus Subtilis'' in Heavy Water as Model System |journal=Journal of Natural Sciences Research |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to [[Melvin Calvin]], certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these compounds like [[Hydrogen cyanide|hydrocyanic acid]] (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the [[stromatolite]]s have been created.

Experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and [[Formic acid|formic]], [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvic]] acid out of the dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the water.&lt;ref name="organics"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Usher |first=Oli |date=27 April 2015 |title=Chemistry of seabed's hot vents could explain emergence of life |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/silva/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1526 |publisher=[[University College London]] |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roldan |first1=Alberto |last2=Hollingsworth |first2=Nathan |last3=Roffey |first3=Anna |last4=Islam |first4=Husn-Ubayda |last5=Goodall |first5=Josephine B.

=== Thermosynthesis ===
Today's bioenergetic process of [[fermentation]] is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron–sulfur world. In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of [[chemiosmosis]], which plays an essential role in [[cellular respiration]] and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W. J. |date=7 August 1985 |pages=429–453 |title=Thermosynthesis by biomembranes: Energy gain from cyclic temperature changes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(85)80202-2 |issn=0022-5193 |pmid=3162066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W.

First, life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|binding change mechanism]] of today's ATP synthase, the "first protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.

The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a [[convection]] current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and [[Dissipative system|dissipative structure]] required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.

By [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] cell membrane lipids, this "first protein" gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson,&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999" /&gt; it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.

Whereas the Iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|ATP synthase's binding change mechanism]] resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Anthonie W.

It has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orgel|1987|pp=9–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay hypothesis ===
[[Montmorillonite]], an abundant [[clay]], is a catalyst for the polymerization of RNA and for the formation of membranes from lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Perry |first=Caroline |date=7 February 2011 |title=Clay-armored bubbles may have formed first protocells |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |agency=EurekAlert! |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714101638/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith]] in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1996|pp=148–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.

At the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], James P. Ferris' studies have also confirmed that clay minerals of [[montmorillonite]] catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wenhua Huang |last2=Ferris |first2=James P. |date=12 July 2006 |title=One-Step, Regioselective Synthesis of up to 50-mers of RNA Oligomers by Montmorillonite Catalysis |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=128 |issue=27 |pages=8914–8919 |doi=10.1021/ja061782k |issn=0002-7863 |pmid=16819887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bart Kahr from the [[University of Washington]] and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of [[potassium hydrogen phthalate]]. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Caroline |date=16 July 2007 |title=Crystals as genes? |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |journal=Highlights in Chemical Science |issn=2041-5818 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714094855/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}

=== Gold's "deep-hot biosphere" model ===
In the 1970s, [[Thomas Gold]] proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms [[Microbial metabolism#Hydrogen oxidation|subsist on hydrogen]] released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.

The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the [[galaxy]] to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archivedate=12 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of [[Martian meteorite]]s found in [[Antarctica]] and in studies of [[extremophile]] microbes' survival in outer space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |date=25 September 2002 |title=Tough Earth bug may be from Mars |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |journal=New Scientist |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202003401/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerda Horneck"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |last2=Klaus |first2=David M. |last3=Mancinelli |first3=Rocco L. |date=March 2010 |title=Space Microbiology |journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=121–156 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |issn=1092-2172 |pmc=2832349 |pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabbow"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rabbow |first1=Elke |last2=Horneck |first2=Gerda |last3=Rettberg |first3=Petra |last4=Schott |first4=Jobst-Ulrich |last5=Panitz |first5=Corinna |last6=L'Afflitto |first6=Andrea |last7=von Heise-Rotenburg |first7=Ralf |last8=Willnecker |first8=Reiner |last9=Baglioni |first9=Pietro |last10=Hatton |first10=Jason |last11=Dettmann |first11=Jan |last12=Demets |first12=René |last13=Reitz |first13=Günther |display-authors=3 |date=December 2009 |title=EXPOSE, an Astrobiological Exposure Facility on the International Space Station – from Proposal to Flight |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=581–598 |bibcode=2009OLEB...39..581R |doi=10.1007/s11084-009-9173-6 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=19629743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onofri |first1=Silvano |last2=de la Torre |first2=Rosa |last3=de Vera |first3=Jean-Pierre |last4=Ott |first4=Sieglinde |last5=Zucconi |first5=Laura |last6=Selbmann |first6=Laura |last7=Scalzi |first7=Giuliano |last8=Venkateswaran |first8=Kasthuri J. |last9=Rabbow |first9=Elke |last10=Sánchez Iñigo |first10=Francisco J. |last11=Horneck |first11=Gerda |display-authors=3 |date=May 2012 |title=Survival of Rock-Colonizing Organisms After 1.5 Years in Outer Space |journal=Astrobiology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=508–516 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..508O |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0736 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=22680696}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[List of microorganisms tested in outer space]].)

These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two [[Offspring|progenies]]. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt;
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |authorlink1=Manfred Eigen |last2=Schuster |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Schuster |date=November 1977 |title=The Hypercycle.

=== Polyphosphates ===
A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of [[polyphosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Michael R.

Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble [[calcium phosphate]] ([[apatite]]), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pasek |first=Matthew A. |date=22 January 2008 |title=Rethinking early Earth phosphorus geochemistry |journal=Proc.

=== Radioactive beach hypothesis ===
Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of [[uranium]] and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dartnell |first=Lewis |date=12 January 2008 |title=Did life begin on a radioactive beach? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |journal=New Scientist |issue=2638 |page=8 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627101858/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to computer models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adam |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=Actinides and Life's Origins |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=852–872 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..852A |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0066 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=18163867}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|self-sustaining nuclear reaction]] as that found in the [[Oklo]] uranium ore seam in [[Gabon]]. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from [[acetonitrile]] in water. Radioactive [[monazite]] material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible." Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive [[actinide]]s, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic complexes]]. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.

John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=John |date=December 2004 |title=Mineral Radioactivity in Sands as a Mechanism for Fixation of Organic Carbon on the Early Earth |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=533–547 |bibcode=2004OLEB...34..533P |doi=10.1023/B:ORIG.0000043132.23966.a1 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=15570707|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.8955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermodynamic dissipation ===
The 19th-century Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor [[energy]], but instead had to do with [[entropy production]] derived from the conversion of the solar [[spectrum]] into [[heat]] by these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]], were dependent on the [[dissipation]] of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book "What is Life", the 20th-century Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until [[Lars Onsager]],&lt;ref&gt;Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, ''Phys. Rev.'' 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; and later Ilya [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]],&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt; developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the "self-organization" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977 "for his contributions to [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], particularly the theory of [[Dissipative system|dissipative structures]]". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a [[system]] were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its [[entropy]]) forming what he called "dissipative structures" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R | last2 = Juretić | first2 = D. | last3 = Županović | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = The functional design of the rotary enzyme ATP synthase is consistent with maximum entropy production | url = | journal = Chem.

Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the [[Archean]] a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to augment the dissipation of the solar photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/475/1/012010 |title=A non-linear irreversible thermodynamic perspective on organic pigment proliferation and biological evolution |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=475 |issue=1 |pages=012010 |year=2013 |last1=Michaelian |first1=K |bibcode=2013JPhCS.475a2010M |arxiv=1307.5924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Archean, with life-induced [[ozone]] dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of [[covalent bond]]s. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the [[Cambrian explosion]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doglioni | first1 = C. | last2 = Pignatti | first2 = J. | last3 = Coleman | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Why did life develop on the surface of the Earth in the Cambrian? | url = | journal = Geoscience Frontiers | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 865–873 | doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many salient characteristics of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life.&lt;ref name="Michaelian, K. 2016"/&gt; Some of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less [[DNA replication|replication]] of RNA and DNA, [[homochirality]] of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of [[Genetic code|information encoding]] in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.

=== Multiple genesis ===
Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early [[history of Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Davies |date=December 2007 |title=Are Aliens Among Us? |url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Scientific American |volume=297 |issue=6 |pages=62–69 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1207-62 |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-07-16 |quote=...if life does emerge readily under terrestrial conditions, then perhaps it formed many times on our home planet. To pursue this possibility, deserts, lakes and other extreme or isolated environments have been searched for evidence of "alien" life-forms—organisms that would differ fundamentally from known organisms because they arose independently. |bibcode=2007SciAm.297f..62D |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185832/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry—e.g., [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]]). It has been proposed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hartman |first=Hyman |date=October 1998 |title=Photosynthesis and the Origin of Life |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=515–521 |bibcode=1998OLEB...28..515H |doi=10.1023/A:1006548904157 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=11536891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===
[[Armid Mulkidjanian]] and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the [[ionic balance]] and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in [[terrestrial hydrothermal pool]]s fed by steam vents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H.

[[Bruce Damer]] and [[David Deamer]] have come to the conclusion that [[cell membrane]]s cannot be formed in salty [[seawater]], and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a [[superorganism]] rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damer |first1=Bruce |last2=Deamer |first2=David |date=13 March 2015 |title=Coupled Phases and Combinatorial Selection in Fluctuating Hydrothermal Pools: A Scenario to Guide Experimental Approaches to the Origin of Cellular Life |journal=Life |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=872–887 |doi=10.3390/life5010872 |issn=2075-1729 |pmc=4390883 |pmid=25780958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Information theory ===
A theory that speaks to the origin of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an [[Information theory|information system]] in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum [[entropy]] variations with abundant free energy, suggest the [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|pore space]] in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colgate| first=S.

'''Alice Muriel Flora Candy''' (9 July 1888 – 18 May 1977) was a New Zealand teacher, academic and historian. Born in [[West Oxford]], [[New Zealand]] on 9 July 1888,&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"&gt;{{DNZB|Gardner|W. J.|4c5|Alice Muriel Flora Candy|9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candy attended [[Christchurch Girls' High School]] and got a Junior Scholarship.&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"/&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1910 and secured Senior Scholarship in economics, leading to a [[Master of Arts]] with honors in  [[political science]] in 1911. After leaving [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury College]] (now [[University of Canterbury]]) she taught at several schools including [[List of schools in the Wellington Region|Chilton Saint James School]] in [[Lower Hutt]].

Candy was appointed to lecture history at the College in December 1920, making her the second woman academic at the institution, after biologist [[Elizabeth Herriott]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"/&gt;

She worked closely with [[James Hight]], including writing the 1927  ''A short history of the Canterbury College (University of New Zealand) with a register of graduates and associates of the college''; it was to be her only major publication; with her background in school teaching, she specialized in teaching rather than research.&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"/&gt; At the time between a quarter and a third of students were women, and Candy played an active role in caring for them, being warden of [[Helen Connon]] Hall, an all-women [[hall of residence]]. By the time of her retirement in 1948 she had risen to senior lecturer.&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"/&gt;

After her retirement she served on the [[University Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, W. J., Beardsley, E. T., Carter, T. E., Phillips, Neville Crompton, A history of the [[University of Canterbury]], 1873—1973. [[Christchurch]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy never married. She died on 18 May 1977 in [[Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Candy"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Plasari was born in [[Tirana]],&lt;ref name="Elsie2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA357|date=19 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7380-3|pages=357–}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he completed all levels of his education. At the age of seventeen, while still in high school, Plasari began to publish translations from world literature.

==Career==
After graduating from secondary school, he fulfilled compulsory military service and, as for several years his right to pursue higher education was denied for "biographical" reasons, he started work at the most basic level of the press, as a copy-editor in the [[typography]] for "Mihal Duri".

From 1982 he worked as literary editor at the magazine "Nëntori", an organ of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists|Writers and Artists' Union of Albania]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2010" /&gt; After graduation in 1989 he worked as an editor of translated literature, and later in 1990 as secretary of the editorial board, at the same magazine.

Beginning in 1990 he was invited to become a part-time lecturer at the [[University of Tirana]]'s Faculty of History and Philology. In 1991 he completed a postgraduate specialization at [[Alcala University|"Alcalá" University]] in Madrid, Spain, and in 1992 he became a full-time lecturer at the Faculty of History and Philology (UT), where he also held the position of vice dean. In 1994 he obtained a doctoral degree in Comparative Literature, the first doctorate in this field in the country.

Plasari was a lecturer and doctoral fellow for university subjects such as "History of Aesthetics" and "Principles of Aesthetics", as well as for special courses "Introduction to Narratology", "Theory of Reception", etc. In 1995 he was recognized as an "Associate Professor", and from 1995 to 1996 was a guest lecturer at [[Inalco]] (Institut des Langues et Civilisations Orientales), Paris. Returning to Albania, he continued to work at the Faculty of History and Philology (UT) until 1998, when he was invited to become director of the [[National Library of Albania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Guide to Library, Archive and Information Science Education: Third new and completely revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnUduW7dwvAC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-598-44029-8|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gazeta-nacional.com/?p=13410&lt;/ref&gt; a post he still held in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://tirana.usembassy.gov/dyn/events2010.html?pn=2&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 he has held the title of "Professor". In the Master's Course of Library Science's Second Level, organized for the first time in the Albanian education system, he has developed the new subject "Introduction to Albanology".&lt;ref name="ClarkeMitchell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andy Clarke|author2=Grethe Mitchell|title=Videogames and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kPRGPc4zHQC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-142-0|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 until 2014 he engaged in national and international scientific-academic activities, lecturing and attending conferences in the USA, Kosovo, Italy, France, Spain, Romania, Greece, Austria, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Macedonia.

Plasari headed the new edition of the cultural magazine "[[Hylli i Drites|Hylli i Dritës]]" in 1993–1997 (from the reopening until it was closed again), and wrote frequently in the free Albanian press, including the newspaper "[[Rilindja Demokratike]]" from its first issue, writing in various fields of culture, but also on policy. Beginning in 1990, some editions of [[Gjergj Fishta|Fishta]], Merxhani, [[Anton Harapi|Harapi]], and Beduli have been prepared by him; he also directed the series "Intelligenda" (Publishing House "55"), with various Albano-Balkanological's contributors, including [[Jorga]], Jirecek, Gelcich, Suliotti, Londres, [[Konitza|Konica]], Nadin, and [[Political Academy of the Socialist Party of Albania|Xhufi]].

In the field of cultural activities he has led some national juries, and has participated as member in national and international juries. In 2012 he was member of Interministerial Committee of Celebration of Proclamation of Independence's 100th Anniversary.

Cebu is the Philippines' main domestic shipping port, and is home to about 80% of the country's domestic shipping companies.

Cebu City is bounded on the north by the town of [[Balamban, Cebu|Balamban]] and the city of [[Danao City, Cebu|Danao]], to the west by  the city of [[Toledo City, Cebu|Toledo]], on the east by the cities of [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu]] and [[Mandaue, Cebu|Mandaue]] and the towns Of [[Consolacion, Cebu|Consolacion]], [[Liloan, Cebu|Liloan]] and [[Compostela, Cebu|Compostela]]. and on the south by the City of [[Talisay City, Cebu|Talisay]].

==Etymology==

The name "Cebu" came from the old [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] word ''sibu'' or ''sibo'' ("trade"), a shortened form of ''sinibuayng hingpit'' ("the place for trading"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbu, the ancient name for Cebu City. Sugbu, in turn, was derived from the Old Cebuano term for "[[scorched earth]]" or "great fire".&lt;ref name="macachor"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Celestino C.

==History==

{{See also|Lapu-Lapu|Rajahnate of Cebu}}

===Founding===
{{Main|Singhapala}}
Before the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|arrival of the Spaniards]], Cebu city was part of the island-[[rajahnate]] and trade center of Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya (literally "[the islands] which belong to Daya"), now better known as the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]]. It was founded by a prince of the Hindu [[Chola dynasty]] of [[Sumatra]], the half-Malay and half-Tamil, Sri Lumay. The name Sugbu (shortened form of ''Kang Sri Lumaying Sugbu'', literally "that of Sri Lumay's great fire") refers to Sri Lumay's [[scorched earth tactics]] against Muslim [[Moro Pirates|Moro raiders]] (''Magalos'').&lt;ref name="macachor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marivir"/&gt;

===Spanish period===
[[File:Magellans Cross Inside.jpg|thumb|left|[[Magellan's Cross]]]]
[[File:Cebu escondrillas.jpg|thumb|left|A 19th-century map of Cebu City]]
On 7 April 1521, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Ferdinand Magellan]] landed in Cebu. He was welcomed by [[Rajah Humabon]] (also known as Sri Humabon or Rajah Humabara), the grandson of Sri Lumay, together with his wife and about 700 native islanders. Magellan, however, was killed in the [[Battle of Mactan]], and the remaining members of his expedition left Cebu soon after several of them were poisoned by Humabon, who was fearful of foreign occupation. The last ruler of Sugbu, prior to Spanish colonization, was Rajah Humabon's nephew, [[Rajah Tupas]] (d. 1565).&lt;ref name="macachor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marivir"/&gt;

On 13 February 1565, Spanish conquistadors led by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] together with Augustinian friars whose prior was [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], arrived in Samar, taking possession of the island thereafter. They Christianized some natives and Spanish remnants in Cebu. Afterwards, the expedition visited [[Leyte]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|Cabalian]], Mazaua, [[Camiguin]] and [[Bohol]] where the famous ''[[Sandugo]]'' or blood compact was performed between López de Legazpi and [[Datu Sikatuna]], the chieftain of Bohol on 16 March 1565. The Spanish arrived in Cebu on 15 April 1565. They then attempted to parley with the local ruler, [[Rajah Tupas]], but found that he and the local population had abandoned the town. Rajah Tupas presented himself at their camp on 8 May, feast of the [[Michael (archangel)|Apparition of Saint Michael the Archangel]], when the island was taken possession of on behalf of the Spanish King. The [[Treaty of Cebu (1565)|Treaty of Cebu]] was formalized on 3 July 1565. López de Legazpi's party named the new city "Villa de San Miguel de Cebú" (later renamed "Ciudad del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús)." In 1567 the Cebu garrison was reinforced with the arrival of 2,100 soldiers from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico).{{efn|1=On orders of the King Philip II, 2,100 men arrived from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The growing colony was then fortified by [[Fort San Pedro]].

By 1569 the Spanish settlement in Cebu had become important as a safe port for ships from [[Mexico]] and as a jumping-off point for further exploration of the archipelago. Small expeditions led by [[Juan de Salcedo]] went to [[Mindoro]] and [[Luzon]], where he and [[Martín de Goiti]] played a leading role in the subjugation of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tundun]]  and [[Seludong]] in 1570. One year later, López de Legazpi departed Cebu to discuss a peace pact with the defeated Rajahs. An agreement between the conquistadors and the Rajahs to form a city council paved the way for the establishment of a new settlement and the construction of the Christian walled city of [[Intramuros]] on the razed remains of Islamic Manila, then a vassal-state of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]].

In 1571, the Spanish carried over infantry from Mexico, to raise an army of Christian Visayan warriors from [[Cebu]] and [[Iloilo]] as well as mercenaries from the Tagalog region, and assaulted the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] in what is known as the [[Castilian War]]. The war also started the [[Spanish–Moro Wars]] waged between the Christian Visayans and Muslim Mindanao, wherein Moros burned towns and conducted slave raids in the Visayas islands and selling the slaves to the Sultanates of the [[Malay Archipelago]] and the Visayans fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities in Mindanao, cities such as [[Zamboanga City]].

On 14 August 1595, [[Pope Clement VIII]] created the diocese of Cebu as a suffragan to the [[Archdiocese of Manila]].

On 3 April 1898, local revolutionaries led by the [[Negrense]] [[Leon Kilat]] rose up against the Spanish colonial authorities and took control of the urban center after three days of fighting. The uprising was only ended by the treacherous murder of Leon Kilat and the arrival of soldiers from [[Iloilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cebu.gov.ph/?getid=2&amp;getsubid=5&amp;infolinkids=6&amp;GetBodyName=History&amp;rightpdisable=0|title=Cebu Provincial Government - The Official Portal of the Province of Cebu|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 1898, the Spanish Governor, General Montero, evacuated his troops to Zamboanga, turning over government property to Pablo Mejia.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=522}} The next day, a provincial government was formed under Luis Flores as president, General Juan Climaco as military chief of staff, and Julio Llorente as mayor.

===American occupation and World War II===

[[File:Cebu Malacanan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Malacañang sa Sugbo]], the [[President of the Philippines|presidential]] residence in the [[Visayas]]]]
The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[Spanish–American War]] provided for the cession of Cebu along with the rest of the Philippine islands to the United States until the formation of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Era (1935–46)]]. On 21 February 1899, the [[USS Petrel (PG-2)]] deployed a landing party of 40 marines on the shores of Cebu.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=523}} Cebu's transfer to the Commonwealth government was signed by Luis Flores although others, most notably General [[Arcadio Maxilom]] and Juan Climaco, offered resistance until 1901.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=524}} Governor [[W. H. Taft]] visited Cebu on 17 April 1901, and appointed Julio Llorento as the first provincial governor.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=526}} Juan Climaco was elected to that office in January 1904.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=526}}

After having remained a town since its original founding in 1565, Cebu became a chartered city on 24 February 1937. Many other Philippine cities such as Dansalan (now [[Marawi]]), [[Iloilo City]], and [[Bacolod City]] were also incorporated at that time (see [[Cities of the Philippines]]).

Along with the rest of the country, Cebu came under Japanese occupation during [[World War II|WW&lt;span style="font-family:serif;"&gt;
II&lt;/span&gt;]]. The Japanese encountered some opposition there from guerrillas and irregular forces led by [[James M. Cushing|Col. James Cushing]] and the Cebu Area Command. It was finally liberated with the [[Battle for Cebu City]] in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, active from 3 January 1942 to 30 June 1946, was stationed in Cebu City during World War &lt;span style="font-family:serif;"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;.

===Present day===

[[Colon Street]], the oldest national road in the Philippines, is the center of a dense and compact area in [[downtown]] Cebu City that was once the heart of Cebu City's shopping and business activity, with fashionable shops, restaurants and movie houses. In the early 1990s, much of this activity shifted to the more modern and more diverse business districts located in almost all of the urban areas of the city, including in what was considered residential and leisure neighborhoods. Colon also serves as a transit point for public utility [[jeepney]]s (PUJ) covering arterial routes within the city.

==Geography==

Cebu City has a land area of {{convert|315|km2}}. To the northeast of the city is [[Mandaue City]] and the town of [[Consolacion, Cebu|Consolacion]]; to the west is [[Toledo City, Cebu|Toledo City]] and the towns of [[Balamban, Cebu|Balamban]] and [[Asturias, Cebu|Asturias]]; to the south is [[Talisay City, Cebu|Talisay City]] and the town of [[Minglanilla, Cebu|Minglanilla]].

Across Mactan Strait to the east is Mactan island where Lapu-Lapu is located. Further east across the [[Cebu Strait]] is the [[Bohol (island)|island of Bohol]].

Being a highly urbanized city, Cebu City (along with Lapu-Lapu City) is independent from Cebu province. Its electorate do not vote for provincial officials. There were proposals during the time of Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña]] to establish an "administrative district" that would be independent from Cebu City. This would mean carving out Cebu City's Capitol Site barangay, where the provincial capitol and other provincial offices are located. The plan, however, did not go through and was even followed by other proposals like the transfer of the capital to Balamban.

Cebu City is governed by a mayor, vice mayor and sixteen councilors (eight representing the northern and eight representing the southern region). Each official is popularly elected to serve for a three-year term. The chief of the [[Association of Barangay Captains]] also serves in the city council. The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by a city administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor | title=Davide is acting Cebu City mayor Osmeña in US, Rama off to Korea | publisher=INQUIRER.net | accessdate=10 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011011530/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor | archive-date=11 October 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers | title=Osmeñas leave for US amid prayer | publisher=INQUIRER.net | accessdate=8 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011080249/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers | archive-date=11 October 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Cebu city's proximity to many islands, beaches, hotel and resorts, diving locations and heritage sites, high domestic and foreign tourist arrivals have fueled the city's tourism industry. Due to its geographic location, accessibility by air, land and sea transportation, Cebu City has become the tourist gateway to Central and Southern Philippines. Its port, [[Port of Cebu]], is the country's second largest port after Manila.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Victorina Zosa |title=Philippine – Japan Economic Linkages: A Case Study of Cebu |url=http://dirp3.pids.gov.ph/ris/dps/pidsdps0433.pdf |journal=Discussion Paper Series No. 2004-33 |publisher=Philippine Institute for Development Studies |accessdate=16 March 2017 |date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Cebu-Sinulog.JPG|thumb|left|Procession during the Feast Day of the Santo Niño.]]
[[File:Interior of the Basilica del Santo Niño.jpg|thumb|Devotees inside the [[Basilica del Santo Niño]].]]

Cebu City is a significant cultural center in the Philippines. The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. The city's most famous landmark is [[Magellan's Cross]]. This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been erected by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cebú|volume=5|pages=592-593|noicon=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was encased in hollow [[Afzelia rhomboidea|tindalo wood]] in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at Magallanes Street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño. Revered by Filipinos, the Magellan's Cross is a symbol of Christianity in the Philippines.

A few steps away from Magellan's Cross is the [[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]] (Church of the Holy Child). This is an Augustinian church elevated to the rank of basilica in 1965 during the 400th anniversary celebrations of Christianity in the Philippines, held in Cebu. The church, which was the first to be established in the islands, is built of hewn stone and features the country's oldest relic, the figure of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] (Holy Child of Cebu).

This religious and cultural event is celebrated during the island's cultural festivities known as the [[Sinulog festival]]. Held every third Sunday of January, it celebrates the festival of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]], who was formerly considered to be the patron saint of Cebu. (This patronage was later changed to that of Our Lady of Guadalupe after it was realised that the St. Niño could not be a patron saint because he was an image of Christ and not a saint.) The sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles somewhat the current (sulog) of the river. Thus, the Cebuanos called it sinulog.

When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler [[Antonio Pigafetta]], sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon. She was later named Juana, the figure of the Santo Niño. The natives also honored the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] in their indigenous sinulog ritual.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} This ritual was preserved but limited to honoring the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Christianized-[[Malay race|Austronesian natives]] started performing the sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting "Viva Pit Señor!"{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebú during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event.

'''Charles Poor "Charlie" Kindleberger''' (October 12, 1910 – July 7, 2003) was an [[Economic history|economic historian]] and author of over 30 books. His 1978 book ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes'', about speculative [[stock market bubble]]s, was reprinted in 2000 after the [[dot-com bubble]]. He is well known for [[hegemonic stability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Altman|first= Daniel|title=Charles P.

==Life==

===Background===

Kindleberger was born in New York City on October 12, 1910. He graduated from the [[Kent School]] in 1928, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1932, and received a PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1937.

During the summer of 1931, he traveled to Europe and attended a seminar hosted by [[Salvador de Madariaga]], but, when the latter was appointed Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Kindleberger attended lectures at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|Institute for International Studies]] in Geneva led by Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]].&lt;ref name=french&gt;

===Government===

====Treasury====
While writing his thesis, Kindleberger was employed temporarily in the international division of [[United States Treasury]] under the direction of [[Harry Dexter White]].  He then joined the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] full-time (1936–1939). Subsequently, he worked at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in Switzerland (1939-1940), the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]] (1940–1942).  During World War II, he served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).  From 1945 to 1947 he was Chief of the Division of Economic Affairs of Germany and Austria at the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref name=tech&gt;

| pages = 12 (career to 1948), 15, ("great lesson of the interwar period"), 16 (Council on Foreign Relations)
| accessdate = 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marshall Plan====

Kindleberger was a leading architect of the [[Marshall Plan]]. In 1945–1947 he served at the [[Department of State]] as Acting Director of the Office of Economic Security Policy, and briefly from 1947-48 as counselor for the [[European Recovery Program]].&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;

He described his around-the-clock work to develop and launch the [[Marshall Plan]] with singular passion in a 1973 interview:  &lt;blockquote&gt;We were conscious of a great sense of excitement about the plan. [[George Marshall|Marshall]] himself was a great, great man—funny, odd but great—Olympian in his moral quality. We'd stay up all night, night after night. The first work ever done that I know about in economics on computers used the Pentagon's computers at night for the Marshall Plan. I had a tremendous sense of gratification from working so hard on it.&lt;ref name=mitnews&gt;

====Harry Dexter White====

Though he himself was spared anti-communist investigation during the 1950s, he later recalled:  &lt;blockquote&gt;...I worked in the Treasury under Harry Dexter White.  That gave me a lot of trouble later on because he got in trouble, and anybody who was infected by him got into trouble, too.  The FBI listened to my phone calls and things I said in the course of my work at the State Department and gave gossip and some misrepresentations to columnists like [[George Sokolsky]].  [[J. Edgar Hoover]] fed them such gossip.&lt;ref&gt;

===Academia===

After 1948, Kindleberger was appointed Professor of International Economics at MIT. He retired from a full-time position in 1976 and continued as a senior lecturer until full retirement from teaching in 1981.&lt;ref name=mitnews /&gt;

He partook in working groups of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;

He later held the position of Ford International Professor of Economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

===Personal===

Kindleberger was married to Sarah Miles Kindleberger for 59 years.  They had four children: Charles P. Kindleberger III, [[Richard Kindleberger|Richard S. Kindleberger]] (a reporter for the ''[[Boston Globe]]''), Sarah Kindleberger, and E. Randall Kindleberger.&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;

| title = Economics Focus:  Of Manias, Panics and Crashes
| publisher = Economist
| date = 17 July 2003
| accessdate = 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of a stroke on July 7, 2003, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;

==Writings==
Kindleberger wrote 30 books, one, ''International Short-Term Capital Movements'', in 1937 and the other 29 beginning in 1950.

As economic historian Kindleberger used a narrative approach to knowledge and not based on mathematical models to prove his point.  In the preface to ''The Great Depression 1929-1939'', he wrote "It's the story simply told, without tables of squares..."&lt;ref name=tech /&gt;

His book ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes'' is still widely used in programs Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States.

===The World in Depression===
His 1973 and 1986 book ''The World in Depression 1929–1939'' (University of California Press, 1986 [Revised and Enlarged Edition]) advances an idiosyncratic, internationalist view of the causes and nature of the [[Great Depression]]. Blaming the peculiar length and depth of the Depression on the hesitancy of the US in taking over leadership of the world economy when Britain was no longer up to the role after [[World War I]], he concludes that "for the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer—one stabilizer", by which, in the context of the interwar years at least, he means the United States. In the last chapter "An Explanation of the 1929 Depression", Kindleberger lists the five responsibilities the US would have had to assume in order to stabilize the world economy:

# maintaining a relatively open market for [[distress good]]s;
# providing [[countercyclical]], or at least stable, long-term lending;
# policing a relatively stable system of [[exchange rates]];
# ensuring the coordination of macroeconomic policies;
# acting as a [[lender of last resort]] by discounting or otherwise providing [[liquidity]] in a financial crisis.

Kindleberger was highly skeptical of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]'s [[monetarism|monetarist]] view of the causes of the Depression, seeing it as too narrow and perhaps dogmatic, and dismisses out of hand what he characterized as [[Paul Samuelson]]'s "accidental" or "fortuitous" interpretation. ''The World in Depression'' was praised by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] as 'the best book on the subject'.

'''Claude-François Baudez''' (3 December 1932 – 13 July 2013) was a French [[Mayanist]], [[archaeologist]] and [[iconologist]]. He was honorary director of research at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]], a specialist on the rituals and beliefs of [[Mesoamerica]], particularly of the [[Maya civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Claude-Francois-Baudez/122866 |title=Claude-François Baudez |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Babelio |publisher= |accessdate=2018-02-05 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In his early years, Claude-François Baudez studied the little-known remains of [[Mesoamerican civilisations]] in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cemca.org.mx/files_biblio/files/12mh_Baudez_esp.pdf |title=Claude-François BAUDEZ |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Centro de estudios mexicanos y centroamericanos |publisher= |accessdate=2018-02-05 |language=es-MX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1971, he has devoted himself mainly to research on the Maya culture. He was co-director of French excavations at the [[Toniná]] archaeological site in Mexico, and led the [[Copán]] exploration and restoration programme, while studying its sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iesr.ephe.sorbonne.fr/node/25510 |title=BAUDEZ CLAUDE-FRANÇOIS |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website={{ill|Institut européen en sciences des religions|fr}} |publisher= |accessdate=2018-02-05 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is co-author of {{lang|fr|Le monde précolombien : Les Mayas}}, published in the collection “{{lang|fr|L’Univers des Formes}}” at [[Éditions Gallimard]]; and {{lang|fr|Les cités perdues des Mayas}}, a heavily illustrated [[Pocket edition|pocket book]] from the [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]”, which has been translated into twelve languages, including English.

'''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''''' (titled '''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive''''' for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author [[Jared Diamond]], in which Diamond first defines ''collapse'':  "a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time."  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of [[societal collapse]] — particularly those involving significant influences from [[environmental change]]s, the effects of [[climate change]], hostile neighbors, [[international trade|trade partners,]] and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges— and considers the success or failure different societies have had in coping with such threats.

While the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Easter-island-moai.jpg|thumb|Diamond says [[Easter Island]] provides the best historical example of a societal collapse in isolation.]]

In the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his [[methodology]] in one paragraph:
{{quote|text=This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which [[environmental problems]] contribute. My previous book (''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Collapses of past societies ===

Diamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the forgoing four factors.

The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.

Diamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the [[Greenlandic Norse people|Greenland Norse]] to eat fish. Diamond also states that "it would be absurd to claim that [[environmental damage]] must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] is a modern counter-example, and the [[destruction of Carthage]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern societies ===
{{See also|Planetary boundaries}}

He also lists twelve [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]] facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:
# [[Deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]]
# [[Soil]] problems ([[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[soil fertility]] losses)
# [[Water management]] problems
# [[Overhunting]]
# [[Overfishing]]
# Effects of [[introduced species]] on [[native species]]
# [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]
# Increased per-capita impact of people

Further, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[Anthropogenic climate change]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buildup of [[toxin]]s in the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[energy crisis|Energy shortages]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Full human use of the Earth’s [[photosynthetic]] capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
In the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section "One-liner objections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", pages 503-514 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). In the "Further readings" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask "What can I do as an individual?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, "Further readings" section of the chapter 16, pages 569-574 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws conclusions, such as:
{{Block quote|In fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies [...] is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. [...] The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, [[resource consumption]], and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", page 509 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, he answers the question, "What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:&lt;ref name=Choices&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?", section "Reasons for hope", pages 522-524 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-term planning: "[...] the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions."&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;
* Willingness to reconsider core values: "[...] the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?"&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;

==Book structure==
[[File:La deforestación en la frontera domínico-haitiana.tif|thumb|The limit of [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] between [[Haiti]] (on the left) and the [[Dominican Republic]] (on the right).]]

''Collapse'' is divided into four parts.
*Part One describes the environment of the US state of [[Montana]], focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.
*Part Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a "framework" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five "sets of factors" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of [[trade|trading partners]], and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates "a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole." 

The societies Diamond describes are:

* The [[Greenland]] [[Norsemen|Norse]] (cf. [[Hvalsey Church]]) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).  
* [[Easter Island]] (a society that [[History_of_Easter_Island#Destruction_of_society_and_population|collapsed]] entirely due to environmental damage)
* The [[Polynesia]]ns of [[Pitcairn Island]] (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)
* The [[Anasazi]] of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)
* The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)
* Finally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:
** The tiny egalitarian Pacific island of [[Tikopia]]
** The agricultural success of egalitarian central [[New Guinea]]
** The [[forest management]] in stratified [[Japan#Ecoregions|Japan]] of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]]-era, and in [[Germany]].

*Part Three examines modern societies, including:
** The [[Rwandan genocide|collapse into genocide of Rwanda]], caused in part by overpopulation
** The failure of [[Haiti]] compared with the relative success of its neighbor on [[Hispaniola]], the [[Dominican Republic]]
** The problems facing a [[developing country|developing nation]], [[China]]
** The problems facing a [[First World]] nation, [[Australia]]
*Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and [[globalization]], and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23). Specific attention is given to the [[polder model]] as a way [[Dutch people|Dutch]] society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p.&amp;nbsp;498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of [[Sustainability|non-sustainability]]" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.

==Reviews==
[[Tim Flannery]] gave ''Collapse'' the highest praise in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', writing:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]], [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/45.full "Learning from the past to change our future"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 307, 7 January 2005, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=While he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. [...] the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that ''Collapse'' must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.}}

''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the [[future]]. Secondly, the reviewer claimed ''Collapse'' contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of [[Starvation|starving]] people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3555894 "History on an environmental scale. Of porpoises and plantations. When communities self-destruct"], ''[[The Economist]]'', volume 374, 13 January 2005, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of British Columbia]] professor of [[ecological planning]] [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] wrote that ''Collapse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that ''Collapse'' is "a necessary antidote" to followers of [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], such as [[Bjørn Lomborg]] who authored ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Rees explained this assertion as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]], [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7021/full/433015a.html "Contemplating the abyss"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 433'', 6 January 2005, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, ''Collapse'', confronts this contradiction head-on.}}

[[Jennifer Marohasy]] of the [[think-tank]] [[Institute of Public Affairs]] wrote a critical review in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'', in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Marohasy]], [http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf "Australia's Environment: Undergoing Renewal, Not Collapse"] (PDF), ''Energy and Environment'' 16 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/03/050103crbo_books?currentPage=1 "The Vanishing"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 2005-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.}}

While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.

Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and [[slave raiding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benny Peiser|author-link=Benny Peiser|year=2005|title=From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui|journal= [[Energy &amp; Environment]] |volume= 16 No. 3&amp;4|url=http://archive.4edu.info/Youth_2007/ESY_06.5_From_Genocide_to_Ecocide.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo, [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5767/1603.full "Late Colonization of Easter Island"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Questioning Collapse'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by anthropologists criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books ''Collapse'' and ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1145682|title = Review: Questioning Collapse|last = Flexner|first = James L.|date = December 2011|journal = Pacific Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2010, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] released the documentary film ''Collapse'' based on Diamond's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715324/ ''Collapse: Based on the Book by Jared Diamond'', [[Internet Movie Database]] (page visited on 10 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26059223&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dead Sea Scrolls''' (also '''Qumran Caves Scrolls''') are [[ancient Jewish]] religious, mostly [[Hebrew]], manuscripts found in the [[Qumran Caves]] in the [[West Bank]]  near the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref name="The Digital Library: Introduction"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/introduction|title= The Digital Library: Introduction|publisher= Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library|accessdate= 2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Kumeran4.jpg|thumb|Caves at Qumran]]
Many thousands of written fragments have been discovered in the Dead Sea area. They represent the remnants of larger manuscripts damaged by natural causes or through human interference, with the vast majority only holding small scraps of text. However, a small number of well-preserved, almost intact manuscripts have survived – fewer than a dozen among those from the Qumran Caves.&lt;ref name="Israel Museum Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/significance|title= The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls: Nature and Significance|publisher= Israel Museum Jerusalem|accessdate= 2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have assembled a collection of 981 different [[manuscripts]] – discovered in 1946/47 and in 1956 – from 11 caves.&lt;ref name="The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://new.huji.ac.il/en/article/33424|title= Hebrew University Archaeologists Find 12th Dead Sea Scrolls Cave|publisher= The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|accessdate= 2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 [[Qumran Caves]] lie in the immediate vicinity of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic-period]] Jewish settlement at [[Khirbet Qumran]] in the eastern [[Judaean Desert]], in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Z.

''Unveiling the Kings of Israel''. p. 160. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly consensus dates the Qumran Caves Scrolls from the last three centuries [[BCE]] and from the first century [[Common Era|CE.]]&lt;ref name="Israel Museum Jerusalem"/&gt; Bronze coins found at the same sites form a series beginning with [[John Hyrcanus]] (in office 135–104&amp;nbsp;BCE) and continuing until the period of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 CE), supporting the radiocarbon and [[paleography|paleographic]] dating of the [[scroll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ARC Leaney, From Judaean Caves, p.27, Religious Education Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the larger sense, the Dead Sea Scrolls include manuscripts from additional Judaean Desert sites, dated as early as the 8th century BCE and as late as the 11th century CE.&lt;ref name="The Digital Library: Introduction"/&gt;

The texts have great historical, religious, and linguistic significance because they include the second-oldest known surviving [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] of works later included in the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Hebrew Bible canon]], along with [[deuterocanonical]] and extra-biblical manuscripts which preserve evidence of the diversity of religious thought in late [[Second Temple Judaism]]. Biblical texts older than the Dead Sea Scrolls have been discovered only in two silver scroll-shaped amulets containing portions of the [[Priestly Blessing]] from the [[Book of Numbers]], excavated in Jerusalem at [[Ketef Hinnom]] and dated c. 600 BCE. The third-oldest surviving known piece of the Torah, the [[En-Gedi Scroll]], consists of a portion of [[Leviticus]] found in the [[Ein Gedi]] synagogue, burnt in the 6th century CE and analyzed in 2015. Research has dated it [[palaeography|palaeographically]] to the 1st or 2nd century CE, and using the [[Radiocarbon dating|C14 method]] to sometime between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/upload/_FILE_1474480873.pdf |title= An Early Leviticus Scroll from En-Gedi: Preliminary Publication |author= Michael Segal, Emanuel Tov, William Brent Seales, Clifford Seth Parker, Pnina Shor, Yosef Porath; with an Appendix by Ada Yardeni |journal= ''Textus'' 26 |year= 2016 |pages= 1–29 |accessdate= 22 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160922152108/http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/upload/_FILE_1474480873.pdf |archive-date= 22 September 2016 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the texts use [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], with some written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (for example the [[4Q246|Son of God]] text; in different regional dialects, including [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean]]), and a few in [[Koine Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Vermes |first1= Geza |title= The Dead Sea Scrolls.

Archaeologists have long associated the scrolls with the ancient [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish sect]] called the [[Essenes]], although some recent interpretations have challenged this connection and argue that priests in [[Jerusalem]], or [[Zadokites]], or other unknown Jewish groups wrote the scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ilani |last= Ofri |url= http://www.haaretz.com/scholar-the-essenes-dead-sea-scroll-authors-never-existed-1.272034 |title= Scholar: The Essenes, Dead Sea Scroll 'authors,' never existed |work= Ha'aretz |date= 13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="golb-2009"&gt;{{cite web |first= Norman |last= Golb |authorlink= Norman Golb |url= http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/jerusalem_origin_dss.pdf |format= PDf |title= On the Jerusalem Origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls |publisher= [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]] |date= 5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Eisenman]] vigorously posits his theory that the later, non-biblical "sectarian" scrolls must be viewed in the context of a wider first-century CE “Opposition Movement,” including Essenes, [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealots]], [[Sicarii]], and/or [[Nazoreans]], and particularly the early [[Judeo-Christian]] community of Jerusalem, the [[Ebionites]], whose leader, [[James, brother of Jesus|James, the brother of Jesus]], was acknowledged by the entire “Opposition Movement,” and who is no other than the Scrolls' [[Teacher of Righteousness]]. He thus creates a strong link between the Scrolls and the pre-Pauline Jewish Christian community.

Owing to the poor condition of some of the scrolls, scholars have not identified all of their texts. The identified texts fall into three general groups:
# About 40% are copies of texts from the Hebrew Scriptures.
# Approximately another 30% are texts from the [[Second Temple Period]] which ultimately were not [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonized in the Hebrew Bible]], like the [[Book of Enoch]], the [[Book of Jubilees]], the [[Book of Tobit]], the [[Sirach|Wisdom of Sirach]], [[Psalms 152–155]], etc.
# The remainder (roughly 30%) are [[sectarianism|sectarian]] manuscripts of previously unknown documents that shed light on the rules and beliefs of a particular group ([[sect]]) or groups within greater [[Judaism]], like the [[Community Rule]], the [[War Scroll]], the [[Habakkuk Commentary|Pesher on Habakkuk]], and [[The Rule of the Blessing]].&lt;ref&gt;Abegg, Jr., Martin, Peter Flint, and [[Eugene Ulrich]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174946/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jmm8Mvjw2WQC | ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English''], San Francisco: Harper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Discovery==
{{See also|Qumran}}
[[File:Qumran.jpeg|thumb|right|Qumran cave 4, where ninety percent of the scrolls were found]]

The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a series of twelve [[cave]]s around the site known as Wadi [[Qumran]] near the Dead Sea in the [[West Bank]] (of the [[Jordan River]]) between 1946 and 1956 by [[Bedouin people|Bedouin shepherds]] and a team of [[Archaeology|archeologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualreligion.net/iho/dss.html#ASOR|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=virtualreligion.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of storing worn-out sacred manuscripts in earthenware vessels buried in the earth or within caves is related to the ancient Jewish custom of [[Genizah]].

===Initial discovery (1946–1947)===
The initial discovery, by Bedouin shepherd Muhammed edh-Dhib, his cousin Jum'a Muhammed, and Khalil Musa, took place between November 1946 and February 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Mark. ''Early Christianity''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, Craig 2010"&gt;Evans, Craig. ''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process, despite popular rumor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John C. Trever. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, "Kando", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James VanderKam|author2=Peter Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|date=10 July 2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)

In 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of ''The [[Nash Papyrus]]'', the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.

===Search for the Qumran caves (1948–1949)===
Early in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop Mar Samuel brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers  tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1948, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Archaeological Site of Qumran and the Personality Of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949–1951)===
[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]
The rediscovery of what became known as "Cave 1" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].&lt;ref&gt;VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.&lt;ref name="biblicaltheology.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

===Excavations of Qumran and new cave discoveries (1951–1956, 2017)===
In November 1951, [[Roland de Vaux]] and his team from the ASOR began a full excavation of Qumran.&lt;ref name="gnosis.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/dss/dss_timeline.htm |title=Dead Sea Scrolls: Timetable |publisher=The Gnostic Society Library |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1952, the Bedouin had discovered 30 fragments in what was to be designated Cave 2.&lt;ref name="VanderKam, James C. 1994. p. 10-11"/&gt; The discovery of a second cave eventually yielded 300 fragments from 33 manuscripts, including fragments of [[Jubilees]] and the [[Wisdom of Sirach]] written in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="biblicaltheology.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gnosis.org"/&gt; The following month, on 14 March 1952, the ASOR team discovered a third cave with fragments of Jubilees and the [[Copper Scroll]].&lt;ref name="VanderKam, James C. 1994. p. 10-11"/&gt; Between September and December 1952 the fragments and scrolls of Caves 4, 5, and 6 were subsequently discovered by the ASOR teams.&lt;ref name="gnosis.org"/&gt;

With the monetary value of the scrolls rising as their historical significance was made more public, the Bedouins and the ASOR archaeologists accelerated their search for the scrolls separately in the same general area of Qumran, which was over 1 [[kilometer]] in length. Between 1953 and 1956, Roland de Vaux led four more archaeological expeditions in the area to uncover scrolls and artifacts.&lt;ref name="biblicaltheology.com"/&gt; Cave 11 was discovered in 1956 and yielded the last fragments to be found in the vicinity of Qumran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/discovery|title=Digital Dead Sea Scrolls at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem – Discovery|work=imj.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caves 4–10 are clustered in an area lying in relative proximity 160 yards (ca. 150 metres) from Khirbet Qumran, while caves 1, 2, 3 and 11 are located 1 mile (1–2 kilometres) North, with Cave 3 being the most remote.&lt;ref name="LibAnn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Qumran in the Second Temple Period: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence. |author=[[Yizhar Hirschfeld]] |journal=Liber Annuus |date=2002 |volume=52 |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum |location=Jerusalem |pages=279–281 |quote=Some of these caves, such as 4 and 5, are located ca. 160 yd from the site, while others, such as 1, 2, 3 and 11, are at a distance of 1 mile to its north (Fig. 12) |isbn= |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/Books/LA52/LA52247Hirschfeld_Qumran.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517184932/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/Books/LA52/LA52247Hirschfeld_Qumran.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=23 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Martinez/Tigchelaar (1999).

The 972 manuscripts found at Qumran were found primarily in two separate formats:  as [[scroll]]s and as fragments of previous scrolls and texts.  In the fourth cave the fragments were torn into up to 15,000 pieces. These small fragments created somewhat of a problem for scholars. [[Gerald Lankester Harding|G.L. Harding]], director of the [[Department of Antiquities (Jordan)|Jordanian Department of Antiquities]], began working on piecing the fragments together but did not finish this before his death in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = '''The Dead Sea Scrolls'''|last = Wise|first = Michael|publisher = Harper San Franscisco|year = 2005|isbn = 0-06-076662-X|location = New York, New York|pages = 5, 6|last2 = Abegg Jr.|last3 = Cook|first2 = Martin|first3 = Edward}} | [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7xcvitgyGmgamt2dVRoX3dHdGM/view '''Les manuscrits de la Mer Morte''' avec textes originaux traduits en français par I.

The original seven scrolls from Cave 1 at Qumran are the [[Isaiah scroll|Great Isaiah Scroll]] (1QIsa&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), a second copy of Isaiah ([[1QIsab|1QIsa&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;]]), the [[Community Rule]] Scroll (1QS), the [[Habakkuk Commentary|Pesher on Habakkuk]] (1QpHab), the [[War Scroll]] (1QM), the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]] (1QH), and the [[Genesis Apocryphon]] (1QapGen).&lt;ref name="Vermes 1998"&gt;[[Geza Vermes|Vermes, Geza]], ''The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English'', London: Penguin, 1998. {{ISBN|0-14-024501-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caves 4a and 4b===
Cave 4 was discovered in August 1952, and was excavated from 22–29 September 1952 by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]], [[Roland de Vaux]], and [[Józef Milik]].&lt;ref name="VanderKam, James C. 1994. p. 10-11"&gt;VanderKam, James C., ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Today'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Milik (1957). '''Dix ans de découverte dans le désert de Juda''' | Discoveries in the Judaean Desert; Milik (1976). '''The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments Qumran Cave 4''' with the collaboration of Black M.&lt;/ref&gt; Cave 4 is actually two hand-cut caves (4a and 4b), but since the fragments were mixed, they are labeled as 4Q. Cave 4 is the most famous of Qumran caves both because of its visibility from the Qumran plateau and its productivity. It is visible from the plateau to the south of the Qumran settlement. It is by far the most productive of all Qumran caves, producing ninety percent of the Dead Sea Scrolls and scroll fragments (approx. 15,000 fragments from 500 different texts), including 9–10 copies of [[Jubilees]], along with 21 ''[[tefillin]]'' and 7 ''[[mezuzot]]''.

===Cave 8===
Cave 8, along with caves 7 and 9, was one of the only caves that are accessible by passing through the settlement at Qumran. Carved into the southern end of the Qumran plateau, cave 8 was excavated by archaeologists in 1957.

Cave 8 produced five fragments: Genesis (8QGen), Psalms (8QPs), a [[tefillin]] fragment (8QPhyl), a [[mezuzah]] (8QMez), and a hymn (8QHymn).&lt;ref&gt;Baillet ed.

===Cave 11===
Cave 11 was discovered in 1956 and yielded 21 texts, some of which were quite lengthy. The [[Temple Scroll]], so called because more than half of it pertains to the construction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], was found in Cave 11, and is by far the longest scroll. It is now 26.7&amp;nbsp;feet (8.15&amp;nbsp;m) long. Its original length may have been over 28&amp;nbsp;feet (8.75&amp;nbsp;m). [[Temple Scroll|The Temple Scroll]] was regarded by [[Yigael Yadin]] as "The Torah According to the Essenes". On the other hand, Hartmut Stegemann, a contemporary and friend of Yadin, believed the scroll was not to be regarded as such, but was a document without exceptional significance. Stegemann notes that it is not mentioned or cited in any known Essene writing.&lt;ref&gt;Stegemann, Hartmut. "The Qumran Essenes: Local Members of the Main Jewish Union in Late Second Temple Times." Pages 83–166 in ''The Madrid Qumran Congress: Proceedings of the International Congress on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Madrid, 18–21 March 1991'', Edited by J. Trebolle Barrera and L. Vegas Montaner. Vol. 11 of Studies on the Texts of the Desert of Judah. Leiden: Brill, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Cave 11, an [[eschatology|eschatological]] fragment about the biblical figure [[Melchizedek]] ([[Melchizedek#In the Dead Sea Scroll 11Q13|11Q13]]) was found. Cave 11 also produced a copy of [[Jubilees]].

According to former chief editor of the DSS editorial team [[John Strugnell]], there are at least four privately owned scrolls from Cave 11, that have not yet been made available for scholars. Among them is a complete [[Aramaic Enoch Scroll|Aramaic manuscript]] of the Book of Enoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shanks |first=Hershel |url=http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/dead-sea-scrolls-12.asp |title=An Interview with John Strugnell |work=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=July–August 1994 |accessdate=21 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706065646/https://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/dead-sea-scrolls-12.asp |archivedate=6 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cave 12===
Cave 12 was discovered in February 2017 on cliffs west of Qumran, near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name = Q12_2017/&gt; Archaeological examination found pickaxes and empty broken scroll jars, indicating that the cave had been discovered and looted in the 1950s. One of the joint Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Liberty University of Virginia project's lead researchers, Dr. Oren Gutfeld, stated, "Although at the end of the day no scroll was found, and instead we 'only' found a piece of parchment rolled up in a jug that was being processed for writing, the findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen."&lt;ref name=McKernan/&gt;

===Fragments with unknown provenance===
Some fragments of scrolls have neither significant archaeological [[provenance]] nor records that reveal in which designated Qumran cave area they were found. They are believed to have come from Wadi Qumran caves, but are just as likely to have come from other archaeological sites in the Judaean Desert area.&lt;ref name="Grossman, Maxine 2010"&gt;Grossman, Maxine. ''Rediscovering the Dead Sea Scrolls''. Pgs.&amp;nbsp;66–67. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments have therefore been designated to the temporary "X" series.

==Origin==
There has been much debate about the origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.

===Qumran–Essene theory===
{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}
The view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the "Qumran–Essene" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Guérin de Vaux]]&lt;ref&gt;de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Józef Milik|Józef Tadeusz Milik]],&lt;ref&gt;Milik, Józef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.&lt;ref&gt;For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qumran–Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&amp;nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.
A number of arguments are used to support this theory.
* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] – a Jewish–Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.
* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.
* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the "[[scriptorium]]" based upon this discovery.
* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = מקוה) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.
* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].

===Qumran–Sectarian theory===
Qumran–Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran–Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran–Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran–Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.

====Qumran–Sadducean theory====
A specific variation on the Qumran–Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H. Schiffman]], who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests ([[Sadducees]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schiffman, Lawrence H., ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: their True Meaning for Judaism and Christianity'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (Doubleday) 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important document in support of this view is the "[[4QMMT|Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah]]" ([[4QMMT]]), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. [[4QMMT]] also reproduces a festival calendar that follows [[Sadducee]] principles for the dating of certain festival days.

===Christian origin theory===
[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[José O'Callaghan Martínez]] argued in the 1960s that one fragment ([[7Q5]]) preserves a portion of text from the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:52–53.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan–Martínez, Josep, ''Cartas Cristianas Griegas del Siglo V'', Barcelona: E. Balmes, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was [[Falsifiability|falsified]] in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Enste, Stefan. (2000). ''Kein Markustext in Qumran: Eine Untersuchung der These; Qumran-Fragment 7Q5 = Mk 6, 52–53 (No Mark text: an enquiry of the thesis; Qumran fragment 7Q5 = Gospel of Mark 6: 52–53)''. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. {{ISBN|978-3-525-53945-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Eisenman]] has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the [[early Christian]] community. Eisenman also argued that the careers of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert H. J''ames, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1st American ed. New York: Viking, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem origin theory===
Some scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of [[Judaism|Jews]] living in [[Jerusalem]], who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Chernoivanenko, Vitaly. "[http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf The Jerusalem Theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls Authorship: Origins, Evolution, and Discussions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215902/http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf |date=17 March 2016 }}," in ''Ukrainian Orientalistics: Special Issue on Jewish Studies'', Кyiv: NaUKMA Omeljan Pritsak Center for Oriental Studies, 2011: 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Rengstorf, Karl Heinrich. ''Hirbet Qumran und die Bibliothek vom Toten Meer''. Translated by J. R. Wilkie. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Norman Golb]] suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library.&lt;ref&gt;Golb, Norman, On the Jerusalem Origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, University of Chicago Oriental Institute, 5 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Golb, Norman, ''Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Magen|last1= Yizhak |first2= Yuval |last2=Peleg |title=The Qumran Excavations 1993–2004: Preliminary Report'', JSP 6 |publisher=Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority |year=2007 |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/images/shop/jsp/JSP6_Qumran_color.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a [[Hasmonean]] fort that was reused during later periods.

==Physical characteristics==

===Radiocarbon dating===
{{Main article|Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls}}
Parchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]]. The initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves. This test gave an indicative dating of 33&amp;nbsp;CE plus or minus 200 years, eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Doudna, G. "Carbon-14 Dating", in ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, &amp; VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls themselves. The results were summarized by VanderKam and Flint, who said the tests give "strong reason for thinking that most of the Qumran manuscripts belong to the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE."&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

===Paleographic dating===
Analysis of letter forms, or [[palaeography]], was applied to the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls by a variety of scholars in the field. Major linguistic analysis by [[Frank Moore Cross|Cross]] and [[Nahman Avigad|Avigad]] dates fragments from 225&amp;nbsp;BCE to 50&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Grossman, Maxine. "Rediscovering the Dead Sea Scrolls." Pgs.&amp;nbsp;48–51. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were determined by examining the size, variability, and style of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Alison. "From Qumran to the Yahad." P. 81. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The same fragments were later analyzed using radiocarbon dating and were dated to an estimated range of 385&amp;nbsp;BCE to 82&amp;nbsp;CE with a 68% accuracy rate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Ink and parchment===
The scrolls were analyzed using a [[cyclotron]] at the [[University of California, Davis]], where it was found that all black ink was carbon black.&lt;ref name="Nir-El and Broshi black"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nir-El|first=Yoram|last2=Broshi|first2=Magen|date=2009|jstor=4201558|title=The Black Ink of the Qumran Scrolls|journal=Dead Sea Discoveries|publisher=Brill|volume=3|issue=2|pages=157–167|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red ink on the scrolls was found to be made with [[cinnabar]] (HgS, mercury sulfide).&lt;ref name="Nir-El and Broshi red"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nir-El|first=Yoram|last2=Broshi|first2=Magen|date=2007|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1996.tb00763.x/abstract|title=The Red Ink of the Dead Sea Scrolls|journal=Archaeometry|publisher=University of Oxford|volume=38|issue=1|pages=97–102|access-date=17 February 2016|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1996.tb00763.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only four uses of this red ink in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments.&lt;ref name="Nir-El and Broshi red"/&gt; The black inks found on the scrolls that are made up of carbon soot were found to be from [[Oil lamp|olive oil lamps]].&lt;ref name="itsgila.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsgila.com/headlinerscrolls.htm|title=Shepherds, Scholars and the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=itsgila.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honey, oil, vinegar, and water were often added to the mixture to thin the ink to a proper [[consistency]] for writing.&lt;ref name="itsgila.com"/&gt; In order to apply the ink to the scrolls, its writers used [[reed pen]]s.&lt;ref name="Magness, Jodi P.33"&gt;Magness, Jodi. ''The Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. P.33. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7Q6-1,2.png|thumb|left|Shown here is a closeup of the ink and text of two of the fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The two fragments, fragments 1 and 2 of 7Q6, are written on papyrus.]]
The Dead Sea scrolls were written on [[parchment]] made of processed [[animal hides|animal hide]] known as [[vellum]] (approximately 85.5 – 90.5% of the scrolls), [[papyrus]] (estimated at 8.0 – 13.0% of the scrolls), and sheets of [[bronze]] composed of about 99.0% [[copper]] and 1.0% [[tin]] (approximately 1.5% of the scrolls).&lt;ref name="Magness, Jodi P.33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, Callie. ''A Clear Destiny''. P.126. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For those scrolls written on animal hides, scholars with the Israeli Antiquities Authority, by use of DNA testing for assembly purposes, believe that there may be a hierarchy in the religious importance of the texts based on which type of animal was used to create the hide. Scrolls written on [[goat]] and [[calf (animal)|calf]] hides are considered by scholars to be more significant in nature, while those written on [[gazelle]] or [[Capra (genus)|ibex]] are considered to be less religiously significant in nature.&lt;ref name="aaas.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Benjamin Sommers |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/1108scrolls.shtml |title=Scientists Decode Dead Sea Scrolls with DNA and Infrared Digital Photography |publisher=AAAS |date=8 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013213623/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/1108scrolls.shtml |archivedate=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, tests by the [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|National Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], have suggested that the origin of parchment of select Dead Sea Scroll fragments is from the Qumran area itself, by using [[X-ray]] and [[X-ray fluorescence|Particle Induced X-ray emission testing]] of the water used to make the parchment that were compared with the water from the area around the Qumran site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/dead-sea-scrolls-protons.html|title=Dead Sea Scrolls Made Locally, Tests Show|publisher=Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterioration, storage, and preservation===
[[File:Qumran pottery.jpg|thumb|right|Two examples of the pottery that held some of the Dead Sea Scrolls documents found at Qumran.]]
[[File:Two Dead Sea Scrolls Jars at the Jordan Museum, Amman.jpg|thumb|Two Dead Sea Scrolls Jars at the Jordan Museum, Amman]]
The Dead Sea Scrolls that were found were originally preserved by the dry, arid, and low humidity conditions present within the Qumran area adjoining the Dead Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/scrolls/dead.html|title=THE DEAD SEA|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lack of the use of tanning materials on the parchment of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the very low airflow in the Qumran caves also contributed significantly to their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Saving_the_Dead_Sea_Scrolls_for_the_Next_2000_Years,_Dodo_Joseph_Shenhav,_Biblical_Archaeology_Review,_Jul/Aug_1981 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224004/http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Saving_the_Dead_Sea_Scrolls_for_the_Next_2000_Years%2C_Dodo_Joseph_Shenhav%2C_Biblical_Archaeology_Review%2C_Jul/Aug_1981 |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the scrolls were found stored in clay jars within the Qumran caves, further helping to preserve them from deterioration.  The original handling of the scrolls by archaeologists and scholars was done inappropriately, and, along with their storage in an uncontrolled environment, they began a process of more rapid deterioration than they had experienced at Qumran.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pnina Shor |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=17&amp;sub_subj_id=522 |title=Conservation of the Dead Sea Scrolls |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s, adhesive tape used to join fragments and seal cracks caused significant damage to the documents.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt; The Government of Jordan had recognized the urgency of protecting the scrolls from deterioration and the presence of the deterioration among the scrolls.&lt;ref name="Burrows, Millar 1958"&gt;Burrows, Millar. ''More Light on the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government did not have adequate funds to purchase all the scrolls for their protection and agreed to have foreign institutions purchase the scrolls and have them held at their museum in Jerusalem until they could be "adequately studied".&lt;ref name="Burrows, Millar 1958"/&gt;

In early 1953, they were moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum (commonly called the [[Rockefeller Museum]])&lt;ref name="RockefellerHist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imj.org.il/rockefeller/eng/Establishment.html |title=West meets East – The Story of the Rockefeller Museum |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=imj.org.il |publisher=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in East Jerusalem and through their transportation suffered more deterioration and damage.&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt;{{rp|63–65}} The museum was underfunded and had limited resources with which to examine the scrolls, and, as a result, conditions of the "scrollery" and storage area were left relatively uncontrolled by modern standards.&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt; The museum had left most of the fragments and scrolls lying between window glass, trapping the moisture in with them, causing an acceleration in the deterioration process. During a portion of the conflict during the [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] waged by Israel, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] against [[Egypt]], the scrolls collection of the Palestine Archaeological Museum was stored in the [[bank vault|vault]] of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Amman, Jordan.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer, Joseph A 1992"&gt;Fitzmyer, Joseph A. ''Responses to 101 Questions on the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Damp conditions from temporary storage of the scrolls in the Ottoman Bank vault from 1956 to the Spring of 1957 led to a more rapid rate of deterioration of the scrolls. The conditions caused [[mildew]] to develop on the scrolls and fragments, and some fragments were partially destroyed or made illegible by the glue and paper of the [[Manila folder|manila envelopes]] in which they were stored while in the vault.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer, Joseph A 1992"/&gt; By 1958 it was noted that up to 5% of some of the scrolls had completely deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Burrows, Millar 1958"/&gt; Many of the texts had become illegible and many of the parchments had darkened considerably.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt;

Until the 1970s, the scrolls continued to deteriorate because of poor storage arrangements, exposure to different adhesives, and being trapped in moist environments.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt; Fragments written on parchment (rather than papyrus or bronze) in the hands of private collectors and scholars suffered an even worse fate than those in the hands of the museum, with large portions of fragments being reported to have disappeared by 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Trever, John. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Personal Account''. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, the deterioration was becoming a major concern with scholars and museum officials alike. Scholars [[John M. Allegro|John Allegro]] and Sir Francis Frank were among the first to strongly advocate for better preservation techniques.&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt; Early attempts made by both the [[British Museum|British]] and Israel Museums to remove the adhesive tape ended up exposing the parchment to an array of chemicals, including "[[British Museum leather dressing|British Leather Dressing]]," and darkening some of them significantly.&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, other preservation attempts were made that included removing the glass plates and replacing them with cardboard and removing pressure against the plates that held the scrolls in storage; however, the fragments and scrolls continued to rapidly deteriorate during this time.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt;

In 1991, the Israeli Antiquities Authority established a temperature-controlled laboratory for the storage and [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of the scrolls. The actions and preservation methods of Rockefeller Museum staff were concentrated on the removal of tape, oils, metals, salt, and other contaminants.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt; The fragments and scrolls are preserved using acid-free cardboard and stored in [[solander box]]es in the climate-controlled storage area.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt;

Nine tiny [[Tefillin|phylactery slips]] were rediscovered by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) in 2014, after they had been stored unopened for six decades following their excavation in 1952. The IAA is preparing to unroll the phylacteries or ''tefillin'' once a safe procedure has been decided upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/03/13/nine-unopened-dead-sea-scrolls-found/|title=Nine unopened Dead Sea Scrolls found|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine manuscripts with biblical text unearthed in Qumran|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/culture/2014/02/27/Nine-manuscripts-biblical-text-unearthed-Qumran_10153990.html|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=ANSAmed|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography and assembly==
Since the Dead Sea Scrolls were initially held by different parties during and after the excavation process, they were not all photographed by the same organization.

===First photographs by the American Schools of Oriental Research (1948)===
The first individual person to photograph a portion of the collection was [[John C. Trever]] (1916–2006), a Biblical scholar and [[archaeologist]], who was a resident for the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]].&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt;{{rp|68}} He photographed three of the scrolls discovered in Cave 1 on 21 February 1948, both on black-and-white and standard color film.&lt;ref name="VanderKamFlint2005"/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig. ''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. P.396. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/dead-sea-scrolls-04.asp |title=Dead Sea Scrolls |publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531102302/http://www.bib-arch.org/online-exclusives/dead-sea-scrolls-04.asp |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an amateur photographer, the quality of his photographs often exceeded the visibility of the scrolls themselves as, over the years, the ink of the texts quickly deteriorated after they were removed from their linen wrappings.

===Infrared photography and plate assembly by the Palestine Archaeological Museum (1952–1967)===
A majority of the collection from the Qumran caves was acquired by the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]]. The Museum had the scrolls photographed by [[Najib Albina]], a local Arab photographer trained by [[Lewis Larsson]] of the [[American Colony, Jerusalem|American Colony]] in Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Israel Antiquities Authority Personnel Records. Dated 1952 and 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1952 and 1967, Albina documented the five-stage process of the sorting and assembly of the scrolls, done by the curator and staff of the Palestine Archaeological Museum, using [[infrared photography]]. Using a process known today as broadband fluorescence infrared photography, or NIR photography, Najib and the team at the Museum produced over 1,750 photographic plates of the scrolls and fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verhoeven |first=G. |title=Imaging the invisible using modified digital still cameras for straightforward and low-cost archaeological near-infrared photography |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=3087–3100 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2008.06.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorrell, Peter G.

''Freeing the Dead Sea Scrolls: And Other Adventures of an Archaeology Outsider'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel Antiquities Authority and NASA digital infrared imaging (1993–2012)===
[[File:Infrared Fragment Photographed by Nasa.jpg|thumb|right|A previously unreadable fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls photographed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA in the early 1990s using digital infrared technology. The fragment, translated into English, reads "he wrote the words of Noah."]]

Beginning in 1993, the United States [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] used digital infrared imaging technology to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; In partnership with the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand on the use of infrared photography previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed.&lt;ref name="Other Ancient Documents 1675"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Spectral Digital Imaging of Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Ancient Documents |url=http://www.trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/35946/1/93-1675.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527084809/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/35946/1/93-1675.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA used this [[Multispectral image|multi-spectral imaging]] technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to reveal previously illegible text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;ref name="Other Ancient Documents 1675"/&gt; The process uses a [[liquid crystal tunable filter]] in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is significantly diminished.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/technologies/scrolls.html|title=Seeing Into the Past|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was used with select fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs using a larger light spectrum could not reveal.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; The camera and digital imaging assembly was developed specifically for the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=17&amp;sub_subj_id=391&amp;id=760|title=Conservation, Science and Scholarly Collaboration|author=Elena Libman, Tania Bitler and Pnina Shor|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel Antiquities Authority and DNA scroll assembly (2006–2012)===
Scientists with the Israeli Antiquities Authority have used [[DNA]] from the parchment on which the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments were written, in concert with infrared digital photography, to assist in the reassembly of the scrolls. For scrolls written on parchment made from animal hide and papyrus, scientists with the museum are using DNA code to associate fragments with different scrolls and to help scholars determine which scrolls may hold greater significance based on the type of material that was used.&lt;ref name="aaas.org"/&gt;

===Israel Museum of Jerusalem and Google digitization project (2011–2016)===
In partnership with Google, the Museum of Jerusalem is working to photograph the Dead Sea Scrolls and make them available to the public digitally, although not placing the images in the public domain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/project|title=Digital Dead Sea Scrolls at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem – The Project|work=imj.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead photographer of the project, [[Ardon Bar-Hama]], and his team are utilizing the [[Alpa]] 12 MAX camera accompanied with a [[Leaf (Israeli company)|Leaf]] Aptus-II back in order to produce ultra-high resolution digital images of the scrolls and fragments.&lt;ref name="idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/how-one-photographer-helped-google-digitize-the-dead-sea-scrolls.php |title=Welcome to nginx! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111014825/http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/how-one-photographer-helped-google-digitize-the-dead-sea-scrolls.php |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; With photos taken at 1,200 [[Pixel|megapixels]], the results are digital images that can be used to distinguish details that are invisible to the naked eye. In order to minimize damage to the scrolls and fragments, photographers are using a 1/4000th of a second [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] time and UV-protected flash tubes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The digital photography project was estimated in 2011 to cost approximately 3.5 million U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name="idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com"/&gt;

==Scholarly examination==
[[File:EL Sukenik 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Scholar [[Eleazar Sukenik]] examining one of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1951.]]

===Early study by scholars===
After most of the scrolls and fragments were moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum in 1953, scholars began to assemble them and log them for translation and study in a room that became known as the "Scrollery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/45166|title=Archaeology: Fragments of history|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and script===
The text of the Dead Sea Scrolls is written in four different languages: [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean]].

==Publication==
[[File:Dead Sea Scroll Scholar Examination.jpg|thumb|right|Scholars assembling and examining the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments in what became known as the "Scrollery" room of the Rockefeller Museum (formerly the Palestine Archaeological Museum).]]

===Physical publication and controversy===
Some of the fragments and scrolls were published early. Most of the longer, more complete scrolls were published soon after their discovery. All the writings in Cave 1 appeared in print between 1950 and 1956; those from eight other caves were released in 1963; and 1965 saw the publication of the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11. Their translations into English soon followed.

==== Controversy ====
Publication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy.  The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by [[John Strugnell]], while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Norman Golb]], and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the "Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&amp;slug=1306832 |title=Copies Of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public – Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=22 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 [[Emanuel Tov]] was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.

====Physical description====
The majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow. During early assembly and translation work by scholars through the Rockefeller Museum from the 1950s through the 1960s, access to the unpublished documents was limited to the editorial committee.

====''Discoveries in the Judaean Desert'' (1955–2009)====
[[File:Emanuel tov.jpg|thumb|right|Emanuel Tov (1941–) who was Editor-in-Chief of the Dead Seas Scrolls Publication Project and, as a result, responsible for the publication of 32 volumes of the ''Discoveries in the Judaean Desert'' series. He also worked to publish a six-volume printed edition with a majority of the non-Biblical Dead Sea Scrolls and make the same volumes available electronically on CD in a collection titled "The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader".]]

The content of the scrolls was published in a 40 volume series by [[Oxford University Press]] published between 1955 and 2009 known as ''[[Discoveries in the Judaean Desert]]''.&lt;ref name="orion.mscc.huji.ac.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/resources/djd.shtml|title=DJD Index|publisher=Hebrew University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the Jordanian Department of Antiquities assembled a team of scholars to begin examining, assembling, and translating the scrolls with the intent of publishing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourbiblequotes.com/dead-sea-scrolls/|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=Your Bible Quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial publication, assembled by [[Dominique Barthélemy]] and [[Józef Milik]], was published as ''Qumran Cave 1'' in 1955.&lt;ref name="orion.mscc.huji.ac.il"/&gt; After a series of other publications in the late 1980s and early 1990s and with the appointment of the respected Dutch-Israeli textual scholar [[Emanuel Tov]] as Editor-in-Chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project in 1990 publication of the scrolls accelerated. Tov's team had published five volumes covering the Cave 4 documents by 1995. Between 1990 and 2009, Tov helped the team produce 32 volumes. The final volume, Volume XL, was published in 2009.

====''A Preliminary Edition of the Unpublished Dead Sea Scrolls'' (1991)====
In 1991, researchers at [[Hebrew Union College]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], [[Ben Zion Wacholder]] and [[Martin Abegg]], announced the creation of a [[computer program]] that used previously published scrolls to reconstruct the unpublished texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://huc.edu/news/article/2011/huc-jir-mourns-dr-ben-zion-wacholder-freehof-professor-emeritus-talmud-and |title=HUC-JIR Mourns Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder |publisher=Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion |date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials at the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]], led by Head Librarian [[William Andrew Moffett]], announced that they would allow researchers unrestricted access to the library's complete set of photographs of the scrolls. In the fall of that year, Wacholder published 17 documents that had been reconstructed in 1988 from a [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] and had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team; in the same month, there occurred the discovery and publication of a complete set of facsimiles of the Cave 4 materials at the Huntington Library. Thereafter, the officials of the Israel Antiquities Authority agreed to lift their long-standing restrictions on the use of the scrolls.&lt;ref name=britan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154274/Dead-Sea-Scrolls|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (1991)====
After further delays, attorney [[William John Cox]] undertook representation of an "undisclosed client", who had provided a complete set of the unpublished photographs, and contracted for their publication. Professors [[Robert Eisenman]] and [[James M. Robinson|James Robinson]] indexed the photographs and wrote an introduction to [[A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls]], which was published by the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Eisenman|Eisenman, Robert H.]] and James Robinson, ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls' in two volumes (Biblical Archaeology Society of Washington, DC, Washington, DC, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the Facsimile Edition, Professor [[Elisha Qimron]] sued [[Hershel Shanks]], Eisenman, Robinson and the Biblical Archaeology Society for copyright infringement for publishing, without authorization or attribution, his decipherment of one of the scrolls, MMT. The District Court of Jerusalem found in favor of Qimron in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Case (Jer) 41/92 Qimron v. Shanks et al. (30 March 1993) [Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court issued a restraining order, which prohibited the publication of the deciphered text, and ordered defendants to pay Qimron NIS 100,000 for infringing his copyright and the right of attribution. Defendants appealed the Supreme Court of Israel, which approved the District Court's decision, in August 2000. The Supreme Court further ordered that the defendants hand over to Qimron all the infringing copies.&lt;ref&gt;Unofficial translation of {{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/law/members/birnhack/DSStranslation.pdf |format=PDF |title=CA 2709/93, 2811/93 Eisenman et al v.

====The Facsimile Edition by Facsimile Editions Ltd, London, England (2007–2008)====
In November 2007 the [[Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation]] commissioned the London publisher, [[Facsimile Editions Limited]], to produce a facsimile edition of ''The Great Isaiah Scroll'' (1QIs&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), ''The Order of the Community'' (1QS), and ''The Pesher to Habakkuk'' (1QpHab).&lt;ref name=Georgson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=M.Divinity |title=Book Digitization: a Practical and Urgent Necessity for the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |url=http://www.wls.wels.net/files/Georgson.pdf |last=Georgson |first=Seth |year=2012 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |page=26 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m13s100&amp;AId=56661 |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls...made in St John's Wood |author=Simon Rocker |date=16 November 2007 |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726031448/http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m13s100&amp;AId=56661 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facsimile was produced from 1948 photographs, and so more faithfully represents the condition of the Isaiah scroll at the time of its discovery than does the current condition of the real Isaiah scroll.&lt;ref name=Georgson/&gt;

Of the first three facsimile sets, one was exhibited at the ''Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' exhibition in Seoul, South Korea, and a second set was purchased by the British Library in London. A further 46 sets including facsimiles of three fragments from Cave 4 (now in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Amman, Jordan) ''Testimonia'' (4Q175), ''Pesher Isaiah&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' (4Q162) and ''Qohelet'' (4Q109) were announced in May 2009. The edition is strictly limited to 49 numbered sets of these reproductions on either specially prepared parchment paper or real parchment. The complete facsimile set (three scrolls including the Isaiah scroll and the three Jordanian fragments) can be purchased for $60,000.&lt;ref name=Georgson/&gt;

The facsimiles have since been exhibited in ''Qumrân. Le secret des manuscrits de la mer Morte'' at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, France (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100618/ARTICLE/6181000 |title=Exhibit offers context for Dead Sea Scrolls |date=18 June 2010 |publisher=HeraldTribune.com |author=Jorg von Uthmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Verbum Domini'' at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], Rome, Italy (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/verbum-domini-bible-exhibit-opens-in-vatican |title="Verbum Domini" Bible Exhibit opens in Vatican |publisher=News.va |date=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital publication===
====Olive Tree Bible Software (2000–2011)====
The text of nearly all of the non-biblical scrolls has been recorded and tagged for [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] by Dr. Martin Abegg, Jr., the Ben Zion Wacholder Professor of Dead Sea Scroll Studies at [[Trinity Western University]] located in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=17117|title=Qumran (non-biblical texts)|publisher=olivetree.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available on handheld devices through [[Olive Tree Bible Software - BibleReader]], on Macs and Windows via emulator through [[Accordance]] with a comprehensive set of cross references, and on Windows through [[Logos Bible Software]] and BibleWorks.

====''The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader'' (2005)====
The text of almost all of the non-Biblical texts from the Dead Sea Scrolls was released on CD-ROM by publisher E.J. Brill in 2005.&lt;ref name="maxwellinstitute.byu.edu"&gt;"From Other Publishers: Dead Sea Scrolls Reader Released." http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/insights/?vol=25&amp;num=2&amp;id=423&lt;/ref&gt; The 2400 page, 6 volume series, was assembled by an editorial team led by [[Donald W.

====Israel Antiquities Authority and Google digitization project (2010–2016)====
High-resolution images, including infrared photographs, of some of the Dead Sea scrolls are now available online on two dedicated websites.

On 19 October 2010, it was announced&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101019/tc_afp/israelarchaeologyinternetjudaismcompanygoogle |title=Israel to put Dead Sea scrolls online |author=Joseph Krauss |publisher=[[Yahoo!

As of May 2012, five complete scrolls from the [[Israel Museum]] have been digitized for the project and are now accessible online: the Great Isaiah Scroll, the Community Rule Scroll, the Commentary on Habakkuk Scroll, the Temple Scroll, and the War Scroll.

==Biblical significance==
{{See also|Biblical canon|Biblical manuscript}}
Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] manuscripts of the Bible were [[Masoretic text]]s dating to the 10th century AD, such as the [[Aleppo Codex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=RABINOVICH|first1=ABRAHAM|title=A sound in silence|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-sound-in-silence|accessdate=29 August 2015|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=26 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101012524/http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-sound-in-silence|archivedate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the oldest known extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century. The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on "REDATING"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.

According to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, &lt;blockquote&gt;Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word "light," which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is important to note that differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.&lt;!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay "A.D. 100" as quoted --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the "Dead sea scrolls", Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.

To quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''&lt;blockquote&gt;In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, "We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biblical books found===
There are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.&lt;ref name="AbeggFlint2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abegg et al. "The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English." 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]]. They also include four of the [[deuterocanonical books]] included in [[Catholic Bible|Catholic]] and [[Eastern / Greek Orthodox Bible|Eastern Orthodox]] Bibles: [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Sirach|Ben Sirach]], Baruch 6 (also known as the [[Letter of Jeremiah|Letter or Epistle of Jeremiah]]), and [[Psalm 151]].&lt;ref name="AbeggFlint2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin G.

===Non-biblical books===
The majority of the texts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are non-biblical in nature and were thought to be insignificant for understanding the composition or canonization of the Biblical books, but a different consensus has emerged which sees many of these works as being collected by the Essene community instead of being composed by them.&lt;ref name="DávidLange2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nóra Dávid|author2=Armin Lange|author3=Kristin De Troyer|author4=Shani Tzoref|title=The Hebrew Bible in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Akn_nhHegIC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=16 March 2013|year=2012|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-53555-4|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars now recognize that some of these works were composed earlier than the Essene period, when some of the Biblical books were still being written or redacted into their final form.&lt;ref name="DávidLange2012"/&gt;

==Museum exhibitions and displays==
===Temporary public exhibitions===
Small portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls collections have been put on temporary display in exhibitions at museums and public venues around the world. The majority of these exhibitions took place in 1965 in the United States and the United Kingdom and from 1993 to 2011 in locations around the world. Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works to digitize the scrolls and place them in permanent cold storage.

A list of major temporary public exhibitions can be found on antiquities.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/dds_eng.asp|title=Israel Antiquities Authority – Dead Sea Scrolls Exhibitions List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permanent Dead Sea Scrolls exhibition at the museum features a reproduction of the Great Isaiah Scroll, surrounded by reproductions of other famous fragments that include Community Rule, the War Scroll, and the Thanksgiving Psalms Scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/shrine_center/shrinemap.asp?bss=13765&amp;bscp=12940 |title=- Map of the Shrine |work=imj.org.il |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326110448/http://www.imj.org.il/shrine_center/shrinemap.asp?bss=13765&amp;bscp=12940 |archivedate=26 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lluker.faculty.ltss.edu/SOB-STM.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504093641/http://lluker.faculty.ltss.edu/SOB-STM.htm |archivedate=4 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection held by the Jordanian government prior to 1967 was stored in Amman rather than at the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem. As a consequence, that part of the collection remained in Jordanian hands under their Department of Antiquities. In 2013 parts of this collection have been put on display at [[The Jordan Museum]] in Amman, to which they were moved from the [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref name="The new Jordan Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritmeyer.com/2011/05/11/the-new-jordan-museum/|title=The new Jordan Museum|publisher=ritmeyer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the display items are artifacts from the Qumran site and the [[Copper Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luhot.ru/news/263/72/v-stolitse-iordanii-ammane-otkryt-novyj-iordanskij-muzej-hranyaschij-vazhnejshie-artefakty-biblejskoj-arheologii|title=Visit at the Jordan Museum, July 2013 (blog with pictures; in Russian)|accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DSS ad.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement in the ''Wall Street Journal'' dated 1 June 1954 for four of the "Dead Sea Scrolls."]]

Arrangements with the Bedouin left the scrolls in the hands of a third party until a profitable sale of them could be negotiated. That third party, [[George Isha'ya]], was a member of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who soon contacted [[Saint Mark Monastery Of Jerusalem|St Mark's Monastery]] in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as [[Mar Samuel]]. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous ''Isaiah Scroll'' ([[1QIs-a|1QIsa&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;]]), the ''[[Community Rule]]'', the ''[[Habakkuk Commentary|Habakkuk Pesher]]'' (a commentary on the book of [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]]), and the ''[[Genesis Apocryphon]]''. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;).

Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in the 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls – Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York. They were purchased by Professor Mazar and the son of Professor Sukenik, [[Yigael Yadin]], for $250,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250000|1954|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), and brought to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/deadsea.html|title=History &amp; Overview of the Dead Sea Scrolls – Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2002, forgeries of alleged Dead Sea Scrolls have appeared on black markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/dead-sea-scrolls-scam-dozens-of-recently-sold-fragments-are-fakes-experts-warn/|title=Dead Sea Scrolls scam: Dozens of recently sold fragments are fakes, experts warn|work=The Times Of Israel|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current ownership===
Almost all of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection is currently under the ownership of the Government of the state of Israel, and housed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] on the grounds of the [[Israel Museum]]. This ownership is contested by both Jordan and by the Palestinian Authority.

===Ownership disputes===
The official ownership of the Dead Sea Scrolls is disputed among the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the [[Israel|State of Israel]], and the [[Palestinian Authority]]. The debate over the Dead Sea Scrolls stems from a more general [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] over land and state recognition.

===Copyright disputes===
{{Expert needed | Law |2=section |reason=Complexity of copyright law surrounding historical documents in the United States and other nations |date=June 2012 }}

There are three types of documents relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls in which copyright status can be considered ambiguous; the documents themselves, images taken of the documents, and reproductions of the documents. This ambiguity arises from differences in [[copyright]] law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.

====Copyright of the original scrolls and translations, Qimron v. Shanks (1992)====
In 1992 a copyright case ''[[Qimron v. Shanks]]'' was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar [[Elisha Qimron]] against [[Hershel Shanks]] of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' which were included without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.&lt;ref name="houstonlawreview.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nimmer|first=David|work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&amp;field=per&amp;match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.

The courts ruling not only affirms that the "deciphered text" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], "freedom" in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.&lt;ref name="houstonlawreview.org"/&gt;

Sir '''Denis William Brogan''' (born 11 August 1900, [[Glasgow]]; died 5 January 1974, [[Cambridge]]), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[author]] and [[historian]]. 

== Early life and education ==
Denis Brogan was born in Glasgow, the eldest son of Denis Brogan (1856–1934), a master tailor, and Elizabeth Toner. His father hailed originally from [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and was a liberal-minded pro-Boer and Irish nationalist who, at one point, served as head of the Glasgow branch of the [[United Irish League]], while his mother was a sister of [[John Toner (bishop)|John Toner]], Bishop of Dunkeld.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Aspinwall, 'The Transatlantic Catholic Conservatism of Colm Brogan', ''Innes Review'', 53:2 (2002), p. 208.[https://www-euppublishing-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.3366/inr.2002.53.2.201]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;'Obituary: Sir Denis Brogan', ''Guardian'', 7 January 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Brogan was educated at St Columcille's Roman Catholic School, Rutherglen, and [[Stonelaw High School|Rutherglen Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = BROGAN | othernames = Sir Denis | id = U152663 | type = was | volume = 2018 | edition = online}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having initially been cajoled by his parents to study medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]], he switched to an arts degree following a series of low marks in his examinations, graduating MA Hons. in 1923.&lt;ref name=Butterfield&gt;Herbert Butterfield, 'Denis Brogan', ''Encounter'', 1 April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Brogan subsequently studied at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he obtained a further degree in history in 1925. He then spent an additional year studying American politics at [[Harvard University]] on a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller Research Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-30858 "Brogan, Sir Denis William (1900–1974)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, September 2004. Retrieved 11 June 2018. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brogan had three brothers, of whom the best known was the conservative journalist [[Colm Brogan]] (1902–77). His other two siblings, Willie and Diarmuid, both taught at [[St Mungo's Academy]] in the East End of Glasgow.

== Career ==
Upon returning from Harvard, Brogan found short-lived employment in London as a journalist at the ''[[The Times|Times]]''. He then chose to enter academia, acquiring successive teaching posts at [[University College, London]] and the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; It was while at the latter institution that Brogan published his seminal work ''The American Political System'' (1933), which was later described in the ''Guardian'' as "in many ways replac[ing] the classic work of [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Lord Bryce]] on American politics."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; According to [[Herbert Butterfield]], it was the left-wing economist [[Harold Laski]] who endowed Brogan with the "both the stimulus and the patronage" necessary to write the book.&lt;ref name=Butterfield/&gt; 

In 1934 Brogan was elected a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. Five years later, in 1939, he moved to the [[University of Cambridge]] to take up the chair in [[political science]], becoming a fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]]; he remained there until his retirement in 1968.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Brogan became known for broadcast radio talks, chiefly on historical themes, and as a panellist on BBC Radio's ''Round Britain Quiz'', where he affected a testy, hyperacademic persona.  In 1963, he received a [[knighthood]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=universitystory&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Denis Brogan|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0133&amp;type=P|publisher=universitystory.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=archiveshub&gt;{{cite web|title=gb247-msgen1581 - Papers of Sir Denis William Brogan, 1900-1974, historian and political scientist|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb247-msgen1581|publisher=archiveshub.ac.uk|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reference&gt;{{cite web|title=Denis William Brogan|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/denis+william+brogan|publisher=reference.com|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brogan appears to have had a working relationship with political scientist [[A. F. K. Organski]]; a copy of the latter's book ''World Politics'' (1958) in the [[Glasgow University]] Library contains the following hand written note on the first blank page:

"''To D.W. Brogan, In thanks for some delightful hours of talk, Kenneth Organski, New York, Aug 11 1959''". The book was presented to the GUL by Sir Denis Brogan.

== Death ==
Brogan died in Cambridge on 5 January 1974. He is buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Goldie]], ''A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge'' (2009), pp. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife [[Olwen Brogan|Olwen Phillis Francis]] (Lady Brogan), OBE, archaeologist and authority on Roman Libya and the mother of his four children - including the historian [[Hugh Brogan]] - is also buried in the same cemetery; she later became Olwen Hackett on her second marriage, when she married Charles Hackett.

'''Diego de Torres Villarroel''' (1693{{snd}}19 June 1770) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] writer, poet, dramatist, doctor, mathematician, priest and professor of the [[University of Salamanca]]. His most famous work is his [[autobiography]], ''Vida, ascendencia, nacimiento, crianza y aventuras del Doctor Don Diego de Torres Villarroel'' (first published 1743).

==Life==

Villarroel was born in [[Salamanca]] and baptised on June 18, 1694. His father was a poor bookseller and his mother was a draper's daughter. After an elementary education he went on to study Latin under [[Juan González de Dios]], who later became professor of humanities at the [[University of Salamanca]]. Villarroel was then enrolled at the [[Colegio Trilingüe]] in Salamanca. However, at this stage the young Villarroel had little love for learning and his wayward and disruptive behaviour led to trouble with the authorities. It was only when he began to read the books in his father's shop that he discovered a fondness for [[mathematics]] and [[astrology]].

Villarroel was in such disgrace with the college authorities that he decided to flee to [[Portugal]] where he led an adventurous life in which he was successively a hermit, a dancing-master, an [[alchemy|alchemist]], a mathematician, a soldier, a bullfighter, a student of medicine and an astrologer. On his return to Salamanca, he settled down to a serious programme of reading books on science, magic and mathematics, while earning his living by publishing [[almanacs]] and annual predictions under the pseudonym of "The Great Piscator of Salamanca". In 1724, he successfully predicted the death of the young [[Louis I of Spain|King Luis I]].

In 1723 he moved to [[Madrid]] where he made many influential friends. He studied medicine and graduated in the city of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]. Back in Madrid, he became so poor that he decided to take up smuggling to make money but he was saved by the patronage of the Countess of Arcos, whose house he had tried to rid of a [[poltergeist]].

After a few years, Villarroel once more returned to Salamanca where he learned that the chair of mathematics at the university was empty and decided to apply for the post. He easily defeated his only rival and was made professor, even though his knowledge of the subject was still rudimemtary.

In 1732 Villarroel was banished from Spain for helping his friend Don Juan de Salazar in a dispute which had turned violent. The two had tried to escape to France but had returned to Spain to face the consequences. Villarroel spent his exile in [[Coimbra]], Portugal until a royal decree allowed him back to Salamanca in 1734. From then on he dedicated his time to his post at the university, to writing various works and paying frequent visits to Madrid, where he made the acquaintance of the [[María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva y Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duchess of Alba|Duchess of Alba]]. In 1743 he published the first four chapters of his autobiography, which enjoyed a tremendous success (chapter five appeared some time before 1752 and chapter six in 1758).

In 1750 he was allowed to retire on a pension by royal decree. His life became much quieter and in 1752 he published a complete edition of his works by public subscription. This was highly unusual for the time and attests to Villarroel's popularity as an author. He died on June 19, 1770 at the age of 77.

==Influence of Leonese language==

Torres Villarroel used elements of the [[Leonese language]] in several of his works.&lt;ref&gt;López Morales, "''Elementos leoneses en la lengua del teatro pastoril de los siglos XV y XVI''". 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Leonese language prefixes like "peri" (more), palatalizations (llo, lla, llas), verbal forms like "jicioren" (they made, in Spanish "''hicieron''"), "salioren" (they went out, Spanish "''salieron''") or "dixioren" (they said, Spanish "''dijeron''") often appear in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Menéndez Pidal, R.: El Dialecto Leonés. 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Villarroel had a poor opinion of his own knowledge of mathematics and science, a result of the low quality of education available in the Spain of his era. As he wrote: "I knew well my ignorance and blindness as I went groping down the alleyways of my profession. But I also knew that I was in the land of the blind, for Spain lay in the grip of a darkness so fearsome that in no school, college or university in any one of its cities was there an individual capable of lighting a lamp whereby one might seek out the elements of these sciences. In the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king" (quoted by Atkinson, page 24).

Today Villarroel is more famous as a writer. In twenty years he received more than 2,000 ''ducados'' per year. He was a prolific and popular author on numerous subjects with a style modelled on that of [[Francisco de Quevedo]] whose ''Sueños'' (satirical visions of Hell) he imitated in his ''Sueños morales, visiones y visitas de Torres con D. Francisco de Quevedo por Madrid''(1727–1751).

He wrote ''Los desdichados del mundo y la gloria'' (1737),  He also wrote poems and plays, but his most important work is his [[picaresque]] account of his own life  entitled ''Vida, ascendencia, nacimiento, crianza y aventuras del doctor don Diego de Torres Villarroel'', (1743, with further additions later), divided into six chapters, each dealing with a decade of his life.

He also wrote scientific works such as ''Anatomía de lo visible e invisible de ambas esferas'' (1738) and works about the lives of saints (e.g. ''Vida de Sor Gregoria de Santa Teresa'') and poets (''Vida de Gabriel Álvarez de Toledo'').

Villarroel was a favourite author of the young [[Jorge Luis Borges]].

Woolf, [http://www.oxforddnb.com.ipac.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/view/article/69723 ‘Ayscu , Edward (1550–1616/17)’], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 10 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayscu was educated at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1586-1587.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ASCH583E|name=Ayscough, Ascoe or Askue, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He afterward resided at [[Cotham, Lincolnshire|Cotham]], in Lincolnshire, from which place he dates the preface to his only work, ''A Historie contayning the Warres, Treaties, Marriages, and other occurrents betweene England and Scotland, from King [[William the Conqueror]] until the happy Union of them both in our gratious [[James I of England|King James]]. With a briefe declaration of the first Inhabitants of this Island: And what severall Nations have sithence settled them-selves therein one after an other'', London, 1607, 4to.

Ayscu has sometimes been confused with his cousin Sir Edward Ayscu (1596–1654?) of South Kelsey.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''DNB'' claimed the elder Ayscu to have been living in 1633.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliécer Silva Celis''' ([[Floresta, Boyacá|Floresta]], [[Colombia]], 20 January 1914 - [[Sogamoso]], 4 July 2007) was a Colombian [[anthropologist]], [[archaeologist]], professor and writer.&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/silva.html Biography Eliécer Silva Celis] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a pioneer in the anthropology of Colombia.&lt;ref name=TiempoCelis&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-3630931 Falleció Eliécer Silva Celis, pionero de la antropología en Colombia y fundador del Museo de Suamox] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt; Silva Celis is known in Colombia for the reconstruction of the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]], the most important temple of the [[Muisca religion]].

Eliécer Silva Celis has published many books and articles about the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and other indigenous groups of Colombia, only in Spanish.&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ASilva+Celis%2C+Elie%CC%81cer.&amp;qt=hot_author List of works by Eliécer Silva Celis] - [[WorldCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sachica_rupestre.JPG|thumb|right|330px|The rock art of Sáchica has been studied by Silva Celis]]
Eliécer Silva Celis was born in Tobasía, ''vereda'' of [[Floresta, Boyacá|Floresta]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] on January 20, 1914. He became an orphan at young age and worked as street vendor and at the construction of the railway of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]].&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis/&gt;

In 1937, at age 23, Silva Celis managed to finish his secondary education. The same year he entered the ''Escuela Normal Superior de Colombia'' in [[Bogotá]], where Silva Celis got to know later famous people who fled the [[Nazi]]s in Europe: [[Paul Rivet]], [[Rudolf Hommes]], Justus W. Schottellius, José Francisco Socarras, Gregorio Hernández de Alba and José de Recasens, among others. They taught Silva Celis [[ethnology]], [[archaeology]], physical [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis/&gt;

In 1942 Silva Celis uncovered a [[Muisca people|Muisca]] cemetery with indigenous tombs in the ''Mochacá'' neighbourhood in [[Sogamoso]]. He found [[Muisca mummification|Muisca mummies]] and could establish the precise location where the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] of the Muisca had been. The Temple, dedicated to [[Muisca religion|Muisca Sun god]] [[Sué]], was destroyed by soldiers in the army of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] on September 4, 1537. When De Quesada's soldiers Miguel Sánchez and Juan Rodríguez Parra raided the Sun Temple in September 1537, they found mummies decorated with golden crowns and other objects sitting on raised platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Cuenca, 2007, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; With the finding of the location of the temple, he founded the ''Parque Indígena del Sol'', present-day site of the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] in Sogamoso. The museum hosts more than 5000 pieces of the Muisca civilisation. In this museum he also reconstructed the Sun Temple.&lt;ref name=TiempoCelis/&gt; Later, Eliécer Silva Celis rediscovered ''[[El Infiernito]]'', close to [[Villa de Leyva]], an [[Muisca astronomy|astronomical]] observatory of the Muisca. Silva Celis founded the Archaeological Park in Monquirá.&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis/&gt;

In 1943, Eliécer Silva Celis found five skulls which were later dated to be between 8890 and 8630 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.uptc.edu.co/export/sites/default/direccion_extension/documentos/museo_sogamoso.pdf Tras las huellas del boyacense más antiguo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Silva Celis studied the famous [[Tierradentro]] culture of [[Huila Department|Huila]], findings from [[La Belleza]] in [[Santander Department|Santander]] and in the following years the [[Lache people|Lache]] of the [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Cuenca, 2007, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

The mummy from [[Sativanorte]], named ''SO10-IX'' belongs to the collection of Silva Celis in the Archaeology Museum of Sogamoso. It has been studied in detail by various researchers.&lt;ref name=Otalora_p5&gt;Otálora Cascante, 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy has been donated to Silva Celis by Abraham López Ávila in 1962.&lt;ref name=Otalora_p5/&gt; Interviews with López Ávila revealed that the mummy had been found by children in the vicinity of Sativanorte, [[Sativasur]] and [[Socotá]] on the western bank of the [[Chicamocha River]].&lt;ref name=Martinez2010_p115&gt;Martínez et al., 2010, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva Celis was co-founder of the [[Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia|UPTC]] in [[Tunja]], Boyacá in 1953.&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis/&gt; He served as [[rector (academia)|rector]] of the university twice.&lt;ref name=TiempoCelis/&gt; In 1966, Silva Celis studied Muisca stones found in [[Mongua]], Boyacá.&lt;ref name=Wordpress&gt;{{es}} [https://museosuamox.wordpress.com/ Estatua Antropomorfa Original #S 027- XVII - Mongua]&lt;/ref&gt; Silva Celis has written more than 400 articles.&lt;ref&gt;Ardila &amp; Correal, 2010, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliécer Silva Celis died on July 4, 2007 at an age of 93 years, after dedicating more than 60 years of his life to knowledge about the Muisca and other indigenous groups in Colombia.&lt;ref name=PueblosCelis/&gt;&lt;ref name=TiempoCelis/&gt;

'''Eva Matthews Sanford''' (6 July 1894 – 26 March 1954) was a scholar of Classical and Medieval history and Assistant Professor of History at [[Sweet Briar College]].

== Career ==
Sanford gained her AB from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1916. Following some years at [[Yale University]] (1917-1919), Sanford obtained her MA and PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 1922 and 1923 with the thesis "Quibus rationibus auctorum Latinorum opera in libris manuscriptis collecta sint".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was then a Whitney Travelling Fellow at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1923-4. Sanford was a member of the faculty of [[Mather House (Case Western Reserve University)|Mather College]] and of the graduate school of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland]] until 1937 when she was appointed Assistant Professor of History at [[Sweet Briar College]]. Shortly afterwards Sanford published her textbook ''The Mediterranean World in Ancient Times'' (New York 1938) which became a standard reference for students and a revised edition was published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Mediterranean_World_in_Ancient_Times.html?id=MgImnQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Mediterranean World in Ancient Times|last=Sanford|first=Eva Matthews|date=1951|publisher=Ronald Press Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford's work focused on the translation, understanding, and transmission of the medieval sources for classical literature. She was the section editor for commentaries of Latin authors 1300-1600 in the ''Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Renaissance Commentaries and Translations of Classical Authors'' and also consulting editor for the ''Corpus of Roman Law''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]] in 1950 Sanford travelled to Italy and France in search of Medieval commentaries on [[Juvenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.uark.edu/SpecialCollections/FulbrightDirectories/|title=Fulbright Scholar Grantee Directories {{!}} University of Arkansas Libraries|website=libraries.uark.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford was also engaged in early work on finger signs in calculations in antiquity and published a text on the subject in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanford|first=Eva Matthews|date=1928|title=De Loquela Digitorum|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3289380|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=23|issue=8|pages=588–593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.laetusinpraesens.org/handed_m_h_14|title=Finger signs and finger notation {{!}} Kairos @ Laetus-in-Praesens.org|website=kairos.laetusinpraesens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before she died Sanford was in the process of translating the ''[[The City of God|De Civitate Dei]]'' of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] for the [[Loeb Classical Library]]. Her work on Volumes XVI-XVIII was subsequently completed by William M. Green and published as [[Loeb Classical Library|LCL]] 415 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/abstract/augustine-city_god_pagans/1957/pb_LCL415.207.xml?rskey=fg1SLa&amp;result=8&amp;mainRsKey=xOqno3|title=AUGUSTINE, The City of God against the Pagans {{!}} Loeb Classical Library|work=Loeb Classical Library|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henri-Irénée|first=Marrou,|date=1966|title=Eva Matthews Sanford et William McAllen Green, Saint Augustine.

An obituary for Sanford was published in the ''[[The American Historical Review|American Historical Review]]'' in July 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1954|title=Historical News|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1845181|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=59|issue=4|pages=1065–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19127">[[File:PolnischeKirche.jpg|thumb|The [[Steindamm Church|Polish church]] in [[Steindamm (Königsberg)|Steindamm]] was the oldest church of Konigsberg.]]
[[File:Albertinum.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Königsberg]] was considered one of the most prestigious universities of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It received the royal privilege by Polish King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] on 28 March 1560.]]
The '''History of Poles in [[Königsberg]]''' (Polish: ''Królewiec'') goes back to the 14th century. In the struggles between the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Teutonic Order]], the city was briefly part of the Polish state, and after the [[Second Peace of Toruń]], 1466, it was a capital of [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fief of Poland. During the [[Protestant Reformation]] Królewiec became the center of Polish [[Lutheranism]] and partially for this reason, a birthplace of Polish printing and one of the epicenters of vernacular Polish literature. Polish intellectuals and scholars played a major role in the founding of the [[University of Königsberg]] (Albertina) and served as both faculty and administrators.

Over the course of the 19th century the Polish population in Königsberg declined, due to assimilation and [[Germanization]], although the publication of Polish language works in the city continued until [[World War I]].

==Background==
In 1255 the Teutonic Knights, during the [[Prussian Crusade]], captured the [[Baltic Prussian]] fortress of Tuwangste  on the [[Pregel]] (Pregola) river. On its site they expanded the existing fortifications into what later became known as the [[Königsberg Castle]]. The new fort was named in honor of king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] (''König'' is the German word for king). Subsequently, towards the end of the thirteenth century, the towns of Altstadt (Old Town, Stare Miasto), Kneiphof (Knipawa) and Löbenicht (Lipnik) arose around the castle and these would eventually together form the town of Konigsberg.  The initial settlements were populated mostly by immigrants from the [[Hansa League|Hanseatic]] city of [[Lübeck]] (Lubeka) as well as local [[Sambia]]n converts to Christianity. They were served by the newly built St. Michael’s Church in what later would become known as the [[Steindamm (Königsberg)|Steindamm]] (Polish: Kamienna Grobla, literally: "stone dam", "stone levee") neighborhood.  Although the church, along with a good portion of the town, was destroyed during the [[Great Prussian Uprising]] (1260-1274), it was rebuilt during the first half of the fourteenth century and eventually came to play an important role in the Polish cultural life of the city.&lt;ref name="historia9to16"/&gt;

==Polish name of the city==
The first recorded name of the castle is ''castrum de Coningsberg in Zambia''. The Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]], writing in the 15th century referred to the city's battle standard captured by the Poles at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410) by both the German name ''Kunigsperk'' and the Polish version ''Crolowgrod'', which given the Polish orthography of the time, has been transliterated as ''Krolowgrod''. ''Król'' is the Polish word for king and ''[[gród]]'' is similar to the German ending "berg". ''Krolowgrod'' by the 16th century became the standard Polish name ''Królewiec''.&lt;ref name="historia9to16"/&gt;

==Polish settlement in the city up to the Protestant Reformation==
Polish migrants from [[Masuria]] began moving to Królewiec during the fourteenth century, settling particularly in the [[Knipawa]] portion of the town, and, along with [[Lithuanians]] and [[Courland|Kurlandians]], were soon granted the ability to acquire burgher rights. Unlike the local [[Old Prussians]], Poles along with Germans, were allowed membership in the local trade guilds. By the beginning of the fifteenth century, according to the German historian [[Bernhard Stade]], a large portion of the city’s population was fluent in Polish, mostly for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="historia56to61"/&gt;

By 1436 one of the largest streets in the city was named ''polnische Gasse'' (Polish Street) and a tower near the Cathedral bridge was referred to as ''polnische Turm'' (Polish tower). Until the first half of the sixteenth century however, most of the Polish inhabitants were part of the lower, poorer, class of the city. This began to change, particularly with the Protestant Reformation, so that by the 1520s Polish individuals show up among master artisans and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="historia56to61"/&gt;

According to historian [[Janusz Jasiński]], based on estimates obtained from the records of St. Michael’s Church, during the 1530s Lutheran Poles constituted about one quarter of the city population. This does not include Polish [[Catholics]] or [[Calvinists]] who did not have centralized places of worship until the seventeenth century, hence records that far back for these two groups are not available.&lt;ref name="historia56to61"/&gt;

==Political connections with Poland==
While Königsberg began as a fortress of the Teutonic Knights, the growing town soon found itself in conflict with the Order. The main cause of the discontent were the economic policies of the Knights which were perceived as detrimental to trade and growth, although ethnic and national identity also played a role. Specifically, the German Knights came to be perceived to be an outside force, ruling over a newly developed, organic ''Prussian identity'' which emerged from the merger of native elements - Poles, Old Prussians and [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]] - and migrants to the region.&lt;ref name="friedrich21"/&gt;
[[File:AGAD Stany pruskie oddaja swe ziemie krolowi polskiemu Kazimierzowi Jagiellonczykowi i koronie polskiej.jpg|thumb|[[Prussian Confederation]] offered to incorporate Prussia into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], 1454, [[Central Archives of Historical Records]], [[Warsaw]]]]
These tensions led Königsberg to join the [[Prussian Confederation]], formed in [[Elbląg]] in 1440, which opposed the Teutonic Order and sought help and protection from Poland. On February 4, 1454, the Secret Committee of the Prussian Confederation, representing the Prussian cities (although some delegates questioned the Committee's mandate) repudiated their allegiance to the Knights and swore an oath of fealty to the king of Poland, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. The Teutonic Order's garrison in Königsberg  castle surrendered to the city's burghers. Casimir IV Jagiellon affirmed the Confederation’s plea for protection and on March 6 issued an edict in [[Kraków]] which officially incorporated Królewiec, as well as other parts of Prussia, into the Polish crown. Kazimierz named Ścibor Bażynski as the first ''[[wojewoda]]'' (Polish governor) of Królewiec and the official act of incorporation was signed in April 15, signed by representatives of Kniepawa and Old Town. This marked the beginning of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] (1454-1466) between Poland and the Prussian cities on one side, and the Teutonic Knights on the other.

However, after the Polish defeat at [[Battle of Chojnice (1454)|Battle of Chojnice]] in September 1454, attitudes in parts of the city began to change and in 1455 Old Town and Lipnik rebelled against the pro-Polish factions and repudiated the agreement, with Knipawa remaining as the only portion of the town loyal to the Polish crown.

In the last phase of the war, the Order began running out of finances, and after a string of victories by the Polish commander [[Piotr Dunin]] agreed to the [[Second Peace of Toruń]] (1466). As a result, the part of the Knight's state known as [[Royal Prussia|Royal (or "Polish") Prussia]] was incorporated into Poland, while the eastern portion became a Polish fief (1525&amp;ndash;1657), [[Duchy of Prussia]], administered by the Teutonic Order, with Königsberg as the capital.

==Center of Polish Lutheranism and printing==
[[File:Seklucjan gospel.gif|thumb|upright|Title page of the [[Gospel]] of [[St. Matthew]] translated by [[Jan Seklucjan]] and [[Stanisław Murzynowski]] in Königsberg, 1551, only surviving copy.]]
In 1519 another war between the Teutonic Order and Poland erupted. A truce was signed in 1521, set to expire in 1525. Over the course of the next four years, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, [[Albert of Prussia|Albert Hohenzollern]] in search for a political way out before the war resumed, met with several Lutheran theologians, including [[Andreas Osiander]] and [[Martin Luther|Luther]] himself. Luther recommended that Albert convert to Lutheranism and secularize his duchy. By 1523 Albert began promoting the new faith and invited Lutheran intellectuals and theologians to the city.

Negotiations with the king of Poland, [[Zygmunt the Old]], began in March 1525, and on April 8, 1525 the [[Treaty of Kraków]] was signed, according to which Albert became the Duke of secular Prussia, which he held as a fief from the Polish king. The formal investiture of Albert by Zygmunt took place two days later in the [[Prussian Homage]]. By this time Königsberg was already known as a Lutheran city, with its bishop, [[George of Polentz]] holding the distinction of being the first Catholic bishop who officially converted to Lutheranism.
[[File:Poczta Królewiecka (Europeana).jpg|thumb||upright|A page from ''[[Poczta Królewiecka]]'', the second oldest Polish newspaper]]
In the aftermath of the Prussian homage Königsberg became a center of Lutheranism in central and eastern Europe. Albert made a conscientious effort to attract Lutheran theologians, including Polish ones, to the city. Since Lutheranism emphasized the importance of vernacular versions of the Bible and other religious works, several prominent Polish translators arrived in Königsberg on the duke's invitation. Their aim was to serve both the Polish speaking Lutheran subjects of the duchy, as well as to proselytize the new faith in Poland and Lithuania. The first notable translators were [[Jan Seklucjan]] and [[Stanisław Murzynowski]], who had their works printed in the shop of [[Hans Weinreich]], a native of [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig). Seklucjan and Murzynowski produced  the first complete translation of the [[New Testament]] into the Polish language, published in 1553, in Königsberg. The first Polish language book published in Königsberg was a Lutheran tract, printed by Weinreich and composed by Seklucjan, ''Wyznanie wiary chrześcijańskiej'' ("Confession of the Christian Faith"), published in 1544 and dedicated to the kings of Poland, Zygmunt the Old, and his son [[Zygmunt August]].

At about the same time, with the approval of the Duke, the church in the neighborhood of Steindamm of the city functioned as a religious center for local Polish and Lithuanian Lutherans. Services in Polish were also held in the town's [[Königsberg Cathedral|cathedral]] and in a church in the Old Town.

A weekly magazine, [[Poczta Królewiecka]] (or The Königsberg Post) was  published in Königsberg from 1718 to 1720. It was published in the Polish language, and was the second oldest Polish newspaper, after the ''[[Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny]]''.&lt;ref name=kpdl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ziaja/&gt;&lt;ref name="zien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wakar1969"/&gt; It focused on regions [[Prussia]] and [[Lithuania]], but was available throughout the entire [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; The publication has been praised for the high quality of the Polish language used, and for its significant contribution the [[history of the Polish press]].&lt;ref name="kaluski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zien"/&gt;

==Persecution and destruction==
[[File:30 Кафедральный собор.jpg|thumb|The [[Königsberg Cathedral]] was site of Polish-language services until the 18th century]]
===Persecution under the Nazi regime===
With the ascent of the [[Nazi regime]] in Germany, the Polish and Jewish minorities were classified as ''[[Untermensch]]'' and persecuted by the authorities. Prior to the Nazi era, Königsberg was home to a third of East Prussia's 13,000 Jews, but under Hitler's rule, the city's Jewish population shrank from 3,200 in 1933 to 2,100 by October 1938. The [[Synagogue (Königsberg)|New Synagogue of Königsberg]], constructed in 1896, was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938), with 500 Jews soon fleeing the city.

In September 1939 with the German invasion against Poland ongoing, the Polish consulate in Königsberg was attacked (which constituted a violation of international law), its workers arrested and sent to concentration camps where several of them died.&lt;ref name="Jasinski 256"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jasiński|1994|loc=p. 256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish students at the local university were captured, tortured and finally executed. Other victims included local Polish civilians guillotined for petty violations of Nazi law and regulations such as buying and selling meat.

In September 1944 there were 69,000 slave labourers registered in the city (not counting prisoners of war), with most of them working on the outskirts; within the city itself 15,000 slave labourers were located &lt;ref name="j257"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jasiński|1994|loc=p. 257}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were denied freedom of movement, forced to wear "P" sign if Poles, or "Ost" sign if they were from Soviet Union and were watched by special units of Gestapo and Wehrmacht. They were denied basic spiritual and physical needs and food, and suffered from famine and exhaustion.The conditions of the forced labour were described as "tragic", especially Poles and Russians, who were treated harshly by their German overseers. Ordered to paint German ships with toxic paints and chemicals, they were neither given gas-masks nor was there any ventilation in facilities where they worked, in order to speed up the construction of the ships, while the substances evaporated in temperatures as low as 40 Celsius. As a result, there were cases of sudden illness or death during the work.

{{Kurds}}
The '''Kurds''' (Kurdish: کورد, Kurd), also the '''Kurdish people''' (Kurdish: گەلی کورد, Gelê Kurd), are a [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranic]] ethnic group in the [[Middle East]]. They have historically inhabited the mountainous areas to the South of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, a geographical area collectively referred to as [[Kurdistan]]. Most Kurds speak Northern Kurdish ([[Kurmanji Kurdish|Kurmanji]]) or [[Central Kurdish|Sorani]], which both belong to the [[Kurdish languages]].

There are various hypotheses as to predecessor populations of the Kurds, such as the [[Carduchoi]] of Classical Antiquity. The earliest known Kurdish dynasties under Islamic rule (10th to 12th centuries) are the [[Hasanwayhid]]s, the [[Marwanid]]s, the [[Rawadid dynasty|Rawadid]]s, the [[Shaddadid]]s, followed by the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] founded by [[Saladin]]. The [[Battle of Chaldiran]] of 1514 is an important turning point in Kurdish history, marking the alliance of Kurds with the Ottomans. The ''[[Sharafnameh]]'' of 1597 is the first account of Kurdish history. Kurdish history in the 20th century is marked by a rising sense of Kurdish nationhood focused on the goal of an independent Kurdistan as scheduled by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920. Partial autonomy was reached by [[Kurdistan Uyezd]] (1923–1926) and by [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] (since 1991), while notably in [[Turkish Kurdistan]], an armed conflict between the Kurdish insurgent groups and [[Turkish Armed Forces]] was ongoing from 1984 to 1999, and the region continues to be unstable with renewed violence flaring up in the 2000s.

==Name==
There are different theories about the origin of name ''Kurd''. According to one theory, it originates in [[Middle Persian]] as 𐭪𐭥𐭫𐭲 ''kwrt-'', a term for "nomad; tent-dweller".{{#tag:ref|Books from the early Islamic era, including those containing legends like the [[Shahnameh]] and the [[Middle Persian]] [[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]] and other early Islamic sources provide early attestation of the term ''kurd'' in the sense of "Iranian nomads".
A. The term ''Kurd'' in the Middle Persian documents simply means nomad and tent-dweller and could be attributed to any Iranian ethnic group having similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Safrastian, ''Kurds and Kurdistan'', The Harvill Press, 1948, pp. 16, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
G. "It is clear that kurt in all the contexts has a distinct social sense, "nomad, tent-dweller". "The Pahlavi materials clearly show that kurd in pre-Islamic Iran was a social label, still a long way off from becoming an ethnonym or a term denoting a distinct group of people"&lt;ref&gt;Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol. 13, pp. 1–58, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}
After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], this term was adopted into Arabic as ''kurd-'', and was used specifically of nomadic tribes.{{#tag:ref|"The ethnic label "Kurd" is first encountered in Arabic sources from the first centuries of the Islamic era; it seemed to refer to a specific variety of pastoral nomadism, and possibly to a set of political units, rather than to a linguistic group: once or twice, "Arabic Kurds" are mentioned. By the 10th century, the term appears to denote nomadic and/or transhumant groups speaking an Iranian language and mainly inhabiting the mountainous areas to the South of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, with some offshoots in the Caucasus....

The ethnonym ''Kurd'' may ultimately derive from an ancient toponym in the upper Tigris basin. According to the [[England|English]] Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term ''Kurd'' is related to the Sumerian ''Karda'' which was found from Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C. He believed in a paper published in 1923 that the term ''Kurd'' was not used differently by different nations and by examining the philological variations of Karda in different languages, such as ''Cordueni'', ''Gordyeni'', ''Kordyoui'', ''Karduchi'', ''Kardueni'', ''Qardu'', ''Kardaye'', ''Qardawaye'', he finds that the similarities undoubtedly refer to a common descent.&lt;ref name=jndr&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driver|first1=G. R.|title=The Name Kurd and Its Philological Connexions|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Middle Persian noun ''kwrt-'' originating in an ancient toponym, it has been argued that it may ultimately reflect a Bronze Age toponym ''Qardu'', ''Kar-da'',&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Ozoglu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman State'', 2004, SUNY Press, 186 pp., {{ISBN|0-7914-5993-4}} (See p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; which may also be reflected in the Arabic (Quranic) toponym
''[[Mount Judi|Ǧūdī]]'' (re-adopted in Kurdish as ''Cûdî'')
&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Reynolds, "A Reflection on Two Qurʾānic Words (Iblīs and Jūdī), with Attention to the Theories of A. Mingana", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 124, No. 4 (October –December , 2004), pp. 675–689.

The name would be continued in classical antiquity as the first element in the toponym ''[[Corduene]]'', and its inhabitants, mentioned by [[Xenophon]] as the tribe of the ''Carduchoi'' who opposed the retreat of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]] through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC. This view is supported by some recent academic sources which have considered Corduene as proto-Kurdish region.&lt;ref name="Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian 1989"&gt;''Revue des études arméniennes'', vol. 21, 1988–1989, p. 281, By Société des études armeniennes, Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Published by Imprimerie nationale, P. Geuthner, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, ''kwrt-'' may be a derivation from the name of the ''[[Cyrtian|Cyrtii]]'' tribe instead.{{#tag:ref|"Evidently, the most reasonable explanation of this ethnonym must be sought for in its possible connections with the Cyrtii (Cyrtaei) of the Classical authors."&lt;ref&gt;G.

According to some sources, by the 16th century, there seems to develop an ethnic identity designated by the term ''Kurd'' among various Northwestern Iranian groups,{{#tag:ref|The development of the [[Kurdish language]] as a separate dialect group within Northwest Iranian seems to follow a similar time-frame; linguistic innovations characteristic of the Kurdish group date to the New Iranian period (10th century onward).

See Paul (2008):

Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]] argues that any nomadic groups called ''kurd'' in medieval Arabic are "bona fide ethnic Kurds", and that it is conversely the non-Kurdish groups descended from them who have "acquired separate ethnic identities since the end of the medieval period".{{#tag:ref|"The Kurds mentioned in the classical and medieval sources were bona fide ethnic Kurds, and the forbearers of the modern Kurds and/or those who have acquired separate ethnic identities in the southern Zagros since the end of the medieval period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad|title=The Kurds: A Concise Handbook|year=1992|publisher=The Kurds: A Concise History And Fact Book|isbn=978-0844817279|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9mr6OgLjBoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kurds:+A+Concise+Handbook&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aY15UYi2FoWyOaOcgOgO&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mentioned%20in%20the%20classical&amp;f=false|authorlink=Mehrdad Izady}}&lt;!--Izady is just playing a semantic game of "bona fide ethnic Kurds" being anyone called "Kurd" in the medieval period, and it must be those *no longer* called Kurds who have "acquired a separate identity" rather than assuming a Kurdish ethnogenesis.
This is quotable, but needs to be put in context, as it isn't objective history but rather a political argument intended to maximize the number of Kurds in history. It is "bona fide" to cite this as long as it is made clear that the topic is identity politics rather than philology.--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

[[Sherefxan Bidlisi]] in the 16th century states that there are four division of "Kurds": ''[[Kurmanji dialect|Kurmanj]]'', ''[[Lurs|Lur]]'', ''[[Kalhor (tribe)|Kalhor]]'' and ''[[Guran (Kurdish tribe)|Guran]]'', each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. Paul (2008) notes that the 16th-century usage of the term ''Kurd'' as recorded by Bidlisi, regardless of linguistic grouping, might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian "Kurdish" ethnic identity uniting the Kurmanj, Kalhor, and Guran.{{#tag:ref|Paul (2008) writes about the problem of attaining a coherent definition of "Kurdish language" within the Northwestern Iranian dialect continuum.&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"&gt;Ludwig Paul [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i "History of the Kurdish Language"], ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
"There is no unambiguous evolution of Kurdish from Middle Iranian, as "from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE."
Paul further states:
"Linguistics itself, or dialectology, does not provide any general or straightforward definition of at which point a language becomes a dialect (or vice versa). To attain a fuller understanding of the difficulties and questions that are raised by the issue of the 'Kurdish language', it is therefore necessary to consider also non-linguistic factors."&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"/&gt;|group=Note}}

[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is a language of the [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian]] group which has likely separated from the other [[dialects of Central Iran]] during the early centuries AD (the [[Middle Iranian]] period). Kurdish has in turn emerged as a group within Northwest Iranian during the Medieval Period (roughly 10th to 16th centuries).&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"/&gt;

The present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie's theory, proposed in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Mackenzie, "The Origin of Kurdish", ''Transactions of Philological Society'', 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco &lt;ref&gt;P. Tedesco (1921: 255)&lt;/ref&gt; and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], D.N. Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages form a unity within Northwestern Iranian. He has tried to reconstruct such a Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to his theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the [[Fars Province|province of Fars]] in the southwest (proceeding from the fact that the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] spoke Persian), the [[Baloch people|Balochs]] (Proto-Balochs) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern [[Lorestān Province|Luristan]] or in the [[Isfahan Province|province of Isfahan]].&lt;ref&gt;Professor Garnik Asatrian (Yerevan University) (2009).

===Muslim conquests===
{{further|Muslim conquest of Persia}}
In 641 AD, Arab commander Utba ibn Farqad conquered Kurdish forts of [[Adiabene]]. Around this time, Kurds lived a partly sedentary life and raised sheep, goats and cattle in the regions of ''Beth Begash'' and ''Beth Kartewaye'' above [[Erbil]] in Adiabene. In 696, Kurds joined the [[Khariji]] revolt near [[Hulwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Morony, ''Iraq after the Muslim conquest'', Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[caliph]]s of [[Baghdad]] there were numerous uprisings. In 838, and again in 905, formidable insurrections occurred in northern Kurdistan; the [[amir]], Adud ad-Daula, was obliged to lead the forces of the caliphate against the southern Kurds, capturing the famous fortress of ''Sermaj'', whose ruins are to be seen at the present day near [[Behistun]], and reducing the province of ''Shahrizor'' with its capital city now marked by the great mound of ''Yassin Teppeh''. [[Al-Dinawari]] (815–896), from ''Dinawar'' near [[Kermanshah]], lived in this period. There is no consensus regarding his ethnic background among scholars; some say he was Persian or Kurdish, while others indicate he was an Arab.&lt;ref name="Abu Hanifa Dinawari"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dinawari|first1=Abu Hanifa|title=.|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abu_Hanifa_Dinawari|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kurd named ''Nasr'' or ''Narseh'' converted to Christianity, and changed his name to ''Theophobos'' during the reign of Emperor [[Theophilus (emperor)|Theophilus]] and was the emperor's intimate friend and commander for many years.&lt;ref&gt;I. Sevcenko, "Review of New Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire". ''[[Slavic Review]]'', p. 111, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Narseh joined [[Babak Khorramdin|Babak]]'s rebellion in southern Kurdistan, but [[Abbasid]] armies defeated his forces in 833 and according to the Muslim historian [[Tabari]] around 60,000 of his followers were killed. Narseh himself fled to the Byzantine territories and helped form the Kurdish contingent of Theophilus. This Kurdish force invaded the domain of [[caliphate]] in 838 to help Babak's rebellion. After the defeat of Babak, Narseh and his followers settled in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (north-central [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;M. Izady, ''The Kurds: A Concise Handbook'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eclipse of the [[Sasanian]] and [[Byzantine]] power, by the Muslim [[caliphate]], and its own subsequent weakening, let the Kurdish principalities and "mountain administrators" set up new independent states. The Shaddadids of Armenia and Arran, the Rawadids of Azerbaijan, the Marwandis of eastern [[Anatolia]], the [[Hasanwayhid]]s, Fadhilwayhids, and Ayyarids of the central [[Zagros]] are some of these Kurdish dynasties and principalities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Early Kurdish principalities===
[[File:Hasanwayhids map.png|thumb|200px|Hasanwayhid dynasty (10th–11th century).]]
In the second half of the 10th century there were five Kurdish principalities: in the north the [[Shaddadid]] (951–1174) (in parts of [[Armenia]] and [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]]) and [[Rawadid]] (955–1221) in [[Tabriz]] and [[Maragheh]], in the East the [[Hasanwayhid]]s (959–1015), the [[Annazid]] (990–1117) (in [[Kermanshah]], ''Dinawar'' and [[Khanaqin]]) and in the West the [[Marwanid]] (990–1096) of [[Diyarbakır]].

Later in the 12th century, the Kurdish{{Citation needed|reason=Proof that he is kurdish|date=July 2014}} [[Hazaraspid]] dynasty established its rule in southern [[Zagros]] and [[Luristan]] and conquered territories of [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kuhgiluya]], [[Khuzestan]] and [[Golpayegan]] in the 13th century and annexed [[Shushtar]], [[Hoveizeh]] and [[Basra]] in the 14th century.

One of these dynasties would have been able, during the decades, to impose its supremacy on the others and build a state incorporating the whole Kurdish country if the course of history had not been disrupted by the massive invasions of tribes surging out of the steppes of [[Central Asia]]. Having conquered [[Iran]] and imposed their yoke on the caliph of [[Baghdad]], the [[Seljuq Turks]] annexed the Kurdish principalities one by one. Around 1150, [[Ahmad Sanjar]], the last of the great Seljuq monarchs, created a province out of these lands and called it Kurdistan. The province of Kurdistan, formed by Sanjar, had as its capital the village Bahar (which means lake or sea), near ancient [[Ecbatana]] ([[Hamadan]]). It included the vilayets of Sinjar and Shahrazur to the west of the [[Zagros]] mountain range and those of Hamadan, Dinawar and [[Kermanshah]] to the east of this range. An autochthonous [[civilization]] developed around the town of Dinawar (today ruined), located 75&amp;nbsp;km North-East of Kermanshah, whose radiance was later on partially replaced by that of [[Senna (Iran)|Senna]], 90&amp;nbsp;km further North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/institute/who_are_the_kurds.php|title=Who Are the Kurds?|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324) met Kurds in [[Mosul]] on his way to China, and he wrote what he had learned about Kurdistan and the Kurds to enlighten his European contemporaries. The Italian Kurdologist Mirella Galetti, sorted these writings which were translated into Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ayyubid period===
{{further|Ayyubid dynasty}}
[[Image:Ayyubid.png|thumb|right|250px|The Middle East, c. 1190. Saladin's empire and its vassals shown in red; territory taken from the [[Crusader states]] 1187–1189 shown in pink. Light green indicates Crusader territories surviving [[Saladin]]'s death.]]
[[File:Cristofano dell'altissimo, saladino, ante 1568 - Serie Gioviana.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saladin, painted 1568]]

The most flourishing period of Kurdish power was probably during the 12th century, when the great [[Saladin]], who belonged to the Rawendi branch of the Hadabani (or [[Adiabene]]) tribe, founded the [[Ayyubid|Ayyubite]] (1171–1250) dynasty of Syria, and Kurdish chieftainships were established, not only to the west of the Kurdistan mountains in [[Syria]], but as far away as [[Egypt]] and [[Yemen]].

===Kurdish principalities after the Mongol period===
After the [[Mongol]] period, Kurds established several independent states or [[Kurdish principalities|principalities]] such as [[Ardalan]], [[Badinan Emirate|Badinan]], [[Baban]], [[Soran Emirate|Soran]], Hakkari and [[Badlis]]. A comprehensive history of these states and their relationship with their neighbors is given in the famous textbook of ''[[Sharafnama]]'' written by Prince Sharaf al-Din Biltisi in 1597. The most prominent among these was [[Ardalan]] which was established in the early 14th century. The state of [[Ardalan]] controlled the territories of Zardiawa (Karadagh), [[Khanaqin]], [[Kirkuk]], Kifri, and [[Hawraman]], despite being vassals themselves of the various in [[Persia]] centred succeeding Turkic federations in the region, namely that of the [[Kara Koyunlu]], and the [[Ak Koyunlu]] specifically. The capital city of this state of Ardalan was first in Sharazour in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], but was moved to [[Sinne]] (in [[Iran]]) later on. The [[Ardalan]] Dynasty was allowed to rule the region as vassals by many of the sovereign rulers over the wider territory, until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] monarch [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]] (1848–1896) ended their rule in 1867.

==Safavid period==
{{main|Safavid dynasty}}
For many centuries, starting in the early modern period with [[Ismail I]], Shah of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Persia, and Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]], the Kurds came under the suzerainty of the two most powerful empires of the [[Near East]] and staunch arch rivals, the Sunni Ottoman Empire and the various Shia Empires. It started off with the rule of Ismail I, who ruled over all regions that encompass native Kurdish living areas, and far beyond. During the years 1506–1510, [[Yazidis]] revolted against Ismail I (who may have had Kurdish ancestry himself).&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Halm, ''Shi'a Islam'', translated by Janet Watson.

===Displacement of the Kurds===
Removal of the population from along their borders with the [[Ottomans]] in Kurdistan and the Caucasus was of strategic importance to the [[Safavids]]. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds were moved to other regions in the Safavid empire, only to defend the borders there. Hundreds of thousands of other ethnic groups living in the Safavid empire such as the [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Georgians]], [[Circassians]], and [[Turkmens|Turkomans]], were also removed from the border regions and resettled in the interior of [[Persia]], but mainly for other reasons such as socio-economic, and bureaucratic ones. During several periods, as the borders moved progressively eastward, with the Ottomans pushing deeper into the Persian domains, entire Kurdish regions of [[Anatolia]] were at one point or another exposed to horrific acts of despoliation and deportation. These began under the reign of the [[Safavid]] Shah [[Tahmasp I]] (ruled 1524–1576). Between 1534 and 1535, Tahmasp, using a policy of [[scorched earth]] against his Ottoman arch rivals, began the systematic destruction of the old Kurdish cities and the countryside. When retreating before the Ottoman army, Tahmasp ordered the destruction of crops and settlements of all sizes, driving the inhabitants before him into [[Azerbaijan]], from where they were later transferred permanently, nearly 1,600&amp;nbsp;km (1,000 miles) east, into [[Khorasan Province|Khurasan]].

[[Shah Abbas I|Shah Abbas]] inherited a state threatened by the Ottomans in the west and the [[Uzbeks]] in the northeast. He bought off the former, in order to gain time to defeat the latter, after which he selectively depopulated the Zagros and Caucasus approaches, deporting Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, North Caucasians and others who might, willingly or not, supply, support or be any use in an Ottoman campaign in the region.

The magnitude of Safavid [[Scorched earth]] policy can be glimpsed through the works of the Safavid court historians. One of these, ''Iskandar Bayg Munshi'', describing just one episode, writes in the ''Alam-ara ye Abbasi'' that Shah Abbas, in furthering the scorched earth policy of his predecessors, ''set upon the country north of the [[Araxes]] and west of [[Urmia]], and between [[Kars]] and Lake Van, which he commanded to be laid waste and the population of the countryside and the entire towns rounded up and led out of harm's way.'' Resistance was met "with massacres and mutilation; all immovable property, houses, churches, mosques, crops ... were destroyed, and the whole horde of prisoners was hurried southeast before the Ottomans should counterattack". Many of these Kurds ended up in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], but many others were scattered into the [[Alburz]] mountains, central [[Persia]], and even [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]]. They became the nucleus of several modern Kurdish enclaves outside Kurdistan proper, in [[Iran]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. On one occasion [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] is said to have intended to transplant 40,000 Kurds to northern Khorasan but to have succeeded in deporting only 15,000 before his troops were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DEPORTATIONS |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=13 November 2011|author1=JOHN R.

=== Massacre of Ganja ===
According to the early 17th century [[Armenian language|Armenian]] historian [[Arakel of Tabriz|Arak'el Davrizhetsi]], the Sunni Kurdish tribe of Jekirlu inhabited the region of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. In 1606, when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] [[Siege of Ganja (1606)|reconquered]] Ganja, he ordered a general massacre of the Jekirlu. Even infants were slaughtered with sharp swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Vardapet Aṛakʻel of Tabriz|last=Dawrizhetsʻi|first=Aṛakʻel|publisher=Mazda Publishers|year=2005|isbn=9781568591827|location=|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Dimdim===
There is a well documented historical account [[Battle of DimDim|of a long battle in 1609–1610]] between Kurds and the [[Safavid Empire]]. The battle took place around a fortress called "Dimdim" (DimDim) in Beradost region around Lake [[Urmia]] in northwestern [[Iran]]. In 1609, the ruined structure was rebuilt by "Emîr Xan Lepzêrîn" (Golden Hand Khan), ruler of Beradost, who sought to maintain the independence of his expanding principality in the face of both Ottoman and Safavid penetration into the region. Rebuilding Dimdim was considered a move toward independence that could threaten Safavid power in the northwest. Many Kurds, including the rulers of Mukriyan ([[Mahabad &amp; Piranshahr]]), rallied around Amir Khan. After a long and bloody siege led by the Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg, which lasted from November 1609 to the summer of 1610, Dimdim was captured. All the defenders were massacred. [[Shah Abbas I|Shah Abbas]] ordered a general massacre in Beradost and Mukriyan (reported by Eskandar Beg Turkoman, Safavid Historian in the Book ''Alam Aray-e Abbasi'') and resettled the Turkish [[Afshar tribe]] in the region while deporting many Kurdish tribes to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Although Persian historians (like Eskandar Beg) depicted the first battle of Dimdim as a result of Kurdish mutiny or treason, in Kurdish oral traditions (Beytî dimdim), literary works (Dzhalilov, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–72), and histories, it was treated as a struggle of the Kurdish people against foreign domination. In fact, Beytî dimdim is considered a national epic second only to [[Mem û Zîn]] by [[Ahmad Khani]]. The first literary account of this battle is written by [[Faqi Tayran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/articles/v7/v7f4/v7f446.html DIMDIM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033443/http://www.iranica.com/articles/v7/v7f4/v7f446.html |date=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Iskandar Beg Munshi|Eskandar Beg Monshi]] |year=1979 |title=History of Shah Abbas the Great History of Shah Abbas the Great |publisher=Mazda |isbn=0-89158-296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O.

==Ottoman period==
[[File:Kurdish Prince (From the Italian book 1876, Giro Mondo).jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|A drawing of a Kurdish prince in an Italian book called Giro Mondo]]
When Sultan [[Selim I]], after defeating Shah [[Ismail I]] in 1514, annexed [[Western Armenia]] and Kurdistan, he entrusted the organisation of the conquered territories to Idris, the historian, who was a Kurd of [[Bitlis]]. He divided the territory into ''sanjaks'' or districts, and, making no attempt to interfere with the principle of heredity, installed the local chiefs as governors. He also resettled the rich pastoral country between [[Erzerum]] and [[Yerevan]], which had lain in waste since the passage of [[Timur]], with Kurds from the [[Hakkari]] and Bohtan districts.

===Janpulat Revolt===

Janpulat (Turkish: Canpulatoğlu, Arabic: [[Jumblatt|Junblat]]&lt;ref&gt;Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh, ''The Image Of An Ottoman City: Imperial Architecture And Urban Experience In Aleppo In The 16th And 17th Centuries'', BRILL, 2004, {{ISBN|9789004124547}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;) clan were local Kurdish feudal lords in the [[Jabal al-Akrad]] and [[Aleppo]] region for almost a century before the Ottoman conquest of Syria. Their leader, Hussein Janpulatoğlu, was appointed as governor of [[Aleppo]] in 1604, but he was executed by [[Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha|Çiğalzade Sinan Pasha]] allegedly for his late arrival at the [[Battle of Urmia (1604)|Battle of Urmia]]. According to Abul Wafa Al-Urdi, Janpulat had been murdered because of Kurdish origins. His nephew, Ali Pasha, revolted in revenge and declared sovereignty in 1606 and was supported by the [[Duke]] of [[Tuscany]], [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand I]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Masters, ''The Arabs of the Ottoman Empire, 1516–1918: A Social and Cultural History'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|1107067790}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He conquered a region stretching from [[Hama]] to [[Adana]] with 30,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;H.

Ali Pasha managed to escape and was later pardoned and appointed governor of province of [[Timișoara|Temesvár]] in Hungary. He was eventually executed by Murad Pasha in [[Belgrade]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Finkel, ''Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire'', Basic Books, 2007, {{ISBN|9780465008506}}, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle against Yazidis===
In 1640, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under the command of ''Firari Mustafa Pasha'' attacked the [[Yazidis]] an [[ethno-religious]] group of Mount ''Sinjar''. According to [[Evliya Çelebi]], the Ottoman force was around 40,000 strong. The battle lasted for seven hours and at the end 3,060 Yazidis were slain. The day after the battle, the Ottoman army raided and set fire to 300 Yazidi villages. Between 1000 to 2000 Yazidis had taken refuge in some caves around Sinjar. They were also massacred after the Ottoman army attacked the caves with [[cannon]]s and hand [[grenade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Evliya Çelebi, ''The Intimate Life of an Ottoman Statesman: Melek Ahmed Pasha (1588–1662)'', Translated by Robert Dankoff, 304 pp., SUNY Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-7914-0640-7}}, pp. 169–171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rozhiki Revolt===
In 1655, ''Abdal Khan'' the Kurdish ''Rozhiki'' ruler of [[Badlis|Bidlis]], formed a private army and fought a full scale war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops. [[Evliya Çelebi]] noted the presence of many [[Yazidi]]s in his army.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Reid, ''Rozhîkî Revolt, 1065/1655'', Journal of Kurdish Studies, Vol. 3, pp. 13–40, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this armed insurrection was the discord between Abdal Khan and ''Melek Ahmad Pasha'' the Ottoman governor of [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and Abdal Khan. The Ottoman troops marched onto Bidlis and committed atrocities against civilians as they passed through ''Rozhiki'' territory. Abdal Khan had built great stone redoubts around Bitlis, and also old city walls were defended by a large army of Kurdish [[infantry]] armed with [[musket]]s. Ottomans attacked the outer defensive perimeter and defeated Rozhiki soldiers, then they rushed to loot Bidlis and attacked the civilians. Once the Ottoman force established its camp in Bidlis, in an act of revenge, Abdal Khan made a failed attempt to assassinate Melek Ahmad Pasha. A unit of twenty Kurdish soldiers rode into the tent of Yusuf Kethuda, the second-in-command and fought a ferocious battle with his guards. After the fall of Bidlis, 1,400 Kurds continued to resist from the city's old [[citadel]]. While most of these surrendered and were given amnesty, 300 of them were massacred by Melek Ahmad with 70 of them dismembered by sword and cut into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Reid, ''Batak 1876: a massacre and its significance'', Journal of Genocide Research, 2(3), pp. 375–409, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bedr Khan of Botan===
[[Image:Kurdish states 1835.png|thumb|200px|Kurdish independent kingdoms and autonomous principalities circa 1835.]]
[[File:Khurasani kurdish exclave 1835.png|thumb|200px|Kurdish autonomous states in Khurasani Kurdish exclave circa 1835.]]
Except for the short Iranian recapture under [[Nader Shah]] in the first half of the 18th century, the system of administration introduced by Idris remained unchanged until the close of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]]. But the Kurds, owing to the remoteness of their country from the capital and the decline of Turkey, had greatly increased in influence and power, and had spread westwards over the country as far as [[Ankara|Angora]].

After the war with Russia, the Kurds attempted to free themselves from Ottoman control which resulted in the Bedr Khan clan uprising in 1834. The Ottoman Porte made the decision to then end the autonomous regions of the Eastern portion of the Empire. This was done by Rashid Pasha, also a Kurd.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meiselas |first=Susan |year=1998 |title=Kurdistan: in the Shadow of History |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780679423898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal towns were strongly garrisoned, and many of the Kurd [[bey]]s were replaced by Turkish governors. A rising under Bedr Khan Bey in 1843 was firmly repressed, and after the [[Crimean War]] the Turks strengthened their hold on the country.

The modernizing and centralizing efforts of [[Sultan Mahmud II]] antagonized Kurdish feudal chiefs. As a result two powerful Kurdish families rebelled against the Ottomans in 1830. ''Bedr Khan'' of Botan rose up in the west of Kurdistan, around [[Diyarbakır]], and ''Muhammad Pasha'' of [[Rowanduz|Rawanduz]] rebelled in the east and established his authority in [[Mosul]] and [[Erbil]]. At this time, Turkish troops were preoccupied with invading Egyptian troops in Syria and were unable to suppress the revolt. As a result, ''Bedr Khan'' extended his authority to ''Diyarbakır'', ''Siverik'' ([[Siverek]]), ''Veransher'' ([[Viranşehir]]), ''Sairt'' ([[Siirt]]), ''Sulaimania'' ([[Sulaymaniyah]]) and ''Sauj Bulaq'' ([[Mahabad]]). He established a Kurdish principality in these regions until 1845. He struck his own coins, and his name was included in Friday sermons. In 1847, the Turkish forces turned their attention toward this area, and defeated Bedr Khan and exiled him to [[Crete]]. He was later allowed to return to [[Damascus]], where he lived until his death in 1868. Bedr Khan Beg made two campaigns in 1843 and 1846 against the Assyrian Christians (Nestorians) of Hakkari and massacred 50,000 Assyrians in an attempt to Islamize the region; those Assyrians who met their fate were the mother and the two brothers of the yet to be spiritual Assyrian leader Mar Shimun.

Bedr Khan became king when his brother died. His brother's son became very upset over this, which the Turks exploited in tricking him into fighting his uncle. They told him that they would make him king if he killed Bedr Khan. Bedr Khan's nephew brought many Kurdish warriors with to attack his uncle's forces. After defeating Bedr Khan, Bedr Khan's nephew was executed instead of becoming king as the Turks had promised.&lt;ref name="shadow"/&gt; There are two famous Kurdish songs about this battle, called "Ezdin Shêr" and "Ez Xelef im" (both can be found on http://www.kurdishmusic.eu/siwanperwerm.html). After this, there were further revolts in 1850 and 1852.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Elphinston, "The Kurdish Question", ''Journal of International Affairs'', Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1946, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurdistan as an administrative entity had a brief and shaky existence of 17 years between 13 December 1847 (following [[Bedirhan Bey's revolt]]) and 1864, under the initiative of [[Koca Mustafa Reşit Pasha]] during the [[Tanzimat]] period (1839–1876) of the Ottoman Empire. The capital of the province was, at first, [[Ahlat]], and covered [[Diyarbekir]], [[Muş]], Van, [[Hakkari]], Botan ([[Cizre]]) and [[Mardin]]. In the following years, the capital was transferred several times, first from Ahlat to Van, then to Muş and finally to Diyarbakır. Its area was reduced in 1856 and the province of Kurdistan within the Ottoman Empire was abolished in 1864. Instead, the former provinces of [[Diyarbekir]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]] have been re-constituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozgurpolitika.org/2003/02/19/hab44.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040121030111/http://www.ozgurpolitika.org/2003/02/19/hab44.html |archivedate=21 January 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1880, Shaikh Ubaidullah led a revolt aiming at bringing the areas between Lakes Van and Urmia under his own rule, however Ottoman and Qajar forces succeeded in defeating the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Shaikh Ubaidullah's Revolt and Armenians===
[[File:Diyarbekir shepherd, Mardin Kurd, Aljazeera Kurd, 1873.jpg|thumb|Kurdish costumes, 1873.]]
The [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] was followed by the attempt of [[Sheikh Ubeydullah]] in 1880–1881 to found an independent Kurd [[principality]] under the protection of Turkey. The attempt, at first encouraged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Porte]], as a reply to the projected creation of an Armenian state under the suzerainty of Russia, collapsed after Ubeydullah's raid into Persia, when various circumstances led the central government to reassert its supreme authority. Until the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 there had been little hostile feeling between the Kurds and the Armenians, and as late as 1877–1878 the mountaineers of both races had co-existed fairly well together.

In 1891 the activity of the Armenian Committees induced the Porte to strengthen the position of the Kurds by raising a body of Kurdish [[irregular military|irregular]] [[cavalry]], who were well-armed [[Hamidieh soldier]]s after the Sultan [[Abd-ul-Hamid II]]. Minor disturbances constantly occurred, and were soon followed by a massacre and rape of Armenians at [[Sasun]] by Kurdish nomads and Ottoman troops&lt;ref name="Bloxham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199226887|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OdoyKqocnoC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=Kurds+ottoman+armenian+++sasun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ4JrnqdDOAhWHKMAKHR1gC5cQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Kurds%20ottoman%20armenian%20%20%20sasun&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other places, 1894–1896.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==20th century history==

===Rise of nationalism===
{{Main|Early Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalism}}
{{Further|Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire}}
Kurdish nationalism emerged at the end of the 19th Century around the same time as Turks and Arabs began to embrace an ethnic sense of identity in place of earlier forms of solidarity such as the idea of Ottoman citizenship or membership of a religious community, or ''millet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Modern+History+of+the+Kurds+%22sense+of+national+community%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEp_ON_PrWAhVHWxoKHbmeA2gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Modern%20History%20of%20the%20Kurds%20%22sense%20of%20national%20community%22&amp;f=false|title=A Modern History of the Kurds|last=McDowall|first=David|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=1997|isbn=1 86064 185 7|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolts occurred sporadically but only in 1880 with the uprising led by [[Sheikh Ubeydullah]] were demands as an ethnic group or nation made. Ottoman sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdul Hamid]] responded by a campaign of integration by co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents to strong Ottoman power with prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] regiments during World War I.&lt;ref name=laciner&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Ideological And Historical Roots Of Kurdist Movements In Turkey: Ethnicity Demography, Politics |journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics |first1=Bal |last1=Laçiner |author2=Bal, Ihsan |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=473–504 |doi=10.1080/13537110490518282 |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |format= |accessdate=19 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011225529/http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and end of the Ottoman empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical [[secularization]] which the strongly Muslim Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant [[Turkish nationalism]] in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.&lt;ref name=natali&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ottoman Kurds and emergent Kurdish nationalism|journal=Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies|first1=Denise|last1=Natali|volume=13|issue=3|pages=383–387|doi= 10.1080/1066992042000300701|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western powers (particularly the United Kingdom) fighting the Turks also promised the Kurds they would act as guarantors for Kurdish independence, a promise they subsequently broke. One particular organization, the Kurdish Teali Cemiyet ([[Society for the Rise of Kurdistan]], or SAK) was central to the forging of a distinct Kurdish identity. It took advantage of period of political liberalization in during the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] (1908–1920) of Turkey to transform a renewed interest in [[Kurdish culture]] and language into a political nationalist movement based on ethnicity.&lt;ref name=natali/&gt;

During the relatively open government of the 1950s, Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests but this move towards integration was halted with the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=laciner/&gt; The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as [[Marxist]] political thought influenced a new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local [[feudal]] authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority, eventually they would form the militant separatist [[Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan|PKK]] – listed as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] by the United Nations, European Union, [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] and many states that includes United States), or [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] in English.

===After World War I===

[[File:Republic of mahabad and south azerbaijan 1945 1946.png| thumb|200px|[[Republic of Mahabad]], 1945–1946.]]
Some Kurdish groups sought self-determination and the championing in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of Kurdish autonomy in the [[aftermath of World War I]], Mustafa Kemal Atatürk prevented such a result. Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established so-called [[Republic of Ararat]]. Turkey suppressed Kurdist revolts in 1925, 1930, and 1937–1938, while Iran did the same in the 1920s to [[Simko Shikak]] at [[Lake Urmia]] and Jaafar Sultan of Hewraman region who controlled the region between [[Marivan]] and north of [[Halabja]]. A short-lived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored Kurdish [[Republic of Mahabad]] in Iran did not survive for long after World War II.

From 1922 to 1924 in Iraq, a [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] existed. When [[Ba'ath]]ist administrators thwarted Kurdish nationalist ambitions in [[Iraq]], war broke out in the 1960s. In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self-rule within Iraq, demanding larger areas including the oil-rich [[Kirkuk]] region. For recent developments see [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

In 1922, an investigation was initiated for Nihad Pasha, the commander of [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|El-Cezire]] front, by ''Adliye Encümeni'' (Council of Justice) of [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] with allegations of fraud. During a confidential convention on the issue on 22 July, a letter of introductions by the Cabinet of Ministers and signed by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] was read. The text was referring to the region as "Kurdistan" three times and providing Nihad Pasha with full authorities to support the local Kurdish administrations (''idare-i mahallîyeye dair teşkilâtlar'') as per the principle of [[self-determination]] (''Milletlerin kendi mukadderatlarını bizzat idare etme hakkı''), in order to gradually establish a local government in the regions inhabited by Kurds (''Kürtlerle meskûn menatık'').&lt;ref&gt;''TBMM Gizli Celse Zabıtları'' Vol. 3 p. 551, Ankara, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Iraqi Kurdish statesman Mihemed Emîn Zekî, while serving as the Minister of the Economy in the first [[Nuri as-Said]] government, drew the boundaries of Turkish Kurdistan as: "With mountains of Ararat and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] border (including the region of [[Kars Province|Kars]], where Kurds and Georgians live side by side) to the north, Iranian border to the east, Iraqi border to the south, and to the west, a line drawn from the west of [[Sivas]] to [[İskenderun]]. These boundaries are also in accord with those drawn by the Ottomans." &lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Emin Zeki, ''Kürdistan Tarihi'' p. 20, Ankara, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, [[Garo Sassouni]], formerly a prominent figure of [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] Armenia, defined the borders of "Kurdistan proper" (excluding whole territory of [[Wilsonian Armenia]]) as: "... with a line from the south of Erzincan to [[Kharput]], incorporating [[Tunceli|Dersim]], [[Bingöl|Çarsancak]], and Malatya, including the mountains of [[Osmaniye Province|Cebel-i Bereket]] and reaching the Syrian border", also adding, "these are the broadest boundaries of Kurdistan that can be claimed by Kurds."&lt;ref&gt;Garo Sasuni, ''Kürt Ulusal Hareketleri ve 15. Yüzyıldan Günümüze Kürt-Ermeni İlişkileri'' p. 331, Istanbul, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, several large-scale Kurdish revolts took place in this region. The most important ones were the Saikh Said Rebellion in 1925, the [[Ararat Revolt]] in 1930 and the Dersim Revolt in 1938 (see [[Kurds in Turkey]]). Following these rebellions, the area of Turkish Kurdistan was put under [[martial law]] and many Kurds were displaced. Government also encouraged resettlement of [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians from Kosovo]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the region to change the population makeup. These events and measures led to a long-lasting mutual distrust between Ankara and the Kurds .&lt;ref&gt;C.

About half of all Kurds live in Turkey. According to the CIA Factbook they account for 18 percent of the Turkish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tu.html#People|title=CIA World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are predominantly distributed in the southeastern corner of the country.&lt;ref name="coucileu"&gt;''[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc06/EDOC11006.htm ''The cultural situation of the Kurds''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124114527/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc06%2FEDOC11006.htm |date=24 November 2006 }}&lt;cite&gt;A report by Lord Russell-Johnston, Council of Europe, July 2006&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The best available estimate of the number of persons in Turkey speaking the Kurdish language is about five million (1980). About 3,950,000 others speak Northern Kurdish ([[Kurmanji]]) (1980).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TRA Ethnologue census of languages in Asian portion of Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018235156/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TRA |date=18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While population increase suggests that the number of speakers has grown, it is also true that the ban on the use of the language in Turkey was only lifted in 1991 and still exists in most official settings (including schools), and that many fewer ethnic Kurds live in the countryside where the language has traditionally been used. The number of speakers is clearly less than the 15 million or so persons who identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.

From 1915 to 1918, Kurds struggled to end Ottoman rule over their region. They were encouraged by [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s support for non-Turkish nationalities of the empire and submitted their claim for independence to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Arin, Kubilay Yado, [https://www.academia.edu/11674094/Turkey_and_the_Kurds_From_War_to_Reconciliation "Turkey and the Kurds – From War to Reconciliation?"] UC Berkeley Center for Right Wing Studies Working Paper Series, March 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] stipulated the creation of an autonomous Kurdish state in 1920, but the subsequent [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] failed to mention Kurds. In 1925 and 1930, Kurdish revolts were forcibly suppressed.

Following these events, the existence of distinct ethnic groups like Kurds in Turkey was officially denied and any expression by the Kurds of their ethnic identity was harshly repressed. Until 1991, the use of the Kurdish language – although widespread – was illegal. As a result of reforms inspired by the EU, music, radio and television broadcasts in Kurdish are now allowed albeit with severe time restrictions (for example, radio broadcasts can be no longer than sixty minutes per day nor can they constitute more than five hours per week while television broadcasts are subject to even greater restrictions). Additionally, education in Kurdish is now permitted though only in private institutions.

As late as 1994, however, [[Leyla Zana]], the first female Kurdish representative in Turkey's Parliament, was charged with making "separatist speeches" and sentenced to 15 years in prison. At her inauguration as an MP, she reportedly identified herself as a Kurd. [[Amnesty International]] reported that "[s]he took the oath of loyalty in Turkish, as required by law, then added in Kurdish, 'I shall struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together in a democratic framework.' Parliament erupted with shouts of 'Separatist!', 'Terrorist!', and 'Arrest her!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/action/special/zana.html |title=Leyla Zana, Prisoner of Conscience |publisher=Amnesty International USA |location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510082350/http://www.amnestyusa.org/action/special/zana.html |archivedate=10 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 1999, the PKK and the Turkish military engaged in open war, and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, with Kurdish civilians moving to local defensible centers such as [[Diyarbakır]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], and [[Şırnak]], as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe.

Kurds make up around 17% of Iraq's population. They are the majority in at least three provinces in Northern Iraq which are known as [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Kurds have also had a presiding majority in Kirkuk, prior to decades of displacement. They still have a presence in [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]], [[Khanaqin]], and [[Baghdad]]. There are around 300,000 Kurds living in the Iraqi capital [[Baghdad]], 50,000 in the city of [[Mosul]] and around 100,000 Kurds living elsewhere in Southern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_155.html|title=Adherents.com: By Location|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurds led by [[Mustafa Barzani]] were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Harris, ''Ethnic Conflict and the Kurds'' in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp. 118–120, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ANFALINT.htm Introduction]. ''Genocide in Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds'' (Human Rights Watch Report, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds. Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]], according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly those around Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Harris, ''Ethnic Conflict and the Kurds'' in the ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', p. 121, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1975 and 1978, two-hundred thousand Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;M. Farouk-Sluglett, P. Sluglett, J. Stork, ''Not Quite Armageddon: Impact of the War on Iraq'', MERIP Reports, July–September 1984, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a ''de facto'' civil war broke out. Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures such as the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the wholesale destruction of thousands of villages and the deportation of thousands of Kurds to southern and central Iraq. The campaign of Iraqi government against Kurds in 1988 was called ''Anfal'' ("Spoils of War"). The Anfal attacks led to destruction of two thousand villages and death of between fifty and one-hundred thousand Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/|title=Genocide in Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Kurdish uprising in 1991 ({{lang-ku|Raperîn}}) led by the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] and [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|KDP]], Iraqi troops recaptured the Kurdish areas and hundreds of thousand of Kurds fled to the borders. To alleviate the situation, a "safe haven" was established by the Security Council. The autonomous Kurdish area was mainly controlled by the rival parties KDP and PUK. The Kurdish population welcomed the American troops in 2003 by holding celebrations and dancing in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/articles/031222on_onlineonly04 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075937/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/articles/031222on_onlineonly04 |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/04/09/kurds-rejoice-but-fighting-continues-in-north/ | title=Kurds Rejoice, But Fighting Continues in North |agency=Associated Press |work=[[foxnews.com]] |date=9 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/10/sprj.irq.war.main/index.html|title=CNN.com – Coalition makes key advances in northern Iraq – 10 April 2003|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Damien McElroy |date=11 April 2003 |title=Grateful Iraqis surrender to Kurds |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=421832003 |newspaper=The Scotsman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213033423/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=421832003 |archivedate=13 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area controlled by [[peshmerga]] was expanded, and Kurds now have effective control in Kirkuk and parts of Mosul.

They are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the north, but there are also significant Kurdish populations in Aleppo and Damascus. Kurds often speak Kurdish in public, unless all those present do not.

Techniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in [[Syria]] include various bans on the use of the Kurdish language, refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic, the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish.&lt;ref name="Syria_Silenced_Kurds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm|title=Syria: The Silenced Kurds|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/syria9812.htm "Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Syria"].

===Armenia===
{{See also|Kurdish-Armenian relations}}
Between the 1920s and 1990s, [[Armenia]] was a part of the Soviet Union, within which Kurds, like other ethnic groups, had the status of a protected minority. Armenian Kurds were permitted their own state-sponsored newspaper, radio broadcasts and cultural events. During the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], many non-Yazidis and Kurds were forced to leave their homes. Following the end of the Soviet Union, Kurds in Armenia were stripped of their cultural privileges and most fled to Russia or Western Europe.&lt;ref name=meho&gt;[http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/meho/meho-bibliography-2001.pdf "Kurds and Kurdistan: A General Background"], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Recently introduced [[National Assembly (Armenia)#Electoral System|Electoral System]] of the Armenian National Assembly reserves seats for each of 4 major national minorities, including the Kurds.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1920, two Kurdish-inhabited areas of Jewanshir (capital [[Kalbajar]]) and eastern Zangazur (capital [[Lachin]]) were combined to form the [[Kurdistan Okrug]] (or "Red Kurdistan"). The period of existence of the Kurdish administration was brief and did not last beyond 1929. Kurds subsequently faced many repressive measures, including deportations. As a result of the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], many Kurdish areas have been destroyed and more than 150,000 Kurds have been deported since 1988.&lt;ref name=meho/&gt;

[[Genetic testing]] amongst randomly chosen [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] populations has begun to shed light into the disparate origins of the Kurds. The results reveal a variety of connections amongst the Kurds, when assessing paternal and maternal lineages. Overall the Kurds share genetic ties to other speakers of [[Iranian languages]] as well as with various peoples from the Caucasus such as the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] which suggests that the Kurds have ancient ethnic ties that connect them to both the early inhabitants of the Kurdistan area, such as the [[Hurrian]]s.

===Similarity to Europeans and peoples of the Caucasus===
A study by Richards and colleagues of [[mitochondrial DNA]] in the Near East found that Kurds, Azeris, Ossetians and Armenians show a high incidence of mtDNA U5 lineages, which are common among Europeans, although rare elsewhere in the Near East. The sample of Kurds in this study came from northwest Iran and northeast Iraq, where Kurds usually predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Richards M |title=Tracing European Founder Lineages in the Near Eastern mtDNA Pool |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1251–76 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11032788 |pmc=1288566 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9297(07)62954-1|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Macaulay V|author3=Hickey E|display-authors=3|last4=Vega|first4=Emilce|last5=Sykes|first5=Bryan|last6=Guida|first6=Valentina|last7=Rengo|first7=Chiara|last8=Sellitto|first8=Daniele|last9=Cruciani|first9=Fulvio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ivan Nasidze and his colleagues examined both mitochondrial and [[Y chromosome]] DNA, they found Kurdish groups most similar genetically to other West Asian groups, and most distant from Central Asian groups, for both mtDNA and the Y chromosome. However, Kurdish groups show a closer relationship with European groups than with Caucasian groups based on mtDNA, but the opposite based on the Y chromosome, indicating some differences in their maternal and paternal histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nasidze I, Quinque D, Ozturk M, Bendukidze N, Stoneking M |title=MtDNA and Y chromosome variation in Kurdish groups |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=401–12 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15996169 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both populations present mtDNA lineages that clearly belong to the Western Eurasian gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Comas D, Calafell F, Bendukidze N, Fañanás L, Bertranpetit J |title=Georgian and kurd mtDNA sequence analysis shows a lack of correlation between languages and female genetic lineages |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10766939 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200005)112:1&lt;5::AID-AJPA2&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarity to Jewish people===
There also appear to be some links to northern Semitic peoples such as the Syrians and possibly ancient [[Hebrews]],{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but fewer links to southern Semites in the [[Arabian peninsula]] in spite of the region having been conquered very early by Muslim [[Arabs]]. In 2001 Nebel et al. compared three Jewish and three non-Jewish groups from the Middle East: [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]], and [[History of Jews in Kurdistan|Kurdish Jews]] from Israel; Muslim Arabs from Israel and the [[Palestinian Authority]] Area; Bedouin from the [[Negev]]; and Muslim Kurds. They concluded that Kurdish and Sephardic Jews were indistinguishable from one another, whereas both differed slightly, yet noticeably, from Ashkenazi Jews. Nebel et al. had earlier (2000) found a large genetic relationship between Jews and Palestinian Arabs, but in this study found an even higher relationship of Jews with Iraqi Kurds. They conclude that the common genetic background shared by Jews and other Middle Eastern groups predates the division of Middle Easterners into different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Nebel A, Filon D, Brinkmann B, Majumder PP, Faerman M, Oppenheim A 2001 1095–112"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nebel A, Filon D, Brinkmann B, Majumder PP, Faerman M, Oppenheim A |title=The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=1095–112 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11573163 |pmc=1274378 |doi=10.1086/324070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nebel et al. (2001) also found that the [[Cohen modal haplotype]], considered the most definitive Jewish haplotype, was found among 10.1% of Kurdish Jews, 7.6% of Ashkenazim, 6.4% of Sephardim, 2.1% of Palestinian Arabs, and 1.1% of Kurds. The Cohen modal haplotype and the most frequent Kurdish haplotype were the same on five markers (out of six) and very close on the other marker. The most frequent Kurdish haplotype was shared by 9.5% of Kurds, 2.6% of Sephardim, 2.0% of Kurdish Jews, 1.4% of Palestinian Arabs, and 1.3% of Ashkenazim. The general conclusion is that these similarities result mostly from the sharing of ancient genetic patterns, and not from more recent admixture between the groups.&lt;ref name="Nebel A, Filon D, Brinkmann B, Majumder PP, Faerman M, Oppenheim A 2001 1095–112"/&gt;

'''Hukou''' is a system of household registration in [[mainland China]]&lt;!--hukou system is not applied in HK and Macau)--&gt; and [[Taiwan]], although the system itself is more properly called "''huji''", and has origins in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]]. A household registration record officially identifies a person as a resident of an area and includes identifying information such as name, parents, spouse, and date of birth. A hukou can also refer to a [[family register]] in many contexts since the household registration record ({{zh|s=户口簿|t=戶口簿|p=hùkǒu bù}}) is issued per family, and usually includes the births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and moves, of all members in the family.

The system descends in part from ancient Chinese household registration systems. The hukou system also influenced similar systems in neighboring East Asian countries—such as one within the public administration structures of Japan ([[koseki]]) and Korea ([[hoju]]), as well as Vietnam ([[hộ khẩu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Teacher Educator International Professional Development as Ren |last=Liu  |first=Laura Blythe  |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn= 978-3662516485 |pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=China's Urban Billion: The Story behind the Biggest Migration in Human History |last=Miller |first=Tom  |year=2012 |isbn=978-1780321417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=China's Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know? |last= Kroeber |first=Arthur R. |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-0190239039 |pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Korea]], the [[hoju]] system was abolished in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gender issues and Confucian scriptures: Is Confucianism incompatible with gender equality in South Korea?|first=Eunkang|last=Koh|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=71|number=2|pages=345–362|jstor=40378774|doi=10.1017/s0041977x08000578|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While unrelated in origin, [[propiska in the Soviet Union]] and [[resident registration in Russia]] had a similar purpose and served as a model for modern China's hukou system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Liu |first=Li  |last2=Kuang |first2=Lei  |year=2012 |editor-last=Denson |editor-first=Tom  |title=Discrimination against Rural-to-Urban Migrants: The Role of the Hukou System in China |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489849/ |department= U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=PLOS |publication-date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Theorizing Chinese Citizenship |last=Guo |first=Zhonghua |last2=Guo |first2=Sujian |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2015 |isbn=978-1498516693 |publication-date=15 October 2015 |pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its connection to social programs provided by the government, which assigns benefits based on agricultural and non-agricultural residency status (often referred to as rural and urban), the hukou system is sometimes likened to a form of [[caste]] system.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance", by Elizabeth J. Perry, Mark Selden, page [https://books.google.com/books?id=JqZyQCZmrRAC&amp;pg=PA90 90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"China's New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society", p. 86, by Daniel A. Bell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Trust and Distrust: Sociocultural Perspectives", p. 63, by Ivana Marková, Alex Gillespie&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the source of much inequality over the decades since the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949, as urban residents received benefits that ranged from retirement pension to education to health care, while rural citizens were often left to fend for themselves. In recent years, the central government has begun to reform the system in response to protests and a changing economic system, but experts speculate as to whether or not these changes have been of substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lu |first1=Rachel |title=China Is Ending Its 'Apartheid.'

==Nomenclature==
The formal name for the system is "''huji''." Within the ''huji'' system, a "''hukou''" is the registered residency status of a particular individual in this system. However, the term "''hukou''" is used colloquially to refer to the entire system, and it has been adopted by English-language audiences to refer to both the ''huji'' system and an individual's ''hukou''.

==History==
According to the ''Examination of Hukou'' in [[Wenxian Tongkao]] published in 1317, there was a minister for population management during the [[Zhou Dynasty]] named Simin ({{zh|c=司民|links=no}}), who was responsible for recording births, deaths, emigrations and immigrations.  The [[Rites of Zhou]] notes that three copies of documents were kept in different places. The administrative divisions in Zhou Dynasty were a function of the distance to the state capital. The top division nearest the capital was named Dubi ({{zh|c=都鄙|links=no}}), top division in more distant areas were named Xiang ({{zh|c=鄉|links=no}}) and Sui ({{zh|c=遂|links=no}}). Families were organized under the [[Baojia system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China's Hukou System: Markets, Migrants and Institutional Change|page=30|author=Jason Young|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China’s Urbanization and the World Economy|page=29|author=Fan Zhang|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guan Zhong]], Prime Minister of the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] 7th century BCE, imposed different taxation and conscription policies on different areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]:国门内外，都鄙井田，山泽川隰&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Guan Zhong also banned immigration, emigration, and separation of families without permission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]:禁迁徙、止流民、圉分异&lt;/ref&gt; In [[the Book of Lord Shang]], [[Shang Yang]] also described his policy restricting immigrations and emigrations.&lt;ref&gt;Guanzi: 禁迁徙、止流民、圉分异 chapter 2:使民无得擅徙&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xiao He]], the first Chancellor of the [[Han Dynasty]], added the chapter of ''Hu'' ({{zh|c=户律|links=no}}, "Households Code") as one of the [[Nine Chapter Law|nine basic law codes of Han]] ({{zh|c=九章律|links=no}}), and established the ''hukou'' system as the basis of tax revenue and conscription.

==Household registration in mainland China==
[[File:Hukou zh.jpg|right|thumb|An individual household's register or ''hukou'' booklet. The local police station held a copy of these records in its central register]]
The hukou system has origins in China that date back to ancient times, but the system in its current form came into being with the 1958 ''People’s Republic of China Hukou Registration Regulation''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's hukou system : markets, migrants and institutional change|last=1976-|first=Young, Jason,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781137277305|location=Basingstoke|pages=|chapter=2|oclc=847140377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until very recently, each citizen was classified in an agricultural or non-agricultural hukou (commonly referred to as rural or urban) and further categorized by location of origin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This two-fold organization structure was linked to social policy, and those residents who held {{clarify span|non-agricultural|based on other sentence, it seems non-agricultural means urban|date=December 2017}} hukou status received benefits not available to their rural counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chan, K. W. (2015). Five Decades of the Chinese Hukou System. In ''Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing'' (pp. 23-47). Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal migration was also tightly controlled by the central government, and only in the past few decades have these restrictions been loosened. While this system has played a major role in China’s fast economic growth, hukou has also promoted and aggravated social stratification and contributed significantly to the deprivation of many of China’s rural workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years, steps have been taken to alleviate the inequalities promulgated by the hukou system, with the most recent major reforms announced in March and July 2014, which included a provision that eliminated the division between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Rationale and function===
In its original legislation, the hukou system was justified as created to&lt;blockquote&gt;“...maintain social order, protect the rights and interests of citizens and to be of service to the establishment of socialism.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The central government asserted that because rural areas had greater capacity to absorb and use excess labor, the majority of the population should be concentrated in these regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, free movement of people was considered dangerous, as it would lead to overpopulation of cities and could threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under the hukou system, the rural population was structured to serve as support for urban industrialization, both in agricultural production&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and workers for [[State owned enterprises#China|state owned businesses]].&lt;ref name="rethinks"&gt;Luard, Tim. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm "China rethinks peasant 'apartheid'"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 10 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, the hukou system served other motives as well. After establishing the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] enacted policies based on the notions of stability and rapid modernization, and the hukou system was no exception.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871534491|title=Cities and stability : urbanization, redistribution, &amp; regime survival in China|last=L.|first=Wallace, Jeremy|isbn=9780199378982|location=New York|oclc=871534491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas have historically been where authoritarian regimes are most vulnerable: to combat this, the central government gave preferential treatment to city residents, hoping to prevent uprisings against the state, particularly in the early years when it was especially susceptible to rebellion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The structure of the hukou system also bolstered the power of the central government over its urban citizens: by making city residents dependent upon the government for all aspects of daily life, the central government could force obedience from problematic individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The central government’s efforts to contain migration has been a major factor in the rapid development of the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]]. Their tight check on migration into urban areas has helped prevent the emergence of a number of problems faced by many other developing countries.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xin-Rui|last2=Hui|first2=Eddie Chi-Man|last3=Choguill|first3=Charles|last4=Jia|first4=Sheng-Hua|date=2015|title=The new urbanization policy in China: Which way forward?|url=|journal=Habitat Internatioinal|volume=47|pages=279–284|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the appearance of slums outside of urban areas due to a massive influx of individuals searching for work has not been an issue, nor have poor health conditions due to high population density.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  And regardless of its other imperfections, the hukou system’s ability to maintain stability has contributed to China’s economic rise.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===

==== Pre-1949: Origins of the Hukou System ====
The legacy of the Chinese hukou system may be traced back to the pre-dynastic era, as early as the 21st century BC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In its early forms, the household registration system was used primarily for the purposes of taxation and conscription, as well as regulating migration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two early models of the hukou system were the xiangsui and baojia systems. The xiangsui system, established under the [[Western Zhou|Western Zhou Dynasty]] (circa 11th-8th centuries BC) was used as a method of organizing and categorizing urban and rural land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The function of the baojia system, propagated by Lord Shang Yang of the 4th century BC, was to create a system of accountability within groups of citizens: if one person within the group violated the strict rules in place, everyone in the group suffered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This structure was later utilized and expanded upon during the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Qin-dynasty|title=Qin dynasty {{!}} China [221-207 BC]|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of taxation, population control, and conscription.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Qing China 1820.png|thumb|264x264px|Precursors to the hukou system were used during the Qing dynasty to monitor individuals and raise funds for war]]
The first formal codification of the hukou system arose at the end of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Qing-dynasty|title=Qing dynasty {{!}} Chinese history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the 1911 Huji Law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although movement was nominally free under this statute, registration of individuals with the government was required, and it was used by the government to pursue communist forces and as a basis for taxation for the funding of wars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law also expanded upon the baojia system, and was intended to establish a sense of stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the period following the fall of the Qing Dynasty, China was ruled by various actors, each of which employed some system of household or personal identification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese employed a system used to identify those under their rule and to fund their war effort.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, the [[Kuomintang]] utilized the system to monitor the activities of their opponents, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party in turn used a system called lianbao, which bundled families into groups of five to aid tracking and impede counterrevolutionaries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== 1949-1978: Maoist Era ====
At the time of its founding in 1949, the People’s Republic of China was a highly agricultural nation. About 89% of its citizens lived in rural areas – about 484 million resided in the countryside, versus about 58 million in the city.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Duan, C., Gao, S., &amp; Zhu, Y. (n.d.). The Phenomenon of Internal Migration in China. In Chinese Migration and Families-at-Risk (pp. 14-36). Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as efforts to industrialize increased, more and more rural residents flocked to the cities in search of better economic opportunities: between 1957 and 1960, there was a 90.9% increase in the urban labor force.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A major objective of the hukou system implemented by the central government was thus to control the stream of resources moving away from the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The instability and high rates of movement that characterized the years following the establishment of the nation impeded the central government’s plan for society and the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the hukou system in its current form was not officially brought into being until 1958, the years preceding its establishment were characterized by growing efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to assert control over its populace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950, the Minister of Public Security, Luo Reiqing, published a statement detailing his vision for the implementation of the hukou system in the new era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By 1954, rural and urban citizens had been registered with the state, and rigorous regulations on the conversion of hukou status had already been implemented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These required that applicants have paperwork that documented employment, acceptance to a university, or immediate family relations in the city to be eligible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In March of the same year, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Labor issued the Joint Directive to Control Blind Influx of Peasants into Cities, which proclaimed that henceforth, all employment of rural workers in city firms would be controlled entirely by local labor bureaus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 9 January 1958, the People’s Republic of China Hukou Registration Regulation was signed into law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This divided the populace into nongmin, with an agricultural hukou, and shimin, with a non-agricultural hukou, and grouped all citizens by locality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The key difference, however, lied in the distinction between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Because the central government prioritized industrialization, state welfare programs, which were tied to hukou status, heavily favored urban residents; holders of agricultural hukous were unable to access these benefits and were saddled with inferior welfare policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, transfer of hukou status was highly restricted, with official quotas at 0.15-0.2% per year and actual conversion rates at about 1.5%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the following years, government oversight over the movement of people was expanded. In 1964, greater limits were imposed on migration to big cities, particularly major ones like Beijing and Shanghai, and in 1977 these regulations were furthered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Throughout this era, the hukou system was used as an instrument of the command economy, helping the central government implement its plan for industrializing the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 1978-Present: Post-Mao ====
From the establishment of the People’s Republic of China until [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]]’s death in 1976, the central government tightened its control over migration, and by 1978, intranational movement was controlled entirely by the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Because living “outside the system” was virtually impossible, nearly all movement of people was state-sponsored.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, with [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s rise to power in 1978 came the initiation of reforms that steadily began to alleviate some of the disparity between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou holders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Restrictions have been loosened on movement from rural areas to smaller cities, although migration to large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin are still heavily regulated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Greater autonomy has also been ceded to local governments in deciding quotas and eligibility criteria for converting hukou status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Legislation has been enacted that allow migrant workers to obtain temporary residency permits, although these permits do not allow them access to the same benefits as possessed by urban residents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, with living outside the system now much more practical than it used to be, a number of migrant workers don’t acquire the temporary residency permits – primarily because they don’t have the resources or concrete employment offers to do so – and as such live in danger of being forced to return to the countryside.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  And in 2014, the central government announced reform that among other things eliminated the division between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Effect on rural population===
{{See also|Migration in China}}
[[File:Elevated Sports Field of Beijing No. 8 High School.jpg|thumb|324x324px|While the government invests heavily in education in the cities, little to no investment in rural education occurs]]
Under the hukou system implemented by the central government in 1958, while holders of the non-agricultural hukou status were given ration cards for everyday necessities, including food and textiles, rural residents were forced to produce everything themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whereas the state provided housing in the city, individuals had to construct their own homes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The state invested in [[Education in China|education]], arranged employment, and provided retirement benefits for city residents, and provided none of these services for their rural citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These disparities have left the rural populace highly disadvantaged, and tragedies such as the famine of the Great Leap Forward primarily ravaged rural Chinese citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== During the Great Leap Forward's famine ====
During the mass famine of the [[Great Leap Forward]] from 1958 to 1962, having an urban versus a rural hukou could mean the difference between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Jasper. ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine''. New York: Holt, 1998. 220-232.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, nearly all of the approximately 600 million rural hukou residents were collectivized into village communal farms, where their agricultural output - after state taxes - would be their only source of food.  With institutionalized exaggeration of output figures by local Communist leaders and massive declines in production, state taxes during those years confiscated nearly all food in many rural communes, leading to mass starvation and the deaths of more than 30 million Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Jasper. ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine''. New York: Holt, 1998. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100 million urban hukou residents, however, were fed by fixed food rations established by the central government, which declined to an average of 1500 calories per day at times but still allowed survival for almost all during the famine.  An estimated 95% or higher of all deaths occurred among rural hukou holders.  With the suppression of news internally, many city residents were not aware that mass deaths were occurring in the countryside at all, which was essential to preventing organized opposition to Mao's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Jasper.

==== Post-1978 ====
During China’s transition from state socialism to market socialism (1978-2001), migrants, most of whom were women, worked in newly created export-processing zones in city suburbs under sub-standard working conditions.&lt;ref name="TheStar"&gt;"Chinese apartheid: Migrant labourers, numbering in hundreds of millions, who have been ejected from state concerns and co-operatives since the 1980s as China instituted market capitalism, have to have six passes before they are allowed to work in provinces other than their own. In many cities, private schools for migrant labourers are routinely closed down to discourage migration."

''China's Workers Under Assault: The Exploitation of Labor in a Globalizing Economy'', M.E. Sharpe, 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the ''hukou'' system upon migrant labourers became onerous in the 1980s after hundreds of millions were ejected from state corporations and cooperatives.&lt;ref name="TheStar" /&gt; Since the 1980s, an estimated 200 million Chinese live outside their officially registered areas and under far less eligibility to [[education]] and government services, living therefore in a condition similar in many ways to that of [[illegal aliens|illegal immigrant]]s&lt;ref name=rethinks/&gt; or to black people living in "white" regions under [[Apartheid]]. The millions of peasants who have left their land remain trapped at the margins of the urban society. They are often blamed for rising crime and unemployment and under pressure from their citizens, the city governments have imposed discriminatory rules.&lt;ref name="Macleod"&gt;Macleod, Calum. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-reviews-apartheid-for-900m-peasants-9178285.html "China reviews `apartheid'  for 900m peasants"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the children of farm workers ({{zh|s=农民工|p=nóngmín gōng|links=no}}) are not allowed to enroll in the city schools, and even now must live with their grandparents or other relatives to attend school in their hometowns. They are commonly referred to as the home-staying children. There are around 130 million such home-staying children, living without their parents, as reported by Chinese researchers.&lt;ref&gt;"从1000万到1.3亿:农村留守儿童到底有多少", http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFD2005-QLTS200502000.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As rural workers provide their workforce in the urban areas, which also profit from the respective taxes, while their families use public services in the rural areas (e.g. schools for their children, health care for the elderly), the system leads to a wealth transfer to the wealthier urban regions from the poorer regions on the public sector level. Intra-family payments from the working-age members to their relatives in the rural areas counteract that to some extent.

==== Challenges faced by migrant workers in the market ====
[[File:Xinhui 新會 中心南路 Zhongxin Nanlu 甘蔗 三輪車 Tricycle morning.JPG|thumb|308x308px|Many rural migrants find work as laborers in cities]]
With the loosening of restrictions on migration in the 1980s came a large influx of rural residents seeking better opportunities in the cities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Maurer-Fazio, M., Connelly, R., &amp; Tran, N. T. (2015). Negative native-place stereotypes and discriminatory wage penalties in China's migrant labour markets. In ''Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing'' (pp. 71-104). No, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these migrant workers have had to confront a number of challenges in their pursuit of financial security. Urban residents received priority over migrants when it came to employment opportunities,  and when migrant workers did find jobs, they tend to be positions with little potential for growth.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2013). Institutional and non-institutional paths: Migrants and non-migrants' different processes of socioeconomic status attainment in China. In China's Internal and International Migration (pp. 29-39). New York, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; While urban workers were supported by employment benefits and laws that favored them over their employers in case of disputes, rural hukou holders were not privy to such substantial protections.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; And because city officials’ performance was evaluated based on the prosperity of local residents and the local economy, they had little incentive to improve the quality of life of migrant workers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2008, the central government passed the Labor Contract Law, which guaranteed equal access to jobs, established a minimum wage, and required employers to provide contracts to full-time employees that included employment benefits.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, a 2010 study revealed that rural workers earned 40% less than urban workers, and only 16% receive employment benefits.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Migrant workers’ labor rights are also frequently violated – they work excessively long hours in poor conditions, and face physical and psychological harassment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cheng, Z., Nielsen, I., &amp; Smyth, R. (n.d.). Determinants of Wage Arrears and Implications for the Socioeconomic Wellbeing of China's Migrant Workers: Evidence from Guangdong Province. In Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing (pp. 105-125). Edward Elgar Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrant workers are also disproportionately affected by wage arrears, which occurs when employers either fail to pay employees on time or in full.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Although such incidences are technically illegal and punishable by seven years’ jail time, wage arrears still occur, and labor contracts and pensions may be disregarded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In a study conducted at the end of the 1990s, 46% of migrant workers were missing three or more months of pay, and some workers hadn’t been paid in a decade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fortunately, over the past couple of decades the prevalence of wage arrears have decreased, and in a study conducted from 2006-2009, it was found that 8% of migrant workers had experienced wage arrears.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Children of migrant workers ====
Following Mao’s death in 1976 came economic reforms that caused a surge in demand in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Chen, M., &amp; Sun, X. (n.d.). Parenting and Grandparenting of Left-Behind Children in Rural China. In Chinese Migration and Families-at-Risk (pp. 37-51). Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Rural residents rushed to fill this void, but without the support of hukou status-based government social programs, many of them were forced to leave their families behind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Economic growth throughout the years has maintained a high demand for labor in the cities that continues to be filled by migrant workers, and in 2000, the Fifth National Population Census revealed that 22.9 million children between the ages of 0-14 were living without either one or both of their parents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In 2010, that number had gone up to 61 million, equal to 37.7% of rural children and 21.88% of all Chinese children.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gao, S., &amp; Xue, J. (n.d.). Future Orientation and School Bonding among Left-Behind Children in Mainland China. In Chinese Migration and Families-at-Risk (pp. 78-104). Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  These children are usually cared for by their remaining parent and/or their grandparents, and although there is a 96% school enrollment rate among left behind children, they are susceptible to a number of developmental challenges.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Left behind children are more likely to resist authority and experience problems interacting with their peers;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  they are more likely to exhibit unhealthy behaviors such as foregoing breakfast and smoking, and have an increased likelihood of developing mental health issues, including loneliness and depression.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  And although left behind children may have greater academic opportunities due to their parents’ expanded financial capacity, they are also often under greater pressure to perform academically and thus are more vulnerable to school-related stress.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
[[File:Chinese children in Beijing.JPG|thumb|284x284px|Children who migrate with their parents face difficulties not experienced by their local counterparts]]
Children of rural workers who do migrate with their parents also face challenges. Without a local, non-agricultural hukou, migrant children have limited access to public social infrastructure. For example, urban students’ educational opportunities are far superior to that of their migrant student counterparts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sun, X., &amp; Chen, M. (n.d.). Inequality in Educational Opportunities of Migrant Children in China. In Chinese Migration and Families-at-Risk (pp. 52-77). Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central government reformed the education system in 1986 and then again in 1993, yielding greater autonomy to local governments in the regulation of their education system.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Limited space and the desire to protect local interests in turn induced local governments to avoid enrolling migrant children in their public schools.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Furthermore, because the central government subsidized public schools based on enrollment rates of children with local hukous, migrant children were required to pay higher fees if they wanted to attend.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Consequentially, many migrant families elect instead to send their children to private schools that specifically cater to migrants.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  However, to lower enrollment and attendance fees, these institutions must cut spending in other areas, resulting in a lower quality of education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  School facilities are often in poor condition, and many teachers are unqualified.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In subsequent years, the central government has enacted a number of reforms, with limited impact. In 2001, it asserted that public schools should be the primary form of education for the nation’s children, but didn’t specify how it would financially support schools in enrolling more migrant children, resulting in little change.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Similarly, in 2003, the government called for lower fees for migrant children, but again failed to detail how it would help schools pay for this.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  And in 2006, the government created the New Compulsory Education Act with asserted equal rights to education and ceded responsibility for enrolling migrant children to provincial governments.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  However, this too failed to improve the lot of migrant children. Students with non-local hukou had to pay inflated admission fees of 3,000 – 5,000 yuan – out of an average annual household income of 10,000 yuan – and are required to take their college entrance exams at their hukou locality, where it is often harder to get into college.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The difficulties faced by migrant children cause many to drop out, and this is particularly common in the middle school years: in 2010, only 30% of migrant children were enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Migrant children also disproportionately deal with mental health issues – 36% versus 22% among their local hukou counterparts – and 70% experience academic anxiety.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; They frequently face stigmatization and discrimination based off differences in how they dress and speak, and have difficulty interacting with other students.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Impact on rural elderly ====
Not only has the mass exodus of rural residents from the countryside in search of work impacted the children of migrant workers, it has also affected the elderly left behind. With the institution of the one-child policy in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/one-child-policy|title=one-child policy {{!}} Definition &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the average age in China has undergone an upward shift: 82% of migrant workers were between the ages of 15-44 in 2000.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Zhuo, Y., &amp; Liang, Z. (n.d.). Migration and Wellbeing of the Elderly in Rural China. In Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing (pp. 126-147). Edward Elgar Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has called into question the traditional custom of filial piety, and while retired urban workers are supported by government retirement programs, rural workers must rely on themselves and their families.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  It appears that the effects of migration on left behind elderly is ambiguous: while parents of migrant children are often better off financially and are happy with their economic situation, they also tend to report lower life satisfaction than do elderly without migrant children.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Like the children of migrant workers, parents are known to experience psychological issues such as depression and loneliness,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and those who take care of their grandchildren may feel burdened by this responsibility.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Reform ===
Over the past few decades since the [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]] in 1978, the state of [[China|the People’s Republic of China]] has taken steps toward reforming the hukou system by implementing a variety of reform policies. 1979-1991 can be identified as the first reform period.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Rong|last2=Cohen|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=January 2015|title=Reform and the Hukou System in China|url=file:///C:/Users/qilia/Desktop/GPP%20105%20Spring%202018/Wiki%20project_Migration%20in%20China/Reform%20and%20the%20hukou%20system%20in%20China.pdf|journal=Article History: Received|volume=|pages=327–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in October 1984, the state issued a document called “A Document on the Issue of Peasants Settling Down in Cities,” which required local governments to integrate rural migrants as part of their urban population and to enable rural migrants to register in their migrant cities.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In 1985, the state also implemented a policy called “Interim Provisions on the Management of Transient Population in Cities,” which allowed rural migrants to stay in their migrant cities even if they had neither changed their hukou status nor returned to their original rural residency.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In the same year, the state also published a document called “The Regulations on Resident Identity Card,” which enabled rural migrants to work in cities even if they did not carry an identity card of urban status.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, what followed these policies was not only a 30 million rural-to-urban migration, but also a phenomenon in which many false urban identity cards were sold to rural migrants for gaining urban benefits.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; It hence stimulated the state to implement another policy, “A Notice on Strictly Controlling Excessive Growth of ‘Urbanization,’” in 1989 for regulating rural-to-urban migration.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Under this policy, rural migrants were monitored again.

1992-2013 can be identified as the second hukou reform period.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Rong|last2=Cohen|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=January 2015|title=Reform and the Hukou System in China|url=file:///C:/Users/qilia/Desktop/GPP%20105%20Spring%202018/Wiki%20project_Migration%20in%20China/Reform%20and%20the%20hukou%20system%20in%20China.pdf|journal=Article History: Received|volume=|pages=327–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were various kinds of reform implemented by the state. Beginning in the late 1980s, one was to offer a “lan yin,” or “blue stamp,” hukou to those who possessed professional skills and/or ability to make some sort of investments (at least 100 million [[Renminbi|Renminbi yuan]]) in specific cities (usually the big cities such as [[Shanghai]]), allowing them to live in cities and enjoy urban welfare entitlements.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China Urbanizes: Consequences, Strategies, and Policies|last=Fan|first=C. Cindy|publisher=The World Bank|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Yusuf|editor-first=Shahid|location=Washington|pages=|chapter=Migration, Hukou and the City|editor-last2=Saich|editor-first2=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “blue stamp hukou” was then been conducted by many other big cities (including [[Nanjing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]]) in 1999.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; The second kind was not applied to big cities but to certain selected towns and small cities. In 1997, the state implemented a policy that granted urban hukou to the rural migrants who had a stable job in their newly resided towns and small cities.&lt;ref name=":73"/&gt; Meanwhile, according to two 1997 government documents, the “Pilot Scheme for Reform of the Hukou System in Small Towns” and “Instructions on Improving the Management of Rural Hukou System,” rural migrant workers could register as permanent residents with equal access to urban privileges in certain small towns.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; These policies were then made official in 2012 with the state document “Notice on Actively Yet Prudently Pushing Forward the Reform of Hukou System Management."&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Moreover, in 1999, the state also allowed more groups of people to gain urban hukou, including children whose parent(s) had urban hukou, and the elderly whose child(ren) had been granted urban hukou.&lt;ref name=":73"/&gt; The third kind was applied to the [[Special economic zones of China|special economic zones and districts]] that were established particularly for economic growth (such as Shenzhen). Specifically, in 1992, the state allowed all people living in the [[Special economic zones of China|special economic zones and districts]] to carry two hukous: Their original hukou and another hukou related to their job in the special zones and districts.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; This policy hence made it easier for rural migrants to gain access to different urban opportunities in the special zones and districts.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; However, in 2003, state published the “Administrative Permit Laws,” which sent rural migrants back to their original residency in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Under this policy, rural migrants’ life chances were once again determined by their hukou status.

The third reform period began in 2014, in which the state published and implemented the “National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014-2020)” in March to tackle various problems derived from China’s fast urbanization process.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xiu-Rui|last2=Hui|first2=Eddie Chi-Man|last3=Choguill|first3=Charles|last4=Jia|first4=Sheng-Hua|date=|title=The New Urbanization Policy in China: Which Way Forward|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S0197397515000351|journal=Habitat International|volume=|pages=279–284|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the plan aims to shorten the 17.3% gap between urban residents who live in cities but do not carry urban hukou and urban residents with urban hukou in 2012 by 2% by 2020.&lt;ref name=":83"/&gt; Meanwhile, the plan also intends to offer welfare entitlements to people who have rural hukou (from rural migrants to urban residents who carry rural hukou), including education, welfare housing, and health care to at least 90% (about 100 million) of migrants by 2020.&lt;ref name=":83"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":93"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/02/chinas-hukou-reforms-and-the-urbanization-challenge/|title=China’s Hukou Reforms and the Urbanization Challenge|last=Sheehan|first=Spencer|date=February 22, 2017|website=The Diplomat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Kam Wing|date=2014|title=Achieving Comprehensive Hukou Reform in China|url=|journal=Paulson Policy Memorandum|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, with this plan, the state has been putting effort into achieving their goals. For instance, the state has granted many left-behind children the right to attend urban schools so that they can reunite with their rural migrant parents; it has also offered many rural migrants job training.&lt;ref name=":64"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Rong|last2=Cohen|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=January 2015|title=Reform and the Hukou System in China|url=file:///C:/Users/qilia/Desktop/GPP%20105%20Spring%202018/Wiki%20project_Migration%20in%20China/Reform%20and%20the%20hukou%20system%20in%20China.pdf|journal=Article History: Received|volume=|pages=327–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in July of the same year, the government also published “Opinions on Further Promoting the Reform of the Hukou System" to abolish the hukou restrictions in towns and small cities, to gradually remove the restrictions middle-sized cities, to relax the restrictions in big cities---but to maintain the restrictions in the very large cities.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; As a result, according to an announcement of the Ministry of Public Security, by 2016, the state has already issued urban hukou to about 28.9 million rural migrants.&lt;ref name=":93"/&gt; Furthermore, in 2016, the local government of [[Beijing]] announced that they would abolish the official distinction between urban hukou and non-urban hukou within Beijing, meaning that all residents living in Beijing would be identified as Beijing residents regardless of their original hukou status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/china/2016/09/160920_ana_beijing_hukou_reform|title=观察：户籍改革里程碑 北京取消农业户口|last=白|first=墨|date=September 20, 2016|website=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having said that, in November 2017, the government of Beijing implemented a “clean-up” campaign that intended to send millions of rural migrants back to their original rural areas.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/beijings-heavy-handed-solution-to-urbanization/|title=Beijing’s Heavy-Handed Solution to Urbanization|last=Pabon|first=John|date=December 4, 2017|website=The Diplomat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this campaign was claimed by the local government as a way of getting rid of the unsafe structures in Beijing, where many rural migrants (at least 8.2 million in total) living in, some considered it as a way of “cleaning up,” as it happened shortly after the fire of an unsafe building in Beijing.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;

The state’s effort in improving the hukou system is not deniable; and it is also undeniable that those reforms alone cannot solve all problems arising from the hukou system. However, some questions are still worth mentioning; for instance, can the reforms mentioned above apply to the majority of rural-to-urban migrants? This question can be raised regarding the policies in all three reform periods mentioned above. Specifically, it seems obvious that many reform policies, especially those during the first and second periods, require rural migrants to possess some sorts of capital, either [[human capital]]s (such as professional skills and titles) or property capitals (such as the ability to become an urban homeowner) or both. Some scholars hence also call some reform policies as ways of "selling" hukou.&lt;ref name=":73"/&gt; Meanwhile, many migrants have claimed that their lack of [[social network]]s (part of what is called “[[Guanxi|guan xi]]”)—which in some sense is also accumulated with [[wealth]]—also has made it harder for them to find a stable job, let alone a lucrative job.&lt;ref name=":93"/&gt; Hence, if wealth is a precondition to change from rural hukou to urban hukou, many rural migrants indeed are unable to gain that access, as many are “unskilled” (because many's skills, such as farming, are not categorized as professional skills) and poor. However, in some large cities, even if a rural migrant does carry certain professional skills, it is not a guarantee that one will be granted with urban hukou. This situation is particularly revealed from many highly educated migrants. Despite of their education background, many would not be granted with urban hukou unless they become a homeowner.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suda|first=Kimoko|date=2016|title=A Room of One's Own: Highly Educated Migrants' Strategies for Creating a Home in Guangzhou|url=|journal=Population, Space and Place|volume=22|pages=146–157|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the high price of real estate in many large cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou), many are unable to do so even if some cities do offer housing [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to migrants.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt; Given their lack of urban hukou, many not only face the difficulty of purchasing an apartment—let alone purchasing a house—but also the disadvantage of being a renter. Because of the lack of rent control in many large cities, even if one rents a room—or rarely, an apartment—one can face the possibility of being asked to leave.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; Many those educated migrant youths hence are also called “yi zu,” or literally “a group of ants,” as many do not have their own room and have to live in a tiny room with many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finance.ifeng.com/money/special/yizufd/|title=蚁族：在现实中找出路|last=|first=|date=|website=凤凰财经|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It hence is worth asking the question whether or not the hukou system has been sufficiently improved to a more people-centered system. In fact, many large cities are still strict about granting rural migrants with urban hukou and about using the hukou system to determine whether or not one should be granted with welfare entitlements. Even if the “National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014-2020)” and the “Opinions on Further Promoting the Reform of the Hukou System” implemented in the third reform period intend to create a more people-centered system, they claim that larger cities should have different hukou registration systems from the smaller cities and towns; and that the hukou regulation will continue to be stricter in larger cities.&lt;ref name=":83"/&gt; However, the very large cities (such as Beijing) are usually the ones that attract rural migrants the most, given their extensive job opportunities. In this case, although the state has actively implemented many reform policies, the hukou rural/urban division still functions and represents a division system of life chances. Some scholars hence have argued that the hukou reforms indeed have not fundamentally changed the hukou system but have only decentralized the powers of hukou to local governments; and it still remains active and continues to contribute to China's rural and urban disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Kam Wing|last2=Buckingham|first2=Will|date=2008|title=Is China Abolishing the Hukou System?|url=|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, others have also argued that by concentrating on cities, the hukou reforms have failed to target the poorer regions, where social welfares such as education and medical care are often not offered to the residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/china-going-nowhere-hukou-reform/|title=China Going Nowhere on Hukou Reform|last=Li|first=Bingqin|date=|website=Asia Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, others seem excited, remarking that some cities have been offering a condition that encourages more migrant parents to bring their children along.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/how-hukou-reform-changing-makeup-chinese-factory-towns|title=How Hukou Reform is Changing the Makeup of Chinese Factory Towns|last=Fish|first=Eric|date=|website=Asia Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the majority of rural migrants thus are still largely overlooked due to their lack to urban hukou, which is often seen as starting point for gaining access to life well-beings.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration|last=Chan|first=Kam Wing|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Ness|editor-first=Immanuel|location=Hoboken|pages=|chapter=China: Internal Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hukou conversion today ===
The Floating Population Dynamic Monitoring Surveys, which have been conducted every year since 2010 by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, have reported that a significant number of migrant workers are in fact not interested in converting their hukou status.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Chuanbo|last2=Fan|first2=C. Cindy|date=October 2016|title=China's Hukou Puzzle: Why Don't Rural Migrants Want Urban Hukou?|url=|journal=China Review|volume=16|pages=9–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hukou policy reform has been gradual over the years, barriers to conversion have been lowered.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  However, many rural residents are hesitant to give up their agricultural hukou status.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  As rural hukou holders, they have property rights not afforded to their urban counterparts, which allow them to use land both for agricultural production and for personal use.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  And with the steady expansion of cities, property values of land near cities have significantly increased.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Owners of these tracts of land may elect to give up agriculture in favor of renting out their homes to migrant workers.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Furthermore, with the continued process of urbanization, land owners near cities can expect the central government to buy their land for a handsome sum sometime in the future.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  These benefits combined with the overall improvement in rural social welfare relative to that in cities have caused many rural residents to hesitate in converting their hukou status.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Household registration in Taiwan==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
When [[Taiwan]] was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] from 1895 to 1945, the Japanese government maintained the same system of household registration (koseki) as they did in other parts of the [[Empire of Japan]].  This system of household registration, with minor changes, has been continued.  Records concerning native Taiwanese are fairly complete{{when|date=March 2016}}.  Records of [[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s date back to the date they first applied for registration with the local household registration office, and are based on information provided by the applicant.

While all [[Nationality law of the Republic of China|Chinese nationals]] not in possession of travel documents issued by the [[People's Republic of China]] or [[British nationality law and Hong Kong|British]] passports (including [[overseas Chinese]] with no connection to Taiwan) can apply for a [[ROC passport|passport issued by the Republic of China (ROC)]],&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Rigger, "Nationalism versus Citizenship on Taiwan," in ''Changing Meanings of Citizenship in Modern China'', Merle Goldman, Elizabeth Jean Perry ed. (Harvard University Press, 2002), 360-61.&lt;/ref&gt; proper household registration in [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan or other islands administered by the ROC]] is required to obtain a [[National Identification Card (Republic of China)|ROC ID Card]], which is often used as proof of citizenship in things like national elections, and an ID number is needed to open bank accounts. Unlike in mainland China, residency can be easily changed with the local authorities and household registration does not serve as a tool to limit a resident's movements within Taiwan.

== Relation to citizenship ==
Because both [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China]] governments claim the territories under the other's control as part of their respective nation, therefore, legally, both treat the people on the other side's territory as their national. However, citizenship rights are only available to the people under their own control respectively - this is legally defined by law as holding household registration in [[Taiwan Area]] (in the [[Republic of China]]) / [[Mainland China|Mainland Area]] (in the [[People's Republic of China]]).

The [[Republic of China]] considers overseas ethnic Chinese as its nationals, and issues [[Republic of China passport]]s to them. However, this does not grant them the [[right of abode]] or any other citizen rights in [[Taiwan]]; they require the existence of household registration in Taiwan. Those [[national without household registration|without household registration]] are subject to immigration control in Taiwan, but after they settle in Taiwan they can establish a household registration there to become a full citizen.

When a person with a household registration in mainland China is settling in the [[Hong Kong SAR]] or the [[Macau SAR]] by means of a one-way permit, they must relinquish their household registration, therefore losing citizen rights in mainland China. However, they can settle in the SAR for seven years to be eligible for permanent resident status (which is associated with citizen rights) in the SAR. Therefore, in the period before they get permanent resident status, though still a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese citizen]], they can't exercise citizen rights anywhere (like voting in elections, getting a passport) and are considered [[second-class citizen]]s.

==Special administrative regions==
Hukou is not employed in the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], though identification cards are mandatory for residents there.&lt;ref&gt;"China Law Deskbook: A Legal Guide for Foreign-invested Enterprises, Volume 1", by James M. Zimmerman, p. 406, publisher = American Bar Association, year = 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, both SARs grant [[right of abode]] to certain persons who are allowed to reside permanently in the regions.

'''Joseph Cassani''' (also spelt Casani, 26 November 1673 – 1750) was a Spanish Catholic historian.

Cassani was born in [[Madrid]] in 1673, entered the Society of Jesus on 16 November 1686, was still in active service of priestly functions in 1745, and died in 1750. He was one of the founders of the ''Academia de la Lengua española'' (Academy of the Spanish Language) at Madrid, and published a ''Diccionario de la Lengua Catellana'' (Catalan dictionary) there in 1726-1730, in six volumes. He was a very prolific writer. Among his works may be noted ''Admirable vida, singulares virtudes etc. del extçtico Varon P. Dionisio Rickel'' (Madrid, 1738), and ''Varones ilustres de la Compañia de Jesus Escual militar de fortificacion Tratado de la naturaleza y orígen de los cometas'' (Madrid, 1737).

He was a member of the Academia from 6 July 1713. Although he never visited America, he appealed particularly to Americans through his ''Historia de la Provincia de la Compañia de Jesus del Nueva Reyno de Granada en la América'' (Madrid, 1741), the only regular chronicle of the [[Jesuit]] Order in Colombia thus far extant. (Note: Fr. Cassani wrote the "Historia" in Venezuela.) The fact that Cassani was never in the [[New World]] detracts somewhat from the usefulness of this otherwise valuable history, as far as ethnologic and ethnographic data are concerned; but it does include data on the missions in the upper [[Orinoco]] basin. The work is exceedingly rare.

It also cites eight references which support these statements. --&gt;

Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the "[[Universal Genius]]" or "Renaissance Man", an individual of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination",&lt;ref name=HG&gt;{{cite book |first=Helen |last=Gardner |title=Art through the Ages |year=1970 |pages=450–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.&lt;ref name="genius"&gt;See the quotations from the following authors, in section "Fame and reputation": Vasari, Boltraffio, Castiglione, "Anonimo" Gaddiano, Berensen, Taine, Fuseli, Rio, Bortolon.&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote".&lt;ref name=HG /&gt; Marco Rosci notes that, while there is much speculation regarding his life and personality, his view of the world was logical rather than mysterious, although the empirical methods he employed were unorthodox for his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marco |last=Rosci |title=Leonardo |year=1977 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo was born out of wedlock to notary Piero da Vinci and a peasant woman named Caterina in [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]] in the region of [[Florence]], and he was educated in the studio of Florentine painter [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of [[Ludovico il Moro]] in Milan. He later worked in Rome, [[Bologna]], and [[Venice]], and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by [[Francis I of France]].

Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter. The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is the most famous of his works and the most parodied portrait,&lt;ref&gt;John Lichfield, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-moving-of-the-mona-lisa-530771.html "The Moving of the Mona Lisa"], ''The Independent'', 2 April 2005 (accessed 2012-03-09)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' is the most reproduced religious painting of all time.&lt;ref name=HG /&gt; His drawing of the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' is also regarded as a cultural icon,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvian Man is referred to as "iconic" at the following websites and many others:[http://www.italian-renaissance-art.com/Vitruvian-Man.html Vitruvian Man], [http://artpassions.com/art/1109-Fine-Art-Classics/0000067329-Leonardo-Da-Vinci-Vitruvian-Man.html Fine Art Classics], [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=403230&amp;sectioncode=26 Key Images in the History of Science]; [http://www.ingenious.org.uk/read/identity/bodyimage/Curiosityanddifference/ Curiosity and difference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130113435/http://ingenious.org.uk/read/identity/bodyimage/Curiosityanddifference/ |date=30 January 2009 }}; [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/aug/30/art1 "The Guardian: The Real da Vinci Code"]&lt;/ref&gt; being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts.

This number is made up principally of paintings on panel but includes a mural, a large drawing on paper, and two works which are in the early stages of preparation. There are a number of other works that have also been variously attributed to him.}} Nevertheless, these few works compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary [[Michelangelo]], together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting.

Leonardo is revered for [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci|his technological ingenuity]]. He conceptualised flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine,&lt;ref name="AddingMachine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://192.220.96.166/leonardo/leonardo.html |title=Roberto Guatelli's Controversial Replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Adding Machine |last=Kaplan |first=Erez |year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140741/http://192.220.96.166/leonardo/leonardo.html |archivedate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the double hull.  Relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. A number of his most practical inventions are displayed as working models at the Museum of Vinci. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo was born on 15 April 1452 (Old Style) "at the third hour of the night"{{efn|His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', and Reynal &amp; Co., ''Leonardo da Vinci'' (William Morrow and Company, 1956): "A grandson of mine was born April 15, Saturday, three hours into the night". The date was recorded in the Julian calendar; as it was Florentine time and sunset was 6:40&amp;nbsp;pm, three hours after sunset would be sometime around 9:40&amp;nbsp;pm which was still 14 April by modern reckoning. The conversion to the New Style calendar adds nine days; hence Leonardo was born 23 April according to the modern calendar.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;}} in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] hill town of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the lower valley of the [[Arno]] river in the territory of the [[Medici]]-ruled [[Republic of Florence]].&lt;ref name= SerA&gt;His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; He was the out-of-wedlock son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine [[Civil law notary|legal notary]], and Caterina, a peasant.&lt;ref name=AV&gt;{{cite book |first=Alessandro |last=Vezzosi |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man |series='[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiesa83&gt;{{cite book |first=Angela Ottino |last=della Chiesa |title=The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci |year=1967 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It has been suggested that Caterina may have been a slave from the Middle East "or at least, from the Mediterranean". According to [[Alessandro Vezzosi]], head of the Leonardo Museum in Vinci, there is evidence that Piero owned a Middle Eastern slave called Caterina. That Leonardo had Middle Eastern blood is claimed to be supported by the reconstruction of a fingerprint as reported by {{cite news |first=Marta |last=Falconi |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120100961.html |title=Experts Reconstruct Leonardo Fingerprint |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=6 May 2013 |edition=News |origyear=1 December 2006}} The evidence, as stated in the article, is that 60% of people of Middle Eastern origin share the pattern of whirls found on the reconstructed fingerprint. The article also states that the claim is refuted by Simon Cole, associate professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine: "You can't predict one person's race from these kinds of incidences, especially if looking at only one finger."

Little is known about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first five years in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Anchiano]] in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Liana |last=Bortolon |title=The Life and Times of Leonardo |publisher=Paul Hamlyn |location=London |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Margherita/6000000022836749865 ''Margherita (da Vinci)'' in: geni.com] [retrieved 15 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Lucrezia-Cortigiani/6000000011018546847 ''Lucrezia Cortigiani'' in: geni.com] [retrieved 15 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magnano"&gt;Magnano, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, Leonardo had twelve half-siblings, who were much younger than he was (the last was born when Leonardo was forty years old) and with whom he had very few contacts, but they caused him difficulty after his father's death in the dispute over the inheritance.&lt;ref name="Magnano"/&gt;

Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, [[geometry]] and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as an omen, was when a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Leonardo's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brigstoke |first=Hugh |title=The Oxford Companion the Western Art |location=Oxford |year=2001}}{{page?|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasari]], the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a [[Medusa (Leonardo da Vinci painting)|painting of a monster]] spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the [[Duke of Milan]]. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vasari |first=Giorgio |title=Lives of the Artists |year=1568 |publisher=Penguin Classics |pages=258–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verrocchio's workshop, 1466–1476 ===

In 1466, at the age of 14, Leonardo was apprenticed to the artist Andrea di Cione, known as [[Andrea del Verrocchio|Verrocchio]], whose ''bottega'' (workshop) was "one of the finest in Florence".&lt;ref name="Rosci"&gt;Rosci, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He apprenticed as a ''garzone'' (studio boy) to Andrea del Verrocchio, the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his day (and would do so for 7 years).&lt;ref name="refseek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refseek.com/data/cache/en/1/Leonardo_da_Vinci.html|title=Leonardo da Vinci – Encarta (cached)|website=refseek.com|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous painters apprenticed or associated with the workshop include [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Lorenzo di Credi]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; Leonardo would have been exposed to both theoretical training and a vast range of technical skills,&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics and carpentry as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting and modelling.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Martindale |year=1972 |title=The Rise of the Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The "diverse arts" and technical skills of Medieval and Renaissance workshops are described in detail in the 12th-century text ''On Divers Arts'' by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] and in the early 15th-century text ''Il Libro Dell'arte O Trattato Della Pittui '' by [[Cennino Cennini]].}}

Much of the painted production of Verrocchio's workshop was done by his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the [[tempera]], using the new technique of [[oil painting|oil paint]], including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of ''[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]'' in the [[Bargello]] and the [[Archangel Raphael]] in ''[[Tobias and the Angel (Verrocchio)|Tobias and the Angel]]''.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;

By 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], the guild of artists and doctors of medicine,{{efn|That Leonardo joined the guild before this time is deduced from the record of payment made to the Compagnia di San Luca in the company's register, Libro Rosso A, 1472–1520, Accademia di Belle Arti.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;}} but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the [[Arno]] valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.{{efn|This work is now in the collection of the [[Uffizi]], Drawing No. 8P.}}&lt;ref name= DA /&gt;

One writer, called the [[Anonimo Gaddiano]], claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the [[Medici family|Medici]] had established.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt; In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto.&lt;ref name=Wasser1&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Wasserman |title=Leonardo da Vinci |year=1975 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.

In 1482, Leonardo, who according to Vasari was a talented musician,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Emanuel Winternitz|Winternitz]] |first=Emanuel |title=Leonardo Da Vinci As a Musician |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a silver [[lyre]] in the shape of a horse's head. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rossi |first=Paolo |title=The Birth of Modern Science |year=2001 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse things that he could achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo's Letter to Ludovico Sforza|website= | publisher =Leonardo-History|date= |url=http://www.leonardo-history.com/life.htm?Section=S5|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' for the monastery of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]].&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Kemp |title=Leonardo |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1538)|Hungary]] on behalf of Ludovico to meet [[Matthias Corvinus]], and was commissioned by him to paint a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Franz-Joachim Verspohl|de}}, ''Michelangelo Buonarroti und Leonardo Da Vinci: Republikanischer Alltag und Künstlerkonkurrenz in Florenz zwischen 1501 und 1505'' (Wallstein Verlag, 2007), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents.

Leonardo was employed on many different projects for Ludovico, including the preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions, designs for a dome for [[Milan Cathedral]] and a model for a huge [[equestrian statue|equestrian monument]] to [[Francesco Sforza]], Ludovico's predecessor. Seventy tons of [[bronze]] were set aside for casting it. The monument remained unfinished for several years, which was not unusual for Leonardo. In 1492, the clay model of the horse was completed. It surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's ''[[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata|Gattamelata]]'' in Padua and Verrocchio's ''[[Bartolomeo Colleoni]]'' in Venice, and became known as the "''[[Leonardo's horse|Gran Cavallo]]''".&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;{{efn|Verrocchio's statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni was not cast until 1488, after his death, and after Leonardo had already begun work on the statue for Ludovico.}} Leonardo began making detailed plans for its casting;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; however, Michelangelo insulted Leonardo by implying that he was unable to cast it.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; In November 1494, Ludovico gave the bronze to be used for cannon to defend the city from invasion by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]].&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

At the start of the [[Second Italian War]] in 1499, the invading French troops used the life-size clay model for the ''Gran Cavallo'' for target practice. With Ludovico Sforza overthrown, Leonardo, with his assistant Salai and friend, the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]], fled Milan for [[Venice]],&lt;ref name=Chiesa85&gt;della Chiesa, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; where he was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of [[Santissima Annunziata, Florence|Santissima Annunziata]] and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'', a work that won such admiration that "men and women, young and old" flocked to see it "as if they were attending a great festival".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 2005, the studio was rediscovered during the restoration of part of a building occupied for 100 years by the Department of Military Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Owen |title=Found: the studio where Leonardo met Mona Lisa |publisher=The Times |date=12 January 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article411195.ece |accessdate=5 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Cesena]] in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of [[Cesare Borgia]], the son of [[Pope Alexander VI]], acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron.&lt;ref name=Chiesa85 /&gt; Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of [[Imola]] in order to win his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief [[military engineer]] and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of [[Chiana Valley]], Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.

Leonardo returned to Florence, where he rejoined the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Italy|Guild of Saint Luke]] on 18 October 1503. He spent two years designing and painting a mural of ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' for the Signoria,&lt;ref name=Chiesa85 /&gt; with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|The Battle of Cascina]]''.{{efn|Both works are lost.

In 1506, Leonardo returned to Milan.

Leonardo did not stay in Milan for long because his father had died in 1504, and in 1507 he was back in Florence trying to sort out problems with his brothers over his father's estate. By 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.&lt;ref name=Chiesa86&gt;della Chiesa, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old age and death, 1513–1519 ===
From September 1513 to 1516, under [[Pope Leo X]], Leonardo spent much of his time living in the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere]] in the Vatican in Rome, where [[Raphael]] and Michelangelo were both active at the time.&lt;ref name=Chiesa86 /&gt; In October 1515, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] recaptured Milan.&lt;ref name=Wasser1 /&gt; On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Goyau, ''François I'', Transcribed by Gerald Rossi.

[[File:Clos luce 04 straight.JPG|thumb|[[Clos Lucé]] in France, where Leonardo died in 1519|alt=Photo of a large medieval house, built of brick with many windows and gables and a circular tower with a conical roof]]

Leonardo died at [[Clos Lucé]], on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67. The cause is generally stated to be recurrent stroke; this diagnosis is consistent with accounts of the state of Leonardo's alleged remains as described in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurology.org/content/88/14/1381.full Charlier P, Deo S.

Some 20 years after Leonardo's death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor [[Benvenuto Cellini]] as saying: "There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario |last=Lucertini |first2=Ana Millan |last2=Gasca |first3=Fernando |last3=Nicolo |title=Technological Concepts and Mathematical Models in the Evolution of Modern Engineering Systems |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YISIUycS4HgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=leonardo+cellini+francois+philosopher |accessdate=3 October 2007 |isbn=978-3764369408 |year=2004 |publisher=Birkhäuser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of remains===
Leonardo's remains were originally interred in the chapel of Saint-Florentin at the Chateau d'Amboise in the Loire Valley. However, following the chapel's destruction in 1802, the whereabouts of Leonardo's remains became subject to dispute. While excavating the site in 1863, the poet [[Arsène Houssaye]] found a partially-complete skeleton and stone fragments bearing the inscription 'EO [...] DUS VINC'. The unusually large skull led Houssaye to conclude he had located the remains of Leonardo, which were re-interred in their present location of the chapel of Saint-Hubert, also at the Chateau d'Amboise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r9RvPdrIqZoC&amp;pg=PT765&amp;lpg= |title= Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind| last= Nicholl| first= Charles | publisher= Penguin| year= 2005| isbn= 978-0140296815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting doubts about the attribution, a plaque above the tomb states that the remains are only "presumed" to be those of Leonardo.

== Relationships and influences ==
=== Florence: Leonardo's artistic and social background ===
[[File:Gylleneportarna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Lorenzo Ghiberti's]] ''Gates of Paradise'' (1425{{ndash}}1452) were a source of communal pride. Many artists assisted in their creation.]]

Florence at the time of Leonardo's youth was the centre of Christian [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] thought and culture.&lt;ref name="Rosci" /&gt; Leonardo commenced his apprenticeship with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor [[Donatello]], died. The painter [[Uccello]], whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. The painters [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Filippo Lippi]], sculptor [[Luca della Robbia]], and architect and writer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were in their sixties. The successful artists of the next generation were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]], and the portrait sculptor [[Mino da Fiesole]]. The latter's lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederich |last=Hartt |title=A History of Italian Renaissance Art |year=1970 |pages=127–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosci1&gt;Rosci, ''Leonardo'', chapter 1, ''the historical setting'', pp. 9–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruck /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Leonardo's youth was spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, [[Masaccio]], whose figurative [[fresco]]es were imbued with realism and emotion; and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], whose ''[[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Gates of Paradise]]'', gleaming with [[gold leaf]], displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''On Perspective for Painting (De Prospectiva Pingendi)''&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti's]] treatise ''[[De Pictura]]''&lt;ref&gt;Leon Battista Alberti, ''De Pictura'', 1435. [http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/ ''On Painting'', in English], [http://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/a/alberti/de_pictura/html/depictur.htm ''De Pictura'', in Latin]&lt;/ref&gt; were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruck /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Massaccio's "[[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]" depicting the naked and distraught [[Adam and Eve]] created a powerfully expressive image of the human form, cast into three dimensions by the use of [[chiaroscuro|light and shade]], which was to be developed in the works of Leonardo in a way that was to be influential in the course of painting. The humanist influence of Donatello's "David" can be seen in Leonardo's late paintings, particularly ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]''.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosci1 /&gt;

[[File:Andrea del Verrocchio - Mary with the Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Small devotional picture by [[Verrocchio]], {{circa|1470}}]]

A prevalent tradition in Florence was the small altarpiece of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]]. Many of these were created in [[tempera]] or glazed [[terracotta]] by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific [[Luca della Robbia|della Robbia]] family.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt; Leonardo's early Madonnas such as ''[[Madonna of the Carnation|The Madonna with a carnation]]'' and the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, particularly in the case of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]''.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Leonardo was a contemporary of [[Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Perugino]], who were all slightly older than he was.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the [[Academy#Modern use of the term academy|Academy]] of the [[Medici]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;

[[File:Hugo van der Goes 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Portinari Altarpiece'', by [[Hugo van der Goes]] for a Florentine family]]

These three were among those commissioned to paint the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]], the work commencing with Perugino's employment in 1479. Leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission. His first significant commission, The ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the Monks of Scopeto, was never completed.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

In 1476, during the time of Leonardo's association with Verrocchio's workshop, the [[Portinari Altarpiece]] by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence, bringing from Northern Europe [[Early Netherlandish painting|new painterly techniques]] that were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; In 1479, the Sicilian painter [[Antonello da Messina]], who worked exclusively in oils, travelled north on his way to [[Venice]], where the leading painter [[Giovanni Bellini]] adopted the technique of oil painting, quickly making it the preferred method in Venice. Leonardo was also later to visit Venice.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Like the two contemporary architects [[Bramante]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder]], Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, pp. 391–92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghirlandaio a-pucci-lorenzo-de-medici-f-sassetti 1.jpg|thumb|Lorenzo de' Medici between Antonio Pucci and Francesco Sassetti, with Giulio de' Medici, fresco by [[Ghirlandaio]]]]

Leonardo's political contemporaries were [[Lorenzo Medici]] (il Magnifico), who was three years older, and his younger brother Giuliano, who was slain in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] in 1478. Leonardo was sent as an ambassador by the Medici court to [[Ludovico il Moro]], who ruled [[Milan]] between 1479 and 1499.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;

With Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom [[Marsiglio Ficino]], proponent of [[Neo Platonism]]; [[Cristoforo Landino]], writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and [[John Argyropoulos]], teacher of Greek and translator of [[Aristotle]] were the foremost. Also associated with the Academy of the Medici was Leonardo's contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher [[Pico della Mirandola]].&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hugh Ross |last=Williamson |title=Lorenzo the Magnificent |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo later wrote in the margin of a journal, "The Medici made me and the Medici destroyed me." While it was through the action of Lorenzo that Leonardo received his employment at the court of Milan, it is not known exactly what Leonardo meant by this cryptic comment.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Although usually named together as the three giants of the [[High Renaissance]], Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael were not of the same generation. Leonardo was twenty-three when Michelangelo was born and thirty-one when Raphael was born.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; Raphael lived until the age of only 37 and died in 1520, the year after Leonardo died, but Michelangelo went on creating for another 45 years.&lt;ref name=Bruck&gt;{{cite book |first=Gene A. |last=Brucker |title=Renaissance Florence |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach&gt;{{cite book |first=Ilan |last=Rachum |title=The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Isabella d'Este.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Study for a portrait of [[Isabella d'Este]] (1500) [[Louvre]]]]

Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "outstanding physical beauty", "infinite grace", "great strength and generosity", "regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind", as described by Vasari,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his respect for life, evidenced by his vegetarianism and his habit, according to Vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Müntz |first=Eugène |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125000944930#page/n47/mode/2up/ |year=1898 |title=Leonardo da Vinci.

Leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance. They included the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Leonardo_Master_Draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp |title=Leonardo, Left-Handed Draftsman and writer |accessdate=18 October 2009 |last=Bambach |first=Carmen |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110221047/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/leonardo_master_draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he collaborated on the book ''[[De divina proportione]]'' in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with [[Cecilia Gallerani]] and the two Este sisters, [[Beatrice d'Este|Beatrice]] and Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright Ady, Julia.

Dent, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; While on a journey that took him through [[Mantua]], he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Eine Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da Vinci'', (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salai and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with [[sodomy]] in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.&lt;ref name=Isaacson/&gt; Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in ''John the Baptist'' and ''Bacchus'' and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships'' epigraph, p. 148 &amp; N120 p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The info contained here is beyond dispute.

=== Assistants and pupils ===
Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed ''[[Salaì|Salai]]'' or ''Il Salaino'' ("The Little Unclean One" i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him "a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton", after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo, Codex C. 15v, Institut of France. Trans. Richter&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Salai executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Salai, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo "taught him a great deal about painting",&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 265"&lt;/ref&gt; his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as [[Marco d'Oggiono]] and [[Boltraffio]]. In 1515, he painted a nude version of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', known as ''[[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno#Life|Monna Vanna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Tom |title=Mona Lisa Goes Topless |website= |publisher=Paintingsdirect.com |date= |url=http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html |accessdate=27 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403073656/http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html |archivedate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salai owned the ''Mona Lisa'' at the time of his death in 1524, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite web |last=Rossiter |first=Nick |title=Could this be the secret of her smile? |website=Daily Telegraph |date=4 July 2003 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/04/07/banr.xml |accessdate=3 October 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1506, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count [[Francesco Melzi]], the son of a [[Lombardy|Lombard]] aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. He travelled to France with Leonardo and remained with him until Leonardo's death.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Melzi inherited the artistic and scientific works, manuscripts, and collections of Leonardo and administered the estate.

{{See also|List of works by Leonardo da Vinci}}

Despite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a "Divine" painter.&lt;ref&gt;His fame is discussed by Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in [[physiognomy]] and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the ''Mona Lisa'', the ''Last Supper'', and the ''Virgin of the Rocks''.&lt;ref&gt;These qualities of Leonardo's works are discussed by Frederick Hartt in ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', pp. 387–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early works ===
[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475{{ndash}}1480), [[Uffizi]], is thought to be Leonardo's earliest complete work]]
Leonardo first gained notoriety for his work on the ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Baptism of Christ]]'', painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are [[Annunciation]]s. One is small, {{nowrap|{{convert|59|cm}}}} long and {{nowrap|{{convert|14|cm}}}} high. It is a "predella" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by [[Lorenzo di Credi]] from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, {{nowrap|{{convert|217|cm}}}} long.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, pp. 88, 90&lt;/ref&gt; In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by [[Fra Angelico]] of the same subject, of the [[Virgin Mary]] sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to [[Ghirlandaio]], the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.&lt;ref name=Berti&gt;{{cite book |first=Luciano |last=Berti |title=The Uffizi |year=1971 |pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the smaller painting, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt; This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the [[Mother of God]], not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.{{efn|Michael Baxandall lists 5 "laudable conditions" or reactions of Mary to the presence and announcement of the angel. These are: Disquiet, Reflection, Inquiry, Submission and Merit. In this painting Mary's attitude does not comply with any of the accepted traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael|last=Baxandall|title=Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy|year=1974|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paintings of the 1480s ===
In the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.

[[File:Leonardo, san girolamo.jpg|thumb|Unfinished painting of ''[[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness (Leonardo)|Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'' ({{c|1480}}), [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]]]
One of these paintings was ''[[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness (Leonardo)|Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'', which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: "I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die."&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual.{{efn|The painting, which in the 18th century belonged to [[Angelica Kauffman]], was later cut up. The two main sections were found in a junk shop and cobbler's shop and were reunited.&lt;ref name=Wasser2 /&gt; It is probable that outer parts of the composition are missing.}} [[St Jerome|Jerome]], as a [[penitent]], occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies.&lt;ref name=Wasser2&gt;Wasserman, pp. 104–06&lt;/ref&gt; Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.

The daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about {{nowrap|250 x 250 centimetres.}} Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined [[classical architecture]] that forms part of the background. In 1482 Leonardo went to Milan at the behest of [[Lorenzo Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in order to win favour with [[Ludovico il Moro]], and the painting was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berti /&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Leonardo da Vinci Virgin of the Rocks (National Gallery London).jpg|thumb|''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', [[National Gallery]], London, demonstrates Leonardo's interest in nature]]--&gt;
The third important work of this period is the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis|de Predis brothers]], was to fill a large complex [[altarpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant [[John the Baptist]], in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Mysterious Virgin | website = | publisher =[[National Gallery, London]] | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/features/potm/2006/may/feature1.htm | accessdate =27 September 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071015062743/http://nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/features/potm/2006/may/feature1.htm | archivedate =15 October 2007 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the painting is quite large, about {{nowrap|200×120 centimetres}}, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.&lt;ref name=DA&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Arasse |title=Leonardo da Vinci |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa85" /&gt;

=== Paintings of the 1490s ===
[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' (1498), [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie]], Milan, Italy]]

Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'', commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the [[Last Supper|last meal]] shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me", and the consternation that this statement caused.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

The novelist [[Matteo Bandello]] observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; This was beyond the comprehension of the [[prior]] of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

When finished, the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as "completely ruined".&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly [[gesso]], resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in every medium from carpets to cameos.

=== Paintings of the 16th century ===
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or ''La Gioconda'' (1503{{ndash}}05/07), [[Louvre]], Paris, France]]

Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or "la Gioconda", the laughing one. In the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called "[[sfumato]]", or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that "the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Whether or not Vasari had seen the Mona Lisa is the subject of debate. The opinion that he had ''not'' seen the painting is based mainly on the fact that he describes the Mona Lisa as having eyebrows. Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'' discusses the possibility that Leonardo may have painted the figure with eyebrows that were subsequently removed. (They were not fashionable in the mid-16th century.)&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; Pascal Cotte said in 2007 that, according to his analysis of high-resolution scans, the Mona Lisa had eyebrows and eyelashes that have been subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=BBC News |title= The Mona Lisa had brows and lashes | date = 22 October 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7056041.stm | accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing [[oil paint|oils]] laid on much like [[tempera]], and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.{{efn|Jack Wasserman writes of "the inimitable treatment of the surfaces" of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;}} Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even "the most confident master{{nbsp}}... despair and lose heart."&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting ''[[Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'', the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as "breathtakingly beautiful"&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and [[Andrea del Sarto]],&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and through them [[Pontormo]] and [[Correggio]]. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].

=== Murals ===
Leonardo's ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiara]]'' was a fresco commissioned in 1505 for the [[Salone dei Cinquecento]] (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence. Its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', was assigned the opposite wall. All that remains of Leonardo's work is a copy by [[Rubens]], but [[Maurizio Seracini]] is convinced it can still be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the Salone dei Cinquecento, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/science/06tier.html |title=A High-Tech Hunt for Lost Art |date=6 October 2009 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=19 March 2016|last1=Tierney |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seracini|first1=Maurizio|title=The Secret Lives of Paintings|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/maurizio_seracini_the_secret_lives_of_paintings?language=en#t-48953|format=lecture|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sforza Castle in Milan, there is a room decorated with the fresco technique by Leonardo and his assistants: Sala delle Asse (in English 'room of the wooden boards'). The room was decorated with a [[trompe-l'œil]] depicting trees, with an intricate labyrinth of leaves and knots on the ceiling. The red fruits of mulberry ("moroni" in local dialect) were an allusion to the name of "Ludovico il Moro", duke of Milan at that time. The first document about the room and Leonardo's work dates back to 1498: on 21 April, the secretary confirms to the duke that "magistro Leonardo" will complete the decoration by September.

Two restorations were accomplished, in 1902 and 1956. Another restoration is currently under way,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saladelleassecastello.it/|title=Sala delle Asse – Castello Sforzesco|website=Sala delle Asse.

Leonardo was not a prolific painter, but he was a most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as ''The Adoration of the Magi'', ''The Virgin of the Rocks'' and ''The Last Supper''.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt;
His earliest dated drawing is a ''Landscape of the Arno Valley'', 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Popham&gt;{{cite book |first=A.E. |last=Popham |title=The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his famous drawings are the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', a study of the proportions of the human body; the ''Head of an Angel'', for ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' in the Louvre; a botanical study of ''Star of Bethlehem''; and a large drawing (160×100&amp;nbsp;cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' in the National Gallery, London.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; This drawing employs the subtle ''[[sfumato]]'' technique of shading, in the manner of the ''Mona Lisa''. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as "caricatures" because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that if Leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salai, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called "Grecian profile".{{efn|The "Grecian profile" has a continuous straight line from forehead to nose-tip, the bridge of the nose being exceptionally high. It is a feature of many [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Classical Greek]] statues.}} These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; Salai is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of [[Bernardo Baroncelli]], hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; With dispassionate integrity Leonardo has registered in neat [[mirror writing]] the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' ({{circa|1485}}) [[Accademia, Venice]]]]

[[Renaissance humanism]] recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and [[natural philosophy]] (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

Most of Leonardo's writings are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy is often suggested as the reason for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.{{efn|Left-handed writers using a split nib or quill pen experience difficulty pushing the pen from left to right across the page.}}

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Studies of the foetus in the womb.jpg|thumb|left|A page showing Leonardo's study of a foetus in the womb ({{circa|1510}}) Royal Library, [[Windsor Castle]]]]

Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

These notebooks&amp;nbsp;– originally loose papers of different types and sizes, distributed by friends after his death&amp;nbsp;– have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at [[Windsor Castle]], [[the Louvre]], the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan, which holds the twelve-volume ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', and [[British Library]] in London, which has put a selection from the ''[[Codex Arundel]]'' (BL Arundel MS 263) online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Sketches by Leonardo | website =Turning the Pages | publisher =[[British Library]] | url =http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html | accessdate =27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Codex Leicester (Leonardo da Vinci)|Codex Leicester]]'' is the only major scientific work of Leonardo in private hands; it is owned by [[Bill Gates]] and is displayed once a year in different cities around the world.

Leonardo's notes appear to have been intended for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor Castle, Royal Library, sheets RL 19073v–74v and RL 19102, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This method of organisation minimises of loss of data in the case of pages being mixed up or destroyed.}} Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

=== Scientific studies ===
[[File:De divina proportione - Vigintisex Basium Planum Vacuum.jpg|thumb|[[Rhombicuboctahedron]] as published in [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli's]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[De divina proportione]]'']]

Leonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in [[Latin language|Latin]] and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. In the 1490s he studied mathematics under [[Luca Pacioli]] and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book ''[[De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

The content of his journals suggest that he was planning a series of treatises to be published on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on [[anatomy]] was said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis 'D' Aragon's secretary in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Malley |last2=Saunders |title=Leonardo on the Human Body |year=1982 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by his pupil Francesco Melzi and eventually published as ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Treatise on Painting by Leonardo da Vinci]]'' in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724,&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter [[Nicolas Poussin]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|336408}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into 62 editions in fifty years, caused Leonardo to be seen as "the precursor of French academic thought on art".&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

While Leonardo's experimentation followed clear scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance Man, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof (2007).

=== Anatomy and physiology ===
[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|Anatomical study of the arm ({{c|1510}})]]

Leonardo started his study in the [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] under the apprenticeship of [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject.&lt;ref name="The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davinci |first1=Leonardo |date=2011 |title=The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1105310164 |page=736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGmAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=736#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist, he quickly became master of ''topographic anatomy'', drawing many studies of [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s and other visible anatomical features.

As a successful artist, Leonardo was given permission to [[Dissection|dissect]] human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]]. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy.&lt;ref name=Sooke /&gt; These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing.&lt;ref name=KDK /&gt; The project was left incomplete at the time of Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's ''Treatise on painting'', published in France in 1632.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref name=KDK&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keele Kenneth D | year = 1964 | title = Leonardo da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1033412/pdf/medhist00157-0072.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Med Hist| volume =  8| issue = 4| pages =  360–70| pmc=1033412 | pmid=14230140 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]], who made a number of drawings from them.&lt;ref name=KDK /&gt;

[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci's Brain Physiology.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo's physiological sketch of the human brain and skull ({{c|1510}})]]
Leonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the [[human skeleton]] and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of [[biomechanics]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Stephen F. |authorlink=Stephen F. Mason |title=A History of the Sciences |publisher=Collier Books |year=1962 |location=New York |page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew the heart and [[Circulatory system|vascular system]], the [[sex organs]] and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a [[fetus]] ''in utero''.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.&lt;ref name=Sooke&gt;[[Alastair Sooke]], ''Daily Telegraph'', 28 July 2013, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/leonardo-da-vinci/10202124/Leonardo-da-Vinci-Anatomy-of-an-artist.html "Leonardo da Vinci: Anatomy of an artist"], accessed 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number of studies of horses.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt;

Leonardo's dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of [[humorism|bodily humours]], but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or [[Ventricular system|ventricles]]. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define [[atherosclerosis]] and liver [[cirrhosis]]. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass [[aorta]] to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in ''De humani corporis fabrica'' in 1543.&lt;ref name="Jones2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Roger |title=Leonardo da Vinci: anatomist |journal=British Journal of General Practice |volume=62 |issue=599 |year=2012 |page=319 |issn=0960-1643 |doi=10.3399/bjgp12X649241|pmid=22687222 |pmc=3361109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering and inventions ===
[[File:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|A design for a flying machine ({{c|1488}}), Institut de France, Paris]]

During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In a letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]], he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] also worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masters |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Masters |title=Machiavelli, Leonardo and the Science of Power |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masters |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Masters |title=Fortune is a River: Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolò Machiavelli's Magnificent Dream to Change the Course of Florentine History |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include [[Viola organista|musical instruments]], a [[Leonardo's robot|mechanical knight]], hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a [[steam cannon]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

In 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span {{convert|720|ft|m|adj=on}} bridge as part of a civil engineering project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Constantinople]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosporus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebjørn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/ |title=The Leonardo Bridge Project |publisher=Vebjorn-sand.com |date= |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104061901/http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/ |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Daniel S. |title=Dream of the Master |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine |date=4 October 1999 |url=http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html |accessdate=27 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912033510/http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html |archivedate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of [[History of aviation|flight]] for much of his life, producing many studies, including ''[[Codex on the Flight of Birds]]'' ({{circa|1505}}), as well as plans for several flying machines such as a flapping [[ornithopter]] and a machine with a helical [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]].&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; The British television station [[Channel Four]] commissioned a 2003 documentary, ''Leonardo's Dream Machines'', in which various designs by Leonardo, such as a [[Parachute#Early Renaissance|parachute]] and a giant crossbow, were interpreted, constructed and tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365434/|title=Leonardo's Dream Machines (TV Movie 2003)|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/leonardo/parachute.html British Library online gallery] (retrieved 10 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when practically tested.

Leonardo's fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]], in the enlarged edition of ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', 1568,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his chapter on Leonardo with the following words:

{{quote|In the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.|Giorgio Vasari}}

The continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], author of ''Il Cortegiano'' ("The Courtier"), wrote in 1528: "...&amp;nbsp;Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | last = Castiglione
 | title = Il Cortegiano

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the biographer known as "Anonimo Gaddiano" wrote, {{circa|1540}}: "His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf{{nbsp}}...".&lt;ref&gt;"Anonimo Gaddiani", elaborating on ''Libro di Antonio Billi'', 1537–1542&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo's genius, causing [[Henry Fuseli]] to write in 1801: "Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius{{nbsp}}..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Henry
 | last = Fuseli
 | title = Lectures

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by A.E. Rio who wrote in 1861: "He towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = A.E.
 | last = Rio
 | title = L'art chrétien
 | year = 1861
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo's notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. [[Hippolyte Taine]] wrote in 1866: "There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Hippolyte
 | last = Taine
 | title = Voyage en Italie
 | year = 1866
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Art historian [[Bernard Berenson]] wrote in 1896: "Leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Bernard
 | last = Berenson
 | author-link = Bernard Berenson
 | title = The Italian Painters of the Renaissance
 | year = 1896
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe."&lt;ref name= LB /&gt;

21st-century author [[Walter Isaacson]] in his biography of Leonardo&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leonardo da Vinci|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2017|isbn=978-1501139154|location=New York|pages=|author-link=Walter Isaacson}}&lt;/ref&gt; based much of his book on the thousands of notebook entries, studying the personal notes, sketches, budget notations, and musings of the man whom he considers the greatest of innovators. Isaacson was surprised to discover a "fun, joyous" side of Leonardo in addition to his limitless curiosity and creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=NonFiction: Biography honors 'fun, joyous' sides of genius da Vinci|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 7, 2018|page=G6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linda Colley''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[British Academy|FBA]], [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]], [[FRHistS]] (born 13 September 1949 in [[Chester]], [[England]]) is a British historian of Britain, empire and nationalism. She is {{As of|2010|alt=currently}} [[Princeton University Department of History|Shelby M. C. Davis 1958 Professor of History]] at [[Princeton University]] in the [[United States]]. Her research focuses on [[British history]] from a global context and often examines history from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Colley is married to fellow historian [[David Cannadine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-even-history-holds-no-solace-their-brilliant-careers-as-academics-could-never-have-1542346.html|title=INTERVIEW / Even history holds no solace: Their brilliant careers as|date=25 August 1992|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Linda Colley took her first degree in history at [[Bristol University]] before completing a doctorate on the [[Tory Party]] in the eighteenth century at the [[University of Cambridge]]. She subsequently held a Research Fellowship at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] College, a joint lectureship in history at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's Colleges]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/pace/graduation/honorary-degrees/hondeg06/colley.html|title=Honorary graduates: Professor Linda Jane Colley |publisher=University of Bristol|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1979 was appointed the first woman Fellow at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], where she is now an Honorary Fellow.

==Career==
Colley is currently Shelby M. C. Davis 1958 [[Princeton University Department of History|Professor of History]] at [[Princeton University]] in the United States. She previously held chairs in History at [[Yale University]] and the [[London School of Economics]].

Linda Colley's books include ''In Defiance of Oligarchy: The Tory Party 1714–1760'' (1982), ''Namier'' (1988), ''Captives: Britain, Empire and the World 1600–1850'' (2002) and ''The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh: A Woman in World History'' (2007), which was named by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the ten best books of the year. Her third book, ''[[Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837]]'' (1992), won the [[Wolfson History Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.wolfson.org.uk/_uploads/documents/history-prize-previous-winners.pdf
|title=Winners of the Wolfson History Prize: 1972–2009
|publisher=Wolfson Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has attracted wide and continuing attention both as a study of the evolution and complexities of British national identities, and as a contribution to understandings of nationalism more broadly.

In March 1993 Colley gave a half-hour ''[[Opinions (TV series)|Opinions]]'' lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in ''[[The Times]]'' as ''"Britain must move with the times to be great again"''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times", 8 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Colley was offered a Sterling Professorship, Yale's highest Professorial rank, but declined it in favour of an offer of a Research Chair in England. Her work has been translated into ten languages.

In 1999 she was invited by the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to deliver the Prime Minister's Millennium Lecture at 10 Downing Street on 'Britishness of the 21st Century'.

[[File:London Hammer.jpg|thumbnail|London Hammer in 1986]]
The '''London Hammer''' (also known as the "London Artifact") is a name given to a hammer made of iron and wood that was found in [[London, Texas]] in 1936. Part of the hammer is embedded in a limy rock concretion, leading to it being regarded by some as an [[Out-of-place artifact|anomalous artifact]], asking how an obviously man-made tool could come to be encased in a 400 million year old rock.  It has been stated that [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] "showed inconclusive dates ranging from the present to 700 years ago."&lt;ref name="Cole1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuban2006" /&gt;

==History==
The hammer was purportedly found by a local couple, Max Hahn and his wife, while out walking along the course of the Red Creek near the town of London.&lt;ref name="HelfinstineRoth2007" /&gt; They spotted a curious piece of loose rock with a bit of wood apparently embedded in it and took it home with them. A decade later, their son Max broke open the rock to find the concealed hammerhead within.

The metal hammerhead is approximately {{convert|6|in|cm|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and has a diameter of {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, leading some to suggest that this hammer was not used for large projects, but rather for fine work or soft metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The London Artifact|url=http://www.creationevidence.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26|website=www.creationevidence.org|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal of the hammerhead has been confirmed to consist of 96.6% [[iron]], 2.6% [[chlorine]], and 0.74% [[sulfur]]. The hammerhead has not rusted since its discovery in the mid-1930s.

Other observers have noted that the hammer is stylistically consistent with typical American tools manufactured in the region in the late 1800s. One possible explanation for the [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] is that the highly [[soluble]] minerals in the ancient [[limestone]] may have formed a [[concretion]] around the object, via a common process (like that of a [[petrifying well]]) which often creates similar encrustations around fossils and other nuclei.&lt;ref name="Kuban2006" /&gt; J.R. Cole states: "The stone is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in [[Ordovician]] rock? The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician. Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble."&lt;ref name="Cole1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/most-amazing-unexplained-artifacts/|title = The 10 most amazing unexplained artifacts|date = March 19, 2009|accessdate = Feb 22, 2015|website = ZME Science |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hammer began to attract wider attention after it was bought by [[creationist]] [[Carl Baugh]] in 1983, who claimed the artifact was a "monumental 'pre-Flood' discovery."&lt;ref name="hystoric_mysteries"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historicmysteries.com/the-london-hammer/ | title=The London Hammer | work=Historic Mysteries | date=20 July 2011 | accessdate=25 February 2015 | author=Hiddleston, Jim | quote=First of all, there are conflicting reports as to where the object was actually located in the surrounding rocks.  And there is no photographic evidence of the object prior to being disturbed.  One report states that the hammer was embedded in a rock formation dating from the Cretaceaus Period (65-135 million years ago).  But other accounts state that Mr. Hahn found the hammer bearing nodule “near” these surrounding rocks.  Skeptics argue that minerals could have cemented the hammer around the Cretaceous rock after it was dropped or left behind.  This could easily lead novice geologists to believe that the hammer and the rock formation are from the same time period.  The only true method of determining the age of the hammer is through Carbon 14 dating of  the wooden handle, but Baugh has yet to authorize this procedure.  The handle appears to be partially fossilized, so this certainly adds to the argument that this a very ancient tool.  But fossilization can occur prematurely through various natural methods.  To skeptics, the hammer appears to be a tool that was abandoned or lost some 200 years ago, but to it’s [sic] supporters, this is a clear indication that man has been on this Earth much longer than previously thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has used it as the basis of speculation of how the atmospheric quality of a pre-[[Great Flood|flood]] earth could have encouraged the growth of giants.&lt;ref name="Cole1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/giants.htm|title=Giant Humans and Dinosaurs|first=M.|last=Coppedge|website=www.biblebelievers.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hammer is now an exhibit in Baugh's [[Creation Evidence Museum]], which sells replicas of it to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/very-ancient-artefacts/the-london-artifact/|title=The London Artifact (Texas)|date=9 May 2007 |author=Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews|work=Bad Archaeology|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Humanists," Baugh said, claim it is an "18th-century miner's hammer." Noting the appearance of the handle, Baugh said a similar-looking piece of wood from Michigan had just been radiocarbon dated 11,500 years old. (He gave no reference and did not blink at the date earlier than his view of creation.) Apparently this was meant to suggest that the hammer was earlier than the 19th (not 18th) century date other observers have suggested and to imply that the hammer itself had been subjected to radiocarbon dating, although it had not been (Baugh, 1983b). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They maintain that the hammer, which was partially embedded in a small, limy rock concretion, originated in a Cretaceous rock formation (or an Ordovician or Silurian one, depending on the account), thus contradicting the standard geologic timetable. However, the hammer was not documented in situ and has not been reliably associated with any specific host formation. Other relatively recent implements have been found encased in by similar nodules and can form within centuries or even decades under proper conditions (Stromberg, 2004). The hammer in question was probably dropped or discarded by a local miner or craftsman within the last few hundred years, after which dissolved limy sediment hardened into a nodule around it. Although a brief rebuttal to Baugh's hammer claims was made by Cole (1985), Baugh and a few other creationists continue to promote it. This review provides further analysis of the hammer and creationist claims about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''28th (Māori) Battalion''', more commonly known as the '''Māori Battalion''', was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[New Zealand Army]] that served during the [[Second World War]]. It was formed following pressure on the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government by some [[Māori electorates|Māori Members of Parliament]] (MPs) and [[Māori people|Māori]] organisations throughout the country which wanted a full Māori unit to be raised for service overseas. The Māori Battalion followed in the footsteps of the [[New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion|Māori Pioneer Battalion]] that served during the First World War with success, and was wanted by Māori to raise their profile, and to serve alongside their [[Pākehā]] compatriots as subjects of the [[British Empire]]. It also gave a generation of people with a well-noted military ancestry a chance to test their own warrior skills.&lt;ref name=Cody1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orange237&gt;{{harvnb|Orange|2000|p= 237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised in 1940 as part of the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force|Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (2NZEF), the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] as an extra battalion that was moved between the division's three infantry [[brigade]]s. The battalion fought during the [[Battle of Greece|Greek]], [[North African Campaign|North African]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaigns]] during which it earned a formidable reputation as a fighting force which has subsequently been acknowledged by both Allied and German commanders. It was also the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], before being disbanded in January 1946.

==History==

===Formation===
The 28th (Māori) Battalion had its origins before the start of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir [[Āpirana Ngata]] started to discuss proposals for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crawford|2000|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion|Māori Pioneer Battalion]] that had served during the First World War.&lt;ref name=Cody1&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs, [[Eruera Tirikatene]] and [[Paraire Karaka Paikea|Paraire Paikea]], and from this support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the [[British Empire]] and to test their warrior skills.&lt;ref name=Cody1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange237"/&gt; At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the [[2nd New Zealand Division]].&lt;ref name=McGibbon309&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was decided that the battalion's key positions, including its [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], [[Non-commissioned officer|non commissioned officers]] (NCOs) and [[signaller]]s, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent.&lt;ref name=Cody1_2&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions.&lt;ref name=Orange237/&gt; In this regard, it was decided that the battalion's first [[commanding officer]] would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] in January 1940—and that his [[second-in-command]] would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.&lt;ref name=Cody2&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately effort was focused upon selecting and identifying the officers and NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed as part of the [[2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (2NZEF) and from new recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at [[Trentham, New Zealand|Trentham]], where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion.&lt;ref name=Cody3&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.&lt;ref name=Cody4&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 1940 the battalion came together for the first time, marking its official raising at the [[Palmerston North]] Show Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody| 1956|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon formation it was decided that the battalion would be organised upon tribal lines.&lt;ref name=Cody5&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The unit consisted of a [[headquarters]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] and four rifle companies, designated 'A' through 'D': 'A' Company was recruited from North Auckland; 'B' Company from Rotorua, the Bay of Plenty and Thames–Coromandel; 'C' Company from the East Coast from Gisborne to East Cape and 'D' Company from Waikato, Maniapoto, Hawkes Bay, Wellington and the South Island, as well as some Pacific Islands and the Chatham and Stewart Islands.&lt;ref name=Cody5/&gt;

February saw the issuing of equipment and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men who were able to serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch.&lt;ref name=Cody7&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service.&lt;ref name=Cody9&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940.&lt;ref name=Cody10&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.&lt;ref name=McGibbon309/&gt;

Sailing upon the [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']] via [[Fremantle]] and [[Cape Town]], the battalion arrived at [[Gourock]], Scotland, after six weeks at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they had been destined to join the rest of the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] in the Middle East, but due to concerns about a possible [[Operation Sea Lion|invasion]] of the United Kingdom by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', the decision was made to divert the division's second echelon, a [[brigade]]-sized force that included the 28th (Māori) Battalion, to Britain to help bolster the island's defences.&lt;ref name=McGibbon309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June or early July 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to a mixed brigade under Brigadier [[Harold Barrowclough]]. During this time they manned defences in the south of England and undertook further training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=20–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion suffered from a lack of equipment, largely due to the priority given to re-equip British units following the losses suffered by the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France, and consequently training was largely focused upon anti-gas procedures and route marching.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July they were inspected by King [[George VI]] and he was said to have been impressed by the "smartness of the close order and arms drill of the Māori Battalion" and "by the fine physique, keenness and determined demeanour" of the men.&lt;ref name=Cody22&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:H 001813 Maori Battalion Gourock June 1940.jpg|thumb|Maori Battalion officers arriving at Gourock, Scotland on 17 June 1940|alt=Two Maori men wearing military uniforms smile at the camera, surrounded by other soldiers in front of a building]]

Shortly afterwards the Mixed Brigade began quick deployment and defensive manoeuvres in earnest, as fears of invasion grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956| p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In between exercises, further training was undertaken and the battalion also worked to improve fixed defences throughout July, August and into September. These exercises varied in size from [[company (military unit)|company]] to [[battalion]]-level, and involved differing scenarios and enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=24–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a [[division (military)|divisional]] review was undertaken and amidst massive German air raids upon London, the New Zealanders were declared to be ready for front-line service in the event of a German landing.&lt;ref name=Cody26&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Warning orders for deployment to [[Egypt]] were cancelled and the New Zealanders were placed under command of [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]], taking up defensive positions in the [[Folkestone]]–[[Dover]] region.&lt;ref name=Cody26/&gt;

In October, the Māori Battalion was attached to "Milforce", under Dittmer's command, along with a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of [[tank]]s, a squadron of [[cavalry]] and a [[medium machine gun]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, with an invasion now considered unlikely, the battalion returned to [[Aldershot]] for the winter, remaining there for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=29–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time limited training was undertaken, although upon invitation the battalion fielded a [[Rugby football|rugby]] team against a Welsh side at Langley Park, losing 12–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, the battalion received the order to begin preparing for redeployment to Egypt and an advance party was dispatched in mid-December. On 7 January 1941 the rest of the battalion left for the Middle East, embarking from [[Liverpool]] on the ''Athlone Castle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=30–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
After sailing via [[Freetown]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]], the ''Athlone Castle'' sailed up the east coast of Africa and entered the [[Suez Canal]], arriving at Tewfik harbour on 3 March 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon the battalion entrained and two days later they arrived in the desert, where they were met by motor transport which carried them to camp Garawi, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=Cody38&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point they were met by about 300 reinforcements which were used to replace men who had been laid down with influenza and to bring the battalion up to a higher establishment.&lt;ref name=Cody38/&gt; Shortly afterwards they were moved to [[Alexandria]], where they embarked on the [[RMS Cameronia (1920)|''Cameronia'']], bound for Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
On 6 April the [[German invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia]] began.&lt;ref name=Cody48&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to help defend Greece, a composite force of three [[Division (military unit)|division]]s of Australian, British and New Zealand troops were to be deployed, and were grouped together under the title of 'W' Force. However, by the time the invasion began only two of the three divisions had arrived, and the New Zealanders were consequently spread thin, holding a position to the north of [[Katerini]], where they were tasked to defend the strategic Olympus Pass to the south.&lt;ref name=Cody48/&gt; During this time, the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, which was later grouped with other Australian and New Zealand units to form the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps#Later formations|Anzac Corps]]. Vastly outnumbered,&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/greek_campaign.asp|title=Encyclopedia: The Greek campaign, 1941|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; within two days the situation for the Allies was not good as the Germans had broken through the defences along the Bulgarian border and the Yugoslav resistance had collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=48–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the situation worsened, orders came down from brigade headquarters that the passes would be held "to the last man and last round".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody| 1956|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Greece - 15 April 1941.png|thumb|left|Map depicting relative positions on 15 April 1941|alt=A map depicting the movement of defensive lines throughout a battle]]

On 9 April, the fall of [[Salonika]] precipitated the order for the battalion to withdraw from their positions at Katerini south to Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody| 1956|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As events unfolded elsewhere, the battalion remained in position, digging in and constructing defences until 12 April when they were ordered to withdraw behind the Mavroneri Gorge and reposition themselves on the western aspect. At this time the 5th Infantry Brigade's orders were changed from a holding action to a delay and withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Petra Pass,&lt;ref name=McGibbon309/&gt; alongside the [[22nd Battalion (New Zealand)|22nd Battalion]], that the 28th Battalion fought its first engagement of the war. In preparation for the coming attack, the Māori built their position, running out barbed and concertina wire and digging in while German bombers droned overhead. During the night they carried out patrols along the Mavroneri riverbed, but no contact was made. The following morning, the [[Divisional Cavalry Regiment (New Zealand)|divisional cavalry]], which had been carrying out a [[rearguard]] action, conducted a withdrawal through the battalion's position, making the Māori Battalion the most forward Allied unit. As German forces were halted at Platamon by the [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st Battalion]], thrusts towards [[Larisa]] once again put the battalion's position in doubt and they were again ordered to withdraw. Meanwhile, the Anzac Corps decided to make its last stand {{convert|100|mi|km}} south at [[Thermopylae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end the Māoris remained in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With isolated platoons still in contact with the Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=64–65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After meeting motor transport, the battalion moved back to Ay Dhimitrios, which they began to prepare to defend in order to help seal off the exit of the Olympus pass. The withdrawal continued, though, and on 19 April the Māori Battalion was called upon to conduct a delaying action as the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade pulled back through Larisa towards Lamia, {{convert|80|mi|km}} south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion. Upon arrival at Thermopylae the battalion had had just enough time to dig in before receiving the order that they were to move their position in order to make way for the 6th Infantry Brigade. They completed this move by 21 April, taking up the same positions that [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] and his army had defended against [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in 480 BC, according to legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence, on 22 April, in [[Athens]], the decision was made that the units of the British Commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from the country.&lt;ref name=Cody71&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next two days, the battalion withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went.&lt;ref name=Cody73&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's [[Universal Carrier|carrier]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00&amp;nbsp;am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured.&lt;ref name=Cody73/&gt; The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crete===
After being evacuated from Greece, the Māori Battalion embarked upon the [[landing ship, infantry]] {{HMS|Glengyle}} and was taken to [[Crete]] where they formed part of the island's hastily formed garrison. The 5th Infantry Brigade was allocated to the area surrounding the airfield and the battalion was positioned on the north coast at Platanias, on the brigade's right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1941, the Germans launched the opening stages of their [[Battle of Crete|campaign]] with large-scale glider and parachute drops of troops from [[Maleme]] to [[Canea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The landings were focused around the airfield and no troops landed in the area being held by the Māori, nevertheless, a small force of glider troops were found to be occupying a house on the beach about {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} from them. A platoon was dispatched to attack them and after a brief fire-fight in which two New Zealanders were wounded and eight Germans were killed, the 10 remaining men in the house surrendered.&lt;ref name=Cody92&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of crete.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|German assault on Crete|alt=A map depicting the various places where the Germans landed troops on the island of Crete]]

The main German attack was focused upon the 22nd Battalion which was defending the airfield. Hard pressed, late in the day the 22nd requested reinforcements and the 5th Infantry Brigade commander, Brigadier [[James Hargest|J. Hargest]], sent one company from the [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd]] and one from the 28th.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The task was given to 'B' Company and, as the company commander only knew the direct route, they had a night approach march of over {{convert|8|mi|km}} to cover. During the march they came in contact with a platoon-sized force of Germans which briefly held up the company before reinforcements could arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German force surrendered, but in doing so one of their number threw a [[grenade]] at the New Zealanders, wounding two men. In response the Māoris fixed bayonets and carried out the first bayonet charge by a New Zealand force during the war, killing 24. A short while later they killed another eight in a separate engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956| p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing on towards the 22nd Battalion, they bumped into a number of small pockets of Germans before eventually linking up with the 22nd Battalion's headquarters where they were told to return to their own lines as the decision had been made to withdraw from the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark| 2000|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven hours later the company reported back to the 28th Battalion's lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next ten days the battalion was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the [[2/7th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/7th Battalion]] at [[Battle of 42nd Street|42nd Street]] on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the Māori accounting for 100.&lt;ref name=McGibbon309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/event_288.asp|title=Battle of 42nd Street|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it soon became clear that the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards [[Sfakia]]. The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of [[Layforce]] to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2000|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May the final order was received, although due to shipping losses it was not possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded.&lt;ref name=Cody501&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the [[Distinguished Service Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa===
After their escape from Crete, the 28th (Māori) Battalion was evacuated to Egypt where they were re-issued with summer uniforms and began to receive reinforcements. In June they carried out a ceremonial parade for King George VI and the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]], and the commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, [[Lieutenant General]] [[Bernard Freyberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout July, the battalion undertook desert familiarisation training and sports parades before moving to [[Kabrit]] where they concentrated with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade for a three-week combined operations exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in August, they moved to a position {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of [[El Alamein]], known as the "Kaponga Box" where throughout September and into October they undertook the unfamiliar task of road construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=135–136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the brigade received orders to link up with the rest of the division in preparation for their commitment to the battle along the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E 003261 E Maoris in North Africa July 1941.jpg|left|thumb|Kneeling in a haka: Maori troops in North Africa (July 1941)|alt=Maori men kneeling, performing the haka]]

On 11 November 1941, the 5th Infantry Brigade concentrated near [[Mersa Matruh]]. Three days later the division had assembled and began the advance into [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first task was to capture the seaside town of Sollum, which was taken on 23 November from its Italian garrison with only a few casualties. Follow-up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Dittmer, and two company commanders. Two hundred and forty-seven Italian prisoners were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=144–146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGibbon310&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the 5th Infantry Brigade was placed under the command of the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Division]] and the 28th Battalion took up positions near [[Bardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later the battalion attacked a column of tanks and motorised infantry before ambushing a column at Menastir on 3 December. Later, notable actions were undertaken at [[Gazala]] and at Sidi Magreb where over 1,000 Italians prisoners were captured. Following this, the battalion was deployed to [[Syria]] before returning to Egypt in June 1942. Now officially under the command of a Māori for the first time—Lieutenant Colonel Eruera Love having taken over from Dyer in May—the Māoris took part in the 2nd New Zealand Division's breakout from Minqar Qaim, undertaking a successful bayonet charge.&lt;ref name=McGibbon310/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moorehead|2009|p=382}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the battalion's skills with the bayonet earned them a reputation as "scalp hunters" among German commanders, including Rommel.&lt;ref name=McGibbon310/&gt;

In September and October the battalion took part in important actions as part of the offensive in the Munassib Depression and at Miteiriya Ridge during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. On 2 November the battalion supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle.&lt;ref name=McGibbon310/&gt; Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|pp=310–311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943, at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap, where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German [[Panzergrenadier|panzer grenadier]] battalion.&lt;ref name=McGibbon310/&gt; It was during this action that Second Lieutenant [[Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu]] performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref name=McGibbon295&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Bennett (high commissioner)|Charles Bennett]], also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack.&lt;ref name=McGibbon55&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks later, on the night 19/20 April 1943, the battalion took part in the 5th Infantry Brigade's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna. The village was situated atop a steep slope, and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines, which wounded a number of men, including the commanding officer.&lt;ref name=McGibbon55/&gt; Nevertheless, two sections under the command of Sergeant [[Haane Manahi|Haane te Rauawa Manahi]], managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on the pinnacle in the early dawn. Following heavy shellfire and hand-to-hand combat with the Italian defenders, the Māoris were forced off the pinnacle twice; each time, though, Manahi led his small force in a counterattack. In the afternoon, Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions, encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender. For these actions, Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross, but the nomination was not approved and he received a [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] instead.&lt;ref name=McGibbon295/&gt;

===Italy===
The battalion returned to Egypt with the 5th Infantry Brigade in late-May and underwent a period of refit and retraining, during which the bulk of the original unit was given three months leave and returned to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=315–316}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the evacuation to hospital of Lieutenant Colonel Kingi Keiha, there were no suitable senior Māori officers available and he was replaced as commanding officer by Lieutenant Colonel Monty Fairbrother on 11 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=317}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Having taken no part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July&amp;nbsp;– August, the 2nd New Zealand Division was committed to battle again in late 1943 as part of Eighth Army during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. The Māori Battalion subsequently arrived in Italy on 22 October, landing at [[Taranto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 5th Infantry Brigade undertook a period of training in close-country tactics, remaining in camp at Taranto until 18 November when it was ordered to move north {{convert|250|mi|km}} to join the Eighth Army.&lt;ref name=Cody321&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd New Zealand Division had moved into the front line in November in order to relieve the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Division]] and would take part in the [[Bernhardt Line|advance across the Sangro]] planned for the end of the month. The brigade subsequently occupied positions around [[Atessa]], with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the [[Sangro]] river valley.&lt;ref name=Cody321/&gt; The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General [[Harold Alexander]]—commander of the [[15th Army Group]]—had planned for Lieutenant General [[Bernard Montgomery]] to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]]. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|1956|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NA 012253 Maori Battalion troops Cassino 1944.jpg|thumb|Troops from the Maori battalion escort German prisoners of war near Cassino, February 1944|alt=Soldiers march along a road past a stone building that has been damaged]]

During December the 2nd New Zealand Division took part in the [[Moro River Campaign]]. By this time the attacking battalions had exploited forward towards the [[Winter Line]] and the Māori Battalion moved forward by truck on 1 December, crossing the Sangro. Heavy congestion on the road delayed the battalion's movements, and although scheduled to assault towards Elici, they arrived to find the 23rd Battalion and the Division Cavalry had already completed the task. The Māoris were again ordered into reserve, occupying positions {{convert|1|mi|km}} east of Castelfrentano.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956| p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, on 3 December, the 6th Infantry Brigade assaulted [[Orsogna]], and was involved in heavy fighting there, first capturing and then losing it following a counter-attack by German armour. A subsequent attack against Orsogna was planned by the New Zealanders utilising both the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades. The attack was scheduled for 7 December, with both brigades to advance on a one battalion front. The Māori Battalion would lead the assault in the 5th Infantry Brigade section, up the Pascuccio spur to cut the Orsogna–Ortona road east of the 6th Infantry Brigade's objective. Fairbrother planned to assault with two companies forward, one in depth and one in reserve, with support from armour and anti-tank guns. This could not be provided though, as difficult terrain prevented tracked vehicles from moving across the Moro and up on to Pascuccio.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=326–327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on Orsogna began at 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm, following a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially some progress was made, the Germans managed to hold Orsogna throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.28maoribattalion.org.nz/story-of-the-28th/italian-campaign|title=Italian Campaign|publisher=Official 28th Maori Battalion Website|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line on the night of 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody| 1956|p=348}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealanders were subsequently transferred to the [[Fifth Army (United States)|Fifth Army]] for its advance up the west coast of Italy towards Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=349}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving behind the bitter cold on the other side of the peninsula, the battalion undertook a period of training and reorganisation near Sant' Angelo d'Alife.&lt;ref name=Cody350&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Fairbrother was replaced by another Pakeha officer, Major Russell Young, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led the battalion until July 1944.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt;

As part of the Fifth Army's advance up the [[Liri|Liri valley]], the Māori Battalion's next major engagement came in early 1944 when they took part in the fighting around [[Monte Cassino]]. The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]].&lt;ref name=Cody350/&gt; Throughout January the Allies continued their advance, but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 351}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 17/18 February 1944, as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines, the Māoris were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=355}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They met very stiff resistance, and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders. Lacking armoured support, which had failed to arrive, they fought through the morning and into the afternoon, but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p= 362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two assaulting companies, 'A' and 'B', suffered over 60 per cent casualties, losing 128 men killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt; In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino, however, it was not until May that the position was eventually captured, by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line, and transferred back to the Eighth Army.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these losses, the battalion did not return to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards [[Florence]] and is believed to have been first to reach the city on 4 August.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt; During this time Major [[Arapeta Awatere]] led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with [[jaundice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=395}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around [[Rimini]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around [[Faenza]], for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The winter snow set in after this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action died down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=446}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, throughout January, February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=449}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945 the battalion returned to the front line to take part in the final stages of the war.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt; On 1 April the battalion entered the line near [[Granarolo dell'Emilia|Granarolo]] along with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade and for the next month they were involved in five main battles along the [[Senio]], [[Santerno]], [[Sillaro]], [[Gaiana River|Gaiana]] and [[Idice]] rivers as the Allies pursued the Germans back towards [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=451}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Trieste that the Māori Battalion's war came to an end. Their involvement in the final stages of the fighting in Italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=478}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while losses for the entire Italian campaign were 230 men killed, and 887 wounded.&lt;ref name=28bnitaly/&gt;

===Disbandment===
On 2 May 1945 news was received that all German forces west of the [[Isonzo River]] had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, on the night of 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over.&lt;ref name=Cody479&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=479}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of [[Istria]] meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this the routine of the battalion became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Cody481&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=481}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The war with Japan continued however, and at the time it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the [[South West Pacific Area|Pacific]]. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.&lt;ref name=Cody481/&gt;

Throughout July the battalion undertook garrison duties in [[Trieste]] before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to [[Lake Trasimene]].&lt;ref name=Cody482&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=482}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan's unconditional surrender, ending plans for the battalion to take part in further combat in the Pacific. In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=482–483}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last batch of long service men had departed shortly after the battalion's arrival at Lake Trasimene,&lt;ref name=Cody482/&gt; and so after this it was decided that the battalion would return to New Zealand as a formed unit. As such their return was to be delayed and so they found winter quarters in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Cody483&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=483}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time it was decided that men from the battalion would be included within the [[J Force|New Zealand contribution]] to the [[occupation of Japan]]. In this vein, a 270-strong contingent from the battalion was sent to Japan under the designation of 'D' Squadron, 2nd Divisional Cavalry Battalion, under the command of Major J.S Baker.&lt;ref name=Cody483/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGibbon311&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|2000|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 6 December the battalion entrained at Florence and embarked on the [[troopship]] {{ship|QSMV|Dominion Monarch||2}} at [[Taranto]] on Boxing Day. Passing through the Suez Canal, they sailed via Fremantle, arriving in [[Wellington]] on 23 January 1946, where they were met by the acting Prime Minister, [[Walter Nash]], at Aotea Quay for an official Māori welcome home ceremony. Afterwards the men were sent back to their homes and the battalion was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|p=484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the course of the war, 3,600 men served in the battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.28maoribattalion.org.nz/|title=28th Maori Battalion|publisher=Official 28th Maori Battalion Website|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 649 were killed or died of wounds while another 1,712 were wounded. Another 29 died as a result of service following discharge, while two were killed by accident during training in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=McGibbon311/&gt; The Māori Battalion's service against the Germans in North Africa earned them a distinguished reputation. Such was the respect that Allied commanders had for the Māori Battalion that they were frequently used as a spearhead unit. Bernard Freyberg, the General Officer Commanding of the 2NZEF, commented, "No infantry had a more distinguished record, or saw more fighting, or, alas, had such heavy casualties, as the Maori Battalion."&lt;ref name=McGibbon311/&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;{{#tag:ref|A full [[Memorial|roll of honour]] can be found in Cody.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cody|1956|pp=486–500}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The battalion's reputation was also acknowledged by their opponents. Some sources state that the Afrika Korps commander, [[Erwin Rommel]] remarked,"Give me the Maori Battalion and I will conquer the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.28maoribattalion.org.nz/memory/impressions-pilgrimage-cruise-28th|title=Impressions – Pilgrimage Cruise of the 28th|publisher=Official 28th Maori Battalion Website|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources attribute this comment to Rommel's former chief of staff, General [[Siegfried Westphal]], who met with the former Māori Battalion chaplain, Reverend Canon Wiremu T. Huata, during an Afrika Korps reunion dinner in Mainz, Germany, in 1972.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/manukau-courier/opinion/willie-jackson/2374818/A-prayer-for-our-country|title=A Prayer for Our Country|last=Jackson|first=Willie|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=8 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forachange.co.uk/browse/2285.html|title=The Warrior Canon |last=Manson|first=Matt|publisher=For A Change|date=1 June 1989|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.28maoribattalion.org.nz/memory/the-m%C4%81ori-chaplains|title=The Māori Chaplains|publisher=Official 28th Maori Battalion Website|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorations==
In total, the Māori Battalion received more individual bravery decorations than any other New Zealand battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/maori-and-the-second-world-war/achievements |title=Achievements – Maori and the Second World War |publisher= New Zealand History Online |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One member of the battalion, Second Lieutenant [[Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu]], was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] during the war,&lt;ref name=LG&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36040 |supp=y|page=2559|date=1 June 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another member, Sergeant [[Haane Manahi]], was also recommended for the award. During the fighting around Takrouna in 1943, Manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of Italian positions; the following day he set out to capture Italian outposts. Four generals, including Harold Alexander, Bernard Freyberg, [[Howard Kippenberger]] and Bernard Law Montgomery had recommended that Manahi receive the Victoria Cross but this recommendation was downgraded in London to the Distinguished Conduct Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0512/S00143.htm|title=Haane Manahi Victoria Cross Claim|date=19 December 2005|publisher=Scoop|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cody 1956, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[iwi]] [[Te Arawa]] lodged a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal for Haane Manahi to have his award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal upgraded to a Victoria Cross. In December 2005 the Waitangi Tribunal released their findings supporting the claim, but in October 2006 the New Zealand [[Minister of Defence (New Zealand)|Minister of Defence]] announced that the award could not be made as King George VI had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made.&lt;ref name=McGibbon295/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10429319|title=Queen recognises Maori soldier's bravery|newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=17 March 2007|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was decided that Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth, a personal letter from [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented to Manahi's son by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]] on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in [[Rotorua]].&lt;ref name=nzherald/&gt;

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

==Artist group==
The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

Niutoua was the famous residence of the Tu'itonga. Before Niutoua. It was called Heketa.

{{Marxism}}
'''Paolo Virno''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɜr|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|ˈvirno|lang}}; born 1952) is an Italian [[philosopher]], [[Semiotics|semiologist]] and a figurehead for the Italian [[Marxism|Marxist]] movement. Implicated in belonging to illegal social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, Virno was arrested and jailed in 1979, accused of belonging to the [[Red Brigades]]. He spent several years in prison before finally being acquitted, after which he organized the publication ''[[Luogo Comune]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[wikt:commonplace|commonplace]]") in order to vocalize the political ideas he developed during his imprisonment. Virno currently teaches philosophy at the [[Roma Tre University|University of Rome]].

==Biography==
Virno was born in [[Naples]], but spent his childhood and adolescence in Genoa. He had his first [[political]] experiences when joining the social movements of 1968—the association between personal fulfillment and [[anti-capitalism]], typical of the ''[[critique artiste]]'' of the 1960s, which then constituted one of the key reasons for his political philosophy. He moved to [[Rome]] with his family at the beginning of the 1970s, where he studied [[philosophy]] in [[university]].

Simultaneously, Virno was involved in the [[Labor movement|labour]] movement and campaigned in the organization ''[[Potere Operaio]],'' a Marxist group involved in the recruitment and mobilization of industrial workers. ''Potere Operaio,'' unlike political [[communists]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] who sought to combine the student bodies with the workers' unions, focused mainly on factory and industrial workers in a program stemming from [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] theory criticising the organization of work. Virno participated in the movement, organizing protests and strikes in northern Italian factories, until its dissolution in 1973.

In 1977 Virno presented his [[doctoral thesis]] on the concept of [[employment|work]] and the theory of [[consciousness]] of [[Theodor Adorno]], while actively participating in the [[movement of 1977]], which organized around the precariousness of workers. The Metropolitan magazine, which he founded along with [[Oreste Scalzone]] and [[Franco Piperno]], was revered as the body of the intellectual movement at the time. Two years later, the editorial board of Metropolitan France was jailed on charges of belonging to the [[Red Brigades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|title=Flee Rather Than Stand Your Ground|url=http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/35502/Wendy-McElroy-Flee-Rather-Than-Stand-Your-Ground/|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=Daily Bell|date=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-year period of custody was a time of intense intellectual activity for Virno and others involved. After being sentenced in 1982 to 12 years in prison for "subversive activities and creation of an armed group" (though the charges of belonging to the [[Red Brigades]] did not materialise), Virno appealed and was released pending trial in the second instance; in 1987 he would eventually be acquitted, along with Piperno. His experience during these years were fed into the organization of the ''[[Luogo Comune]]'' publication, devoted to the analysis of life forms within [[postfordism]].
In 1993 Virno left his post as [[editor in chief|editor]] of ''Luogo Comune'' to teach [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Urbino]]. In 1996 he was invited to talk at the [[University of Montreal]] and upon his return he held the chair of [[philosophy of language]], [[semiotics]] and [[ethics of communication]] at the [[University of Cosenza]] (Calabria). He now teaches at the University of Rome.

==Philosophical work==
The early works of Virno were directly linked to his political participation, but after years of imprisonment, which along with his fellow prisoners, he conducted intensive studies of philosophy, and his focus on theoretical research has become more ambitious, covering [[political philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[mass media]].

On the one hand, studies pertaining to philosophy of language have led to the confrontation of the classic themes of philosophy — like the analysis of [[subjectivity]] — with the limits imposed under linguistics. On the other hand, Virno has explored the ethical dimension of communication. The juncture of these fields was found to be a [[materialism]] that encompasses the processes of language and thought as a working link, keeping in line with the traditions of [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], the interrelationship between work, thought, language, society and history is the nexus of its philosophical thought.

The philosophical concepts, however, maintained a close link with theory and action-related policies; notions of "world", "power", "potential" or "history", which have been the focus of many of his works, were in fact conceived in key by [[Marx]]. Virno, along with many of his contemporaries such as [[Antonio Negri]], has abandoned and argued against the hegemony of the dialectic tradition in Marxist philosophy.

Virno maintains the status of historical and linguistic concepts as being political-[[State (polity)|state]], [[sovereignty]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[legality]], [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], which are accepted in social theory and philosophy as invariant, although polemically are considered to have been invented in the 17th century, with very specific and controversial political objectives. The reinvention of the concepts of society is part of the political task that has been proposed, regarding the concept of [[Emigration|exodus]] — perhaps the best example of this joint,{{Clarify|reason = This passage is unclear or incomplete|date=November 2015}} where the personal experiences of emotion are understood as an act of resistance toward established power and [[status quo]]. The assumption by the personality of the flight as a reaction to the social structure. On these lines, Virno has criticized these restrictions as [[symbol]]ic of the counter-culture movements.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015|reason = No citation provided to substantiate the claim.}}

==Development==
In 1738 [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] obtained a [[patent]] for a [[Cotton-spinning machinery|cotton spinning machine]] that for the first time used the principle of two sets of rollers travelling at different speeds to enable fully mechanical spinning. The patent outlined the two key developments that were later to underlie both [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]] and [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]], and made it possible for a single power source to drive more than one spinning machine. Wyatt envisaged "a kind of [[Mill (grinding)|mill]], with wheels turned either by horses, water or wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mantoux|first=Paul|others=tr. Vernon, Marjorie|title=The Industrial Revolution in the Eighteenth Century: An Outline of the Beginnings of the Modern Factory System in England|origyear=1928|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0415378397|page=212|chapter=Machinery in the Textile Industry|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ypy0Nnqc7kC&amp;pg=PA212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this technology, and with financial support provided by associates of the author [[Samuel Johnson]], in the summer of 1741 Paul and Wyatt set up the [[Upper Priory Cotton Mill]] in Birmingham, the first mill to spin cotton "without the aid of human fingers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Baker|first=John Leon|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|title=Wyatt, John (1700–1766), inventor of machinery|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30106|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mill "containing fifty rollers ... turned by two donkeys walking round an axis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=Thomas T.|last2=Showell|first2= Walter|title=Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham: A History And Guide Arranged Alphabetically|origyear=1885|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14472/14472-h/14472-h.htm|accessdate=2007-12-31|edition=Project Gutenberg EBook|year=2004|publisher=Cornish Brothers|chapter=Calico, Cotton, and Cloth }}&lt;/ref&gt; was not a commercial success, with Wyatt unable to enforce the levels of organisation and discipline that an operation on this scale demanded; [[Andrew Ure]] was to comment that Wyatt was "favourably placed, in a mechanical point of view, for maturing his admirable scheme" but "a gentle and passive spirit, little qualified to cope with the hardships of a new manufacturing enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marglin|first=Stephen A.|editor=Warwick Organizational Behaviour Staff|title=Organizational Studies: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management|origyear=1974|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415215544|page=43|chapter=What do bosses do? The origins and functions of hierarchy in capitalist production|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdDt1MaJ42YC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after its opening the mill was described as being in a "pitiful state" and in 1743 Wyatt was incarcerated in the [[Fleet Prison]] for debt. [[Matthew Boulton]] was later to observe that the Paul-Wyatt mill "would have got money had it been in good hands", but nothing is known of it after Wyatt's release in October 1743.&lt;ref name="Mann_XXXI-IV" /&gt;

[[File:Marvels Mill Northampton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marvel's Mill]] in [[Northampton]] pictured in 1746 - the earliest known pictorial representation of a [[cotton mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bates|1996|p=241}}; {{Citation|last=Smith|first=D.|title=The representation of non-extractive industry on large-scale county maps of England and Wales 1700 -c. 1840|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=26|issue=2|date=December 1989|publisher=Maney Publishing|pages=134–147|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/caj/1989/00000026/00000002/art00005|accessdate=2011-05-12|doi=10.1179/caj.1989.26.2.134}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four other mills were set up using the Paul-Wyatt machinery in the following years. [[Edward Cave]] – publisher of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' and one of the friends of Dr Johnson who had funded the development of Paul and Wyatt's invention – experimented in [[London]] with running the machinery by hand and by 1742 had set up 250 spindles at [[Marvell's Mill]], a [[watermill]] in [[Northampton]]. This was the first cotton mill to be driven by water power. Cave experienced similar problems organising his workforce to Paul and Wyatt ("I have not got half my people come to work today" he wrote to Wyatt, "and I have no great fascination in the prospect I have to put myself in the power of such people") and the mill generated little profit, but was to continue operation until about 1764. [[Samuel Touchet]] set up a second Birmingham mill in conjunction with Paul and Wyatt in 1744; little is known of its fate, but it was sufficiently encouraging for Touchet to lease the Northampton mill from Cave for a period up to 1755.&lt;ref name="Mann_XXXI-IV" /&gt;

The final mill was [[Pinsley Mill]] established by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]]. This may have been in operation by 1744, but is first mentioned in 1748, when both Bourn and Paul patented machinery for [[carding]] cotton - a premilinary process that must be undertaken before spinning.&lt;ref name="Mann_XXXI-IV" /&gt; Bourn's mill burned down in 1754 but must have had a considerable reputation, as the ''Manchester Mercury'''s report of the fire described it as being "erected there with great expense and skill" and "viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/agriculture%20_industry/mills_leominster.htm|title=The Mills of Leominster - Pinsley Mill or Etnam Street Mill|accessdate=2009-01-04|work=Herefordshire Sites and Monuments Record|publisher=Herefordshire Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrus Cunaeus''' (1586, in [[Vlissingen]] &amp;ndash; 2 December 1638, in [[Leiden]]) was the pen name of the Dutch Christian 
scholar Peter van der Kun. His book ''The Hebrew Republic'' is considered "the most powerful statement of republican theory in the early years of the [[Dutch Republic]]." &lt;ref name="Tuck, Richard 1651, p. 169"&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cunaeus enrolled at the [[University of Leyden]] at the age of fourteen, where he studied [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Following a trip to England in 1603, he returned to Leyden to study theology and jurisprudence. He was introduced to rabbinic studies and Aramaic by [[Johannes Drusius]].  In 1612,  Cunaeus became a professor
of Latin, in 1613 of politics, and in 1615 of jurisprudence, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name="j1454305"&gt;Petrus Cunaeus on Theocracy, Jubilee and the Latifundia, by Jonathan R. Ziskind, 
The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Ser., Vol. 68, No. 4. (Apr., 1978), pp. 235-254.  {{jstor|1454305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunaeus wrote at  the peak of Protestant interest in Jewish texts for their political as well as religious authority.   He was among the leading Christian  scholars of Jewish texts of a generation that included the Frenchman [[Joseph Scaliger]], [[Hugo Grotius]], and [[Bonaventure Vulcanius]] in the Netherlands, [[Johannes Buxtorf]], father and son in Germany and; England, [[John Selden]] and [[Daniel Heinsius]] in England.  Cunaeus also corresponded with such contemporary Jewish scholars as [[Menasseh ben Israel]].&lt;ref name="j1454305" /&gt;

==''The Hebrew Republic''==
Cunaeus is best remembered for his book ''De Republica Hebraeorum'' (also known as ''Respublica Hebraeorum''  and ''The Hebrew Republic'')  in which he described the ancient Hebrew kingdom as a model of republican  government.  The work was highly acclaimed and published in at least seven editions between  1617  and 1700. It  was translated into Dutch, French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lea Campos Boralevi, Classical Foundational Myths of European Republicanism: The Jewish Commonwealth, in Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner,   Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Cambridge University
Press,  2002 , p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;   There had already been dozen books and essays by other authors with the same title.  “ Cunaeus’ effort stood apart, for the first time presenting the Israelite state of the First Temple period, and especially the united monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon, as a practical model for the newly independent United Provinces.” &lt;ref&gt;Per una storia della Respublica Hebraeorum come modello politico, by Lea Campos Boralevi, in Dalle Repubbliche elezeviriane alle ideologie del '900, V.I. Comparato, E. Pii (eds), Florence, 1997; The Jewish Roots of Western Freedom, by  Fania Oz-Salzberger, Azure • SUMMER 5762 / 2002, https://web.archive.org/web/20040910141043/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/azure/13/13-fania.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For Cunaeus the Bible was a legal and juridical model for the functioning of an independent state.  For Cunaeus, who was the leading expert of his era on Josephus,&lt;ref name="j1454305"/&gt;
[[Josephus]]' [[Jewish Antiquities]] and [[Contra Apion]], as well as [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah]], the [[Talmud]], and the Bible together provided information demonstrating that Hebrew State was of a higher order than the Greek or Roman states. “Because its god was the true God… the Hebrew state could function as an archetype for the ideal republic. Its laws corresponded to natural law, and its social spirit flowed directly from the divine imperative of justice. This state was neither a monarchy nor an oligarchy nor a democracy, but a republic, whose senate—the Sanhedrin—and magistrates, including judges and priests, enforced and executed divinely ordained laws in ordinary civic situations. “&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Roots of Western Freedom, by  Fania Oz-Salzberger, Azure • SUMMER 5762 / 2002, https://web.archive.org/web/20040910141043/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/azure/13/13-fania.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunaeus’s understanding of the Hebrew State as a federal republic directly influenced the formation of the government of the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government 1572-1651, New York, Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp, 167-169)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lea Campos Boralevi, The Jewish Commonwealth, in Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner,   Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Cambridge University
Press,  2002 , p. 258-60&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not, however, a republic of the common man that Cunaeus wished for the Dutch, but a republic modeled on an imagined ancient Hebrew republic in which the [[Sanhedrin]] was composed of "men, not chosen from among the Plebeians, but all most noble, commended by their honourable parentage, and the ancient ornaments of their family."  The Hebrew kings, were constitutional monarchs, beholden to the legislature, with the special power of holding power over the religious affairs of the nation.&lt;ref name="Tuck, Richard 1651, p. 169"/&gt;

Cunaeus was concerned that the Dutch Republic might fall as Athens and Rome had fallen, as a result of high living and selfish bickering among the leadership.  As a model for his nation that would prevent such a calamity, he described a Hebrew republic in which "the counsels of all provided for the safety of all; and the Cities, which were many, did not every one aim at its own dominion, but all used their best endeavors to defend the public Liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 167; Lea Campos Boralevi, Introduction to Petrus Cunaeus, De Republica Hebraeorum-The Commonwealth of the Hebrews (reprint of the original edition and of the English translation), Florence, 1996, p.XXXVIII-XXXIX
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Republic, as Cunaeus saw it,  was a virtuous community of republican small-hold farmers, kept that way by the Biblical law that  every fiftieth (Jubilee) year all land transactions become null with the property returning to the family of the original owner.  In this way,  "all were equally provided for; which is the prime care of good Governours in every common-wealth," a system that insures that "the wealth of some might not lead to the oppression of the rest; nor the people change their course, and turn their minds form their innocent labors to any new and strange employment." &lt;ref name="Tuck, Richard 1651, p. 168"&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;   For Cunaeus, manufacturing and commerce led to moral corruption of all kinds, the collapse of virtuous republican government among them.  Virtue was equated with material simplicity, small-hold farmers, and an egalitarian distribution of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 168-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunaeus closed the book with an appeal for tolerance and sympathy towards contemporary Jews.&lt;ref name="Tuck, Richard 1651, p. 168"/&gt;

'''Polidoro Virgili''', commonly Latinised as '''Polydorus Vergilius''', or anglicised as '''Polydore Vergil''' (or '''Virgil'''), and often known as '''Polydore Vergil of Urbino''' (''c.'' 1470 – 18 April 1555) was an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar, historian, priest and diplomat, who spent most of his life in [[Kingdom of England|England]]. He is particularly remembered for his works the ''Proverbiorum libellus'' (1498), a collection of Latin proverbs; ''De inventoribus rerum'' (1499), a history of discoveries and origins; and the ''Anglica Historia'' (drafted by 1513; printed 1534), an influential history of England. He has been dubbed the "Father of [[History of England|English History]]".&lt;ref&gt;Galdieri 1993, pp. 316–17. This sobriquet has also been assigned to other historians, notably the Venerable [[Bede]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vergil is sometimes referred to in contemporary documents as '''Polydore Vergil Castellensis''' or '''Castellen''', leading some to assume that he was a kinsman of his patron, Cardinal [[Adriano Castellesi]]. However, it is more likely that the alias simply indicates that he was in Castellesi's service.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Urbino, targe virgilio vecchietti e polidoro virgili e balcone.JPG|thumb|right|Vergil's family home and alleged birthplace in [[Urbino]], marked with a plaque (the lower of the two)]]
===Early life in Italy===
Vergil was born at [[Urbino]], or more probably at [[Fermignano]], within the [[Duchy of Urbino]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Connell 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Giorgio di Antonio, owned a dispensary. His grandfather, Antonio Virgili, "a man well skilled in medicine and astrology",&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Virgil, Polydore |volume=28 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; had taught philosophy at the [[University of Paris]]; as did Polydore's own brother, Giovanni-Matteo Virgili,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; at [[Ferrara]] and [[Padua]]. Another brother, Girolamo, was a merchant trading with England.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 1, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The niece of Polydore Vergil, Faustina, married Lorenzo Borgogelli, count of [[Fano]], from whom descend the family of Borgogelli Virgili.

Polydore was educated at the [[University of Padua]], and possibly at [[Bologna]]. He was ordained by 1496.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably in the service of [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], [[Duke of Urbino]], before 1498, as in the dedication of his ''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (April 1498) he styles himself Guido's client.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; His second book, ''De Inventoribus Rerum'', was dedicated to Guido's tutor, Lodovico Odassio, in August 1499.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

At some point prior to 1502 Polydore entered the service of [[Pope Alexander VI]].

===Move to England===
[[File:The Music School, Cathedral Green - Wells - geograph.org.uk - 985810.jpg|thumb|right|The "Old Archdeaconry" in Wells, traditionally identified as Vergil's residence there. Now the Music School of [[Wells Cathedral School]]]]
In 1502, Vergil travelled to England as the deputy of Cardinal [[Adriano Castellesi]] in the office of Collector of [[Peter's Pence]], and, in practice, the Cardinal's agent in a variety of affairs. In October 1504 he was enthroned [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] as proxy for Adriano;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and in 1508 he himself was installed as [[List of Archdeacons of Wells|Archdeacon of Wells]]. He probably spent little time in Wells, but was active as the Chapter's representative in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 8–9, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated a set of hangings for the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of [[Wells Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He held other ecclesiastical [[sinecure]]s, including, from 1503, the living of [[East Langton|Church Langton]], Leicestershire; from 1508 [[Prebendary|prebends]] in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Hereford Cathedral]]s; and from 1513 the prebend of Oxgate in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

As an established author, and a representative of Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] learning, Vergil was received in England as a minor celebrity, and was welcomed at court by King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the King's behest that he began work on his ''Anglica Historia'', a new history of England, probably as early as 1505.

On 22 October 1510, he was [[Naturalization|naturalised]] English.

Early in 1515 – through the intrigues of [[Andrea Ammonio]], who sought the subcollectorship for himself – an ill-judged letter from Vergil was intercepted by the authorities. It contained what was read as implied criticism of both [[Thomas Wolsey]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and as a result Vergil was imprisoned in April in the [[Tower of London]]. His supporters and advocates included [[Pope Leo X]], who wrote to the King on his behalf.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; From prison Vergil wrote to Wolsey, begging that the approaching Christmas season – a time which witnessed the restitution of a world – might also see his pardon: his letter's tone has been described as "almost blasphemous".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He was released before Christmas 1515, but never regained his subcollectorship.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return visits to Italy and death===
Although Vergil lived predominantly in England from 1502 onwards, he paid several return visits to Urbino, in 1513–14, 1516–17 and 1533–4. In 1534, [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]], in recognition of his literary achievements, admitted Vergil and his family to the ranks of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Negroni, "Punctualizzazioni archivistiche sulla famiglia Virgili di Urbino", in Bacchielli 2003, pp. 39–51, at p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1546 Vergil resigned the Archdeaconry of Wells to the Crown, perhaps in anticipation of his retirement to Italy. He was licensed to return to Urbino in 1550, and probably left England for the last time in the summer of 1553. He died in Urbino on 18 April 1555.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Commemoration==
Vergil was buried in [[Urbino Cathedral]], in the chapel of St Andrew which he himself had endowed. In 1613, it was agreed that a memorial stone should be set over his tomb. This was eventually put in place in 1631, with an inscription stating that his fame would "live for ever in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Negroni, "Punctualizzazioni archivistiche", pp. 42–5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed to have been lost when the cathedral was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1789.

Vergil's family home in Urbino (now a property of the [[University of Urbino]]) is marked by a plaque; and there is also a bust of him in the city, unveiled in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchielli 2003, pp. 75, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vergil is among the worthies whose portraits were painted in ''c''.1618–19 on the frieze in what is now the Upper Reading Room of the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.R.A. |last=Bullard |title=Talking heads: the Bodleian frieze, its inspiration, sources, designer and significance |journal=Bodleian Library Record |volume=14 |date=1991–94 |pages=461–500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Perotti's ''Cornucopiae''===
Vergil published his first work in 1496. This was an edition of [[Niccolò Perotti]]’s ''Cornucopiae latinae linguae'', a commentary on [[Martial]]'s ''Epigrams''.

===''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (''Adagia'')===
Vergil's ''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (Venice, 1498), retitled in later editions as ''Adagiorum Liber'', and often known as the ''Adagia'', was a collection of Latin proverbs. It was the first such collection printed, preceding the similar ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]] by two years. The initial controversy between the two authors that arose from their rival claims for [[Scientific priority|priority]] (Erasmus still believed as late as 1533 that his work had been the earlier) gave place to a sincere friendship.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; The first edition of Vergil's work contained 306 proverbs taken from classical sources. A second, expanded, edition appeared in 1521: it contained a further series of 431 Biblical proverbs, and was dedicated to Wolsey's follower, [[Richard Pace]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This edition is preceded by an interesting letter sent in June 1519, which gives the names of many of Vergil's English friends, including [[Thomas More]], [[William Warham]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[Cuthbert Tunstall]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The ''Adagia'' ran through about 20 editions down to 1550.

===''De Inventoribus Rerum''===
Vergil's ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' was published in 1499, having been written in only three months. It was a history of origins and inventions, describing in three books the "first begetters" of all human activities. Book I investigated the origin of the gods and the word "God", along with such matters as the creation, marriage, religion and learning. Book II covered, among other topics, the origins of law, time, military science, money, precious metals and art. Book III covered, again among other topics, the origins of agriculture, architecture, towns, theatres, tools and materials, maritime navigation, commerce and prostitution.

For the edition of 1521, Vergil added five more books, devoted to the ''initia institorum rei Christianae'', i.e. the origins of Christian rites and institutions. He probably thought that this addition would be a popular one, but it was also a concession towards critics who had labelled the ''De Inventoribus'' a work of heretics and depravity. The work nonetheless included criticisms of monks, priestly celibacy, indulgences, and of the policies and constitutional status of the papacy. As a consequence it was placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (papal list of prohibited books) in 1564: an expurgated text, sanctioned by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], was published in 1576.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

''De Inventoribus'' was, however, exceedingly popular, and was quickly translated into French (1521), German (1537), English (1546) and Spanish (1551).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Thirty Latin editions had been published by the time Vergil died in 1555; and the work eventually ran to around 70 Latin editions, and another 35 translations.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 52, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The English edition of 1546 was an abridgement made by [[Thomas Langley (priest)|Thomas Langley]], which also proved highly successful and was reprinted several times.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 66–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is notable for the immense industry that went into its compilation, and the range of ancient and modern writers on which Vergil was able to draw.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 54–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gildas …de calamitate, excidio et conquestu Britanniae''===
In 1525 Vergil published an edition of [[Gildas]]' 6th-century history, ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', probably at [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated it to [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], [[Bishop of London]]. This was the first critical edition of a British historical text.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 17, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galdieri 1993, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; In publishing it, Vergil reflected a growing interest in post-classical texts among German and Italian scholars. This interest sprang mainly from self-conscious nationalism which makes it curious at least that a foreigner chose a text about Britain. Vergil did, however, have a motive; this project provided a background for his anti-Arthurian position. Tunstall supplied one of the source [[manuscript]]s (hence the dedication), and the work of editing was undertaken by Vergil and [[Robert Ridley]]. Their editing was for the most part conscientious, although they rearranged certain words in the interests of clarity, and also suppressed a few [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] passages.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dialogus de Prodigiis''===
Vergil's ''Dialogus de Prodigiis'' was written in 1526–7, and printed in 1531. It was dedicated to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This treatise, in three books, takes the form of a Latin dialogue between Vergil and his Cambridge friend Robert Ridley&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; on the subject of the natural and the supernatural, and whether credence should be given to such alleged phenomena as prodigious events and portents. The setting for the dialogue is the open air, at Vergil's country house near London. Vergil's role is to state the problems and supply the historical illustrations; his friend's to explain, rationalise and depreciate as best he can.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 34–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''De Prodigiis'' also achieved great popularity, and was translated into Italian (1543), English (1546) and Spanish (1550).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===''Anglica Historia''===
Vergil's history of England, the ''Anglica Historia'', was begun at the instigation of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], perhaps as early as 1505. This first version was completed in 1512–13. However, the work was not published until 1534; and four distinct versions can therefore be identified:

# Manuscript written in 1512–13: covering events up to 1513 (MS)
# First edition, Basle, 1534, [[Folio (printing)|folio]]; covering events up to 1509 (A)
# Second edition, Basle, 1546, folio: covering events up to 1509 (B)
# Third edition, Basle, 1555, folio: covering events up to 1537 (C)

The manuscript version is now held in the [[Vatican Library]]. Comprising two volumes, it was presented to the ducal library at Urbino in 1613 by Vergil's grand-nephew. Although he stated in prefatory notes that the manuscript was written in Vergil's hand – an assessment fully supported by the [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] evidence – it was at one time sometimes attributed to [[Federico Veterani]]. This misunderstanding arose from a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in the second volume, in a different hand, stating that "I, Federico Veterani, wrote the whole work". A possible explanation is that Vergil left it in the care of Veterani, who inscribed the colophon to associate it with his other treasures so that it would not be lost or damaged during the [[Papal invasion in Urbino]] in 1516. Further isolated notes in Veterani's hand, nearly all directions to a binder or printer, are found throughout the manuscript. The most plausible interpretation of the evidence is that Vergil intended to present a fine manuscript (rather than a printed book) to Henry VIII, and commissioned the work from Veterani, the most famous copyist of the day. However, no such copy by Veterani is known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript version of the work was divided into 25 books. Books I-VII described the early history of England up to the Norman conquest; Book VIII dealt with the reigns of [[William the Conqueror|William I]] and [[William II of England|William II]]; and the following books covered one reign per book, ending in book XXV which dealt with the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to 1513.

In 1534 the first printed version of the work appeared, a folio with decorations from [[John Bebel]]’s press in [[Basle]]. While this edition was broadly similar to the manuscript, it incorporated substantial changes, and it seems that Vergil effectively made a fresh start using the manuscript as a guideline. The rewriting appears to have taken place between 1521 and 1524 (based on one reference to his having been archdeacon of Wells for fourteen years; and another allusion to "this day, which is 1524"). Book VII of the manuscript was now split into two parts, the new book VIII running from the death of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] to 1066; while the reigns of the first two [[Normans|Norman]] kings, previously covered in a single book, were also divided between two books. The work had therefore gained two books, but now ended with book XXVI in 1509, no longer extending into the reign of Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 81–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition appeared in 1546. This version also ended in 1509, but was much revised. The revisions included rewordings for political reasons, a greater emphasis on the civic history of London, and stylistic improvements of the Latin for European readers.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 82–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third edition was published in 1555, the year of Vergil's death. In this case the revisions were minor and largely stylistic. However, Vergil added a new book (XXVII) giving an account of Henry VIII's reign to 1537, and which included a highly critical portrait of Wolsey. Vergil claimed that most of his work on the last book was done contemporaneously, and that the work was interrupted by a visit to Italy. This must refer to his visit of 1533–4, and the entire period from 1530 to 1537 is in fact treated cursorily. [[Denys Hay]] finds it reasonable to suppose that at first Vergil planned this book to describe events up to 1530, but that he postponed the publication of it due to the political uncertainties in England, enabling him to extend the terminal date.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vergil drew on an impressively wide range of sources for his work, including published books and [[Oral tradition|oral testimony]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have been diligent in collecting materials, and to have drawn on the work of foreign as well as English historians. For this reason, he remarked, the English, Scots and French would find things reported in his pages far differently from the way they were used to hearing them within their own countries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In his search for information he applied to [[James IV of Scotland]] for a list of the Scottish kings and their annals; but not even his friendship with [[Gavin Douglas]] could make him accept the historical theories of the latter, who traced the pedigree of the Scots down from the banished son of an [[King of Athens|Athenian king]] and [[Scota]], daughter of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Vergil opened the ''Anglica Historia'' with a passage heavily influenced by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Britannia omnis...diuiditur in partes quatuor: quarum unam incolunt Angli, aliam Scoti, tertiam Vualli, quartam Cornubienses. Hi omnes uel lingua; uel moribus seu institutis inter se differunt.&lt;ref&gt;Polydore Vergil, ''Anglicae Historiae'' (Basel 1557), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In an early English translation, this is rendered as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole Countrie of Britaine...is divided into iiij partes ; wherof the one is inhabited of [[English people|Englishmen]], the other of [[Scottish people|Scottes]], the third of [[Welsh people|Wallshemen]], and the fowerth of [[Cornish people|Cornishe people]]. Which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, either in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Polydore Vergil's English history, from an early translation: Vol. I |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=36 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1846 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The opening lines to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic War]]'' read in English as follows: "Gaul as a whole is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts (in ours Gauls), the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other works===
Vergil published a ''Commentariolum in Dominicam Precem'' ("Commentary on the Lord's Prayer") at Basle in 1525, accompanying an edition of the ''De Inventoribus Rerum''. His comments owed much to Erasmus' ''Precatio Dominica in septem portiones distributa'' (1523).&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 31–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Erasmus' request, Vergil worked on a translation from the Greek of [[Dio Chrysostom]]'s ''De Perfecto Monacho'', which he published in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted in 1541 and 1550.

In 1545, he published his last work, the ''Dialogorum libri'', a collection of Latin dialogues, divided into three parts as ''De patientia'', ''De vita perfecta'', and ''De veritate et mendacio''.&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 45–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==
In continental Europe, Vergil is principally remembered for the ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' and the ''Adagia'': these are the works which secured his reputation before he ever came to England, and which he himself regarded as his masterpieces, writing "I, Polydore, was the first of the Romans to treat of these two matters".&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1949, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''De Inventoribus'' receives a mention, for example, in [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605–15).&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 75–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, however, Vergil is more often remembered as author of the ''Anglica Historia''. The work is an important [[primary source]] in its own right for the period 1460–1537, and as a [[secondary source]] continued to exert an influence on English [[historiography]] into the 19th century. It provided the chronicler [[Edward Hall]] with much of his sense of 15th-century English history, and so fed into the [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay 1952, pp. 127–8, 131–5, 155–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galdieri 1993, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly controversial element of Vergil's work in England was the scepticism he expressed – first in his edition of Gildas, and then in the ''Anglica Historia'' – towards the traditional account of the early history of Britain derived from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], and in particular towards the question of the [[historicity]] of [[King Arthur]]. This criticism touched a patriotic nerve with the antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who responded forcefully, first in an unpublished tract, written perhaps in 1536, the ''Codrus sive Laus et Defensio Gallofridi Arturii contra Polydorum Vergilium'' ("Codrus", a reference to Vergil, was a type-name drawn from [[Juvenal]] for an offensive hack-poet); and afterwards in a longer published treatment, the ''Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britannia'' (1544).&lt;ref&gt;Carley 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carley, James P., ed. |title=De uiris illustribus: On Famous Men |location=Toronto and Oxford |year=2010 |pages=xlii, cxv–cxxvii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leland was critical of Vergil's views in the ''Assertio'', he treated his opponent with respect, acknowledging his intelligence and his mastery of Latin style.

On another contentious issue, Vergil came down in favour of the claims of the [[University of Cambridge]] to be a more ancient foundation than the [[University of Oxford]]. When this was mentioned in a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1628, the [[Oxonian]] [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Littleton of Mounslow|Edward Littleton]] sneered, "What have we to do with Polydore Vergil? One [[Virgil|Vergil]] was a poet, the other a liar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.R. |last=Woolf |authorlink=Daniel Woolf |title=Reading History in Early Modern England |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=24 |isbn=0521780462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other English readers also reacted vehemently to what seemed to be criticisms of their national history. [[John Bale]] in 1544 accused Vergil of "polutynge our Englyshe chronycles most shamefullye with his Romishe lyes and other Italyshe beggerye".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Connell 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous contemporary described him as "that most rascall dogge knave in the worlde", claiming that "he had the randsackings of all the Englishe lybraryes, and when he had extracted what he pleased he burnt those famous [[vellum|velome]] manuscripts, and made himself father to other mens workes".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hay 1952, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; This charge of burning manuscripts was widely reported. [[John Caius]] in 1574, for example, asserted that Vergil had "committed as many of our ancient and manuscript historians to the flames as would have filled a waggon, that the faults of his own work might pass undiscovered".&lt;ref&gt;Translated in {{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxiii }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] in 1622 similarly accused him of having "burned and embezeled the best and most ancient Records and Monuments of our Abbeies, Priories, and Cathedrall Churches, under colour … of making search for all such monuments, manusc. records, Legier bookes, &amp;c. as might make for his purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peacham |first=Henry |title=The Compleat Gentleman |place=London |year=1622 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one of Peacham's contemporaries, the Leicestershire antiquary [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]], cast Vergil in a more positive light, describing him as "a man of singular invention, good judgement, and good reading, and a true lover of antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-last=Ellis |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Vergil's importance to English historiography finally began to be acknowledged, as "historians of Tudor England realized the scope of his achievement in the ''Anglica Historia''".&lt;ref&gt;Galdieri 1993, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger of Wendover''' (died 6 May 1236), probably a native of [[Wendover]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], was an [[England|English]] [[English historians in the Middle Ages|chronicler]] of the 13th century.

At an uncertain date he became a [[monk]] at [[St Albans Abbey]]; afterwards he was appointed prior of the [[Belvoir Priory|cell of Belvoir]], but he forfeited this dignity in the early years of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], having been found guilty of wasting the endowments. His latter years were passed at St Albans, where he died on 6 May 1236.

==Biography==
Roger is the first in the series of important chroniclers who worked at St Albans. His best-known [[chronicle]], called the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' (''Flowers of History''), is based in large part on material which already existed at St Albans. The actual nucleus of the early part of Roger’s ''Flowers of History'' is supposed to have been the compilation of John de Cella (also known as [[John of Wallingford (d. 1214)|John of Wallingford]]), who was abbot of St Albans from 1195 to 1214, although that is inconclusive.

John’s work started from the year 1188, and was revised and continued by Roger up to 1235, the year before his death. Roger claims in his preface to have selected "from the books of catholic writers worthy of credit, just as flowers of various colours are gathered from various fields." Hence he called his work ''Flores Historiarum''—a title appropriated in the 14th century to a long compilation by various hands. Begun at St Albans based upon the Chronicle of [[Matthew Paris]], it was finally completed at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] continuing to the year 1326. The work was long ascribed to one "[[Matthew of Westminster]]", but it is now known that no actual chronicler of that name ever existed.

Roger's work, like that of most chroniclers, is, valued not so much for what he culled from previous writers as for its full and lively narrative of contemporary events, from 1216 to 1235,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/211/0919.html Volume I, Chapter IX, Section 19] of ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]''&lt;/ref&gt; including the sealing of [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/runnymede.html Signing of Magna Carta, Runneymede, 1215]&lt;/ref&gt; An example being his description of [[John of England|King John]]'s troops action in the north during the bitter war at the end of his reign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole land was covered with these limbs of the devil like locusts, who assembled to blot out every thing from the face of the earth: for, running about with drawn swords and knives, they ransacked towns, houses, cemeteries, and churches, robbing everyone, sparing neither women nor children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGlynn|first=Sean|title =King John and the French invasion of England |journal=BBC History Magazine| publisher=Bristol Magazines Ltd|issn=1469-8552|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Revelation of St Nicholas to a monk of Evesham'' was composed in 1196 but the author is unknown. In an abridged form, it is found in Roger of Wendover’s ''Flores Historiarum'' under the year 1196. It is a curious religious allegory, treating the pilgrimage of a soul from death through purgatory and paradise to heaven. The monk, conducted by [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]], is taken from place to place in purgatory, where he meets and converses with persons of various ranks, who relate their stories and their suffering. From purgatory he advances slowly to paradise, and finally reaches the gates of heaven; after which he awakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/212/1310.html Volume II, Chapter XIII, Section 10] of ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Roger's work is known to us through one thirteenth-century manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] ([[Francis Douce|Douce]] manuscript 207), a mutilated 14th century copy in the [[British Library]] ([[Cotton library|Cotton]] manuscript Otho B. v.), and the edition prepared by [[Matthew Paris]] which forms the first part of that writer's ''Chronica Majora''&lt;ref&gt;See Paris, ed. [[Henry Richards Luard]], [[Rolls Series]], seven volumes).&lt;/ref&gt; The best edition of Roger's works is that of [[H. O. Coxe]] (four volumes, London, 1841–44); there is another (covering the material from 1154) in the Rolls Series by H. G. Hewlett (three volumes, 1886–89).

'''Sharp power''' is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country.  Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.  

Sharp power is distinguished from [[soft power]], which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion.  Soft power policies can include [[student exchange program|student exchanges]] and the sponsoring of [[Cultural diplomacy | cultural and sporting events]].  Sharp power is also distinct from [[hard power]], which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions.  Hard power can include [[war | military force]], [[economic sanctions]], and [[coercive diplomacy|diplomatic threats]].  

The term "sharp power" was coined in November of 2017 by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and published in an article in [[Foreign Affairs | Foreign Affairs Magazine]], to describe aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Sharp Power:  How Authoritarian States Project Influence|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-11-16/meaning-sharp-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig|date=Nov 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded [[RT (TV network) | RT News Network]] and the Chinese state-sponsored [[Confucius Institute | Confucius Institute educational partnerships]] as examples of sharp power.  According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them."  

Since 2018, the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings.  Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spokesman addresses Western charges of China using 'sharp power'.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLe5ZF6qeX8|publisher=China Global Television Network|date=Mar 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11779">[[Image:Stocking Frame.jpg|thumb|right|Stocking frame at [[Ruddington]] Framework Knitters' Museum ]]
A '''stocking frame''' was a mechanical [[knitting machine]] used in the [[textiles]] industry. It was invented by [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] of [[Calverton, Nottinghamshire|Calverton]] near [[Nottingham]] in 1589. Its use, known traditionally as '''framework knitting, ''' was the first major stage in the mechanisation of the textile industry, and played an important part in the early history of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It was adapted to knit cotton and to do ribbing, and by 1800 had been adapted as a [[Lace machine|lace making machine]].

==Description==
[[File:Maschenbildung 1.jpg|thumb|Six stages in the knitting machine cycle]]
Lee's machine consisted of a stout wooden frame. It did straight knitting, not tubular knitting. It had a separate needle for each loop - these were low carbon steel bearded needles where the tips were reflexed and could be depressed onto a hollow, closing the loop. The needles were supported on a needle bar that passed back and forth, to and from the operator. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar. The first machine had eight needles per inch and was suitable for worsted. The next version had 16 needles per inch and was suitable for silk.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|pp=12,13}}

The mechanical movements:&lt;ref name="Freer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freer|first1=Wendy|title=Framework Knitting|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWfzzfjMa6k&amp;t=312s|publisher=Leicestershire Industrial History Society|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The needle bar goes forward; the open needles clear the web.
#The weft thread is laid on the needles; the jack sinkers descend and form loops.
#The weft thread is pushed down by the divider bar.
#The jack sinkers come forward pulling the thread into the beard of the open needles.
#The presser bar drops, the needle loops close and the old row of stitches is drawn off the needle.
#The jack sinkers come down in front of the knitting and pull it up so the process can begin again.

==History==
[[File:Lee's knitting frame.jpg|thumb|Stocking frame]]
The machine imitated the movements of hand knitters. Lee demonstrated the operation of the device to [[Queen Elizabeth I]], hoping to obtain a [[patent]], but she refused, fearing the effects on hand-knitting industries. The original frame had eight needles to the inch, which produced only coarse fabric. Lee later improved the mechanism with 20 needles to the inch. By 1598 he was able to knit stockings from [[silk]], as well as wool, but was again refused a patent by [[James I of England|James I]]. Lee moved to France, under the patronage of [[Henri IV]], with his workers and his machines, but was unable to sustain his business. He died in Paris around 1614. Most of his workers returned to [[England]] with their frames, which were sold in [[London]].&lt;ref name="VW-Lee"/&gt;

The commercial failure of Lee's design might have led to a dead-end for the knitting machine, but John Ashton, one of Lee's assistants, made a crucial improvement by adding the mechanism known as a "divider".&lt;ref name="VW-Lee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rev. William  Lee, inventor of the Stocking Frame|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/technology/inventors/lee.html|website=www.victorianweb.org|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is used after the jack sinkers have pulled down a large loop over all the needles, and the sinker bar has separated out the loop, the dividers are rested on the loop to give the bearded needles guidance as they are pulled forward.

==Development==
A thriving business built up with the exiled [[Huguenot]] silk-spinners who had settled in the village of [[Spitalfields]] just outside the city of London. In 1663, the [[Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters]] was issued a royal charter. By about 1785, however, demand was rising for cheaper stockings made of [[cotton]]. The frame was adapted but became too expensive for individuals to buy; thus, wealthy men bought the machines and hired them out to the knitters, providing the materials and buying the finished product. With increasing competition, they ignored the standards set by the Chartered Company. Frames were introduced to [[Leicester]] by Nicholas Alsop in around 1680, who encountered resistance and at first worked secretly in a cellar in Northgate Street, taking his own sons and the children of near relatives as apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gough Nichols]], 'Notes on ancient hosiery', Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society, Hinckley, July 1864; R.A. McKinley (Ed.), (Occupations: The hosiery industry), 'The City of Leicester: Social and administrative history, 1660-1835', ''A History of the County of Leicester, IV: The City of Leicester'' (1958), pp. 153-200; [[James Thompson (journalist)|J. Thompson]], ''The History of Leicester in the 18th Century'' (Leicester &amp; London 1871), pp. 254-57.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1728, the Nottingham magistrates refused to accept the authority of the London Company, and the centre of the trade moved northwards to Nottingham, which also had a [[lace]] making industry.

The breakthrough with cotton stockings came in 1758 when [[Jedediah Strutt]] introduced an attachment for the frame which produced what became known as the "Derby rib". The Nottingham frameworkers found themselves increasingly short of raw materials. Initially they used thread spun in [[India]], but this was expensive and required doubling. [[Lancashire]] yarn was spun for [[fustian]] and varied in texture. They tried spinning cotton themselves but, being used to the long fibres of wool, experienced great difficulty.  Meanwhile, the [[Gloucester]] spinners, who had been used to a much shorter wool, were able to handle cotton and their frameworkers were competing with the Nottingham producers.

==Influence on the Industrial Revolution==
It was then that [[Richard Arkwright]] arrived with his new experimental spinning machinery. He initially built a works operated by horsepower but it was evident that six to eight would be needed at a time, changed every half-hour. He moved to [[Cromford]] and set up what became known as the [[water frame]]. Strutt, as his partner, set up mills at [[Belper]] and [[Milford, Derbyshire|Milford]]. Thus the area joined Nottingham in producing cotton stockings, while [[Derby]], with its mills originated by [[John Lombe]] continued largely with silk; Leicester, a farming area, continued with [[wool]].

For mechanical power to be applied to a stocking frame, it had to be adapted for rotary motion. In 1769, Samuel Wise, a clockmaker, took out a patent for changing the hand frame into a rotary. In Nottingham's case, steam coal was easily available from the Nottinghamshire coalfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellors|first1=Robert|editor1-last=Nicholson|editor1-first=A P|title=In and about Nottinghamshire|date=1908|publisher=Nottinghamshire History:Resources for Genealogist|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/books/mellors1908/stockingframe.htm|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1812, there were estimated to be over 25,000 frames in use, most of them in the three counties, and the frame had come back to Calverton.

==Derby Rib machine==
The [[Derby Rib|Derby Rib machine]] was invented in 1757 by [[Jedediah Strutt|Strutt]]. It consisted of an extra set of bearded needles that operated vertically, taking the loop and reversing them. This allowed a plain and [[Purl stitch|purl]] knit to be used, and led to [[Ribbing (knitting)|ribbing]] and a tighter more flexible fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jedediah Strutt|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TEXstrutt.htm|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do a 3:1 rib, there would be one vertical needle after every third horizontal needle.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|p=18}}

==Lace making==
Lacey knits can be achieved by slipping a stitch, picking up a stitch or knitting two together. On a frame, a tickler wire could realise individual loops and create a run that would be picked up by hand. The frame was modified by adding a tickler bar and a tuck presser, to allow held and tuck stitches. Here the weft was held in the beard and carried up to the next course where two threads were passed together. Messrs Morris and Betts took a patent (807) in 1764 on a stitch transfer devise where threads from one needle were passed to another. With tuck stitches, this a created 'eyelet holes'. Partial stitch transfer produced a marker stitch.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|p=19}}

In 1764, a profound change was made to the stocking frame that enabled it to produce weft-knitted nets. Hammond, the attributed inventor, used ticklers to stitch-transfer from one needle to the third one along crossing over two intermediate needles creating a cross stitch. He also used a tickler to move two stitches two to the right, and then two to the left in a double cross stitch, [[Valenciennes lace]]. To do this the tickler bar was detached from the frame and attached to 'dogs', that is, jointed arms. This allowed forward motion to scoop, and sideways motion to shog. New inventions were patented: Frost's tickler net of 1769, the two plain net of 1777 and the square net of 1781, and their patents were fiercely defended. Harvey changed the shape of the tickler wires to avoid one in his pin machine. This became popular in Lyon and Paris where 2000 frames were in use in 1800.{{Sfn|Earnshaw|1986|p=21}}

In 1803 cotton was used with silk, as [[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish|Houldsworth]]s were producing 300 count cotton.{{Sfn|Earnshaw|1986|p=24}}

==Postscript==
A legend later developed that Lee had invented the first machine in order to get revenge on a lover who had preferred to concentrate on her knitting rather than attend to him. A painting illustrating this story was once displayed in the [[Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters|Stocking Framer's Guild]] hall in London. In 1846 the Victorian artist [[Alfred Elmore]] produced a variation on the story in his popular painting ''The Invention of the Stocking Loom'', in which Lee is depicted pondering his idea as he watches his wife knitting (Nottingham Castle Museum).

'''Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider''' (November 19, 1937 &amp;ndash; August 31, 1967), better known as '''Tania''' or '''Tania the Guerrilla''', was an [[Argentine]]-born [[East German]] [[communist]] revolutionary and spy who played a prominent role in the [[Cuban government]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]] and in various Latin American revolutionary movements.&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4477656.ece Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider: the woman who died with Che Guevara] by Christine Toomey, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only woman to fight alongside [[Marxist]] guerrillas under [[Che Guevara]] during the [[Bolivian Insurgency (1966&amp;ndash;1967)]] where she was killed in an ambush by [[CIA]]-assisted [[Bolivian Army]] Rangers.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;

==Early life (1937–52)==
Bunke was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the daughter of German communists Erich Bunke and Nadia Bider (who was of [[Poles|Polish]] origin).&lt;ref name = "DT02" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Her father Erich had joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in 1928 and fled with his wife to Argentina when the [[Nazis]] came to power in 1933.&lt;ref name = "DT02" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Her parents immediately joined the Argentine Communist Party, ensuring that Tamara and her brother Olaf would grow up in a highly charged political atmosphere.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Their family home in Buenos Aires was often used for meetings, helping refugees, hiding publications and occasionally stashing weapons.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; 

As a youth Bunke was a keen athlete and an excellent student, who developed a particular fondness for the [[folk music]] of South America.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; However, in 1952, the family returned to East Germany and settled in [[Stalinstadt]] (later named Eisenhüttenstadt).&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;  Bunke did not learn German until her adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bunke-tamara-1937-1967|title=Bunke, Tamara (1937–1967)|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2017|website=encyclopedia.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University years (1953–59)===
Bunke thrived in her new environment and began studying [[political science]] at [[Humboldt University]] in [[East Berlin]]. She soon joined the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]'s youth organization, the Free German Youth (FGY).&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; In addition, she also joined the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], allowing her to attend the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], Moscow and finally [[Havana, Cuba]].&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Her keen interest in and familiarity with Latin America, along with her linguistic abilities (she spoke fluent Russian, French, English, Spanish and German),&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; soon saw her translating on behalf of the FGY's International Department. In this capacity she entertained and translated for the growing stream of visitors from Cuba, following the victory of the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

==Cuba and Che Guevara (1960–64)==
[[File:TamaraBunke2.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Bunke as she first arrived in Cuba in 1961.]]

In 1960, at the age of 23, Bunke met the [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref name = "DT02" /&gt; Guevara was visiting the East German city of [[Leipzig]] with a Cuban trade delegation and Bunke, who considered him a hero of hers, was assigned to him as an [[Interpreting|interpreter]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Inspired by the [[Cuban Revolution]], of which Guevara had become an international icon, Bunke came to live in [[Cuba]] in 1961&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. She first sought out voluntary work, teaching and building homes and schools in the countryside.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Her Cuban hosts soon began to notice the efficiency, discipline and good-natured sense of service that she possessed. As a result, she participated in work brigades, the [[militia]], and the [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]].&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; She also worked in the [[Education in Cuba|Ministry of Education]], the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples, and the [[Women in Cuba|Federation of Cuban Women]].&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

Eventually she was selected for training to take part in Che's ill-fated guerrilla expedition to Bolivia entitled "Operation Fantasma". Guevara's goal was to spark a continent-wide revolutionary uprising into neighbouring [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]] and [[Chile]]; by creating "two, three, many [[Vietnam War|Vietnams]]" in order to challenge American [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; In preparation, Guevara assigned Bunke to be trained by Dariel Alarcón Ramírez (known by his nom de guerre ''Benigno'') in [[Pinar del Río]] in western Cuba.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Guevara wanted her taught self-defence, such as how to use a knife, a submachine gun and a pistol; and how to send and receive telegraph transmissions and coded messages by radio.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; It was during this period that she took the name "Tania" as her ''[[nom de guerre]]''. During her training in Cuba and later at a small farm on the outskirts of [[Prague]], Bunke impressed the Cubans with her intelligence, stamina, and skill for [[espionage]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Benigno for instance, has described her as "gracious, beautiful and kind, but also very tough."&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; She further endeared herself to the Cubans by entertaining them in the training camp by playing Argentine folk songs on [[accordion]] or [[guitar]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Moreover, as a very sociable person who could strike up friendships easily, the Cuban government realized that she possessed beneficial traits for her future work in Bolivia.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

==Bolivian insurgency (1964–67)==
[[File:TamaraBunke3.jpg|thumb|320px|During her years working for the Cuban government (1961&amp;ndash;1967), Bunke utilized various disguises. These included a Czech woman Marta Iriarte, Haydée González, and Vittoria Pancini, an Italian citizen travelling in Europe.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;]]
In October 1964, Bunke traveled to [[Bolivia]] under the name '''Laura Gutiérrez Bauer''', as a secret agent for Guevara's last campaign. Her first mission was to gather intelligence on Bolivia's political elite and the strength of its armed forces.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Posing as a right-wing folklore expert of Argentine background, she quickly found herself infiltrating high society and rubbing shoulders with the [[wikt:glitterati|glitterati]] of Bolivia's academic and official circles.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tania05"&gt;''Tania: Undercover with Che Guevara in Bolivia'', by Ulises Estrada, 2005, Ocean Press, {{ISBN|1-876175-43-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showing how high she was able to rise in [[La Paz]] society, she won the adoration of Bolivian President [[René Barrientos]], and even went on holiday with him to [[Peru]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; In order to maintain her cover, she also busied herself part-time with her explorations of folk music (producing one of the most valuable collections of Bolivian music in the process) and entered into a marriage of convenience with a young Bolivian to gain citizenship.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

Tactically, she was initially invaluable to Guevara's guerrillas because she used radio equipment hidden in a compartment behind the wall in her apartment to not only send coded messages to [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Havana]]; but to Guevara's guerrillas in the field by posing as a radiohost giving encoded relationship advice to fictitious lovelorn couples.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;  This radio program was called "Advice to Women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In late 1966 however, the unreliability of many of her comrades in the urban network set up to support Che's guerrillas forced Bunke to travel to their rural camp at Ñancahuazú on a number of occasions. On one of these trips, a captured Bolivian communist gave away a safe house where Tania's jeep was parked in which she had left her address book. As a result, her cover was blown, and she now had no other choice than to join Guevara's armed guerrilla campaign. In this capacity she was in charge of rationing food and monitoring radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; There continues to also be the allegation from fellow surviving guerrilla Benigno, that Bunke and Guevara had at some point become lovers in Bolivia; with Benigno remarking decades later in 2008 that "You could tell by the way they spoke so quietly and looked at each other when they were together near the end."&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;

Without Bunke as the guerrilla's contact to the outside world, the guerrillas then found themselves isolated. Bunke also soon found herself battling a high fever, a leg injury, and the painful effects of the [[Tunga penetrans|Chigoe flea]] parasite.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Consequently, Guevara decided to try to send a group of 16 other ailing combatants, including Bunke, out of the mountains.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

===Death===

}}

At 5:20 pm on August 31, 1967, the lead guerrilla column was ambushed while crossing the [[Río Grande (Bolivia)|Río Grande]] at Vado del Yeso.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Tania was waist-deep in the water, with her rifle held above her head, when she was shot through the arm and the lung and killed along with eight of her fellow insurgents in quick succession.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; Her body was then carried downstream and only recovered by the Bolivian army several days later on September 6. When her corpse was presented to Barrientos, it was decided that it would be buried in an unmarked grave with the rest of the guerrillas. However, the local campesino women demanded that, as a woman, she be given a proper Christian burial.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

When her death was announced over the radio, Guevara, still struggling through the jungles close by, refused to believe the news; suspecting it was army propaganda to demoralise him.&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt; Later, when [[Fidel Castro]] learned of her demise, he declared "Tania the guerrilla" a hero of the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;

===Remains===
After the research of biographer [[Jon Lee Anderson]] led to the 1997 discovery of Che Guevara's Bolivian remains, Bunke's remains were also tracked down to an unmarked grave in a small pit on the periphery of the [[Vallegrande]] army base on October 13, 1998. They were transferred to Cuba and were interred in the [[Che Guevara Mausoleum]] in the city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], alongside those of [[Che Guevara|Guevara]] himself and several other guerrillas killed during the [[Bolivian Insurgency (1966–1967)]].

==KGB, Stasi, and affair claims==
Since the time of her death there have been various conflicting rumors or allegations that she worked for the Soviet [[KGB]] and/or the East German [[Stasi]]; along with the claim that she and Che Guevara were lovers while in Bolivia, and that she may have even been carrying his child when she was killed&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;; this was finally refuted in 2017 by Dr. Abraham Baptista, who was in charge of the autopsy of both the Ché and Tamara Bunke.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proceso.com.mx/506707/hora-decir-murio-che&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 amidst unproven rumors and claims that Tamara worked for the KGB or East German Stasi, her 85-year-old mother Nadia Bunke travelled to Moscow to obtain a written statement from the successors to the KGB declaring that Bunke never worked for them.&lt;ref name = "DT02" /&gt; For their part the German government, which now holds the Stasi files, has also confirmed that it has no records on her.&lt;ref name = "DT02" /&gt;

Before Tania's mother Nadia Bunke died in 2003, she also managed to have the book ''[[Tania, the Woman Che Guevara Loved]]'' by Uruguayan author José A Friedl, removed from sale in Germany.&lt;ref name = "Guard05"&gt;[http://www.cpa.org.au/z-archive/g2005/1246review.html ''Tania: Undercover with Che Guevara in Bolivia''] A Book Review by Bob Briton, ''[[The Guardian, The Worker's Weekly|The Guardian]]'', January 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruled that the book contained defamatory allegations against Tamara Bunke; namely it repeated Stasi defector Günter Männel's rumor from the 1970s that Bunke and Guevara started an extra-marital affair in 1965 while training together in the Czech capital of [[Prague]].&lt;ref name = "Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt; However, although they both did receive instruction in Prague, they were never in the city at the same time.&lt;ref name = "Guard05" /&gt;

==Popular culture==
*During her involvement with the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] in 1974, [[Patty Hearst]] took on the alias "Tania."
*[[Minor planet]] [[2283 Bunke]], discovered in 1974 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]], is named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | pages = 186 | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2279+barto+1968+DL | isbn = 3-540-00238-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Venezuelan folk singer songwriter [[Ali Primera]] wrote a song titled Tania, commemorating Bunke and her dedication to revolution.
*Tania Bunke also appears intermittently in the first part of [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]'s 1972 music/theatre work ''Al gran sole carico d'amore''.
*[[Heidi Specogna]] filmed a documentary about her in 1991.
*Before unification, Bunke was a folk legend in [[East Germany]]. At one time, there were 200 youth clubs named after her.&lt;ref name = "DT02"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1388018/Mother-fights-Che-film-over-lover-claims.html Mother Fights Che Film Over 'Lover' Claims] by Tony Paterson &amp; Oliver Poole, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', March 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*She is portrayed by [[Franka Potente]] in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s 2008 biopic of [[Che Guevara]], entitled ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]''.

===In fiction===
*A 2007 novel by [[Chile]]an economist Sebastián Edwards entitled ''El misterio de las Tanias'' is inspired by Bunke's story.
*A character known as Tania Vunke appears in Chuck Pfarrers novel ''Killing Che''. In the story Tania is an East German KGB spy who falls in love with Guevara when she is supposed to be helping to kill him. Eventually she betrays the KGB to fight for Che and dies in battle.
*A fictionalized version of Bunke appears in the [[shared world]] anthology ''[[Heroes in Hell]]'', created by [[Janet Morris]].  Written in the 1980s, this version of Bunke incorporates what was then commonly believed about her work for the KGB and betraying Che to his death.  In this series, Bunke is working for one of [[Satan]]'s various intelligence agencies and is sent to find and (temporarily) assassinate Che, who is now running Hell's Dissidents.

'''Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|t|ən}}; 17 February 1900 – 17 September 1993) was a [[Canadian]] [[Classical antiquity|classical]] scholar and leading [[Latin]] [[prosopography|prosopographer]] of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Linderski1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerzy Linderski|title=Imperium Sine Fine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEtE8c1jGY4C|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|isbn=978-3-515-06948-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is especially noted for his definitive three-volume work, ''[[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton#Magistrates of the Roman Republic|Magistrates of the Roman Republic]]'' (1951-1986).&lt;ref name="Broughton1952"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton|title=The Magistrates of the Roman Republic: 99 B.C.-31 B.C|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXYGAQAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=American Philological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Broughton was born in 1900 in [[Corbetton, Ontario]]. He attended [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. There he received a [[B.A. degree|B.A.]] in 1921 with honors in classics. He earned his M.A. in 1922. After studying at the [[University of Chicago]], he was made a Rogers Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he received a [[Ph.D. degree|Ph.D.]] in Latin in 1928, having studied under the famed ancient historian [[Tenney Frank]] (1876-1939).

He began his teaching career at [[Victoria College, Toronto]].  Broughton would go on to teach at [[Amherst College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1928-1965) and, later, serve as [[George L. Paddison]] Professor of Latin at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1965-1971), where the [http://library.unc.edu/davis/epigraphy/ Library Epigraphy Room], created at his behest, remains a seminal resource. Although he retired from UNC in 1971 (then aged 71), he would continue to work and advise students until his death in 1993.&lt;ref name="Linderski1996"/&gt;

In 1931, he married [[Annie Leigh Hobson Broughton]] of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. They had two children, Margaret Broughton Tenney and [[T. Alan Broughton]] (b. 1936), a poet and pianist and professor ''emeritus'' of the [[University of Vermont]]. Mrs. Broughton died on September 19, 2005, in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brynmawr.edu/emeritus/obit.html#broughton&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Magistrates of the Roman Republic''==
Broughton's main scholarly work was his massive, three-volume ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (commonly abbreviated ''MRR''), published 1951 to 1986 and requiring more than 30 years to complete. The project provides an unparalleled accounting of the names of men elected to office during the [[Roman Republic]] and has become a standard reference work.  It provides a year-by-year list of all known office-holders, including not only the magistracies of the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' from [[Roman consul|consul]] to [[quaestor]], but also promagistracies and military commands in the [[Roman province|provinces]], [[legatus|legates]] (both official and ad hoc), military prefects, priesthoods, and special commissions. Each entry is documented with ancient sources and selected works of modern scholarship. An index by name, listing each man's known offices, appears in volume 2.

In 1953 the ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' was recognized with the [[Goodwin Award of Merit]] from the [[American Philological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin Award of Merit - Previous Winners http://apaclassics.org/awards-and-fellowships/goodwin-award-of-merit-previous-winners&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements and awards==
Broughton's career included a variety of academic appointments and awards: visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, Simon F. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow, holder of a Fulbright research grant to Italy and professor in charge of the School of Classical Studies of the [[American Academy in Rome]].

Broughton served as [[List of Presidents of the American Philological Association|president of the American Philological Association]] and as vice president of the [[International Federation of Societies of Classical Studies]] for 10 years. He was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], an honorary member of the [[Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies]], a corresponding member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and a corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]]. Three universities awarded him honorary LL.D. degrees: Johns Hopkins University in 1969, the University of Toronto in 1971 and UNC in 1974.

After Broughton's death in September 1993, a Colloquium was organised for November 1994 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in honour of his memory. The  papers delivered on this occasion, including those by eminent scholars such as [[T.P. Wiseman]], [[Erich S. Gruen]], and [[Ernst Badian]], later formed the basis of the honorific volume ''Imperium Sine Fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'', edited by [[Jerzy Linderski|J. Linderski]].

'''''U.S. Army Field Manual 30-31B''''' is an alleged classified appendix to a [[U.S. Army Field Manuals|U.S. Army Field Manual]] that describes top secret [[counter insurgency]] tactics. In particular, it identifies a "[[strategy of tension]]" involving violent attacks which are then blamed on radical left-wing groups in order to convince allied governments of the need for counter-action. It has been called the '''Westmoreland Field Manual''' because it is signed with the alleged signature of General [[William Westmoreland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A facsimile copy of FM30-31B then appeared a year later in Bangkok, Thailand,&lt;ref name="HR1"/&gt; and in various capitals of north African states.&lt;ref name="Triunfo"/&gt; In 1978, it appeared in various European magazines, including the Spanish ''Triunfo'' and ''El Pais''.&lt;ref name="HR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triunfo"/&gt; The Italian press picked up the ''Triunfo'' publication, and a copy was published in the October 1978 issue of ''L'Europeo''.&lt;ref name="HR1"/&gt;

A wide range of field manuals, including 30-31, can be accessed through websites that catalog U.S. field manuals. However, 30-31B is not among the field manuals published by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The "Westmoreland Field Manual" was mentioned in at least two parliamentary commissions reports of European countries, one about the Italian [[Propaganda Due]] masonic lodge,&lt;ref&gt;{{it}}

At a 1980 hearing of the House of Representatives [[Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], Subcommittee of Oversight, CIA officials testified that the document was a singularly effective forgery by the KGB and an example of Soviet covert action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title     = Operation Gladio - 1951
  | url       = http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/ops/gladio.htm

==Authenticity==
U.S. official sources, including the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|U.S. House Intelligence Committee]],&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; and the [[U.S. State Department]],&lt;ref name="USState"/&gt; state that it is a forgery. Peer Henrik Hansen, a scholar specializing in Cold War intelligence and stay-behind missions,&lt;ref name="Hansen 2006 pp. 685–701"&gt;{{cite web |author=Informa UK | title=“Upstairs and Downstairs”—The Forgotten CIA Operations in Copenhagen: Author information | url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600500483715 |access-date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also affirms that the document is a forgery.&lt;ref name="Hansen" /&gt;

The discovery in the early-1990s of [[Operation Gladio]] (NATO [[stay-behind]] networks) in [[Europe]] led to renewed debate as to whether or not the manual was fraudulent. According to [[Daniele Ganser]] who popularized the history of Gladio stay-behind networks, [[Licio Gelli]], the Italian leader of the anti-Communist [[Propaganda Due|P2]] [[Freemasonry|freemason]] [[Masonic Lodge|lodge]] told the BBC's [[Allan Francovich]] in the second of a three-part documentary, shown on BBC 2 on June 24, 1992, "The CIA gave it to me" and [[Ray S.

Ganser's work has been heavily criticized by Western scholars&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Bookshelf_11.htm ''The Intelligence Officer’s Bookshelf''] Hayden Peake, ''CIA,'' April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;, who have characterized it as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref name="Hansen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip H.

In almost three centuries of the Spanish Colonization Period, close to one thousand cities were founded in the Americas. These new towns were built in accordance to several legislative documents that were given by the Spanish Crown to regulate, among many other aspects in the American Colonies, the creation of new settlements. In order to assure a long lasting presence of the Spanish Crown, the command given to the Conquistadors was that the settlements were to be permanent so they could have a strategic role in the discovery, conquest and administration of the new world.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortiz|first=Alfonso|title=Damero|year=2007|publisher=FONSAL|location=Quito}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quito]] is one of the cities founded by the Spanish. It was located 2800 meters above sea level in a territory previously occupied by an indigenous population. One of the advantages this place offered was that, due to the complicated topography of creeks and mountains, it had favorable conditions for defending the city against a possible uprising of the aboriginal inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt;

== Foundation ==

[[File:First graphic of the layout of Colonial Quito.jpg|right|thumb|upright|First graphic of the layout of Colonial Quito]]It is not certain if [[Quito]] had a foundational plan as it was recommended by the [[Spanish Crown]] for every new [[Human settlement|settlement]]. However, its founders surely followed and adapted the instructions to the complicated terrain where they settled. All works had to start by the establishment of the Main Plaza and then extend the square grid and the streets so they would connect to gates and main roads leaving enough space for the growth of a future population.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt; The regularity of the Damero, as the square Spanish Grid was called, was broken by the creeks and elevations existing in this site. The blocks had to be made smaller and many of them rectangular when cut by a creek. Despite the efforts of the settlers to adapt this system to the site, many of the streets and allotments turned out having a very steep slope. This characteristic became one of the peculiarities of this Historical Center.

There is no clear consensus over the shape of the original allotments since the first plan that included this information was only published by 1887 by Gualberto Pérez, over three hundred years after the foundation. However, some studies suggest that every block was divided in eight allotments of 55 by 110 foot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schottelius|first=Justus Wolfran|title=La Fundación de Quito. Plan y Construcción de una Ciudad Colonial Hispanoamericana|year=1941|publisher=Archivo Municipal de Quito|location=Quito}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there were around three hundred houses in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ponce Leiva|first=Pilar|title=Descripción de la ciudad de San Francisco de Quito|year=1992|publisher=Abya Yala|location=Quito}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Development Era ==

[[File:1734 Plan of the City of Quito.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Plan Created by Dionisio Alcedo y Herrera and Found in the Archive of Indies.]]
The first graphical representation of the layout of the city is an anonymous draft dated 1573 made for the [[Spanish Crown]]. It situates the main elements of the city, but most of them are misplaced. It is believed that the author was drafting by memory once he went back to [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estupiñán|first=Tamara|title=El Plano Conocido Más Antiguo de Quito|journal=Revista Trama|year=1984|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this plan, the city did not exceeded six by five blocks and it is believed to represent the shape of the city before 1569 since some elements added after this date are not included in this draft.

When in 1563 [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] raised the City of Quito to Royal Audience, new [[infrastructure]] was built to house the growing population. Bridges were created over the creeks that crossed through the city and, later, they were piped and leveled to generate more space for dwellings and streets.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt; The original [[topography]] of the city was changed allowing more people to populate a bigger area. This started the period of biggest expansion the city knew for several centuries.

Over two hundred years had to pass until another plan of the city was drafted. In 1734, Dionisio Alcedo y Herrera, President of the Tribunal of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]], created a representation of the layout of the city that showed that Quito had grown over three times its original size and that showed how it had extended especially to the North and South. This was the period of the biggest and most rapid growth of Colonial [[Quito]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrera|first=Isaac|title=Quito Colonial. Siglo XVIII Comienzos del Siglo XIX|year=1992|publisher=Academia Nacional de Historia|location=Quito}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Barrera, 1922). All the Plazas, [[Monasteries]] and most of the streets that are shown in this map, are kept until the current days. This plan also skillfully incorporates the [[elevations]] of the buildings and it is clear that most of them have not changed ever since.

== The Stagnation Era ==

[[File:1736 French Draft of the Plan of Quito.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Plan Created by the Academy of Sciences of Paris and Found in the British Library.]]When scientists from the [[French Academy of Sciences]] arrived to Quito, by 1736 they created what is probably the first modern representation of the plan of the city in terms of technique, scale and proportion. They calculated that the city had between fifty and sixty thousand inhabitants and it is clear that by this moment most of what today is the [[Historic Center of Quito]] had been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Fuente|first=Antonio|title=Los Caballeros del Punto Fijo|year=1992|publisher=Abya Yala|location=Quito}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was reproduced and adapted in a series of publications in [[France]] and [[Spain]]; however there were no new measurements made until a century later.

Until the end of the 18th Century, the population of the city would decline due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, famines, economic crisis, plagues, bad sanitary conditions, poor medical attention, among other factors.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt; It was calculated in 1757 by the Italian [[Jesuit]] Juan Bautista Coleti that the population was between 46000 and 48000 inhabitants. During this time there was no urban expansion and many of the houses in the outskirts of the city were reported to have turned into ruins since almost a quarter of the population was lost or left the city.

== The end of the colonial period ==

[[File:1810 Plan of San Francisco of Quito.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Of Unknown Author it was property of Juan Pío Montúfar.]]In all the new plans that represented Quito there was no evidence of growth in population or area. It was not until 1810 that this could be seen in a map. It is believed that this representation of the city was property of Juan Pío Montúfar, II Marquis of Selva Alegre, but it has no known author. It is an adaptation of the maps made by the [[French Academy of Sciences]], but it incorporated new elements created over the last century.&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt; It is clear in this map that the city had grown towards the mountains to the East and West, but the limits in the north and south did not have any significant changes.  This map is the last colonial representation of the urban form of Quito. After 1809 several uprisings and military battles led Quito to its independence and years after it became the Capital of [[Ecuador]].

The colonial period had ended and the new [[Republic]] started. The costs of war, political instability and economic crisis caused a very slow recovery and growth for this City. However, it may have been because of these same limitations that the City was preserved in its previous glory that centuries later gave it the acknowledgement by the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

{{History of Scandinavia}}
The '''Viking Age''' (793–1066 AD) is a period in [[History of Europe|European history]], especially [[Northern Europe]]an and [[Scandinavian history]], following the [[Germanic Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is the period of history when Scandinavian [[Norsemen]] explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonization, and conquest. In this period, the Norsemen settled in [[Norse Greenland]], [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Newfoundland]], and present-day [[History of the Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]], [[Settlement of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Normandy]], [[Scandinavian Scotland|Scotland]], [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]].

[[Vikings|Viking]] travellers and colonists were seen at many points in history as brutal raiders. Many historical documents suggest that their invasion of other countries was retaliation in response to the encroachment upon tribal lands by [[Christian mission]]aries, and perhaps by the [[Saxon Wars]] prosecuted by [[Charlemagne]] and his kin to the south,&lt;ref name="Rudolf Simek 2005, p. 24–25"&gt;Simek, Rudolf (2005) "the emergence of the viking age: circumstances and conditions", "The vikings first Europeans VIII&amp;nbsp;– XI century&amp;nbsp;– the new discoveries of archaeology", other, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno Dumézil 2005"&gt;Bruno Dumézil, master of Conference at Paris X–Nanterre, Normalien, aggregated history, author of conversion and freedom in the barbarian kingdoms. 5th&amp;nbsp;– 8th centuries (Fayard, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annals R.20"&gt;"Franques Royal Annals" cited in Sawyer, Peter (2001) ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings''. {{ISBN|0-19-285434-8}}. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decaux 1981 pp. 184"&gt;Decaux, Alain and Castelot, André (1981) ''Dictionnaire d'histoire de France''.

Information about the Viking Age is drawn largely from what was written about the Vikings by their enemies, and [[primary source]]s of archaeology, supplemented with [[secondary source]]s such as the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic Sagas]].

== Historical considerations ==
In England, the beginning of the Viking Age is dated to 8 June 793,&lt;ref name="English Heritage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/history/ |title=History of Lindisfarne Priory|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swanton"&gt;Swanton, Michael (1998). ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|0-415-92129-5}}. p. 57, n. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; when Vikings destroyed the [[abbey]] on [[Lindisfarne]], a centre of learning on an island off the northeast coast of England in [[Northumberland]]. Monks were killed in the abbey, thrown into the sea to drown, or carried away as [[slave]]s along with the church treasures, giving rise to the traditional (but unattested) prayer—''A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine'', "Free us from the fury of the Northmen, Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Albert D'Haenens, ''Les Invasions Normandes en Belgique au IX Siecle'' (Louvain 1967) asserts that the phrase cannot be documented. It is asserted that the closest documented phrase is a sentence from an antiphon for churches dedicated to St. Vaast or St. Medard: ''Summa pia gratia nostra conservando corpora et cutodita, de gente fera Normannica nos libera, quae nostra vastat, Deus, regna'', "Our supreme and holy Grace, protecting us and ours, deliver us, God, from the savage race of Northmen which lays waste our realms." Magnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'' (New York: E.P. Dutton 1980), {{ISBN|0-525-22892-6}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Viking ships had beached in [[Weymouth Bay]] four years earlier (although due to a scribal error the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' dates this event to 787 rather than 789), but that incursion may have been a trading expedition that went wrong rather than a piratical raid. Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: "Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Magnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as "wolves among sheep".

The first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.

In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torfæus]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more "rational" and "pragmatic" approach to historical scholarship.

By the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.

Scholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[The War of the Irish with the Foreigners]]''. Today, most scholars take these texts as sources not to be understood literally and are relying more on concrete archaeological findings, [[numismatics]], and other direct scientific disciplines and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXzrQvv51tEC&amp;dq |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings |last=Sawyer |first=Peter Hayes |authorlink=Peter Hayes Sawyer |isbn=0-19-820526-0|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jones|Jones]], pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[File:Faroe stamp sheet 406-408 viking voyages.jpg|right|thumb|Viking voyages in the North Atlantic]]
The Vikings who invaded western and eastern Europe were mainly pagans from the same area as present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.

Their [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.

In Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.

The sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.

== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==
{{Main|Viking expansion}}
Many theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land—especially in mountainous Norway—and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50–60 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 "The Vikings&amp;nbsp;– Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything"] (3 July 2000). See also P.H. Sawyer, "The Causes of the Viking Age" in ''The Vikings'' (R.T. Farrell, ed. 1982), London: Phillimore &amp; Co, pp. 1–7; P.H. Sawyer, ''The Age of the Vikings'' (2nd Ed. 1971), London: Edward Arnold). "It has been suggested that the expansion of the Viking age was spurred by a population growth outstepping the capacities of domestic resources. Archaeological evidence shows that new farms were cleared in sparsely populated forest areas at the time of the foreign expansion—so the pressure of population growth is surely a contributing factor." [https://www.ragweedforge.com/ODIN.html#over Arne Emil Christensen], ''The Vikings''.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advance like the use of iron, or a shortage of women due to selective [[female infanticide]] also had an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/808691/_Selective_Female_Infanticide_as_Partial_Explanation_for_the_Dearth_of_Women_in_Viking_Age_Scandinavia_pp._205-221 in Violence_and_Society_in_the_Early_Medieval_West_edited_by_Guy_Halsall._Woodbridge_United_Kingdom_Boydell_Press_1998_paperback_2002|title=Selective female infanticide as partial explanation for dearth of women in Viking Age Scandinavia |date=1998 |publisher=Boydell press |isbn= 0-85115-713-0 |location=Woodbridge|pages=205–221|last1=Wicker|first1=Nancy|editor1-last=Hallsal|editor1-first=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions caused by Frankish expansion to the south of Scandinavia, and their subsequent attacks upon the Viking peoples, may have also played a role in Viking pillaging.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Harald I of Norway]] ("Harald Fairhair") had united Norway around this time and displaced many peoples. As a result, these people sought for new bases to launch counter-raids against Harald.

Vikings would plant crops after the winter and go raiding as soon as the ice melted on the sea, then return home with their loot in time to harvest the crops.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Viking Expansion.svg|thumb|right|Viking expansion in Europe between the eighth and 11th centuries: The yellow colour corresponds to the expansion of the Normans, only partly descending from the Vikings]]
Debate among scholars is ongoing as to why the Scandinavians began to expand from the eighth through 11th centuries.

;Demographic model: This model suggests that Scandinavia experienced a population boom just before the Viking Age began.&lt;ref name="Barrett, James H 2008"&gt;Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age? Antiquity 82.317 (2008): 671–685. Web., 673&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural capacity of the land was not enough to keep up with the increasing population.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Robert. The Vikings: A History. New York: Viking, 2009. Print., 45&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually into all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Richard. Roman–Britain and Anglo–Saxon England 55 BC–AD 1066. Mechanicsburg, 2002., 177&lt;/ref&gt;

;Economic Model: The economic model states that the Viking Age was the result of growing urbanism and trade throughout mainland Europe. As the Islamic world grew, so did its trade routes, and the wealth which moved along them was pushed further and further north.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Robert. The Vikings: A History. New York: Viking, 2009. Print., 48&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, proto-urban centres such as the [[-wich town]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] began to boom during the prosperous era known as the "Long Eighth Century".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, I.L &amp; C. Wickham. ''The Long Eighth Century: Production, Distribution, and Demand.'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier "urban" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.

;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800–1300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250–1850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]]. Historians [[Rudolf Simek]] and Bruno Dumézil theorise that the Viking attacks may have been in response to the spread of Christianity among pagan peoples.&lt;ref name="Rudolf Simek 2005, p. 24–25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno Dumézil 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="annals R.20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Decaux 1981 pp. 184" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer, R. 2008 p. 96" /&gt; Professor Rudolf Simek believes, "it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne".&lt;ref name="Rudolf Simek 2005, p. 24–25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|François-Xavier Dillmann|fr}}, "Viking civilisation and culture.

Gallimard. {{ISBN|2-07-073211-8}} pp. 15–16, 18, 24, 33, 34, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

;Political model: The first of two main components to the political model is the external "Pull" factor, which suggests that the weak political bodies of Britain and Western Europe made for an attractive target for Viking raiders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The reasons for these weaknesses vary, but generally can be simplified into decentralized polities, or religious sites. As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal "Push" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age? Antiquity 82.317 (2008): 671–685. Web., 678–679&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technological model: This model suggests that the Viking Age occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the Vikings to go on their raids in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Robert. The Vikings: A History. New York: Viking, 2009. Print., 58&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt that piracy existed in the Baltic before the Viking Age, but developments in sailing technology and practice made it possible for early Viking raiders to attack lands farther away.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Andrew. Piracy in Late Roman Britain: A Perspective from the Viking Age. Britannia 37 (2006): Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these developments are included the use of larger sails, tacking practices, and 24-hour sailing.&lt;ref name="Barrett, James H 2008"/&gt;

These models constitute much of what is known about the motivations for and the causes of the Viking Age. In all likelihood, the beginning of this age was the result of some combination of the aforementioned models.

[[File:Viking towns of Scandinavia 2.jpg|right|thumb|Viking-era towns of Scandinavia]]
The earliest date given for a Viking raid is 789, when according to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a group of men from Norway sailed to the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[Dorset]] (it was wrongly recorded as 787). They were mistaken for merchants by a royal official. When asked to come to the king's manor to pay a trading tax on their goods, they murdered the official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.portsandships.com/index.php?categoryid=117&amp;p2_articleid=120 | publisher = Ports &amp; ships | title = The Vikings 787 AD-1066 AD (Anglo Saxon Britain) }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the Viking Age in the [[British Isles]] is often set at 793. It was recorded in the ''Anglo–Saxon Chronicle'' that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne (the generally accepted date is actually 8 June, not January&lt;ref name="Swanton" /&gt;):

In 794, according to the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'',  a serious attack was made on Lindisfarne's mother-house of [[Iona]], which was followed in 795 by raids upon the northern coast of Ireland. From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|Céli Dé]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]]. [[Lower Normandy]], depicted as a ″Viking territory in 911″, was not part of the lands granted by the king of the Franks to [[Rollo]] in 911, but [[Upper Normandy]].]]

The Kingdom of the [[Franks]] under Charlemagne was particularly devastated by these raiders, who could sail up the [[Seine]] with near impunity. Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].

The [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means "new city") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].

Other Norse people, particularly those from the area that is now modern-day Sweden and Norway, continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these "[[Varangians]]" brought [[Byzantine silk]], coins from [[Samarkand]], even a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].

In 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].

In 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.&lt;ref&gt;The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as "Rolf the Walker"&lt;/ref&gt; Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo–Saxon England]].

In Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Skötkonung|Olov Skötkonung]] ({{circa}} 995–1020) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden.

The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Harðráði]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Hákon Hákonarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]]. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the [[Western Isles]] and the [[Isle of Man]] remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266. [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] belonged to the king of Norway as late as 1469.

According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', Viking raiders struck England in 793 and raided Lindisfarne, the monastery that held [[Saint Cuthbert]]'s relics. The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the "Viking Age of Invasion", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840–841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the "Great Summer Army" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.

In 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England. This culminated in a full-scale invasion that led to Sweyn being crowned king of England in 1013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAnglo-Saxonkings/Sweyn.aspx | publisher = The Official Website Of The British Monarchy | title = Sweyn (r. 1013–1014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Badsey et al."&gt;Badsey, S.

The Viking presence dwindled until 1066, when the invading Norsemen lost their final battle with the English at [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|Stamford Bridge]]. Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England]] and defeated the weakened English army at the [[Battle of Hastings]].

In 1152, [[Eystein II of Norway]] led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
{{main|History of Ireland (800–1169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}

The Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.

In 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.

In 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.

Norwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.

One of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.

=== Scotland ===
{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}
While  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.

In 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eogán mac Óengusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[Dál Riata]], [[Áed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cináed mac Ailpín]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).

==== Earldom of Orkney ====
By the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Norðreyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Suðreyjar]]''—this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.

In 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.

==== Kings of the Isles ====
{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}
In 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson [[Thorstein the Red]] and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney invaded Scotland were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and fearing the bounty on his head fled to Iceland.

The Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the "Kingdom of Man and the Isles", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].

In eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes "'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes"]. ''The Modern Antiquarian''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].

The end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].

Orkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the dowry of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]]. Although attempts were made during the 17th and 18th centuries to redeem Shetland, without success,&lt;ref&gt;[http://universitas.uio.no/Arkiv/1996/16okt96/norsk.htm "Norsken som døde"].

=== Wales ===
Incursions in Wales were decisively reversed at the [[Battle of Buttington]] in Powys, 893, when a combined Welsh and Mercian army under Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, defeated a Danish band.

Wales was not colonised by the Vikings as heavily as eastern England. The Vikings did, however, settle in the south around [[St. David]]'s, [[Haverfordwest]], and [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]], among other places. Place names such as Skokholm, Skomer, and Swansea remain as evidence of the Norse settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John Garnons. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220020051/http://www.gwp.enta.net/walhist.html Wales at the Time of the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267]. Mapping Medieval Wales. gwp.enta.net&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings, however, did not subdue the Welsh mountain kingdoms.

=== Iceland ===
According to Sagas, Iceland was discovered by [[Naddodd]], a Viking from the Faroe Islands, after which it was settled by mostly Norwegians fleeing the oppressive rule of Harald Fairhair (late 9th century). While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the Norse. According to the saga of [[Erik the Red]], when Erik was exiled from Iceland, he sailed west and pioneered Greenland.

=== Greenland ===
[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|The last written records of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders are from a 1408 marriage in the [[Church of Hvalsey]].]]
The Viking-Age settlements in Greenland were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast. They settled in three separate areas along roughly {{convert|650|km|nmi smi|abbr=on|lk=out}} of the western coast. While harsh, the [[microclimate]]s along some fjords allowed for a pastoral lifestyle similar to that of Iceland, until the climate changed for the worse with the [[Little Ice Age#Dating|Little Ice Age]] around 1400.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[History of Greenland#Norse failure]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Eastern Settlement]]: The remains of about 450 farms have been found here. Erik the Red settled at Brattahlid on Ericsfjord.
* The [[Middle Settlement]], near modern [[Ivigtut]], consisted of about 20 farms.
* The [[Western Settlement]] at modern [[Godthåbsfjord]], was established before the 12th century. It has been extensively excavated by archaeologists.

=== Kvenland ===
{{Main|Kvenland}}
Kvenland, known as Cwenland, Kænland, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Scandinavia and [[Fennoscandia]]. A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an [[Old English]] account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named [[Ohthere of Hålogaland|Ohthere]]. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.

All the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of them—in part at least—are believed to be rewrites of older texts. Other references and possible references to Kvenland by other names and/or spellings are discussed in the main article of [[Kvenland]].

== Eastern Europe ==
The [[Varangians]] or Varyags ([[Russian language|Russian]], {{lang-uk|варяги}}, ''varyagi''; {{lang-be|варагі}}, ''varahi''; [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: Βάραγγοι, Βαριάγοι, ''Varangoi'') sometimes referred to as Variagians were Scandinavians, often Swedes, who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries. Engaging in [[trade]], [[piracy]], and [[mercenary]] activities, they roamed the river systems and portages of [[Gardariki]], reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople.
Contemporary English publications also use the name "[[Viking]]" for early Varangians in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057004/Oleg|title=Oleg|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064445/Rurik|title=Rurik|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Varangian remained in usage in the Byzantine Empire until the 13th century, largely disconnected from its Scandinavian roots by then.
Having settled [[Aldeigja]] (Ladoga) in the 750s, Scandinavian colonists were probably an element in the early ethnogenesis of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus' people]], and likely played a role in the formation of the [[Rus' Khaganate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/land-of-the-rus-viking-expeditions-to-the-east/ Land of the Rus – Viking expeditions to the east] National Museum of Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://natmus.dk/en/historisk-viden/danmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/dangerous-journeys-to-eastern-europe-and-russia/ Dangerous journeys to Eastern Europe and Russia] National Museum of Denmark&lt;/ref&gt; The Varangians ('''Varyags''', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the Primary Chronicle as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonian people|Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.

[[File:Bildsten med skepp 800-1099 Tjängvide, Gotland.jpg|thumb|[[Longship]] on [[Tjängvide image stone]], 800-1099.]]
In 862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled against the Varangian Rus, driving them overseas back to Scandinavia, but soon started to conflict with each other{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. The disorder prompted the tribes to invite back the Varangian Rus "to come and rule them" and bring peace to the region{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. This was a somewhat bilateral relation with the Varagians defending the cities that they ruled. Led by [[Rurik]] and his brothers [[Truvor and Sineus]], the invited Varangians (called Rus') settled around the town of Novgorod (Holmgard).

In the 9th century, the Rus' operated the [[Volga trade route]], which connected Northern Russia (Gardariki) with the Middle East ([[Serkland]]). As the Volga route declined by the end of the century, the [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] rapidly overtook it in popularity. Apart from Ladoga and Novgorod, [[Gnezdovo]] and [[Gotland]] were major centres for Varangian trade.&lt;ref&gt;A massive majority (40,000) of all Viking Age Arabian coins found in Scandinavia were found in Gotland. In Skåne, Öland and Uppland together, about 12,000 coins were found. Other Scandinavian areas have only scattered finds: 1,000 from Denmark and some 500 from Norway. [[Byzantine]] coins have been found almost exclusively in Gotland, some 400.&lt;br /&gt;'''''See:'''''&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |last=Burenhult |first=Göran |date=1999 |title=Arkeologi i Norden 2 |trans-title=Archeology in the Nordic countries, part 2 |url= |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm |publisher=[[Natur &amp; Kultur]] |isbn=9789127134782}}&lt;br /&gt;'''''See also:'''''&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardell |first=Carl Johan |date=1987 |title=Gotlands historia i fickformat |trans-title=The pocket history of Gotland |url= |language=Swedish |location= |publisher= |isbn=91-7810-885-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western historians tend to agree with the Primary Chronicle that these Scandinavians founded Kievan Rus' in the 880s and gave their name to the land.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Milner-Gulland, ''The Russians'', Blackwell Publishing, 1999, {{ISBN|0-631-21849-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-631-21849-4}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Many Slavic scholars are opposed to this theory of Germanic{{Clarify|date=October 2011|reason=Germanic? Shouldn't that be Scandinavian?}} influence on the Rus' and have suggested alternative scenarios for this part of Eastern European history.

In contrast to the intense Scandinavian influence in Normandy and the British Isles, Varangian culture did not survive to a great extent in the East. Instead, the Varangian ruling classes of the two powerful city-states of [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and Kiev were thoroughly Slavicised by the end of the 10th century. Old Norse was spoken in one district of Novgorod, however, until the 13th century.

Viking Age Scandinavian settlements were set up along the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], primarily for trade purposes. Their appearance coincides with the settlement and consolidation of the Slavic tribes in the respective areas.&lt;ref name=Harck17&gt;[[#Harck|Harck]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavians had contacts to the Slavs since their very immigration, these first contacts were soon followed by both the construction of Scandinavian emporia and Slavic burghs in their vicinity.&lt;ref name=Harck15&gt;[[#Harck|Harck]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Scandinavian settlements were larger than the early Slavic ones, their craftsmen had a considerably higher productivity, and in contrast to the early Slavs, the Scandinavians were capable of seafaring.&lt;ref name=Harck15 /&gt; Their importance for trade with the Slavic world however was limited to the coastal regions and their hinterlands.&lt;ref name=Harck1617&gt;[[#Harck|Harck]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Siege of Paris (845) | Siege of Paris (885–886)| History of Normandy}}

The French region of Normandy takes its name from the Viking invaders who were called ''Normanni'', which means ‘men of the North'. Today, ''nordmann'' (pron. Norman) in the [[Norwegian language]], denotes a Norwegian person.

The first Viking raids began between 790 and 800 along the coasts of western France. They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to [[Francia]] during the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814–840). But the Vikings took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of Louis the Pious to settle their first colony in the south-west ([[Gascony]]) of the kingdom of Francia, which was more or less abandoned by the Frankish kings after their two defeats at [[Roncevaux]]. The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to [[Rouen]] and [[Jumièges]]. The Viking attackers sought to capture the treasures stored at [[Monastery|monasteries]], easy prey given the monks' lack of defensive capacity. In 845 an expedition up the Seine reached [[Paris]]. The presence of [[French denier|Carolingian ''deniers'']] of ''ca'' 847, found in 1871 among a hoard at Mullaghboden, County Limerick, where coins were neither minted nor normally used in trade, probably represents booty from the raids of 843–6.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After 851, Vikings began to stay in the lower Seine valley for the winter. Twice more in the 860s Vikings rowed to Paris, leaving only when they acquired sufficient loot or bribes from the [[Carolingian]] rulers.

The Carolingian kings tended to have contradictory politics, which had severe consequences. In 867, [[Charles the Bald]] signed the [[Treaty of Compiègne]], by which he agreed to yield the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] to the [[Breton people|Breton]] king [[Salomon, King of Brittany|Salomon]], on the condition that Salomon would take an oath of fidelity and fight as an ally against the Vikings. Nevertheless, in 911 the Viking leader [[Rollo]] forced Charles the Simple to sign the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]], under which Charles gave Rouen and the area of present-day [[Upper Normandy]] to Rollo, establishing the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. In exchange, Rollo pledged vassalage to Charles in 940, agreed to be [[baptism|baptised]], and vowed to guard the [[estuaries]] of the Seine from further Viking attacks, even though the exact opposite was often the case. The Duchy of Normandy also annexed further areas in Northern France, expanding the territory which was originally negotiated.

While many buildings were pillaged, burned, or destroyed by the Viking raids, ecclesiastical sources may have been overly negative as no city was completely destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} On the other hand, many monasteries were pillaged and all the abbeys were destroyed. Rollo and his successors brought about rapid recoveries from the raids.

The Scandinavian colonization was principally Norwegian and Danish under the leadership of Rollo. A few Swedes were present. The merging of the Scandinavian and native elements contributed to the creation of one of the most powerful [[feudal states]] of [[Western Europe]]. The naval ability of the Normans would allow them to [[Norman conquest of England|conquer England]] and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|southern Italy]], and play a key role in the [[Crusades]].

=== Italy ===
In 860, according to an account by the Norman monk [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]], a Viking fleet, probably under [[Björn Ironside]] and [[Hastein]], landed at the Ligurian port of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] and sacked the city. The Vikings then moved another 60 miles down the Tuscan coast to the mouth of the [[Arno]], sacking [[Pisa]] and then, following the river upstream, also the hill-town of [[Fiesole]] above [[Florence]]; and others victory around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and North Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haywood|first1=John|title=Northmen|date=8 October 2015|publisher=Head of Zeus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Anglo-Danish and Varangian mercenaries fought in Southern Italy, including [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] and [[William Iron Arm|William de Hauteville]] who conquered parts of Sicily between 1038 and 1040,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=John|title=Fighting Emperors of Byzantium|date=30 April 2015|publisher=Pen and Sword|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Paul|title=The Norman Commanders: Masters of Warfare 911–1135|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Pen and Sword|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edgar the Ætheling]] who participated in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', p. 217; Florence of Worcester, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy runestones|Runestones]] were raised in Sweden in memory of warriors who died in Langbarðaland ([[Langobardia Minor|Land of the Lombards]]), the Old Norse name for southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansmuseum.a.se/runriket/taby.html ''2.

After 842, when the Vikings set up a permanent base at the mouth of the [[Loire]] river, they could strike as far as northern Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; They attacked [[Cádiz]] in 844. In some of their raids they were crushed either by [[Kingdom of Asturias]] or Emirate armies.

In 1015, a Viking fleet entered the [[Minho River|river Minho]] and sacked the episcopal city of [[Tui, Pontevedra|Tui]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]); no new bishop was appointed until 1070.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A.

=== Portugal ===
In 844, many dozens of drakkars appeared in the "Mar da Palha" ("the Sea of Straw", mouth of the [[Tagus]] river). After a siege, the Vikings conquered [[Lisbon]] (at the time, the city was under Muslim rule and known as ''Lashbuna''). They left after 13 days, following a resistance led by [[Alah Ibn Hazm]] and the city's inhabitants. Another raid was attempted in 966, without success.

== North America ==
{{Main|L'Anse aux Meadows}}
In about 986, the Norwegian Vikings [[Bjarni Herjólfsson]], [[Leif Ericson]] and [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Þórfinnr Karlsefni]] from Greenland reached [[North America]], over 500 years before [[Christopher Columbus]], and they attempted to settle the land they called [[Vinland]]. They created a small settlement on the northern peninsula of present-day [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Conflict with indigenous peoples and lack of support from Greenland brought the Vinland colony to an end within a few years. The archaeological remains are now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Centre. [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/4 "L’Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site"]. ''unesco.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Old Norse influence on the English language ==
The long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, p25–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.&lt;ref name="Crystal" /&gt; The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning "wind-eye".&lt;ref name="Crystal" /&gt; Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with ''they, them'' and ''their'' replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb ''to be''; the replacement of ''sindon'' by ''are'' is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending ''-s'' in the present tense of verbs.&lt;ref name="Crystal" /&gt;

There are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the ''Danelaw''): over 600 end in ''-by'', the Scandinavian word for "village"—for example ''Grimsby, Naseby'' and ''Whitby'';&lt;ref&gt;"The ''-by'' ending is almost entirely confined to the area of the Danelaw, supporting a theory of Scandinavian origin, despite the existence of the word ''by'' "dwelling" in Old English." Crystal, p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; many others end in ''-thorpe'' ("farm"), ''-thwaite'' ("clearing"), and ''-toft'' ("homestead").&lt;ref name="Crystal" /&gt;

The distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in ''-son'' reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement. Early medieval records indicate that over 60% of personal names in Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire showed Scandinavian influence.&lt;ref name="Crystal" /&gt;

== Technology ==
[[File:Vikingship.jpg|thumb|Modern replica of a Viking [[longship]]]]

{{further|Longship|Viking Age arms and armour}}
The Vikings were equipped with the technologically superior longships; for purposes of conducting trade however, another type of ship, the ''[[knarr]]'', wider and deeper in draft, were customarily used. The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates. Chroniclers paid little attention to other aspects of medieval Scandinavian culture. This slant was accentuated by the absence of contemporary primary source documentation from within the Viking Age communities themselves. Little documentary evidence was available until later, when Christian sources began to contribute. As historians and archaeologists have developed more resources to challenge the one-sided descriptions of the chroniclers, a more balanced picture of the Norsemen has become apparent.


The Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. Not only were the ships light and agile, but they were light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. "Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.". &lt;ref&gt;Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael. Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of the World: Beginnings Through the Fifteenth Century (Fourth Edition)  (Vol. 1) (Page 352). W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;.The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes. This led to a lesser quality of ships.

While battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, P. and Wilson, D. M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]''—a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipen'' (ship community) had to deliver one ship and crew—was discontinued. Changes in shipbuilding in the rest of Europe led to the demise of the longship for military purposes. By the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships.

Exactly how the Viking's navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite "sunstones"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking "sky-polarimetric" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.&lt;ref&gt;Horvàth, G. et al.

The archaeological find known as the [[Visby lenses]] from the Swedish island of Gotland may be components of a [[telescope]]. It appears to date from long before the invention of the telescope in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/702478.stm Did the Vikings make a telescope?] BBC. 5 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence suggests that the Vikings also made use of an optical compass as a navigation aid, using the light-splitting and polarisation-filtering properties of [[Iceland spar]] to find the location of the sun when it was not directly visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gG9Zg8qGn6p_Q1uGYEkURed9ctUw?docId=CNG.4d3e3192983c9038907dfe85d0f868e0.01 |title=AFP: Viking 'sunstone' more than a myth |publisher=Google |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aroa viking town 1.jpg|thumb|The fortified Viking Age town of Aros]]
Some of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period, include both existing and former cities such as [[Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Ribe]] (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), [[Bjørgvin]] (Norway), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Skiringssal]] (Norway), [[Birka]] (Sweden), [[Bordeaux]] (France), [[Jorvik|York]] (England), Dublin (Ireland) and [[Staraya Ladoga|Aldeigjuborg]] (Russia).

One important centre of trade was at [[Hedeby]]. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[Jórvík]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g. a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].
