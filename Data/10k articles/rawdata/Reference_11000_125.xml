ARINC 424 specifies a 132-[[byte]] fixed-length record format.

Each amendment is issued as a supplement, a format number suffix indicating the revision level of the standard. Supplement 21 was issued in July 2016, but the FAA currently publishes data in three older formats ARINC 424-13, ARINC 424-15, and ARINC 424-18.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/productcatalog/digitalproducts/CIFP/ Coded Instrument Flight Procedures (CIFP), formerly the National Flight Database (NFD)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Alternative dispute resolution''' ('''ADR'''; known in some countries, such as India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/ASIC.NSF/byHeadline/Complaints%20resolution%20schemes Australian Securities and Investments Commission - Complaints resolution schemes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106073042/http://www.asic.gov.au./asic/ASIC.NSF/byHeadline/Complaints%20resolution%20schemes |date=6 January 2009 }}. Asic.gov.au. Retrieved on 2013-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt; as '''external dispute resolution''') includes [[dispute resolution]] processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of [[litigation]]. It is a collective term for the ways that parties can settle disputes, with the help of a third party.

Despite historic resistance to ADR by many popular parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the [[legal profession]] in recent years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually [[mediation]], before permitting the parties' cases to be tried (indeed the [[European Mediation Directive]] (2008) expressly contemplates so-called "compulsory" mediation; this means that attendance is compulsory, not that settlement must be reached through mediation). Additionally, parties to [[merger and acquisition]] transactions are increasingly turning to ADR to resolve post-acquisition disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Litvak|first1=Jeff|last2=Miller|first2=Brent|title=Using Due Diligence and Alternative Dispute Resolutions to Resolve Post-Acquisition Disputes|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/using-due-diligence-and-alternative-dispute-resolutions-resolve-post-acquisition-disputes|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723082545/https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/using-due-diligence-and-alternative-dispute-resolutions-resolve-post-acquisition-disputes|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality, and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Totaro, Gianna., "Avoid court at all costs" The Australian Financial Review Nov. 14 2008. (April 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the senior judiciary in certain jurisdictions (of which England and Wales is one) are strongly in favour of this (ADR) use of mediation to settle disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1599420|title=The Phenomenon of Mediation: Judicial Perspectives and an Eye on the Future|first=Noel Rhys|last=Clift|date=3 May 2010|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salient features==
Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is generally classified into at least four types: [[Negotiation (process)|negotiation]], [[mediation]], [[collaborative law]], and [[arbitration]]. Sometimes, [[conciliation]] is included as a fifth category, but for simplicity may be regarded as a form of [[mediation]]. ADR can be used alongside existing legal systems such as [[Sharia]] courts within common law jurisdictions, such as the UK.

ADR traditions vary somewhat by country and culture.  There are significant common elements which justify a main topic, and each country or region's difference should be delegated to sub-pages.

ADR is of two historic types.  First, methods for resolving disputes outside of the official judicial mechanisms.  Second, informal methods attached to or pendant to official judicial mechanisms. There are in addition free-standing and or independent methods, such as mediation programs and ombuds offices within organizations.  The methods are similar, whether or not they are pendant, and generally use similar tool or skill sets, which are basically sub-sets of the skills of negotiation.

ADR includes informal tribunals, informal mediative processes, formal tribunals and formal mediative processes.  The classic formal tribunal forms of ADR are arbitration (both binding and advisory or non-binding) and private judges (either sitting alone, on panels or over summary jury trials). The classic formal mediative process is referral for mediation before a court-appointed mediator or mediation panel. Structured transformative mediation as used by the U.S. Postal Service is a formal process. Classic informal methods include social processes, referrals to non-formal authorities (such as a respected member of a trade or social group) and intercession.  The major differences between formal and informal processes are (a) pendency to a court procedure and (b) the possession or lack of a formal structure for the application of the procedure.

For example, freeform negotiation is merely the use of the tools without any process.  Negotiation within a labor arbitration setting is the use of the tools within a highly formalized and controlled setting.

Calling upon an organizational ombudsman's office is never, by itself, a formal procedure. (Calling upon an organizational ombudsman is always voluntary; by the International Ombudsman Association Standards of Practice, no one can be compelled to use an ombuds office.)

Organizational ombuds offices refer people to all conflict management options in the organization: formal and informal, rights-based and interest-based. But, in addition, in part because they have no decision-making authority, ombuds offices can, themselves, offer a wide spectrum of informal options.

This spectrum is often overlooked in contemporary discussions of "ADR". "ADR" often refers to external conflict management options that are important, but used only occasionally. An organizational ombuds office typically offers many internal options that are used in hundreds of cases a year. These options include:

* delivering respect, for example, affirming the feelings of a visitor, while staying explicitly neutral on the facts of a case,
* active listening, serving as a sounding board,
* providing and explaining information, one-on-one, for example, about policies and rules, and about the context of a concern,
* receiving vital information, one-on-one, for example, from those reporting unacceptable or illegal behavior,
* reframing issues,
* helping to develop and evaluate new options for the issues at hand,
* offering the option of referrals to other resources, to "key people" in the relevant department, and to managers and compliance offices,
* helping people help themselves to use a direct approach, for example, helping people collect and analyze their own information, helping people to draft a letter about their issues, coaching and role-playing,
* offering shuttle diplomacy, for example, helping employees and managers to think through proposals that may resolve a dispute, facilitating discussions,
* offering mediation inside the organization,
* "looking into" a problem informally,
* facilitating a generic approach to an individual problem, for example instigating or offering training on a given issue, finding ways to promulgate an existing policy,
* identifying and communicating throughout the organization about "new issues",
* identifying and communicating about patterns of issues,
* working for systems change, for example, suggesting new policies, or procedures,
* following up with a visitor, following up on a system change recommendation. (See Rowe, Mary, Informality — The Fourth Standard of Practice, in JIOA, vol 5, no 1, (2012) pp 8–17.)&lt;!-- bad citation style --&gt;

Informal referral to a co-worker known to help people work out issues is an informal procedure. Co-worker interventions are usually informal.

Conceptualizing ADR in this way makes it easy to avoid confusing tools and methods (does negotiation once a lawsuit is filed cease to be ADR?  If it is a tool, then the question is the wrong question) (is mediation ADR unless a court orders it?  If you look at court orders and similar things as formalism, then the answer is clear: court annexed mediation is merely a formal ADR process).

Dividing lines in ADR processes are often provider driven rather than consumer driven. Educated consumers will often choose to use many different options depending on the needs and circumstances that they face.

Finally, it is important to realize that conflict resolution is one major goal of all the ADR processes.  If a process leads to resolution, it is a dispute resolution process.&lt;ref&gt;Taken with permission from a presentation by Stephen R. Marsh of {{cite web |url=http://adrr.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204202307/http://adrr.com/ |archivedate=4 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salient features of each type are as follows:

# In [[Negotiation (process)|negotiation]], participation is voluntary and there is no third party who facilitates the resolution process or imposes a resolution. (NB – a third party like a chaplain or organizational ombudsperson or social worker or a skilled friend may be coaching one or both of the parties behind the scene, a process called "Helping People Help Themselves" – see Helping People Help Themselves, in Negotiation Journal July 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–248, which includes a section on helping someone draft a letter to someone who is perceived to have wronged them.)
# In [[mediation]], there is a third party, a mediator, who facilitates the resolution process (and may even suggest a resolution, typically known as a "mediator's proposal"), but does ''not'' impose a resolution on the parties. In some countries (for example, the [[United Kingdom]]), ADR is synonymous with what is generally referred to as [[mediation]] in other countries.
# In [[collaborative law]] or [[collaborative divorce]], each party has an attorney who facilitates the resolution process within specifically contracted terms. The parties reach agreement with support of the attorneys (who are trained in the process) and mutually agreed experts. No one imposes a resolution on the parties. However, the process is a formalized process that is part of the litigation and court system.  Rather than being an Alternative Resolution methodology it is a litigation variant that happens to rely on ADR like attitudes and processes.
# In [[arbitration]], participation is typically voluntary, and there is a third party who, as a private judge, imposes a resolution. Arbitrations often occur because parties to contracts agree that any future dispute concerning the agreement will be resolved by arbitration. This is known as a 'Scott Avery Clause'.&lt;ref name="Scott v Avery"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Scott v Avery |reporter=ER |year=1856 |volume=10 |num=810 |firstpage=1121 |parallelcite=5 {{abbr|HLCas|House of Lords Cases}} 811 |courtname=[[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] |juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the enforceability of arbitration clauses, particularly in the context of consumer agreements (e.g., [[credit card]] agreements), has drawn scrutiny from courts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, David S., "Mandatory Arbitration and Fairness." 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1247 (April 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Although parties may appeal arbitration outcomes to courts, such appeals face an exacting [[standard of review]].&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Conflict Prevention &amp; Resolution. "Arbitration Appeal Procedure." {{cite web |url=http://www.cpradr.org/ClausesRules/ArbitrationAppealProcedure/tabid/79/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408140952/http://www.cpradr.org/ClausesRules/ArbitrationAppealProcedure/tabid/79/Default.aspx |archivedate=8 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the basic types of alternative dispute resolutions there are other different forms of ADR:

* Case evaluation: a non-binding process in which parties present the facts and the issues to a neutral case evaluator who advises the parties on the strengths and weaknesses of their respective positions, and assesses how the dispute is likely to be decided by a jury or other adjudicator.
* Early neutral evaluation: a process that takes place soon after a case has been filed in court. The case is referred to an expert who is asked to provide a balanced and neutral evaluation of the dispute. The evaluation of the expert can assist the parties in assessing their case and may influence them towards a settlement.
* Family group conference: a meeting between members of a family and members of their extended related group. At this meeting (or often a series of meetings) the family becomes involved in learning skills for interaction and in making a plan to stop the abuse or other ill-treatment between its members.
* Neutral fact-finding: a process where a neutral third party, selected either by the disputing parties or by the court, investigates an issue and reports or testifies in court. The neutral fact-finding process is particularly useful for resolving complex scientific and factual disputes.
* Ombuds: third party selected by an institution – for example a university, hospital, corporation or government agency – to deal with complaints by employees, clients or constituents.
An [[organizational ombudsman]] works within the institution to look into complaints independently and impartially.&lt;ref&gt;"What You Need to Know about Dispute Resolution: The Guide to Dispute Resolution Processes." American Bar Association. {{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/dispute/draftbrochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518022658/http://www.abanet.org/dispute/draftbrochure.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Alternative" dispute resolution is usually considered to be alternative to [[litigation]]. It also can be used as a [[colloquialism]] for allowing a dispute to drop or as an alternative to [[violence]].

In recent years there has been more discussion about taking a systems approach in order to offer different kinds of options to people who are in conflict, and to foster "'''appropriate'''" dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. "ADR and Beyond: A Systems Approach to Conflict Management",
Negotiation Journal, Volume 17, Number 3, July 2001, Volume, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, some cases and some complaints in fact ought to go to formal grievance or to court or to the police or to a compliance officer or to a government IG. Other conflicts could be settled by the parties if they had enough support and coaching, and yet other cases need [[mediation]] or arbitration. Thus "alternative" dispute resolution usually means a method that is not the courts. "Appropriate" dispute resolution considers '''all''' the possible responsible options for conflict resolution that are relevant for a given issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Sloan-School-of-Management/15-667Spring2001/4D52CAC7-78CE-453D-9918-6E6EE2146864/0/lec11_notes_on_options.pdf |title=Notes on options for managers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920125625/http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Sloan-School-of-Management/15-667Spring2001/4D52CAC7-78CE-453D-9918-6E6EE2146864/0/lec11_notes_on_options.pdf |archive-date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADR can increasingly be conducted online, which is known as [[online dispute resolution]] (ODR, which is mostly a buzzword and an attempt to create a distinctive product). It should be noted, however, that ODR services can be provided by government entities, and as such may form part of the litigation process. Moreover, they can be provided on a global scale, where no effective domestic remedies are available to disputing parties, as in the case of the [[UDRP]] and [[domain name]] disputes. In this respect, ODR might not satisfy the "alternative" element of ADR.

===Benefits and disadvantages===
ADR has several advantages over litigation:

* Suitable for multi-party disputes
* Lower costs
* Likelihood and speed of settlements
* Flexibility of process 
* Parties' control of process
* Parties' choice of forum
* Practical solutions
* Wider range of issues can be considered
* Shared future interests may be protected
* Confidentiality
* Risk management

However, ADR less suitable than litigation when there is:
* A need for precedent
* A need for court orders
* A need for interim orders
* A need for evidential rules
* A need for enforcement
* Power imbalance between parties
* Quasi-criminal allegations
* Complexity in the case

=== Modern era ===
Traditional people's mediation has always involved the parties remaining in contact for most or all of the mediation session. The innovation of separating the parties after (or sometimes before) a joint session and conducting the rest of the process without the parties in the same area was a major innovation and one that dramatically improved mediation's success rate.

Traditional arbitration involved heads of trade guilds or other dominant authorities settling disputes. The modern innovation was to have commercial vendors of arbitrators, often ones with little or no social or political dominance over the parties. The advantage was that such persons are much more readily available. The disadvantage is that it does not involve the community of the parties. When wool contract arbitration was conducted by senior guild officials, the arbitrator combined a seasoned expert on the subject matter with a socially dominant individual whose patronage, good will and opinion were important.

Private judges and summary jury trials are cost- and time-saving processes that have had limited penetration due to the alternatives becoming more robust and accepted.

==Country-specific examples==
===Somalia===
Somalia has a cultural and historic mediation and justice system known as ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution), which is an informal justice system. It is a kind of justice system in which the arbiter listens to both sides of dispute and then concludes a solution that both sides will accept.

===Roman Empire===
Latin has a number of terms for mediator that predate the Roman Empire. Any time there are formal adjudicative processes it appears that there are informal ones as well. It is probably fruitless to attempt to determine which group had mediation first.

===Iceland===
[[Njáls saga]] is an [[Iceland]]ic story of a mediator who was so successful that he eventually threatened the local power structure. It ends in tragedy with the unlawful burning of Njal alive in his home, the escape of a friend of the family, a mini-war and the eventual ending of the dispute by the intermarriage of the two strongest survivors. It illustrates that mediation was a powerful process in Iceland.

===India===
Alternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted to accommodate the harmonisation mandates of UNCITRAL Model. To streamline the Indian legal system the traditional civil law known as Code of Civil Procedure, (CPC) 1908 has also been amended and section 89 has been introduced. Section 89 (1) of CPC provides an option for the settlement of disputes outside the court. It provides that where it appears to the court that there exist elements, which may be acceptable to the parties, the court may formulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for arbitration, conciliation, [[mediation]] or judicial settlement.

Due to extremely slow judicial process, there has been a big thrust on Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanisms in India. While Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a fairly standard western approach towards ADR, the Lok Adalat system constituted under National Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 is a uniquely Indian approach.

A study on [http://www.sundayguardianlive.com/business/10161-experts-seek-legislative-framework-address-cases-commercial-disputes commercial dispute resolution in south India] has been done by a think tank organization based in Kochi, [[Centre for Public Policy Research]]. The study reveals that the Court-annexed Mediation Centre in Bangalore has a success rate of 64%, and its counterpart in Kerala has an average success rate of 27.7%. Further, amongst the three southern states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala), Tamil Nadu is said to have the highest adoption of dispute resolution, Kerala the least.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livelaw.in/see-court-see-court-burdened-judicial-system-can-adr-system-answer-part-iii/|title=“See You In Court” Or “See You Out Of Court” ?

====Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996====
Part I of this act formalizes the process of Arbitration and Part III formalizes the process of Conciliation. (Part II is about Enforcement of Foreign Awards under New York and Geneva Conventions.)

=====Arbitration=====
The process of arbitration can start only if there exists a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties prior to the emergence of the dispute. As per Section 7, such an agreement must be in writing. The contract regarding which the dispute exists, must either contain an arbitration clause or must refer to a separate document signed by the parties containing the arbitration agreement. The existence of an arbitration agreement can also be inferred by written correspondence such as letters, telex, or telegrams which provide a record of the agreement. An exchange of statement of claim and defense in which existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by other is also considered as valid written arbitration agreement.

Any party to the dispute can start the process of appointing arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator. There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment of an arbitrator – reasonable doubt in the impartiality of the arbitrator and the lack of proper qualification of the arbitrator as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.

Except for some interim measures, there is very little scope for judicial intervention in the arbitration process. The arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over its own jurisdiction. Thus, if a party wants to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal, it can do so only before the tribunal itself. If the tribunal rejects the request, there is little the party can do except to approach a court after the tribunal makes an award. Section 34 provides certain grounds upon which a party can appeal to the principal civil court of original jurisdiction for setting aside the award.

The period for filing an appeal for setting aside an award is over, or if such an appeal is rejected, the award is binding on the parties and is considered as a decree of the court.

=====Conciliation=====
Conciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator. One conciliator is preferred but two or three are also allowed. In case of multiple conciliators, all must act jointly. If a party rejects an offer to conciliate, there can be no conciliation.

Parties may submit statements to the conciliator describing the general nature of the dispute and the points at issue. Each party sends a copy of the statement to the other. The conciliator may request further details, may ask to meet the parties, or communicate with the parties orally or in writing. Parties may even submit suggestions for the settlement of the dispute to the conciliator.

When it appears to the conciliator that elements of settlement exist, he may draw up the terms of settlement and send it to the parties for their acceptance. If both the parties sign the settlement document, it shall be final and binding on both.

Note that in the US, this process is similar to [[mediation]]. However, in India, [[mediation]] is different from conciliation and is a completely informal type of ADR mechanism.

====Lok Adalat====
Etymologically, Lok Adalat means "people's court". India has had a long history of resolving disputes through the [[mediation]] of village elders. The current system of Lok Adalats is an improvement on that and is based on Gandhian principles. This is a non-adversarial system, whereby mock courts (called Lok Adalats) are held by the State Authority, District Authority, Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, High Court Legal Services Committee, or Taluk Legal Services Committee, periodically for exercising such jurisdiction as they thinks fit. These are usually presided by retired judge, social activists, or members of legal profession. It does not have jurisdiction on matters related to non-compoundable offences.

While in regular suits, the plaintiff is required to pay the prescribed court fee, in Lok Adalat, there is no court fee and no rigid procedural requirement (i.e. no need to follow process given by [Indian] Civil Procedure Code or Indian Evidence Act), which makes the process very fast. Parties can directly interact with the judge, which is not possible in regular courts.

Cases that are pending in regular courts can be transferred to a Lok Adalat if both the parties agree. A case can also be transferred to a Lok Adalat if one party applies to the court and the court sees some chance of settlement after giving an opportunity of being heard to the other party.

The focus in Lok Adalats is on compromise. When no compromise is reached, the matter goes back to the court. However, if a compromise is reached, an award is made and is binding on the parties. It is enforced as a decree of a civil court. An important aspect is that the award is final and cannot be appealed, not even under Article 226 of the Constitution of India [which empowers the litigants to file Writ Petition before High Courts] because it is a judgement by consent.

All proceedings of a Lok Adalat are deemed to be judicial proceedings and every Lok Adalat is deemed to be a Civil Court.

=====Permanent Lok Adalat for public utility services=====
In order to get over the major drawback in the existing scheme of organisation of Lok Adalats under Chapter VI of the [[Legal Services Authorities Act 1987]], in which if the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the unsettled case is either returned to the back to the court or the parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law, which causes unnecessary delay in dispensation of justice, Chapter VI A was introduced in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, by Act No.37/2002 with effect from 11-06-2002 providing for a Permanent Lok Adalat to deal with pre-litigation, conciliation and settlement of disputes relating to Public Utility Services, as defined u/sec.22 A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, at pre-litigation stage itself, which would result in reducing the work load of the regular courts to a great extent. [https://sites.google.com/site/plapushyderabad Permanent Lok Adalat for Public Utility Services, Hyderabad, India]

The Lok Adalat is presided over by a sitting or retired judicial officer as the chairman, with two other members, usually a lawyer and a social worker. There is no court fee. If the case is already filed in the regular court, the fee paid will be refunded if the dispute is settled at the Lok Adalat. The procedural laws, and the Evidence Act are not strictly followed while assessing the merits of the claim by the Lok Adalat.

Main condition of the Lok Adalat is that both parties in dispute should agree for settlement. The decision of the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties to the dispute and its order is capable of execution through legal process. No appeal lies against the order of the Lok Adalat.

Lok Adalat is very effective in settlement of money claims. Disputes like partition suits, damages and matrimonial cases can also be easily settled before Lok Adalat as the scope for compromise through an approach of give and take is high in these cases.

Lok Adalat is a boon to the litigant public, where they can get their disputes settled fast and free of cost.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Before modern state law was introduced under [[colonialism]], African customary legal systems mainly relied on mediation and conciliation. In many countries, these traditional mechanisms have been integrated into the official legal system. In [[Benin]], specialised ''tribunaux de conciliation'' hear cases on a broad range of civil law matters. Results are then transmitted to the court of first instance where either a successful conciliation is confirmed or jurisdiction is assumed by the higher court. Similar tribunals also operate, in varying modes, in other [[Francophone Africa|francophone African countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominik Kohlhagen, ADR and Mediation: the Experience of French-Speaking Countries, Addis Abada, 2007 (on [http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/etudesdiverses/articles/kohlhagenmediation.pdf ADR in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806192902/http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/etudesdiverses/articles/kohlhagenmediation.pdf |date=6 August 2010 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Quedlinburg]], Germany, was first mentioned in writing in a document dated to 922. [[Saint Mathilda]] founded a religious community for women at its [[Quedlinburg Abbey|abbey]], serving as abbess from 966 to 999.&lt;ref name=warner/&gt; The abbey became a premier educational institution for the female nobles of [[Saxony]], and maintained its mission for nearly 900 years.&lt;ref name=FL&gt;Felice Lifshitz.

Beginning in 993, the narrative begins including events which represent the annalist's own eyewitness testimony concerning events at and around Quedlinburg.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt; The amount of detail increases significantly from 1008 onwards, leading some analysts to conclude that 1008 was the actual date that the Annals were first compiled, although Robert Holzman argues for a start date of 1000.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;{{cite book|last=Chase|first=Colin|author-link=Colin Robert Chase|year=1997|title=The Dating of Beowulf|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWs1Wvp0otAC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=annals++quedlinburg | isbn=978-0-8020-7879-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the annalist temporarily abandoned the project between 1016 and 1021.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt; The exact reasons for this suspension of the work are unknown. Work on the project continued between 1021 and 1030, when its authors were able to report a military victory against [[Mieszko II]].

The primary task of the annalists was to record the heritage of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] and of Quedlinburg itself. The Annals incorporate the stories of a number of historic and legendary figures such as [[Attila the Hun]], King [[Dietrich of the Goths]], and others.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt; The historian [[Felice Lifshitz]] has suggested that the amount of [[saga]] material integrated into its narrative is without parallel.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt;

The Annals of Quedlinburg became an important research source; during the 12th century they were used by at least five contemporary historians. Felice Lifshitz asserts that the Annals of Quedlinburg played a key role in shaping the ways in which influential [[Germans]] of the 19th and 20th centuries saw their medieval past.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt; They continue to be analyzed in other contexts: by scholars of ''[[Beowulf]]'' discussing its use of the term ''Hugones'' to mean [[Franks]], by [[climate change|climatologists]], and in a book discussing fear of the [[Millennium (disambiguation)|millennium]].&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stothers |first=Richard B. |date=August 1998 |title=Far Reach of the Tenth Century Eldgjá Eruption, Iceland |journal=Climatic Change |volume=39 |issue=4 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1998/1998_Stothers_1.pdf |doi=10.1023/A:1005323724072 |pages=715 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021085544/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1998/1998_Stothers_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Howard S.|year=2003|title=The Apocalyptic Year 1000: Religious Expectation and Social Change, 950-1050

==Mention of Lithuania==

The first written occurrence of [[Lithuania]]'s [[Name of Lithuania|name]] has been traced to the Quedlinburg Annals and dated to 9 March 1009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Origin of the Name of Lithuania | journal=Lituanus |url=http://www.lituanus.org/2009/09_3_02%20Baranauskas.html | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=Fall 2009 | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | issn=0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard C.

"[In 1009] St. Bruno, an archbishop and monk, who was called Boniface, was slain by [[Pagan]]s during the 11th year of this conversion at the [[Rus (region)|Rus]] and [[Lithuania]]n border, and along with 18 of his followers, entered heaven on March 9th."}}

From other sources that describe [[Bruno of Querfurt]], it is clear that this missionary attempted to Christianize the pagan king [[Netimer]] and his subjects.&lt;ref name=AB2&gt;Alfredas Bumblauskas.

[[File:Anonymi Barensis Chronicon (Pellegrino, 1643).jpg|thumb|right|1643 ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the chronicle]]
'''''Anonymi Barensis Chronicon''''' is a medieval [[Italy|Italian]] [[annals|annalistic]] [[chronicle]].

Composed in [[Latin]] by an anonymous author from [[Bari]] in the first quarter of the 12th century, it covers the years 855–1118, concentrating first and foremost on the events in Bari and [[Apulia]]. The [[First Crusade]] is followed in some detail, however, as are the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] affairs.

''Anonymi Barensis Chronicon'' has much content in common with two other [[Bari]]ot chronicles, ''[[Annales Barenses]]'' and, especially, ''[[Annales Lupi Protospatharii]]'' (with which it also shares the beginning). Therefore, all three are assumed to be based on some older chronicle that no longer survives. The ''Chronicon'' becomes more detailed from the 1040s on, also diverging in coverage from the other chronicles.

No medieval copy of ''Anonymi Barensis Chronicon'' is known. The survival of the chronicle is due to the 17th-century Italian historian [[Camillo Pellegrino]]{{sup|[[:it:Camillo Pellegrino (storico)|(it)]]}} who transcribed the text from a manuscript in [[Salerno]] and published it in [[Naples]] in 1643. In 1724, it was reprinted in volume 5 of ''[[Rerum Italicarum scriptores]]{{sup|[[:it:Rerum Italicarum scriptores|(it)]]}}'', influential corpus of historical sources first compiled by the Italian historian [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]]. In 1753, [[Francesco Maria Pratilli]] published a number of fake chronicles, including a forgery based on the ''Chronicon''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17566">The sports under the umbrella of [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], particularly [[track and field]], use a large number of statistics.  In order to report that information efficiently, numerous abbreviations have grown to be common in the sport.

Starting in 1948 by [[Bert Nelson (publisher)|Bert Nelson]] and [[Cordner Nelson]], ''[[Track and Field News]]'' became the leader in creating and defining abbreviations in this field.  But these abbreviations have also been adopted by, among others, the [[IAAF]]; the world governing body, various domestic governing bodies, the [[Association of Track and Field Statisticians]], the [[Association of Road Racing Statisticians]], the [[Associated Press]] and the individual media outlets who receive their reports.  These abbreviations also appear in Wikipedia.

==Times and marks==
Almost all races record a time.  Evolving since experiments in the 1930s, to their official use at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] and official acceptance in 1977, [[fully automatic timing|fully automatic times]] have become common.  As this evolution has occurred, the rare early times were specified as FAT times.  As they are now commonplace, automatic times are now expressed using the hundredths of a second.  Hand times (watches operated by human beings) are not regarded as accurate and thus are only accepted to the accuracy of a tenth of a second even when the watch displays greater accuracy.  If the mark was set before 1977, a converted time to the tenth was recorded for record purposes, because they did not have a system to compare between the timing methods.  Frequently in those cases there is a mark to the 100th retained for that race.  Over this period of evolution, some reports show hand times also followed with an "h" or "ht" to distinguish hand times.

With two different timing methods came the inevitable desire to compare times.  ''Track and Field News'' initiated adding .24 to hand times as a conversion factor.  Many electronic hand stopwatches display times to the hundredth.  Frequently those readings are recorded, but are not accepted as valid (leading to confused results).  Some low level meets have even hand timed runners and have switched places according to the time displayed on the stopwatch.  All of this is, of course, wrong.  Hand times are not accurate enough to be accepted for record purposes for short races.  [[Mental chronometry|Human reaction time]] is not perfectly identical between different human beings.  Hand times involve human beings reacting, pushing the stopwatch button when they see the smoke or hear the sound of the [[Starting pistol]], then reacting (possibly anticipating) the runner crossing the finish line.  The proper procedure for converting hand times would be to round any hundredths up to the next higher even tenth of a second and then add the .24 to get a time for comparison purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocmstrackmeet.com/fat-vs-handheld-times.html|title=FAT vs Handheld Times|author=|date=|website=Gordie Richardson Oakland County 7th &amp; 8th Grade Track Meet|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But many meets displayed the converted marks accurate to the hundredth making the results look like they were taken with fully automatic timing.  In these cases, some meets have displayed a 4 or a 0 in the hundredths column for all races.  When detected, reports of these times are followed by a "c" or ' to indicate converted times.

Road race times are only considered accurate to a full second.  To distinguish a full second time with hours, from a minute time with hundredths of a second, colons are used to separate hours from minutes, and minutes from seconds.  A period is used to separate seconds from hundredths of a second.

[[Transponder timing]] is becoming more common.  The RFID detection system times the transponder chip, usually located on a runner's shoe as opposed to the official timing of the torso.  Accurate to a full second, this is not significant, but in breaking microscopic ties, the data does not correspond to timing rules.  Most road races cannot fit all participants onto the start line.  Depending on the size of the field, some athletes could be several city blocks away from the start line and in the large crowd, could take minutes to get across the line.  Results frequently indicate two times, the "gun time" would be the official time from the firing of the [[starting gun]], but the mat time shows the time the shoe crossed a sensing mat at the start line to the time the shoe crossed the sensing mat at the finish line.

Occasionally, when breaking ties using [[photo finish]], times are displayed to the thousandth of a second.  These times to the thousandth are not used for record purposes but times to the thousandth can be used to break ties between adjacent heats.  Rules specify if a tie is broken this way, that all heats involved are recorded with the same timing system.

===Records===
Most records are subject to ratification by the governing body for that record.  On the world level, that is the [[IAAF]].  Each body has their own procedure for ratifying the records: for example, [[USATF]], the governing body for the [[United States]], only ratifies records once a year at their annual meeting at the beginning of December.
Until a record is ratified, it is regarded as "Pending" which is sometimes indicated by a following '''P'''

* '''WR''' = [[List of world records in athletics|World Record]]
* '''OR''' = [[List of Olympic records in athletics|Olympic Record]]
* '''CR''' = Championship Record
* '''GR''' = Games Record
* '''AR''' = Area (or continental) Record
** '''ER''' = European Record
* '''NR''' = [[National records in athletics|National Record]] (for a specific country)
* '''MR''' = [[List of Meet Records in Athletics|Meet Record]]
* '''DLR''' = [[IAAF Diamond League|Diamond League]] Record
When a '''J''' is added, it indicates a junior record (if a junior does not reach their 20th birthday in the calendar year of the mark)
* '''WJR''' = [[List of world junior records in athletics|World Junior Record]]
* '''AJR''' = Area (or continental) Junior Record
* '''NJR''' = National Junior Record (for a specific country)
* '''#''' = indicates a record has not been accepted, or there is some sort of irregularity with a result
* '''X''' = indicates the athlete has been disqualified after the performance (usually, this is for  taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]])

===Bests===
Some records are ratified or tracked, but they are not to the same standard of quality or accuracy as a record.  The term is "bests."  IAAF lists bests for the Youth division and for [[road running|road racing]] records such as the [[marathon]].  It also tracks athlete personal achievements as bests.  A '''Y''' indicates Youth.  A youth athlete has not reached or will not reach their 18th birthday in the calendar year of competition.

* '''WYB''' = [[List of world youth bests in athletics|World Youth Best]] (the best mark achieved by an athlete in the [[youth athletics|youth age category]])
* '''WB''' = World Best (the best mark recorded for a non-IAAF world record event)
* '''PB''' = Personal Best (the best mark achieved by an athlete on a personal level)
* '''SB''' = Season's Best (the best mark achieved by an athlete on a personal level within a given season)
* '''WL''' = World Leader (the best mark achieved worldwide within a given season)

===Circumstances and conditions===
* '''A''' = a mark set at [[1968 in athletics#Altitude|altitude]]
* '''w''' = a [[Wind assistance|wind assisted]] mark
* '''NWI''' = No Wind Information
For events where wind assistance is a factor (outdoor races 220 yards or less, [[Long Jump]] and [[Triple Jump]]),  the wind reading is usually reported in metres per second or "m/s"
* '''a''' = in a road race, indicates a course that has conditions that assist the athlete (downhill, favoring wind, point to point)
* '''+''' = indicates a time was taken at an intermediate distance in a longer race
* '''c''' = indicates a converted mark
* '''DNF''' = Did not finish
* '''DNS''' = Did not start
* '''DQ''' = Disqualified
* '''i''' = indoors
* '''n''' = non-winning time
* '''h''' = hand timed
* '''Mx''' = mixed gender race
* '''NH''' = No height
* '''NM''' = No mark
* '''NT''' = No time
* '''ND''' = No distance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.stackexchange.com/a/465|title=What does ND abbreviation stand for in athletics results|author=|date=|website=Sports Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''AC''' = Also competed
* '''Q''' = automatic qualifier in a major competition  See [[Qualifying standards in athletics]]
* '''q''' = secondary qualifier, by next best time or distance to complete the prescribed field size, rather than achieving a place or measurement goal
* '''Wo''' = women only race
* '''y''' = race measurement was in yards

===Disqualifications===
Athlete disqualifications often reference the IAAF rule number under which the athlete was disqualified.

This is typically written in the format (false start as example): '''DQ R162.7'''&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Mark et al. (2013).

In late 2007, the [[Australian Rugby League]] and [[National Rugby League]] commissioned 130 experts to select the 100 best rugby league players in the game's 100-year history in [[Australia]]. From this list, a limited panel of experts picked a "Team of the Century" - a team of 17 players considered to be the best Australian players of all time. This team was announced in Sydney on 17 April 2008, see [[Australian Rugby League's Team of the Century]].

'''Bruce S. Kershner''' (April 17, 1950 – February 16, 2007) was an [[environmentalist]], [[author]], high school biology teacher and forest ecologist.

As a child he resided in [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]]. Bruce Kershner obtained degrees from [[Binghamton University]] and the [[University of Connecticut]]. He most recently resided in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] with his wife Helene. He taught high school biology at [[John F. Kennedy High School (Cheektowaga, New York)|John F. Kennedy High School]] in [[Cheektowaga (town), New York|Cheektowaga, NY]] until 2005 where he established the Environmental Club, exposing many of his students to the old grown forests he cared so much about.

He was a renowned [[old growth forest]] authority,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guelphcivicleague.ca/news.php?n=12 GCL : Ancient Trees Found - A 500-Year-Old Clings To Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has discovered almost 300 old growth forests in Eastern [[North America]] where previously no one thought they existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencebuff.org/bruce_kershner.php |title=Buffalo Museum of Science - Bruce Kershner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910173226/http://www.sciencebuff.org/bruce_kershner.php |archive-date=2006-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the second tallest [[hardwood forest]] in Eastern North America, outside of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]]s, New York State's oldest forest, and the largest assemblage of old growth (the Niagara River corridor).&lt;ref&gt;''AMERICAN FORESTS Magazine, Fall 2005''&lt;/ref&gt; Kershner has published a dozen books including the ''Sierra Club Guide to Ancient Forests of the Northeast''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060609081130/http://www.sierraclub.org/books/catalog/1578050669.asp] and ''Secret Places: Scenic Treasures of Western New York and Southern Ontario''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;isbn=0840391234 Barnes &amp; Noble.com - Books: Secret Places, by Bruce Kershner, Hardcover&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Kershner has won numerous awards for his environmental activism. These include 'Environmentalist of the Year' in 1987 and 1988 from the [[Sierra Club|Sierra Club (Niagara Group)]] and the [[Adirondack Mountain Club]], and 'Environmentalist of the Year in New York State' in 1996 from Environmental Advocates of New York.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060518121249/http://ens.alfred.edu/seminardescrip.htm] Bruce Kershner was serving as the Conservation Chair for the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] [[Audubon Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffaloaudubon.com/about.htm About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608103831/http://www.buffaloaudubon.com/about.htm |date=June 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Kershner led numerous [[ecology|ecological]] studies. These have included studies of the [[Reinstein Woods Nature Preserve]], [[Zoar Valley]], Staten Island, [[Allegany State Park]], and the [[Niagara Gorge]]. He was working on a research study for legal proceedings associated with the Kortright Hills Community Association in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccnmatthews.com/news/releases/show.jsp?action=showRelease&amp;actionFor=598253 Innovative Solutions Achieved in Guelph Ontario Municipal Board Resolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershner died in February 2007, after battling [[esophageal cancer]] for a year and a half.

Effective September 4, 2008, [[New York State]] [[David Paterson|Governor David Patterson]] signed into law the Bruce S. Kershner Old-growth Forest Preservation and Protection Act,&lt;ref&gt;2008 New York State Senate Bill S-4637-C, Assembly Bill A-8145-C&lt;/ref&gt; an amendment to existing environmental law that establishes a first in the nation definition of an Old Growth Forest, compels indefinite protection on state land and encourages acquisition by the state where the definition is satisfied on private land.

Since at least 2009, the Niagara Group of the Sierra Club [http://niagarasierraclub.com/] has presented the annual Bruce Kershner Award to an individual or individuals for their environmental activism.  The award was "designed to honor a person who has continued to fight tirelessly on behalf of an environmental issue in the way that Kershner fought for old growth forests."

}}The '''[[China]] Immigration Inspection''' ('''Chinese border patrol''', {{zh|s=中国边检}}) is the government agency responsible for controlling its borders. The [[People's Republic of China]] [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] is a subsidiary of the co-operating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sh-immigration.gov.cn/mainPageEn.aspx|title=Shanghai General Station of Immigration Inspection|website=www.sh-immigration.gov.cn|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
The border inspection posts of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are directly managed by the [[Central government|Central Government]] and are responsible for specific border inspection procedures. 

China's border authorities serve as law enforcement agencies. They are responsible for safeguarding national sovereignty, security, social order, management, and transportation of important means upon entry and exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sh-immigration.gov.cn/about.html|title=Shanghai General Station of Immigration Inspection|website=sh-immigration.gov.cn|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative work is mainly handled by the entry and exit administration departments of the public security organs of the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Chinese border authorities also administer entry and exit border inspection posts of [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.shairport.com/2012-12/03/content_15980156.htm|title=Entry and Exit Inspection|website=en.shairport.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Zhuhai]], [[Shantou]] and [[Haikou]].

The Ministry of Public Security operates more than 278 border control checkpoints, covering entry into China by air, water and land.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3789">Rank comparison chart of all navies of [[Europe|European]] states.
Some European countries do not have naval forces, either because they are landlocked Austria, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Luxembourg, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Kosovo, Slovakia, San Marino and the Vatican (enclaves with Italy), or naval duties provided by another state such as Monaco (provided by France),  .

The [[Cyprus Navy]] is the naval branch of the [[Cypriot National Guard]].
NATO has a scheme for comparative ranks for member countries, non-NATO countries equivalence is determined against this system.

{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}
A '''contraction''' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s nor [[acronym]]s (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Hart's Rules|New Hart's Rules]]: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal}} {{rp|p.167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraction is also distinguished from [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
{{main|English auxiliaries and contractions}}

[[English language|English]] has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an [[apostrophe]] in writing), as in ''I'm'' for "I am", and sometimes other changes as well, as in ''won't'' for "will not" or ''ain't'' for "am not". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of "o'clock").

The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]]).

|-
| you
| y'-

|}

Some other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of [[elision]], may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as ''wanna'' for ''want to'', ''gonna'' for ''going to'', ''y'all'' for ''you all'',  ''ya'll'' for ''ya all'' in the [[Southern United States]] and others common forms in colloquial speech.

In [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of ''He won't go'' is '''''Won't he''' go'', whereas the uncontracted equivalent is ''Will he not go?'', with ''not'' following the subject.

== Chinese ==

Contractions exist in [[Classical Chinese]], some of which are used in modern Chinese.

Contractions also appear in [[Cantonese]], for example, 乜嘢&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E4%B9%9C%E5%98%A2&amp;oldid=27284238|title=乜嘢|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 咩.

== French ==

The [[French language]] has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in ''[[wiktionary:c'est la vie|C'est la vie]]'' ("That's life"), where ''c'est'' stands for ''ce'' + ''est'' ("that is"). The formation of these contractions is called [[Elision (French)|elision]].

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in ''[[e caduc]]'' (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, ''h'' or ''y'' (as ''h'' is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; ''y'' sounds like ''i''). In addition to ''ce'' → ''c'-'' (demonstrative pronoun "that"), these words are ''que'' → ''qu'-'' (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun "that"), ''ne'' → ''n'-'' ("not"), ''se'' → ''s'-'' ("himself", "herself", "itself", "oneself" before a verb), ''je'' → ''j'-'' ("I"), ''me'' → ''m'-'' ("me" before a verb), ''te'' → ''t'- '' (informal singular "you" before a verb), ''le'' or ''la'' → ''l'-'' ("the"; or  "he/she", "it" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''), and ''de'' → ''d'-'' ("of"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) ''*ce est'' or ''*que elle''.

''Moi'' ("myself") and ''toi'' (informal "yourself") mandatorily contract to ''m'-'' and ''t'-'' respectively after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction ''si'' ("if") is followed by ''il'' ("he", "it") or ''ils'' ("they"), which begin with the same vowel sound ''i'': ''*si il'' → ''s'il'' ("if it", if he"); ''*si ils'' → ''s'ils'' ("if they").

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: ''au'' for ''à le'', ''aux'' for ''à les'', ''du'' for ''de le'', and ''des'' for ''de les''. However, the contraction of ''cela'' (demonstrative pronoun "that") to ''ça'' is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, ''je ne sais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʒənəsɛpa|IPA}}, "I don't know") may be pronounced roughly ''chais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛpa|IPA}}), with the ''ne'' being completely elided and the {{IPA-fr|ʒ|}} of ''je'' being mixed with the {{IPA-fr|s|}} of ''sais''.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}  It is also common in informal contexts to contract ''tu'' to ''t'-'' before a vowel, e.g., ''t'as mangé'' for ''tu as mangé''.

== Hebrew ==

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In [[Modern Hebrew|colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter.  Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, "I saw the dog") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions ''a'', ''da'', ''di'', ''in'', ''su'', ''con'' and ''per'' combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely ''il'', ''lo'', ''la'', ''l','' ''i'', ''gli'', ''gl','' and ''le''.

* Contractions with a, da, di, in, and su are mandatory, but those with con and per are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer commonly used, but some still exist in common expressions such as ''colla voce''.
* Formerly, ''gl''' was used before words beginning with ''i'', however it is no longer in common use.

The words ''ci'' and ''è'' (form of ''essere'', to be) and the words ''vi'' and ''è'' are contracted into ''c'è'' and ''v'è'' (both meaning "there is").
* “''C'è'' / ''V'è'' un problema”&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There is a problem

The words ''dove'' and any word that begins with ''e'' are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally ''come'' does be made so.
As well other words may be contracted the same these two, like ''quale'', and other ones, etcetera.

== Spanish ==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: ''al'' (to the) for ''a el'', and ''del'' (of the) for ''de el'' (not to be confused with ''a él'', meaning ''to him'', and ''de él'', meaning ''his'' or, more literally, ''of him'').

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being ''de'' + personal and demonstrative pronouns: ''destas'' for ''de estas'' (of these, fem.), ''daquel'' for ''de aquel'' (of that, masc.), ''dél'' for ''de él'' (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with ''a-'': ''l'alma'' for ''la alma'', now ''el alma'' (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of ''aquí'' (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + ''otro/a'' (other): ''aqueste'', ''aqueso'', ''estotro'' etc. The modern ''aquel'' (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns ''nosotros'' (we) and ''vosotros'' (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: ''todol'' for ''todo el'' (all the, masc.), ''ques'' for ''que es'' (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as ''conmigo'' for *''con mí'' (with me), ''contigo'' for *''con ti'' (with you sing.), ''consigo'' for *''con sí'' (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).

Finally, one can hear {{clarify|reason=in which dialects?|date=January 2014}} ''pa''' for ''para'', deriving as ''pa'l'' for ''para el'', but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, ''de'' (of) and ''por'' (by; formerly ''per'') combine with the definite articles ''o'' and ''a'' (masculine and feminine forms of "the" respectively), producing ''do'', ''da'' (of the), ''pelo'', ''pela'' (by the). The preposition ''de'' contracts with the pronouns ''ele'' and ''ela'' (he, she), producing ''dele'', ''dela'' (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb ''amar'' (to love) combines with the pronoun ''a'' (her), giving ''amá-la'' (to love her).

Another contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun ''da'' with words starting in ''a'', resulting in changing the first letter ''a'' for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: ''Estrela d'alva'' (A popular phrase to refer to [[Venus]] that means "Alb star", as a reference to its brightness) ; ''Caixa d'água'' (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken [[German language|German]] [[prepositional phrase]]s, one can often merge the preposition and the [[article (grammar)|article]]; for example, ''von dem'' becomes ''vom'', ''zu dem'' becomes ''zum'', or ''an das'' becomes ''ans''. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, ''aufm'' for ''auf dem'', ''unterm'' for ''unter dem'', etc. are also  used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun ''es'' often contracts to ''{{'}}s'' (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting ''Wie geht es?'' is usually encountered in the contracted form ''Wie geht's?''.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===

[[Dialectology|Regional dialects]] of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's [[Standard German]] was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as ''in den'' becoming ''in'n'' (sometimes ''im'') or ''haben wir'' becoming ''hamwer'', ''hammor'', ''hemmer'', or ''hamma'' depending on local intonation preferences. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]] features several more contractions such as ''gesund sind wir'' becoming ''xund samma'' which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German ''wir'' exists alongside Bavarian ''mir'', or ''mia'', with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has as his catchphrase "Schau mer mal" ("Schauen wir einmal" - in English "let's have a look"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, "Schau'n Mer Mal".

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: ''Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?'' is spoken as ''Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?''

Several [[West Central German]] dialects along the [[Rhine River]] have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of [[liaison (French)|"liaison"]] is used. So, ''[Dat] kriegst Du nicht'' may become ''Kressenit'', or ''Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt'' may become ''Lomejon haschjesaat''.

Mostly, there are no binding [[orthography|orthographies]] for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to  degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are "jakke" for "jeg har ikke", meaning "I do not have" and "dække" for "det er ikke", meaning "there is not". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] words like {{wt|nb|jeg}}, {{wt|nb|du}}, {{wt|nb|deg}}, {{wt|nb|det}}, {{wt|nb|har}} or {{wt|nb|ikke}}. The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is "Det ordner seg av seg selv" in standard written [[Bokmål]], meaning "It will sort itself out" could become "dånesæsæsjæl" (note the letters [[Å]] and [[Æ]], and the word "sjæl", as an [[eye dialect]] spelling of {{wt|nb|selv}}). [[R-dropping]], being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway {{which|date=March 2018}}, but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like {{IPA|/ə/}}.

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official [[Norwegian orthography|orthography]]. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb ''nolo'' (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of ''non volo'' (''volo'' meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (''-ssu'') for です (''desu'') and すいません (''suimasen'') for すみません (''sumimasen''). では (''dewa'') is often contracted to じゃ (''ja''). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (''no'') is contracted to simply ん (''n'').

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (''-te''), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:

{| class="wikitable"

| ''-nakute wa''
| {{lang|ja|～なくちゃ}}
| ''-nakucha''
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated ''ikimasu'' (go) and the verb ''kimasu'' (come).

The ending ～なければ (''-nakereba'') can be contracted to ～なきゃ (''-nakya'') when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (''ikanakya (ikenai)'') "I have to go."

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (''nanika'') "something" is contracted to なんか (''nanka'') to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of "sort of," but which can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English "like."
* じゃない (''ja nai'') "is not" is contracted to じゃん (''jan'') which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker's belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (''ii jan!'') "What, it's fine!"
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (''to iu'') is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (''-tte/-te/-ttsū'') to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (''to ieba''), the conditional form of という (''to iu'') mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (''-tte ba'') to show the speaker's annoyance at the listener's failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (''mō ii tte ba!''), “I already told you I don't want to talk about it anymore!”.
* The common words だ (''da'') and です (''desu'') are older contractions that originate from である (''de aru'') and でございます (''de gozaimasu''). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (''de aru'') is used in place of だ (''da'').
* The [[Japanese pronouns|first-person singular pronoun]] 私 is pronounced わたくし (''watakushi'') in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(''watashi'') in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women's speech to あたし (''atashi'').

Various [[Japanese dialects|dialects of Japanese]] also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==

In the [[Polish language]] pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are ''go'' and ''mu''. The non-contracted forms are ''jego'' (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and ''jemu'', respectively. The [[clitic]] ''-ń'' which stands for ''niego'' (him) as in ''dlań'' (''dla niego'') is more common in literature.  The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ksiazka.pdf (p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uyghur ==

[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]], includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of [[compound verb]]s ([[serial verb construction|serial verbs]]). For instance, ''sëtip alidu'' (sell-manage, "manage to sell") is usually written and pronounced ''sëtivaldu'', with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] [[lenition|leniting]] into a [v] or [w].{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like "at" and "ay." In this chart, the "@" represents any vowel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4457">The '''Corporate Bodies Authority File''' ({{lang-de|Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei}}) or '''GKD''' is a German [[authority control]] for the organisation of corporation names (corporate bodies) from [[Library catalog|catalogues]]. It is used mainly for [[documentation]] in [[libraries]]. Like the [[Subject Headings Authority File]] (''Schlagwortnormdatei'' or SWD) and the [[Name Authority File]] (''Personennamendatei'' or PND), the GKD is looked after and updated by the [[German National Library]] (DNB), the [[Bavarian State Library]], the [[Berlin State Library]] and, since 1997, the [[Austrian National Library]], several [[library network]]s taking part. The responsible editor is the State Library in Berlin. The Common Corporate File was created in the 1970s from the catalogue data of the [[Journal Database]] (ZDB). In April 2004 it contained more than 915,000 records.

Since April 2012 GKD, SWD and PND are part of the [[Integrated Authority File]] (''Gemeinsame Normdatei'' or GND).

[[File:GKD mirofiche 1988 05 all.jpg|thumb|The GKD on [[microfiche]]]]
[[File:GKD mirofiche 1988 05 single.jpg|thumb|The GKD on [[microfiche]]]]

== Structure ==
As with the SWD and PND, the "Rules for Alphabetical Cataloguing" (''Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung'' or RAK-WB) are used. They stipulate, amongst other things, what counts as a corporation. These include, ''inter alia'', [[local authorities]] and associations such as firms and [[Club (organization)|club]]s, but also [[Meeting|congresses]] and [[exhibition]]s. &lt;!-- ... What is still missing here is the organisation of names, etc, with [[qualifier]]s and division. --&gt;

In addition to names ([[index term]]s and [[synonyms]]) of individual corporations, GKD data files contain links to parent bodies as well as earlier and later names.

GKD records are uniquely identified by an ID number, the GKD number. The GKD number consists of digits, the last being a check digit, which can also be 'X' (for 10). The number ranges are divided into quotas by library network, so that, for newer records, it can be determined in which network they were created.

The GKD, like the PND and SWD, is available to information systems in libraries (usually library networks) and other areas via the DDB file on a standard CD-ROM or through a [[Z39.50]] interface - but usually only for a fee. For access to authority records, there is a separate Machine Exchange Format for Libraries or MAB GKD. Previously [[microfiche]]s were used (see illustration).

The search for individual corporations enabled by the GKD is part of many [[Library catalogue|catalogues]].

A link to the name authorities of the Library of Congress is provided. A link to [[Wikipedia]] is still in the planning stage.

== Examples of a GKD file ==
;ID Number (''ID-Nummer'') : 2144828-0
;Entry (''Ansetzung'') : Institut für Bibliothekswissenschaft &amp;lt;Berlin&amp;gt;
;Remarks (''Bemerkung'') : Quelle: telM an DBL
;Abbreviation (''Abkürzung'') : IfB
;Corporation dates (''Daten zur Körperschaft'') : 1.&amp;nbsp;Oktober 1994 -

;Second reference (''2. Verweisung'') : Universität &amp;lt;Berlin, Humboldt-Universität&amp;gt; / Philosophische Fakultät &amp;lt;1&amp;gt; / Institut für Bibliothekswissenschaft
;Former name (''Früherer Name'') (Reference to its own record): Institut für Bibliothekswissenschaft und Wissenschaftliche Information &amp;lt;Berlin&amp;gt;
;State code (''Ländercode'') : XA-DE

See [[General Store]] for more general information
{{coord|52|31|22.78|N|2|4|37.57|W|region:GB|display=title}}

==The Building==
Gregory's was originally a pair of houses built on Lawrence Lane, [[Old Hill]], in 1883 by Charles Gregory, an iron worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Interactive Map|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/gregorys-general-store/19.htm#.URTjcaVLNtE|work=Gregory's General Store|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=8/2/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1900s the houses were converted to a double fronted shop with living accommodation up stairs for the family. The two houses were originally separated by a central tunnel or 'entry' to the back garden.&lt;ref name=Gregorys&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|isbn=978-0-9562031-2-0|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating as a General Store==
Gregory's held a wide variety of stock, meat and fresh produce was served from the right hand counter, this included; bacon, ham, beef [[suet]], butter, cheese, eggs, homemade [[faggot (food)|faggot]]s, [[tripe]] and cow heel. The left hand counter sold various other items including sweets, cigarettes, clothes, hats and haberdashery items. The middle counter sold groceries and green grocery, however most of the fruit and vegetables would have been displayed outside the shop. Fruit and vegetable would have been available on a seasonal basis, and not all fruit and veg would be available all the time like we are used to today. Gregory's General Store catered for those on low wages, often allowing eggs to be sold individually and half loaves to be brought. Common essential items like tea, [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] and butter would be sold by the penny's worth.&lt;ref name=Gregorys /&gt; Mrs Gregory also allowed customers to have items on the tick, meaning that she would give them the items on the basis that they would pay her when they received their [[wages]]. She would write what each customer owed in a book and tick their names off after they had paid her, hence the phrase 'on the tick'.&lt;ref name=Notes&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Gregory's General Store|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a Museum Exhibit==
Gregory's General store was rebuilt at the Black Country Living Museum in 1980 and is set as it would have been in the 1925

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Gullveig''' is a being who was speared by the [[Æsir]], burnt three times, and yet thrice reborn. Upon her third rebirth, Gullveig's name becomes '''Heiðr''' and she is described as a knowledgeable and skillful [[völva]]. Gullveig/Heiðr is solely attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have variously proposed that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as the goddess [[Freyja]], that Gullveig's death may have been connected to corruption by way of gold among the Æsir, and/or that Gullveig's treatment by the Æsir may have led to the [[Æsir–Vanir War]].

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the [[Old Norse]] name ''Gullveig'' is problematic. The first element, ''Gull-'', means "gold", yet the second element, ''veig'', is murky (a situation shared with the Old Norse personal names ''Rannveig'', ''Sölveig'', and ''Thórveig''). ''Veig'' may sometimes mean "alcoholic drink", "power, strength", and sometimes also "gold". The name ''Heiðr'' (Old Norse "fame", in adjective form "bright, clear") is semantically related; scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] comments that although Gullveig's name changes to ''Heiðr'', the meaning still remains basically the same.{{sfn|Simek|1996|p=123}}{{sfn|Simek|1996|p=124}} ''Heiðr'' is sometimes anglicized as '''Heith''', '''Heid''', or '''Heidi'''.

==Attestations==
Gullveig is solely attested in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]''. In the poem, a [[völva]] recalls that Gullveig was pierced by spears before being burnt three times in the hall of Hárr (''Hárr'' is one of [[List of names of Odin|Odin's various names]]), and yet was three times reborn. The völva says that, presumably after Gullveig's burning, she was called ''Heiðr'' and that Heiðr was a knowledgeable völva who could perform great feats:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:She that remembers, the first on earth,
:when Gullveig they with lances pierced,
:and in the high one's hall her burnt,
:thrice burnt, thrice brought forth, 
:oft not seldom; yet she still lives.
:Heidi they called her, whitherso'er she came,
:the well-foreseeing Vala:
:wolves she tamed, magic arts she knew, magic arts practiced;
:ever she was the joy of evil people.&lt;ref name="THORPE4"&gt;Thorpe (1907:4).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:The war I remember, the first in the world,
:When the gods with spears had smitten Gollveig,
:And in the hall of Hor had burned her,
:Three times burned, and three times born,
:Oft and again, yet ever she lives.
:Heith they named her who sought their home
:The wide-seeing witch, in magic wise;
:Minds she bewitched that were moved by her magic,
:To evil women a joy she was.&lt;ref name="BELLOWS10"&gt;Bellows (1923:10).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A description of the [[Æsir–Vanir War]] follows and the poem continues thereafter.

==Theories==
Starting with scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]], scholars such as [[Rudolf Simek]] and [[John Lindow]] have theorized that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the Æsir somehow led to the events of the Æsir–Vanir War.{{sfn|Simek|1996|p=123}}{{sfn|Simek|1996|p=124}}&lt;ref name=FREYJA-GULLVEIG&gt;Lindow (2002:155), and Orchard (1997:67).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kazan Chronicle''''' (Russian: Казанская летопись) or '''''Story of the [[Kazan Khanate|Tsardom of Kazan]]''''' (Russian: История Казанского Царства) is a document written between 1560 and 1565 by a [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] chronicler. The chronicler introduces himself as a Russian who was held in captivity in [[Kazan]] for about 20 years until [[Ivan the Terrible]] sacked Kazan in 1552. In some sources his name is given as Ioann Glazaty (John the Big Eyes). While in captivity, the chronicler assumed [[Islam]], which gave him substantial freedom to explore the local customs. The document deals with events from formation of [[Kazan Khanate]] in the first half of 15th century until its annexion in 1552. The authenticity of events, particularly events before the date when the chronicler came to Kazan, is doubtful. The chronicle contains numerous errors, and what appears to be complete fiction, mixed with genuine historical data. The ''Chronicle'' was first published in print in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1790.

Foley was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|class of 2013]].

Foley has wrestled under his real name and various personas, including Dude Love, Cactus Jack and Mankind, also known as the "Three Faces of Foley". He is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] (three [[WWE Championship|WWF Championships]] and one [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]), an eleven-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] (eight [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]], two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]s and one [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]), a one-time [[TNA King of the Mountain Championship|TNA Legends Champion]] and the inaugural [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]].

== Background ==
Foley was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. He has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, Foley's family moved to [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|East Setauket, New York]], where Foley attended [[Ward Melville High School]], played [[lacrosse]], and [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestled]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 11–12, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Foley is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pscp.tv/JOEdotie/1zqJVRoaBMDJB?t=120|title=JOE.ie @JOEdotie|first=Twitter|last=Inc|website=Periscope}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley was a high school classmate of actor [[Kevin James]]. The two were on the wrestling team together and attended the same college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/mickfoley3.php|title=One on One with Mick Foley (2007)|first=Joel|last= Murphy|publisher=HoboTrashcan.com| accessdate=March 30, 2007|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student at [[State University of New York at Cortland]], he hitchhiked to [[Madison Square Garden]] to see his favorite wrestler, [[Jimmy Snuka]], in a steel cage match against [[Don Muraco]].&lt;ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/mickfoley|title=Mick Foley |publisher=WWE Alumni profile, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mf34/&gt; Foley has said that Snuka's flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in pro wrestling.&lt;ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley/&gt;&lt;ref name=mf34&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Foley had a front row seat and is visible on the video of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s271.photobucket.com/user/jklmn_2008/media/FoleyMSG.jpg.html|title=Photo by Alec Settee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mf34/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Training and early career (1983–1991) ===
[[File:Mick Foley.jpg|thumb|upright|Foley as Cactus Jack]]
Mick Foley formally trained at [[Dominic DeNucci]]'s wrestling school in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], driving several hours weekly from his college campus in [[Cortland, New York]], and debuted in 1983.&lt;ref name="HAND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Mick|title=Mick Foley - 30 YEARS AGO TODAY: MY FIRST MATCH EVER...|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/photos/a.150133228350157.28288.126269440736536/1326472897382845/?type=3&amp;permPage=1|website=facebook.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squash]] matches as [[Job (professional wrestling)#jobbers|jobbers]] for [[WWE|WWF]] TV tapings of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and [[Les Thornton]] (another jobber) faced the [[British Bulldogs]], during which the [[Dynamite Kid]] (who had a long earned reputation as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stiff|stiff]] worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top level talent at the time, such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]]. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.

After several years of wrestling in the [[independent circuit]], Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the [[Stud Stable]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988.&lt;ref name=SlamFoleyBio&gt;{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/foley.html|title=Mick Foley Profile|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=November 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].

In [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s stable. (The addition of "Manson" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to [[Charles Manson]], made him uncomfortable.)&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 131, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to [[Eric Embry]] in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]].  For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers.  When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor.  His biggest match at the time was against [[Mil Máscaras]] at [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout|Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with [[Herb Abrams]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].&lt;ref name=SlamFoleyBio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; In UWF, Foley teamed with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]] to feud with [[Don Muraco]], [[Sunny Beach (wrestler)|Sunny Beach]], and [[Brian Blair]].

He soon left UWF for [[Professional wrestling promotion|Tri-State Wrestling]] (a forerunner to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]),&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] had three matches in one night: Cactus won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]], lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]], and then fought to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cage match|Steel Cage match]].&lt;ref name=mf194&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; These matches caught the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Foley joined WCW full-time.&lt;ref name=SlamFoleyBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=mf194/&gt;

=== World Championship Wrestling===
==== Early years (1991–1993) ====
On September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; After feuds with [[Van Hammer]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]] in 1992, which Sting won.&lt;ref name=mf223&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.&lt;ref name=mf223/&gt; Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catch phrase "Bang-Bang!".

After spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at a [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXII|Clash of the Champions]] event. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at [[SuperBrawl III]]. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.

Cactus Jack wrestled [[Big Van Vader]] on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt; While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.&lt;ref name=mf248&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 248–250&lt;/ref&gt; Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in ''Have a Nice Day'' that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.&lt;ref name=mf248/&gt;

==== Feud with Vader (1993–1994) ====
In one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a [[professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Race won the match for Vader by using a cattle prod on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in [[Munich]], Germany. Foley began a hangman—a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back.  When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows.  During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's ear, and ripped it off.  The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer.  Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] were scheduled to win the tag team titles at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW's reluctance to work a storyline around losing his ear.

WCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[Hostile City Showdown]] on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.

=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994–1996) ===
Cactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia.  After being part of a talent exchange between ECW &amp; WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW, and began a feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with [[Terry Funk]], [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. He had two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.&lt;ref name=ECWtag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ecw/ecw-t.html|title=ECW World Tag Team Title history with his son alex foley|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with [[Tommy Dreamer]]. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said "Cane Dewey" a reference to Foley's real life son, Foley began a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars" &gt;{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E05:Have a Nice Day!|publisher=WWE|}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with [[The Pitbulls]] against Raven, [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Dudley Brothers]] ([[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]]).  Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]'s "higher purpose". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated [[911 (wrestler)|911]]. As part of Foley's heel [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In ''Have a Nice Day'', Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', '''p.??'''&lt;/ref&gt;). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of "You sold out" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater [[Shane Douglas]], who won when he put Jack into a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]] that allowed Mikey Whipwreck to hit him repeatedly with a steel chair. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, "Please don't go!". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Blue Meanie]] to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.&lt;ref name=SlamFoleyBio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mick Foley, ''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Japan (1994–1996)===
At the tail end of 1994, Foley joined [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing [[Balls Mahoney|Boo Bradley]] to lose the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]]. He often teamed with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to feud with Bradley and [[Chris Candido]]. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tamara Fytch]]. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.

In 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname "Tsunami Stopper." Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] forty-six times. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee [[Bill Alfonso]], however, reversed his decision on the grounds that the title cannot change hands by knockout.

Returning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with [[Michael Kirchner|Leatherface]], whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and [[Steel City Wrestling|Steel City]] circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a [[IWA Kawasaki Dream#1995 King of the Death Match Tournament|King of the Death Match]] tournament at their [[IWA Kawasaki Dream|Kawasaki Dream]] event. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]: Cactus Jack's first round was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack death match, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] board, time-bomb death match, which Cactus Jack won with help from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]]. After the match, both men were ravaged by the wire, and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night&lt;ref&gt;''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2010 he wrote that, "looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of."&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; After the tournament, he teamed with [[Tracy Smothers]] for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.

=== World Wrestling Federation===
==== Three faces of Foley (1996–1998) ====
In 1996, Foley signed a contract with WWF and, this time, the WWF did not use Foley as "[[Job (professional wrestling)#jobbers|enhancement talent]]". He was shown several designs for a new character—a man with a leather mask and chains. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask.&lt;ref name="FoleyDVD"&gt;{{cite AV media|date=May 3, 2013|title=Mick Foley: For All Mankind|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 with a new [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] and perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind, a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked ''"Mommy!"'', spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair), wore a mask and lived in [[Mechanical room|boiler rooms]]; hence, his specialty match, the [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]].&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Mankind's finishing move was the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|mandible claw]] nerve hold, which involved sticking his fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catch phrase was "Have a nice day". On the April 1, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', the day after [[WrestleMania XII]], Mankind debuted and defeated [[Hardcore Holly|Bob Holly]], quickly moving into a feud with [[The Undertaker]]. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room brawl]], in which the goal was to escape the arena's boiler room and reach the ring to take the urn from Paul Bearer. The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as "Uncle Paul". Mankind then earned the number one contendership to face the then WWF Champion [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and The Undertaker.

The Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive match]] at [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the [[Terry Gordy|Executioner]], Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at [[WrestleMania 13]]. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. [[Jim Ross]] then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also had an effect on the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.

Around this time, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from [[Owen Hart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted "nothing to do with a freak" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.&lt;ref name="Worldtag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwf-t.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Tag Team Title history|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]]. Dude Love feuded with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], as the two competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, "they" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's [[Terry Funk]] joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], Foley participated under three personas, Cactus Jack, Mankind, and Dude Love. Charlie and Jack defeated [[the New Age Outlaws]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#dumpster match|Dumpster match]] to win the tag team titles. The next night, however, [[Vince McMahon]] stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, [[D-Generation X]]. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[Vince McMahon]] explained to Austin the next week that he would face a "mystery" opponent at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]]. That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contendership match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first ever "[[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore match]]" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his own name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was "fired" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of ''Raw''.

On that same episode of ''Raw'', Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] on June 28, the two performed in the [[the Undertaker vs. Mankind|third]] [[Hell in a Cell]] match, which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]. His character lost the match to conclude their storyline.

==== WWF Champion (1998–2000) ====
{{main|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection}}
Although conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following a couple months of teaming with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] in 1998, after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.

The following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of ''Raw'', while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named '''"Mr. Socko"'''. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|mandible claw]], stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sharpshooter|Sharpshooter]], McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and the crown jewel in McMahon's new [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] faction.

After weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]], Mankind received a title shot against The Rock at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. Mankind won the match by shoving a stench-ridden sock down The Rock's [[gullet]], but McMahon ruled that the title would not change hands because Mankind did not win by pinfall or submission. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the [[Monday Night Wars#1997–1998: McMahon strikes back|Monday Night Wars]], TV ratings became more important. The rival WCW, attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show ''Monday Nitro'' aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, "That'll put a lot of butts in the seats." The move backfired for WCW, as [[Nielsen ratings]] showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the [[The Fingerpoke of Doom|Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event]] which led to the reformation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from ''Nitro'' to ''Raw'' to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.

Mankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an [["I Quit" match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]], in what is regarded as one of the company's most violent matches. During the match, Foley took several bumps, including eleven unprotected chair shots to the head. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'', which shows the impact the match had on Foley and his family at ringside. The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview. The match was also voted 1999's Match of the Year by the readers of ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated''. Mankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the WWF's first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]] on January 31. The two then competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types|Last Man Standing match]] at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Foley would go on to [[WrestleMania XV|WrestleMania]] to defeat The Big Show and again at [[Backlash (1999)|Backlash]] a month later. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called [[the Rock 'n' Sock Connection]], becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. Foley helped ''Raw'' achieve its highest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The "This is Your Life" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |title=Slashwrestling Raw report – with ratings |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |author=Christopher Robin Zimmerman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102112807/http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with [[Triple H]]. On an episode of ''Raw'', Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], pinning the reigning champion Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|last=Powell|first=John|title=Mick Foley New Champion at SummerSlam!|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 22, 2006|date=August 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind's win led to an enraged Triple H to assault Austin, justifying Austin's absence while he healed a knee injury. The next night on ''Raw'', Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H.

Foley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]]. Cactus used barbed wire 2x4 and thumbtacks, trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that if Cactus Jack did not win the title, Foley would retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas. One pedigree later, Triple H had won the match and Mick's career was over.&lt;ref name=NoWayOut2000&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple H vs. Cactus Jack – Hell in a Cell Match for the WWE Championship|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/2000/mainevent|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 25, 2012|date=February 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley left for a few weeks, but returned at the request of [[Linda McMahon]] to wrestle for the title at [[WrestleMania 2000]] against Triple H, The Rock and Big Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000402/ai_n13856891|title=Foley's dream to come true at `WrestleMania'|author=Blackjack Brown|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=June 9, 2007|date=April 2, 2000 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209222307/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000402/ai_n13856891 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple H won and Foley did not wrestle again for four years.

==== Commissioner and departure (2000–2001) ====
[[File:MickFoleyandDudleys.jpg|thumb|Foley at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] Fan Axxess]]
After retiring from active competition, Foley served as storyline [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner]] under his real name rather than one of his personas. Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a "role model for nerds," cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#pop|cheap pops]] into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be "right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge and Christian]], and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being "fired" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.

Foley made a surprise return on the ''Raw'' just prior to [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and announced that he would be the [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]] in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] during a taping of ''Raw'' in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match at the [[WWF Invasion]] pay-per-view.

Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches prior to the final pay-per-view of the storyline, [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.

=== Independent circuit (2003–2005) ===
During his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the [[independent circuit]] from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.

His first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].

Foley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion [[HUSTLE]] and returned to the ring to face [[Toshiaki Kawada]] for the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], but ended up losing.

On September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as "Ring of Hardcore", thus establishing himself as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted [[Ricky Steamboat]], who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with [[Nigel McGuiness]] and [[Chad Collyer]] representing Steamboat and [[Dan Maff]] and [[B.J. Whitmer]] representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called [[ROH World Championship|ROH Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] "softcore". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.

Foley made an appearance on the [[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu|Night of Appreciation for Sabu]], where he refereed the match between [[Shane Douglas]] and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.

Foley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with [[Border City Wrestling]] to referee the match between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]] for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.

Foley refereed the main event of the first [[WrestleReunion]] show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]], and [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] battle [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], and [[CM Punk]].

On February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing [[Vordell Walker]] to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his "backup plan" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.

On February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming [[Hardcore Homecoming]] show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out [[Axl Rotten]], Shane Douglas, [[Chris Candido]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Sytch]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Al Snow]], [[Justin Credible]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an "E-C-Dub!" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.

On April 2, Foley appeared with [[Harley Race]]'s [[World League Wrestling]] to referee a match between [[William Mueller|Trevor Rhodes]] and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.

On April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and [[King Kong Bundy]], which Lawler won.

On May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and [[D'Lo Brown]], which also featured [[Dominic DeNucci]] (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.

The main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, [[Bill Alfonso]], who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of "Terry!" and "Sabu!" and "Foley!" and "Thank You Shane!" and of course "E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued "E-C-Dub" chants.

On July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.

On August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.

On August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue [[Jade Chung]] from [[Prince Nana]]. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] until [[Austin Aries]] and [[Roderick Strong]] chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in a losing effort against the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] ([[Stan Lane]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Dennis Condrey]].)

Foley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in [[A.J. Styles]]' corner in a match against Embassy member [[Jimmy Rave]], which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.

Foley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to ''Starrcade'' show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.

=== Return to WWE ===
====Various feuds (2003&amp;ndash;2006)====
Foley returned in June 2003 to referee the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Triple H and [[Kevin Nash]] at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a ''Raw'' broadcast in [[Madison Square Garden]], he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down stairs by [[Randy Orton]] and [[Ric Flair]]. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of ''Raw''. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion [[Randy Orton]] on the December 15 episode of ''Raw'' and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.

In 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the [[Royal Rumble]] and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]], where Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. The Hardcore Diaries (p.260)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as—Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack—against [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match. On the February 16, 2006, ''Raw'', Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[John Cena]]. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Edge challenged Foley to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table. In the weeks after the match, Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], Foley, Edge and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] defeated Terry Funk, [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Beulah McGillicutty]].

Foley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with [[Ric Flair]], inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In ''Have a Nice Day!'', Foley wrote that Flair was "every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it." In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was "a glorified stuntman" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a ''Raw'' event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.&lt;ref name=SlamFoleyRicFlair&gt;{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title= Ric Flair Critical of Mick Foley in New Book|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=June 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a "glorified [[Stunt performer|stuntman]]" and Foley called Flair a "washed up piece of crap" and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls. The two then wrestled an [["I Quit" match]] at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]], which Flair won when he forced Foley to quit by threatening [[Melina Perez|Melina]] with a barbed-wire bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659|title=Flair and Foley put on great show|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=June 11, 2007|date=August 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209071650/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley kissed [[Vince McMahon]]'s buttocks as part of McMahon's "[[Vince McMahon#Kiss My Ass Club Members|Kiss My Ass Club]]" [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.

====Sporadic appearances and SmackDown color commentator (2007&amp;ndash;2008)====
Seven months later, Foley made his return to ''Raw'' on March 5, 2007, with the storyline being that he tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. At [[Vengeance: Night of Champions|Vengeance]], Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion [[John Cena]], [[Randy Orton]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|King Booker]], and [[Bobby Lashley]]. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on ''Raw'' as the special guest referee for a match between [[Jonathan Coachman]] and Mr. McMahon's storyline illegitimate son [[Hornswoggle]]. Foley then made an appearance on ''SmackDown'' the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of ''Raw'', Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble]] by defeating [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]], but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.

Foley debuted as a color commentator for SmackDown alongside [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] at [[Backlash (2008)|Backlash]] in 2008, replacing [[Jonathan Coachman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash|title=Foley joins Smackdown! broadcast team|accessdate=April 27, 2008|date=April 27, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135314/http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the edition of August 1 of ''SmackDown'', Foley was [[kayfabe]] attacked by Edge during Edge's promo for his [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] match against [[The Undertaker]]. Foley sat out the August 8 ''SmackDown'' to sell his recovery from the injuries. Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on ''SmackDown'', while Raw wrestler [[Matt Striker]] filled in for Tazz on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]''. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that "creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well". He expanded with Dave Meltzer on the Observer radio show that the environment was creatively frustrating. Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008 and quietly left the company.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===
==== Championship reigns (2008–2009) ====
[[File:TNA Bound to Glory IV (93 of 136).jpg|thumb|right|Foley at [[Bound for Glory IV]]]]
On September 3, 2008, Foley's agency, Gillespie Talent, issued a press release that stated Foley had signed a short-term deal with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). Foley claimed in the statement to be "very excited about the specifics of this agreement and the potential it holds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/09/03/6654116.html|title=Mick Foley TNA bound|first=Jason|last=Clevett|publisher=SLAM!

(and, before [[No Surrender (2008)|No Surrender]], "Have a nice Sunday!").

[[File:Foley2009.JPG|thumb|left|Foley at a TNA house show in Dublin, Ireland in January 2009]]
On the edition of September 18, 2008 of ''Impact!'', Foley made his first televised appearance for TNA, where [[Jeff Jarrett]] introduced him to the audience on the arena's video wall. Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE roster]], Vince McMahon and [[Kurt Angle]]. At [[Bound for Glory IV]], he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on ''Impact!'', Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of ''Impact!'', Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.

On November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. [[Alex Shelley]] ended up being pinned by [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]], and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley "[[Finger (gesture)|flipped off]]" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. [[The Main Event Mafia]]'s [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]] were going to take on [[D-Von Dudley|Brother Devon]], [[A.J. Styles]], and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at [[Genesis (2009)|Genesis]]. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by [[Monty Sopp|Cute Kip]]. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.

On April 19, 2009 at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], he defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to win the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] for his first ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at [[Sacrifice (2009)|Sacrifice]]. Foley had also stated on ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'' tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at [[Victory Road (2009)|Victory Road]], commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]]) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the [[ankle lock]].

On July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of ''Impact!'', Foley won the [[TNA Global Championship|TNA Legends Championship]] by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with [[Bobby Lashley]]. At [[Hard Justice (2009)|Hard Justice]] Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from [[Tracy Brookshaw|Traci Brooks]].

On April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]], Foley returned in-ring alongside [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on [[The League of Nations (professional wrestling)|The League of Nations]] after they had defeated [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] and proclaimed "No three people can ever defeat us." Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on [[Sheamus]] and once on [[Wade Barrett|King Barrett]]. The latter was part of a three-way finishing move sequence where Barrett was first hit with Sweet Chin Music by Shawn Michaels, staggered and fell into Mr. Socko, and finally hit with a Stone Cold Stunner.

==== Raw General Manager (2016–2017) ====
[[File:Mick Foley in December 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Foley at ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]]'' in December 2016]]
On the July 18, 2016 episode of ''Raw'', Foley was appointed by [[Stephanie McMahon]] as the General Manager of Raw. Foley has since unveiled new titles exclusive to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]], while also making fair decisions to favor the fan favorites and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding [[Sheamus]] and [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into [[WWE Clash of Champions|Clash of Champions]] the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw. On the next night's episode of ''Raw'' Foley who had promised the victor a championship opportunity would put the two in a tag team. They would later lose to The New Day in a WWE Tag Team Championship match before going on to capture the RAW Tag Team Championships against the New Day at the Roadblock: End of the Line pay-per-view. On the November 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley would place [[Sami Zayn]] in a match against [[Braun Strowman]] after Zayn failed to defeat [[The Miz]] at [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to bring the title to ''Raw''. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on ''Raw'', Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of ''Raw'', Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman, but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated [[Jinder Mahal]], Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with ''SmackDown'' for him in exchange for [[Eva Marie]]. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at [[Roadblock: End of the Line]] with a ten-minute time limit.

On the March 13, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the ''Raw'' roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted [[Triple H]] to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via ''Mr. Socko'' before being low blowed by McMahon. [[Seth Rollins]] would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2017)|class of 2017]] ceremony.

====Return to Raw (2018–present)====
On the September 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw''. Foley interrupted [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] with the announcement that in speaking with Stephanie McMahon regarding the upcoming 20th anniversary of his [[Hell in a Cell]] [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] [[The Undertaker vs. Mankind|match with]] [[The Undertaker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ottawasun.com/sports/other-sports/holy-foley-former-wwe-star-takes-fans-on-a-personal-20-years-of-hell-journey|title=Holy Foley!

Following the show, a Mick Foley 20 Years of Hell special was aired on the WWE Network.

== Writing career ==
[[File:foley-originals.jpg|thumb|Foley promoting his book on ECW]]
Foley is a multi-time ''New York Times'' bestselling author, particularly known for his ongoing series of memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/22/books/a-wrestler-who-prefers-the-pen-to-the-pin.html|publisher= New York Times|title= A Wrestler Who Prefers the Pen to the Pin|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia|date= May 22, 2001|accessdate= July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writing has generally received favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=1-9781400044146-2|author=Powell's Books|title=Scooter: Synopses &amp; Reviews|accessdate=March 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 7 to July 1, 1999, Foley wrote his autobiography — without the aid of a [[ghostwriter]], as he noted in the introduction — in almost 800 pages of longhand.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', Introduction, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; The book, ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]]'' was released on October 31, 1999 and topped ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[New York Times Non-Fiction Bestsellers of 2001|non-fiction bestseller]] list for several weeks.

== Activism ==
[[File:Foley - USO-Metro Merit Awards.jpg|thumb|right|Foley speaking at the USO Metro awards in Arlington, Virginia, March 25, 2008]]
Much of Foley's charitable work revolves around children. Among his involvement, Foley has participated in numerous [[Make-a-Wish Foundation]] events, has made surprise visits to children in hospitals, and has visited schools and libraries to talk to students about the value of education and the importance of reading. Foley sponsors seven children with [[ChildFund International]] (formerly Christian Children's Fund), a group he has been affiliated with since 1992. In recent years, he has become one of the fund's leading donors, helping fund childhood education centers in the remote areas of the [[Philippines]] and [[Mexico]], as well as four small community schools in the West African nation of [[Sierra Leone]]. After visiting the country in November 2008, an experience he called "one of the best experiences of my life; maybe the best,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Myspace]]|url=http://www.myspace.com/officialMickFoley|title=Mick Foley Official Myspace|date=November 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley committed to funding a larger primary school, which was completed in September 2009.

Foley has visited U.S. troops at various military bases and military hospitals. For several years Foley visited wounded soldiers at Washington D.C.-based military hospitals on almost a monthly basis, becoming known as a "Legend among hurt troops," according to a ''Washington Times'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Legend Among Hurt Troops 2005|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/aug/03/20050803-120641-6356r/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having become a devoted fan of [[Tori Amos]]' music in 1993, (particularly the song "[[Winter (Tori Amos song)|Winter]]" from the ''[[Little Earthquakes]]'' album),&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;Foley, Mike, [http://www.slate.com/id/2267815/pagenum/all/#p2 "The Wrestler and the Cornflake Girl: Ring legend Mick Foley explains how Tori Amos changed his life"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', September 28, 2010 10:06 AM ET. Retrieved October 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and following a meeting with Amos at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con, Foley became involved with the [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN), a group Amos co-founded in 1994. Since then, he has worked as a volunteer on their online hotline and as a member of their National Leadership Council.

Continuing his campaign for the organization, in May 2011 Foley auctioned off on eBay two famous items associated with his wrestling career: his Cactus Jack lace-up "leopard skin" boots (still embedded with 149 thumbtacks from his ''Impact'' match with Ric Flair); and the white shirt that he wore as Mankind during 1998's "Hell in a Cell" match, among other items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mickfoley.typepad.com/mickfoley/page/2/|title=Bid High, Bid Often, Make it Hurt! 05/04/2011|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley has been outspoken in his support for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

His son Mickey is on the [[autism spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collisionconf.com/news/mick-foley-goes-from-mankind-to-collision|title=How Mick Foley went from "broken in half" to autism advocacy on Collision Center Stage - COLLISION|date=April 20, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley's sons Mickey and Hughie operate their own [[YouTube]] channel, ''MickeyFoley0105''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/user/MickeyFoley0105 | title=MickeyFoley0105 @ YouTube | publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page depicts Mickey wrestling on a [[trampoline]] with his brother, and [[video game]]s and other aspects of his life. Foley himself occasionally appears in Mickey's videos, including one parodying the 2010 [[LeBron James]] special ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'' in which Foley teases announcing [[Al Snow]] as being his WWE Hall of Fame inductee before announcing the real inductee, [[Terry Funk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKYPuj39Im0&amp;list=UUNyN1gd0esbjx0X1ockoPNA&amp;index=6 | title=The Decision (parody) | accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley is a longtime fan of [[women's professional wrestling]] and has campaigned for their equality among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tjrwrestling.net/mick-foley-nxts-positive-effect-on-indy-wrestling-womens-wrestling-and-more/|title=Mick Foley – NXT's Positive Effect On Indy Wrestling, Women's Wrestling And More - TJR Wrestling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his closest friends in WWE have long been their female performers, with [[Trish Stratus]] calling Foley the Divas' "safety valve" since, due to Foley being married, he was one of the few wrestlers who would not try to date his coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pw-core.com/videos/Mick_Foley_talks_about_his_relationship_with_WWE_Divas/68612|title=Mick Foley talks about his relationship with WWE Divas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6650">'''NBench''' is a synthetic computing [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] program developed in the mid-1990s by the now defunct [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE magazine]] intended to measure a computer's [[CPU]], [[Floating-point unit|FPU]], and [[Computer memory|Memory System]] speed.

== History ==
NBench is essentially release 2 of BYTE Magazine's BYTEmark benchmark program (previously known as BYTE's Native Mode Benchmarks), published about 1995, which was just a few years before the magazine ceased publication. NBench is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and was initially focused on PCs running the [[Windows|Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Independently of BYTE, in 1996 NBench was ported to [[Linux]] and other flavors of [[Unix]] by Uwe F. Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2018-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently Ludovic Drolez prepared an NBench App for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile device operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

NBench should not be confused with the similarly named but unrelated AMD N-Bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | title = AMD N-Bench

  | accessdate = 2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The NBench algorithm suite consists of ten different tasks:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = BYTE Magazine
  | title = Original NBench documentation (archived snapshot)
  | url=http://www.tux.org/~mayer/linux/byte/bdoc.pdf
  | accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Numeric sort - Sorts an array of long integers.
* String sort - Sorts an array of strings of arbitrary length.
* Bitfield - Executes a variety of bit manipulation functions.
* Emulated floating-point - A small [[Floating-point emulator|software floating-point package]].
* Fourier coefficients - A numerical analysis routine for calculating series approximations of waveforms.
* Assignment algorithm - A well-known task allocation algorithm.
* Huffman compression - A well-known text and graphics compression algorithm.
* IDEA encryption - A relatively new block cipher algorithm.
* Neural Net - A small but functional back-propagation network simulator.
* LU Decomposition - A robust algorithm for solving linear equations.

A run of the benchmark suite consists essentially of two phases for each of the tests. First, a calibration loop is run to determine the size of the problem the system can handle in a reasonable time, in order to adapt to the ever-faster computer hardware available. Second, the actual test is run repeatedly several times to obtain a statistically meaningful result.

Originally, NBench and BYTEmark produced two overall index figures: Integer index and Floating-point index. The Integer index is the geometric mean of those tests that involve only integer processing—numeric sort, string sort, bitfield, emulated floating-point, assignment, Huffman, and IDEA—while the Floating-point index is the geometric mean of those tests that require the floating-point coprocessor—Fourier, neural net, and LU decomposition. The index figures where relative scores to get a general feel for the performance of the machine under test as compared to a baseline system based on a 90&amp;nbsp;MHz Pentium Intel CPU.

The Linux/Unix port has a second baseline machine, it is an AMD K6/233 with 32 MB RAM and 512 KB L2-cache running Linux 2.0.32 and using GNU gcc version 2.7.2.3 and libc-5.4.38.  The original integer index was split into an integer-operation and a memory-operation index, as suggested by Andrew D. Balsa, reflecting the realization that memory management is important in CPU design. The original tests have been left alone, however, the geometric mean of the tests numeric sort, floating-point emulation, IDEA, and Huffman now constitutes the integer-arithmetic focused benchmark index, while the geometric mean of the tests string sort, bitfield, and assignment makes up the new memory index. The floating point index has been left alone, it is still the geometric mean of fourier, neural net, and LU decomposition.

== Use ==
The benchmark suite has seen consistent use since the mid-1990s by the personal computing community, on PCs and other devices running various flavors of UNIX including Linux&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Shortcomings ==
Using NBench as a benchmark has pitfalls: 
* These benchmarks are meant to expose the theoretical upper limit of the CPU, FPU, and memory architecture of a system. They cannot measure video, disk, or network throughput (those are the domains of a different set of benchmarks).
* NBench is single-threaded. Currently, each benchmark test uses only a single execution thread. However, most modern operating systems have some multitasking component. How a system "scales" as more tasks are run simultaneously is an effect that NBench does not explore.

==Overview==
Founder Daniel Brandt began collecting [[clipping (publications)|clipping]]s and [[citation]]s pertaining to influential people and [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] agents in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Farhad Manjoo |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/08/29/google_watch/ |title=Meet Mr. Anti-Google |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=August 29, 2002 }} Citing a review in ''[[College &amp; Research Libraries News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially in the 1970s after becoming a member of [[Students for a Democratic Society]], an organization that opposed US foreign policy.&lt;ref name=online/&gt; With the advent of personal computing, he developed a database which allowed subscribers to access the names of [[United States Intelligence Community|US intelligence agents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/online/issue24/lob24-02.htm|title=An Incorrect Political Memoir|number=24|date=December 1992|author=Daniel Brandt|work=Lobster-magazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, through his company Micro Associates, he sold subscriptions to this computerized database under its original name, Public Information Research, Inc (PIR).  At PIR's onset, Brandt was President of the newly formed non-profit corporation, and investigative researcher [[Peggy Adler]] served as its Vice President.  The material was described as "information on all sorts of spooks, military officials, political operators and other cloak-and-dagger types".&lt;ref name="morley"&gt;{{cite news |title=Beltway Bandits: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spywatcher |author=Morley, Jefferson |author2=Corn, David |authorlink2=David Corn |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-6754640.html |newspaper=[[The Nation]] |date=November 7, 1988 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' at the time that "many of these sources are fairly obscure so it's a very effective way to retrieve information on U.S. intelligence that no one else indexes."&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;{{cite news |title=Washington Talk: The Study of Intelligence; Only Spies Can Find These Sources |author=Gerth, Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Gerth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/us/washington-talk-the-study-of-intelligence-only-spies-can-find-these-sources.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 6, 1987 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One research librarian calls it "a unique part of the '[[Deep web|Deep Web]]'", equally useful to investigative journalists and students.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"&gt;{{cite paper

'''Le Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée''' or '''CNC''' (the '''National Centre for Cinema and the Moving Image''') is an agency of the [[France|French]] [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]], and is responsible for the production and promotion of cinematic and audiovisual arts in France. The CNC is a publicly owned establishment, with legal and financial autonomy.

Created by law on 25 October 1946 as the '''Centre national de la cinématographie''' (National Centre for [[Cinematography]]), it is currently directed by Frédérique Bredin.

The CNC archives are located in the former [[Fort de Bois-d'Arcy]] to the southwest of Paris. Initially established in 1969 to house combustible nitrate films, the archives now house modern acetate films as well.&lt;ref name="pajolec1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ipr.univ-paris1.fr/spip.php?article364 | title=Bulletins :: Bulletin n° 26 Les archives françaises du film à Bois d’Arcy | publisher=Institut Pierre Renouvin | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Le Pajolec, Sébastien|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The principal functions of the CNC are:

*Regulation of cinema
*Support of the economy of the cinema, audiovisual, and multimedia arts
*Promotion of cinema and audiovisual arts among the public
*Protection of French cinematographic heritage

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12400">'''Need for power''' ('''nPow''') is a term that was popularized by renowned psychologist [[David McClelland]] in 1961. McClelland's thinking was influenced by the pioneering work of [[Henry Murray]], who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a [[Need theory|taxonomy of needs]], including needs for achievement, [[Power (social and political)|power]], and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book ''The Achieving Society'', A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, ''social'' and ''personal''.

==Background==

===Murray's system of needs===
Henry Murray was one of the first psychologists to systematically investigate human needs. In his 1938 book, ''Explorations in Human Personality'', he identified and labeled twenty needs he believed were universal in nature for all humans. Later research demonstrated that [[Murray's system of needs]] positively correlates with the [[Big Five personality traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.258|title=From catalog to classification: Murray's needs and the five-factor model.|first1=Paul T.|last1=Costa|first2=Robert R.|last2=McCrae|publisher=|volume=55|issue=2|pages=258–265|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McClelland's three needs theory===
In the 1960s, psychologist [[David McClelland]] expanded on Murray's work, focusing on the effects of human needs in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;NetMBA. "McClelland's Theory of Needs". 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His [[need theory]] proposes that most people are consistently motivated by one of three basic desires: the [[need for affiliation]], the [[need for achievement]], or the need for power.

===Thematic apperception test===
To determine how strongly an individual felt each of the three needs, McClelland used the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT), which is designed to uncover a person's unconscious drives, emotions, wants and needs. During the test, a psychologist shows an individual a series of picture cards depicting ambiguous situations and asks them to tell a story about each image. The psychologist then interprets those stories to identify desires or personality traits the individual may be are unaware of or want to hide.&lt;ref&gt;Teglasi, Hedwig. "Essentials of TAT and Other Storytelling Assessments". Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Several empirical studies have demonstrated that the TAT cannot detect mental illness at a rate higher than chance,&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, R.W., &amp; Wildman, R.W. II. (1975). An investigation into the comparative validity of several diagnostic tests and test batteries. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 31, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lilianfeld, S., Wood, J., &amp; Garb, H. [http://www.therapiebreve.be/documents/lilienfeld-ea-2000.pdf The scientific status of projective techniques.] Psychological Science in the Public Interest.&lt;/ref&gt; and the inter-rater validity as measured by [[Cronbach's alpha]] (the likelihood of two psychologists providing similar interpretations of the same person's results) is low, especially if the clinician gives a subjective interpretation instead of using the test's original scoring system.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Meyer, G. [http://psychology.utoledo.edu/images/users/16/Meyer%20(2004,%20CHoPA)%20Reliability%20and%20Validity%20of%20the%20Rorschach%20and%20TAT.pdf The reliability and validity of the Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Test compared to other psychological and medical instruments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, N. &amp; Kreuzpointner, L. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079450 Measuring the Reliability of Picture Story Exercises like the TAT]. PLOS&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the TAT argue that Cronbach's alpha is artificially low for tests with a small number of items, and that the TAT provides a more detailed and flexible description of an individual than a structured questionnaire.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Effects of a high need for power==

McClelland defines the need for power (nPow) as a desire for "power either to control other people (for &lt;nowiki&gt;[one's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good)," and describes people high in this trait as seeking "neither recognition nor approval from others - only agreement and compliance."[http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/acquired_needs.htm]. In his later research, McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation: the need for ''socialized power'', expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans, self-doubts, mixed outcomes, and concern for others, and the need for ''personal power'', expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it.&lt;ref&gt;Chusmir, L. &amp; Parker, B. (1984). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00287808 Dimensions of need for power: Personalized vs. socialized power in female and male managers.] Sex Roles.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement, individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative, more assertive in group discussions, and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Jay &amp; Kanungo, Rabindra. "The Empowerment Process: Integrating Theory and Practice" 1988&lt;/ref&gt; They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others, and to engage in [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R. &amp; Buss, D. (2010). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pros and cons===

====For individuals====
A high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, SR. (1991). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126645 Need for power and women's careers over 14 years: structural power, job satisfaction, and motive change.] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Chusmir, L. &amp; Parker, B. (1984). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00287808 Dimensions of need for power: Personalized vs. socialized power in female and male managers.] Sex Roles, 11, 759-769.&lt;/ref&gt; McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace, especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions. In one characteristic example, a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management. He experienced difficulty giving direct orders, leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, H. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=N1A4rnVMRuAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=power+is+the+great+motivator&amp;ots=2D59mwRrz4&amp;sig=ni33Tu9fZm31DBXHd6qacUEH4pk#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20is%20the%20great%20motivator&amp;f=false Managing and Directing Your Career.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of work, a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility. When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility, a high nPow score predicts higher rates of [[Externalization|externalizing]] [[self-destructive]] behavior, such as binge-drinking and physical aggression. Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce, separate, or physically abuse their spouses. However, this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores, who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Worell, J. [Ed.] [https://books.google.com/books?id=7SXhBdqejgYC&amp;pg=PA851&amp;lpg=PA851&amp;dq=need+for+power+gender+differences&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0NgJuEY-1i&amp;sig=zYNhZiDim0Q17WQAwNFeWJI2reY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DzEnVYS-DdD3oASIgIKgDg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20for%20power%20gender%20differences&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex Similarities and Differences, Volume 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====For society====
As with individual outcomes, whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits, particularly responsibility and empathy. An argumentative group member may prevent [[groupthink]], or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises; a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team, or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates. Even dangerous behaviors, like impulsive risk-taking, can be beneficial in moderation: successful stock traders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296305000512|title=An integrated model of risk and risk-reducing strategies|first1=Jinsook|last1=Cho|first2=Jinkook|last2=Lee|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=59|issue=1|pages=112–120|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2005.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1396803261/risk-taking-propensity-among-entrepreneurs-small|title=Risk Taking Propensity among Entrepreneurs, Small Business Owners and Managers|first1=Carland, James W.,|last1=III|first2=Carland, James W.,|last2=Jr.|first3=Carland, Jo Ann|last3=C.|first4=Pearce, James|last4=W.|date=1 March 1995|publisher=|volume=7|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; often have a high propensity for risk.

===Gender===

On average, men report a higher need for power than women, which may be due to biological factors, social factors, or an interaction between them. Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed: men are more likely to express anger directly, use physical violence to establish control, or engage in risky or impulsive behavior, while women are more likely to employ [[relational aggression]] or suppress their hostility.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately, women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts, but an equal desire for personal power. Men, but not women, reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Other parts of the theory==

===Need for achievement===
{{Main|Need for achievement}}
Murray defined [[need for achievement]] as the attempt to overcome obstacles. Need for achievement (nAch) was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard. McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory. He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures. Based on his/her story, McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived.&lt;ref name="cengagesites.com"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://cengagesites.com/academic/assets/sites/Schultz_Ch05.pdf|title=Theories of Personality |chapter=Chapter 5 – Henry Murray: Personology|publisher=Cengage Learning|url=http://www.psychlab.net/uploads/4/5/8/3/4583362/theories_of_personality.pdf|author=Duane P. Schultz|author2=Sydney Ellen Schultz|isbn= 978-0-495-50625-6|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need for affiliation===
{{Main|Need for affiliation}}
Murray believed [[need for affiliation]] was a trait that was very strong in most people, especially in stressful situations. Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation, people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present. In McClelland's research, he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them.&lt;ref name="cengagesites.com"/&gt;

'''Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision''' is the operating name for '''The New Zealand Archive of Film, Television and Sound Ngā Taonga Whitiāhua Me Ngā Taonga Kōrero'''.&lt;ref name="ntsv-charities-register-details" /&gt; The archive was launched on 31 July 2014, following the completion of a three-year process whereby the [[New Zealand Film Archive]] "absorbed"&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; the collections and operations of the RNZ Sound Archives Ngā Taonga Kōrero in 2012 and the [[Television New Zealand Archive]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech" /&gt;

==Purpose==
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision identifies itself as New Zealand's audiovisual archive, with a purpose of collecting, sharing and caring for New Zealand's audiovisual taonga.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Annual Report (2016/17)|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMTAvMjAvN3V1cm9nNmlxdF9Bbm51YWxfUmVwb3J0XzIwMTZfMTdfRklOQUwucGRmIl1d/Annual%20Report%202016-17%20FINAL.pdf?sha=73e733c59c88d325|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
===Independent Charitable Trust===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is an independent Charitable Trust (CC22250).  It identifies itself as a Tier 2 public benefit entity (PBE).&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; It was originally called '''The New Zealand Film Archive''', incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 on 9 March 1981.  The name was changed to '''The New Zealand Archive of Film, Television and Sound Ngā Taonga Whitiāhua Me Ngā Taonga Kōrero''', effective 1 July 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-charities-register-details"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.register.charities.govt.nz/CharitiesRegister/ViewCharity?accountId=d075b4e1-208d-dc11-98a0-0015c5f3da29|title=Charities Register details|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's new name was officially launched by the Minister for Broadcasting [[Craig Foss]] on 31 July 2014.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech" /&gt;

===Constitution and Kaupapa===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision retained the Constitution and Kaupapa of The New Zealand Film Archive when it was founded in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt;

===Bicultural organisation===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision adopted its bicultural framework from the New Zealand Film Archive when the new archive was established in mid-2014.

The Archive identifies itself as a bicultural organisation that upholds the principles of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in its policies and practices.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-reuse-of-moving-image-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-use of moving image items|url=https://www.ngataonga.org.nz/collections/re-use-of-collection-items/moving-image|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty is part of the Archive's Kaupapa, which in turn is part of the archive's Constitution.&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt; At all times there are three people on the Board of Trustees that represent Māori interests "through their own heritage and/or their connections with iwi and iwi interests."&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt;

However Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, noted that the term bi-culturalism allowed archive staff to opt-out of kaupapa-centred activities.  Even the term kaupapa-centred was largely undefined. Staff had limited knowledge of mana whenua histories and significant places.  Both non-Māori and Māori staff felt culturally unsafe at the archive, with organisational policies and procedures not reflecting a kaupapa-centred approach.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

In May 2016 the Board of Trustees retired the Board's Bicultural Committee and resolved that the Chief Executive would report to the Board on matters relating to the kaupapa of the organisation.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-report-20160513"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Report of the 200th meeting of the Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Board of Trustees|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMDcvMDgvNGt1MzI2NmdzcV9Cb2FyZF9SZXBvcnRfMTNfTWF5XzIwMTYucGRmIl1d/Board%20Report%2013%20May%202016.pdf?sha=66839eab7a59852b|date=May 13, 2016|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taha Māori====
The Taha Māori working group within Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision was developed during the 2012-2014 transformation process. Specialist Māori language and programme staff were seconded to a working group to develop Taha Māori programming and activities within the archive.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt;

The major operational restructure of the Archive in 2014 saw the establishment of the Taha Māori department to "address the needs of Māori collections and users".&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;  The department saw rapid growth, with expenditure rising from $54,257 in 2013/14 to $413,692 in 2014/15.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; However, in July 2016 an operational restructure saw the disestablishment of the Taha Māori department, with its staff split and absorbed into other departments.&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt;

====External engagement with iwi and Māori====
At the time of publication in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2014 noted that there was no work programme to address relationships with iwi and Māori.  The archive had eight expired Memoranda of Understanding with various iwi, and little connection with urban Māori.  The archive didn't engage with Māori audiences and used English as its primary language for on and off-line services, with only elements of Te Reo.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

===Patron===
After becoming [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] in September 2016, [[Dame Patsy Reddy]] took on the role of Patron of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision.&lt;ref name="gg-patron-speech"&gt;{{cite speech|last=Reddy|first=Patsy|title=Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision Foundation|date=October 19, 2017|location=Government House, Wellington|url=https://gg.govt.nz/publications/nga-taonga-sound-and-vision-foundation|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s Dame Patsy was the Chair of the New Zealand Film Archive's Board of Trustees. Later she became the Chair of the [[New Zealand Film Commission]].&lt;ref name="gg-patron-speech" /&gt;

===Board of Trustees===
The Board of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is composed of six Trustees. Each Trustee can be on the Board for a maximum of 2 three-year terms. The Trustees can also co-opt other people onto the Board as needed.&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Constitution and Kaupapa|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMDYvMjAvM3kwYnV5dGhwNV9Db25zdGl0dXRpb25fS2F1cGFwYV9OZ2FUYW9uZ2EucGRmIl1d/Constitution_Kaupapa_NgaTaonga.pdf?sha=4c95b3b96861c803|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trustees are paid an [[honoraria]] of $10,000 each annually.  The Chair is also paid an additional $10,000 annually.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; The Chair must be a current Trustee and is appointed by the Board on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt; Even though Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is largely a tax-payer funded organisation, it is not a Crown entity and the Board is solely responsible for identifying and appointing Trustees.&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mch-memo-20170126"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6042/response/20640/attach/5/Documents%20to%20be%20released%20Board%20meeting.pdf|title=Ministry for Culture and Heritage memorandum|date=January 26, 2017|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chair of the Board of Trustees====

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's founding Chair of the Board of Trustees was Jane Kominik.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Annual Report (2014/15)|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMDEvMDUvMXE5MjA1eXVrMV9Bbm51YWxSZXBvcnQyMDE0XzIwMTUucGRmIl1d/AnnualReport2014_2015.pdf?sha=7ef3e78c309a910f|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ms Kominik was previously the Chair of The New Zealand Film Archive.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Annual Report (2013/14)|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMTIvMjMvOWc2b2FtZnIwMV9OVFNWQW5udWFsUmVwb3J0MjAxMzIwMTQucGRmIl1d/NTSVAnnualReport20132014.pdf?sha=422731a9e58a857a|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had earlier been Deputy Chief Executive of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage when it was established in 1991.&lt;ref name="gg-jane-kominik"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gg.govt.nz/images/jane-kominik|title=Jane Kominik profile|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Kominik's term as Chair of Ngā Taonga ended on 30 June 2017.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-report-20160722"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Report of the 202nd meeting of the Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Board of Trustees|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMTAvMjcvNWQ5bzBnNG1mN19Cb2FyZF9SZXBvcnRfMjJfSnVseV8yMDE2LnBkZiJdXQ/Board%20Report%2022%20July%202016.pdf?sha=a93d982f15949db0|date=July 22, 2016|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 current Chair Simon Murdoch reflected on Ms Kominik's time leading the archive "Her wise and steady leadership during a time of such dramatic change always inspired confidence that the organisation was heading in the right direction."&lt;ref name="ntsv-press-release-20180219" /&gt;

[[Simon Murdoch]] was appointed Chair in mid-2017. Mr Murdoch also sits on the Performance &amp; Appointments Committee and the Property &amp; Fundraising Committee.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-report-20160722" /&gt;&lt;ref name="simon-murdoch-profile"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/about/governance/board-members/simon-murdoch|title=Simon Murdoch profile|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his involvement with the archive, Mr Murdoch was in the media spotlight as head of the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]], presiding over the illegal surveillance of [[Kim Dotcom]].&lt;ref name="simon-murdoch-gcsb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/7752643/Dotcom-saga-rebounds-on-Key-Government|title=Dotcom saga rebounds on Key Government|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the Board discussed the employee engagement survey and sought the Chief Executive's commitment to meaningful action planning and activity.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-reports" /&gt;

====Employee snapshot (2016)====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2014 published in mid-2016 summarised employee-related issues.  These included an aging workforce with low turnover and minimal knowledge management; employees not empowered to use their own initiative; a scattergun approach to professional development and employees not supported because of poor processes. The archive also noted that it was not actively monitoring the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of staff.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

===Transparency and Accountability===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's kaupapa calls for the Archive to "maintain and defend its own professional integrity, independence and judgment in its role as a publicly accountable body".&lt;ref name="ntsv-constitution-kaupapa-2017" /&gt; On 12 July 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision launched its Strategic Plan 2016-2024.&lt;ref name="ntsv-2016-strategic-plan-press-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=New direction for Nga Taonga – an audiovisual archive for all New Zealanders|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=90545|date=July 12, 2016|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik said it was "the result of much honest self-appraisal".&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

The Strategic Plan not only set out "an ambitious direction and challenging goals", but also clearly documented "a range of factors that create real challenges for us and our clients". This included highlighting ongoing issues with the integration between the three archives, issues with management, iwi engagement, buildings, clients, work processes, diversity of audiences, education activities and a heavy reliance on government funding.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

For two years, from October 2014 to October 2016 the Board of Trustees published a report of each Board meeting online.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-reports"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngā Taonga Board of Trustee reports|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/about/governance/board-reports|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2016 only summaries are published.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-reports" /&gt;

In November 2016, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern questioned the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry over whether she considered it satisfactory that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, a private trust, be "not answerable in any formal or legal way to the people of New Zealand except through temporary funding contracts."&lt;ref name="written-question-14886" /&gt; Ms Ardern was told that Ngā Taonga was accountable through its agreement with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-11-10"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pennington |first=Phil |date=November 10, 2017 |title=New Zealand’s television history archive under threat|url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/343410/project-to-digitise-nz-tv-history-lags-behind|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Ardern also asked Ms Barry if she had "considered turning Ngā Taonga into a crown entity; if not, why not?"  Ms Barry replied that "no, the current arrangements are working well."&lt;ref name="written-question-14885" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision itself says it is "accountable to all New Zealanders as it collects and cares for audiovisual taonga on their behalf."&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection and Acquisition policy (2017)|url=https://www.ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMTIvMDgvNW11NWtta2p4M19TZWxlY3Rpb25fYW5kX0FjcXVpc2l0aW9uX1BvbGljeV8yMDE3LnBkZiJdXQ/Selection%20and%20Acquisition%20Policy%202017.pdf?sha=bea9a0451cfbd992|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial working group===
In June 2018, Internal Affairs Minister [[Tracey Martin]] and the Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage [[Grant Robertson]] announced a National Archival and Library Institutions Ministerial Group.  As part of its remit, the group will "investigate options for ensuring Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision has appropriate governance, and a sustainable structure and funding (this will include a consideration of whether Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision  should be established as a Crown entity)".&lt;ref name="nali-tor-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Archival and Library Institutions Ministerial Group - Terms of Reference|url=https://mch.govt.nz/sites/default/files/National%20Archival%20Library%20Institutions%20TOR%20June%202018%20%28D-0784308%29_0.PDF|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working group includes Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Grant Robertson, Minister of State Services [[Chris Hipkins]], Minister for Māori Development [[Nanaia Mahuta]] and the Minister for Government Digital Services and Associate Minister of State Services [[Clare Curran]].

==Professional memberships==
At February 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision was a member of the following associations:&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017" /&gt; [[Association of Moving Image Archivists]] (AMIA), [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]] (ARSC), [[Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film]] (FIAF), Fédération Internationale des Archives du Television (FIAT), [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] (IASA) and the South East Asia and Pacific Audio-Visual Archives Association (SEAPAVAA).

Previously Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had been a member of the following associations, but their current membership status is unknown:&lt;ref name="asef-website-about-ntsv"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASEF Culture website - About Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|url=http://culture360.asef.org/resources/nga-taonga-sound-vision|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archives and Records Association of New Zealand (ARANZ), Australasian Sound Recordings Association (ASRA) and the National Oral History Association of New Zealand (NOHANZ).

During Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's [[#Staff restructure (2016/17)|restructure]] in 2016 the Association of Moving Image Archivists and the Archives and Records Association of New Zealand raised formal concerns with the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aranz-ntsv-submission-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Submission to Nga Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Archive - Strategic Review|url=https://www.aranz.org.nz/includes/download.ashx?ID=147123|date=December 22, 2016|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restructures==
===Restructure (2012-14)===
Between November 2012 and April 2014&lt;ref name="memo-frank-stark-11-march-2014"&gt;Stark, Frank. Memorandum to All Staff. March 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the New Zealand Film Archive undertook a major review of its governance, structure and capability at the request of the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;  This followed the transfer of the RNZ Sound Archive in October 2012, and the upcoming transfer of the TVNZ Archive on 1 August 2014.

Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik noted that it had been almost two years of review and rebuilding.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;  The result was a new constitution, a new way of electing board members and a new operational structure.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech" /&gt;  The new structure came into effect on 1 July 2014&lt;ref name="memo-frank-stark-11-march-2014" /&gt; and became the founding structure of Ngā Taonga.

The long-standing function based structure of "collect, protect and connect"&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; employed by the archive was replaced with a structure that put the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] partnership at its centre. As part of this, the [[#Taha Māori|Taha Māori]] department was established.  The new structure aimed to be audience-focused, standards-based, collaborative and provide value for money.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;

Notably, the Radio Division (i.e. the former RNZ Sound Archive) and the senior management role of Director Radio was disestablished by the restructure, less than two years after the RNZ Sound Archive amalgamation. Radio Division staff were split and absorbed into the newly created departments.&lt;ref name="fa-decisions-document-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;

At 1 August 2014, apart from Karen Neill (Head of Partnerships and former Director Radio), there were no former TVNZ Archive or RNZ Sound Archive staff employed in a management capacity within Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision.&lt;ref name="fa-decisions-document-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-people-2014-web-archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=People at Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision (November 2014)|url=http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/about-nga-taonga-sound-and-vision/nga-taonga-sound-and-vision-people/|access-date=2018-01-13|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129070939/http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/about-nga-taonga-sound-and-vision/nga-taonga-sound-and-vision-people/|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013/14 Annual Report noted "the successful completion of the process to bring together the management and operations of the Film Archive and the Sound Archives."&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; Chief Executive Officer Frank Stark resigned from the archive in February 2015&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; and was replaced by Rebecca Elvy in March.&lt;ref name="ntsv-press-release-20150424" /&gt; Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik noted in the 2014/15 Annual Report that the challenge ahead for the archive was to "retain the integrity of the constituent collections whilst providing integrated services and access."&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;

===Restructure (2015-16)===
The staff and collections of the TVNZ Archive were amalgamated with Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision in August 2014.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech" /&gt;  In 2015 Ngā Taonga restructured the former TVNZ Archive staff, &lt;ref name="psa-press-release" /&gt; and then in July 2016 Ngā Taonga changed its operational structure.&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt; The restructure saw the departure of two members of the leadership team&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt; and the disestablishment of the Taha Māori group, with its staff split and absorbed into the newly created departments.&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt;

===Restructure (2016-17)===
====Restructure details====
The 2016/17 staff restructure followed on from the operational restructure of July 2016.

The restructure proposal was announced to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision staff on 7 November 2016.&lt;ref name="nz-first-press-release-2016" /&gt; It was labeled by the archive as the first significant change since the three organisations had come together.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt; On 9 December the archive confirmed that it would centralise its collections from Auckland and Christchurch to the former TVNZ Avalon facility in Lower Hutt, and that five jobs would be lost.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2016-12-09"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319984/five-jobs-go-as-video,-audio-offices-close|title=Five jobs go as Ngā Taonga closes Auckland, Christchurch offices|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/87348056/risk-to-thousands-of-archives-as-move-from-christchurch-to-wellington-goes-ahead|title=Risk to thousands of archives as move from Christchurch to Wellington goes ahead|website=Stuff|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restructure saw many staff disestablished. Staff had to apply for new roles, and in some cases relocate to Wellington.&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016"&gt;Consultation document, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Released under an Official Information Act request, correspondence from a [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] individual to the Prime Minister [[John Key]] noted that the biggest loss would occur in Collection Services - which encompassed the acquisition and conservation areas.  Out of a total of 35 current positions in that department, 33 (94% of the staff) would be disestablished or ended, with the guarantee of fewer positions available in the new structure.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt;

The restructure was largely implemented by April 2017.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; Employee figures from 30 June 2017 showed that there had been a decrease from 80 to 61 full-time positions since 30 June 2016, but an increase of 13 part-time positions at the archive.&lt;ref name="ntsv-charities-register-details" /&gt;

====Christchurch closure====
One of the main aspects of the restructure was the closure of the former RNZ Sound Archives audio preservation facilities in Christchurch and the relocation of 100,000 collection items to Wellington.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-restructure-proposal-2016" /&gt; Sound Archives had been based in the South Island since 1956, and located in central Christchurch since 1992.&lt;ref name="sound-archives-about-2014-04-15" /&gt;

Staff and unions raised concerns about the move, including whether the material could be safely transferred.&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt; Union members also said the relocation went against promises made by the Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage [[Chris Finlayson]] to keep the archives in Christchurch following the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nz-first-press-release-2016" /&gt;  Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in July 2016 also noted that the archive was "committed to remaining in Christchurch as part of the Canterbury recovery."&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

Contrary to the sentiment expressed in the Strategic Plan, an [[Archives New Zealand]] email released under the Official Information Act, noted that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy had advised Archives New Zealand at the start of August 2016 that the political pressure to have the sound archives in Christchurch had been removed, and that the archive was not wedded to keeping the archive in that region.  Ms Elvy was interested in Palmerston North as an alternative site.&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Internal Affairs Official Information Act request - document release #3 (4909)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4909/response/16420/attach/4/4740995DA%20P3%20Redacted%20document%20Davis%20Documents%20for%20Release.pdf|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fact sheet provided by Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision to Minister Maggie Barry noted that even though it wanted to close the Christchurch operation it would be "increasing the level of activity and visibility that Cantabrians have to all of the collections". This was likely to include Christchurch-based partnerships with galleries, cinemas, archives, museums and libraries.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

====Political involvement====
The Office of Hon Maggie Barry worked closely with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision to formulate a set of consistent responses that could be used by the Minister and others. The text was circulated to other Ministers' Offices as suggested responses to media or stakeholder enquires.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

Two weeks prior to the restructure being confirmed, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern submitted seven [[New Zealand House of Representatives#Debates and votes|written questions]] to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry regarding the proposed restructure.&lt;ref name="written-question-14860"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14860_2016/14860-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14860)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14881"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14881_2016/14881-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14881)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14882"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14882_2016/14882-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14882)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14883"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14883_2016/14883-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14883)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14884"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14884_2016/14884-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14884)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14885"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14885_2016/14885-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14885)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="written-question-14886"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/document/QWA_14886_2016/14886-2016-jacinda-ardern-to-the-minister-for-arts-culture|title=Written question the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry (14886)|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable question which was later highlighted by RNZ news, was "Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that much of New Zealand's audio-visual heritage is in the hands of a private trust which is not answerable in any formal or legal way to the people of New Zealand except through temporary funding contracts?" Ms Ardern was told that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision was accountable through its agreement with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-11-10" /&gt; And later, in response to an Official Information Act request Minister Barry wrote that "though significantly funded by government, Ngā Taonga is a non-government organisation and is responsible for its own organisational matters.  It would therefore be inappropriate for me as a Minister to interfere with Ngā Taonga's internal decision-making."&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

The [[New Zealand First Party]] said that relocating the national sound archives from Christchurch to Wellington was a direct result of the government's obsession with centralisation.&lt;ref name="nz-first-press-release-2016"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1612/S00062/shifting-nz-sound-archives-is-centralisation-gone-mad.htm|author=New Zealand First Party|title=Shifting NZ Sound Archives is Centralisation Gone Mad|date=December 5, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand First Leader [[Winston Peters]] said "The wisdom of shifting archives to an area which is considered an earthquake risk in which 60 buildings were closed after the recent [[Kaikoura earthquake]] with some having to be demolished, must also be questioned. The plan was only announced to staff on November 7 and has been rushed through without professional risk management or sufficient input from the cultural heritages sector."&lt;ref name="nz-first-press-release-2016" /&gt;

====National concern====
The Archives and Records Association of New Zealand wrote to Minister Maggie Barry and opposition MP Jacinda Ardern to express their concerns with the restructure.&lt;ref name="aranz-ntsv-submission-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt; The Association noted that relocating all of the collections to Wellington "increases the risk of damage to these collections due to a severe earthquake or other natural disaster [...] A distributed collections model with the archives held in three separate regions lowers the risk to the total collection."&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt; The Association also noted that "due to continual staffing cuts, due to rolling restructures, most repositories and archives (government, private and charitable) are facing large backlogs of historic collections awaiting processing.  It would be disappointing if the effect of the Ngā Taonga review would be to compound any such backlog."&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

Mayor of Christchurch [[Lianne Dalziel]] expressed concern to Minister Maggie Barry that the collections would be threatened by "centralised location in Wellington, which could be cut off for months" following a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt; Ms Dalziel said she would be disappointed if Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision did not have a future alongside other institutions committed to supporting the city's regeneration following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Ms Dalziel also noted that Prime Minister [[Bill English]] had talked about the Government's ongoing commitment to Christchurch in his 2016 Budget Speech.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

The [[New Zealand Public Service Association|Public Service Association]] said that decades of institutional knowledge would be lost. PSA National Secretary Erin Polaczuk said "We understand there has been little consultation with the wider heritage sector, which is concerned about the fragility of the archive, and the expertise needed to administer it."  She went on to say "This is the third round of restructuring in the four years since the Film and Sound archives merged, and the impact on staff can’t be underestimated."&lt;ref name="psa-press-release"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://www.psa.org.nz/media/releases/new-zealands-history-at-risk-in-nga-taonga-relocation-plans|author=PSA|title=Decades of institutional knowledge will be lost if the government presses ahead with plans to centralise New Zealand’s audio and video archives, the PSA says|date=December 6, 2016|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film researcher Dr Emma Kelly campaigned against the move saying valuable heritage material and expertise would be lost.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2016-12-09" /&gt; Dr Kelly began an online petition calling for the restructure to be stopped to allow "iwi, users, viewers and other communities have a say."&lt;ref name="2016-petition"&gt;Maggie Barry: stop a restructure at Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision NZ Audio Visual Archives, December 2016 (change.org - URL is unavailable through Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was presented to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry and Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/5315/response/17747/attach/4/KI%20Davis%20response%2013%20Mar%202017.pdf|title=Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage document release for Official Information Act request 5315|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-petition" /&gt;

====International concern====
The restructuring drew international concern from the Association of Moving Image Archivists who wrote to Minister Maggie Barry, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern, Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik and Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy strongly "urging caution and broad consultation before committing to any action."  The Association believed that the restructure could have "detrimental consequences for the staff and the collections they conserve", and may pose major risks to the long term stability of the collections.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

===Cutbacks flagged (2017/18)===
In December 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision confirmed to RNZ news that unless it got an increase in government funding it would make cutbacks.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-12-22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018627307/nga-taonga-sound-and-vision-struggling-urges-more-funding|title=Nga Taonga Sound &amp; Vision struggling, urges more funding|date=December 22, 2017|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news report followed Ngā Taonga's briefing to [[Jacinda Ardern]], the incoming Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. The briefing noted that if funding was maintained at its current level the archive would need to reduce its accountabilities.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMTIvMDcvN3VrbGM4NnA5dl9CcmllZmluZ190b190aGVfSW5jb21pbmdfTWluaXN0ZXJfMjAxNy5wZGYiXV0/Briefing%20to%20the%20Incoming%20Minister%202017.pdf?sha=cb1981ef8afd1f85|title=Briefing to Incoming Minister 2017|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accommodation==
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's headquarters are based in the Wellington region, although it takes its "national role seriously and work[s] hard to offer access throughout the country."&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-locations-2014" /&gt; In November 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision noted that since it was established in 2014 it had consolidated its property portfolio: from nine facilities in three regions, to five facilities in one region, with two small satellite offices&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; in Auckland and Christchurch.

===Current locations===

====Avalon (Lower Hutt)====
Prior to the 2016/17 restructure at Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, the TVNZ Archive collection was the only collection stored permanently at the former TVNZ Archive facility at 181A Taita Drive, Lower Hutt.  Since the restructure, the majority of the archive's physical collection items have been moved there.&lt;ref name="ntsv-media-statement-2016-12-09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1612/S00161/changes-at-nga-taonga.htm|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision changes secure New Zealand's audiovisual taonga|date=December 9, 2016|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building contains 20km worth of climate-controlled storage.&lt;ref name="ntsv-tvnz-collection-video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Preserving the TVNZ Collection|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/preservation/our-preservation-work/video-preserving-the-tvnz-collection|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 twelve staff worked there.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014" /&gt;

The facility and land are owned by the Crown and managed by the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name="govt-press-release-budget-2014"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Budget 2014: Better access to NZ’s TV heritage|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/budget-2014-better-access-nz’s-tv-heritage|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=May 21, 2014|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage appointed Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision as the initial Archive Manager, giving it the right to occupy the publicly-owned facility.  The occupancy conditions are documented in the Licence to Occupy Archive Facility&lt;ref name="licence-to-occupy" /&gt; and in the Memorandum of Understanding - Access to TVNZ Archive Collection, between the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection" /&gt; 

As Archive Manager, Ngā Taonga is allowed to use the fixtures and fittings in the facility in connection with managing the TVNZ Archive collection. This includes items such as the archive shelving and air-conditioning system.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision can only undertake minor alterations (such as painting a wall) at the Avalon facility.  Larger alterations need the consent of the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name="licence-to-occupy" /&gt;

The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for building maintenance, paying charges for building services, security service charges, exterior cleaning and grounds maintenance. The Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision are responsible for the maintenance of the TVNZ Archive equipment. Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is responsible for paying utility charges (water, gas, electricity etc.), rubbish collection, internal cleaning and provisioning of toilets and any other shared facilities.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection" /&gt; They do not pay any rent or occupancy fees.&lt;ref name="oia-7896"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request (7896)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7896-avalon-facility|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit 51, Hazeldean Business Park (Christchurch, 2018-)====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision has a small satellite office located within the Hazeldean shared office business centre in Addington.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-contact" /&gt; Visits are by appointment only.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt;

====Hobson Street (Auckland, 2005-)====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision has a small satellite office located within Radio New Zealand House at 171 Hobson Street.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-hobson-street"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/access-points/auckland|title=Access points: Auckland|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From April 2005 it housed a branch of RNZ Sound Archives.  The office was redeveloped circa 2014, with the construction of two studios, a separate tape cleaning area, on-site storage and a small office area.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt; The sound studios were used to preserve the Ngā Taonga Kōrero audio collection.&lt;ref name="sound-archives-about-2014-04-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-hobson-street" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision moved the audio collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;

In December 2015, staff from the former New Zealand Film Archive public facility in Karangahape Road moved to Hobson Street.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-karangahape-close-2015" /&gt; Originally intended as a new public facility,&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt; the Hobson Street site was due to be refurbished and opened in early 2016.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-karangahape-close-2015" /&gt;The site was to include a library and viewing spaces.&lt;ref name="ntsv-changes-to-opening-hours-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes to Opening Hours|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/about/news/changes-to-opening-hours|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the branch remained closed to the public.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-hobson-street" /&gt;

Responding to news reports during the [[#Staff restructure (2016/17)|2016 restructure]], Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision said that there were no permanent collections in Auckland and that the facility only had two permanent staff who were in back-office roles.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2016-12-06"&gt;{{cite web|title=Push to centralise NZ's audio and video archives in Wellington|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319772/push-to-centralise-nz%27s-audio-and-video-archives-in-wellington|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taranaki Street (Wellington, 2002-)====
The New Zealand Film Archive purchased the 84 Taranaki Street property in 2002 for $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; It is a six-level building which houses a 107-seat cinema,&lt;ref name="ntsv-cinema-2017" /&gt; the Jonathan Dennis research library, a media library, as well as offices and technical facilities.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-locations-2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/viewing|title=Ngā Taonga website viewing page (2014)|access-date=2017-12-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809163522/http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/viewing|archivedate=2014-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014"&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMTEvMjcvMWo4dm56OXIzYl9OVFNWX0JyaWVmaW5nSW5jb21pbmdNaW5pc3Rlci5wZGYiXV0/NTSV-BriefingIncomingMinister.pdf?sha=33e2f329e8804215|title=Briefing to Incoming Minister 2014|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2014 amalgamation, it became the head office of Ngā Taonga.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-contact"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/contact|title=Ngā Taonga website contact page|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 69 staff and 4 volunteers were based there in 2014,&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; although the archive reported to the incoming Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage that the building only had 47 staff.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014" /&gt;

In its Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision itself described the building as: cold and uninviting with nothing to see or do unless you are attending the cinema. The building was not insulated and required a new lift and roof, plus a heating/cooling/humidity control system. The Jonathan Dennis Library was rarely open and accessible. The cinema was uncomfortable and cold and not large enough.  The media library was dark and contained predominantly video formats which were becoming obsolete.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMDcvMTIvNTcxYnVwY3Z0dF9TdHJhdGVnaWNfUGxhbl8yMDE2XzIwMjQucGRmIl1d/Strategic%20Plan%202016-2024.pdf?sha=43ace20692f11a4c|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Strategic Plan 2016-2024|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is considered earthquake-prone by the [[Wellington City Council]] and was given a yellow notice.&lt;ref name="wcc-earthquake-prone-building-list"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/services/rates-and-property/earthquake-prone-buildings/files/eqp-building-list.pdf|title=Earthquake prone building list - Wellington City Council|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yellow notice requires the building owner to either strengthen the building or demolish all or part of it.&lt;ref name="wcc-earthquake-prone-building-notice"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/services/rates-and-property/earthquake-prone-buildings/files/earthquake-prone-building-notices.pdf|title=Earthquake prone building notice - Wellington City Council|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wcc-earthquake-prone-building-notice-explained"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/services/rates-and-property/earthquake-prone-buildings/earthquake-prone-building-notices-explained|title=Earthquake prone building notices explained - Wellington City Council|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017 Ngā Taonga signaled to the Minister for Culture and Heritage that it would need to exit the earthquake-prone site and further consolidate its property footprint.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt;  In early 2018 a newly incorporated company&lt;ref name="companies-register-6621053"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/co/6621053|title=Companies Register (6621053)|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the owner of the property.&lt;ref name="linz-land-records-online"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linz.govt.nz/land/land-records/order-copy-land-record/land-record-order-form|title=Certificate of Title Lot 1 DP 53985 - Land Information New Zealand|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of sale Ngā Taonga is leasing back the building.&lt;ref name="ntsv-sale-of-buidling-2018-06-25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/about/news/sale-of-nga-taonga-sound-visions-wellington-property

The majority of New Zealand's audiovisual heritage, managed by Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, is stored in the Wellington region.

Since 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision has stored most of its physical collection in the Avalon facility in Lower Hutt.  The facility is owned by the Crown and managed by the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name="govt-press-release-budget-2014" /&gt; It has four vaults: a cold vault, a documentation vault, a general vault and a temporary vault. The cold vault has a temperature of 7-8C which is higher than best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C), and the temporary vault which now holds the former Sound Archives acetate disc collection does not meet best practice conditions.&lt;ref name="ntsv-kpi-jul-aug-sep-2017" /&gt;

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision lease the Map Room&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; in a two-storey underground bunker built into Mount Cook.  The site is referred to in corporate documents as Buckle Street. Constructed during [[World War II]], the bunker and tunnels are located underground behind the former [[Dominion Museum]] building,&lt;ref name="buckle-street-bunker-mch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pukeahu National War Memorial Park: Law and Order and the Military|url=https://mch.govt.nz/pukeahu/park/pukeahu-history-7|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buckle-street-bunker-massey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Impact Report: Massey University Wellington Puke ahu|url=https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/fms/sustainability/documents/Massey%20Wellington%20-%20cultural%20impact%20report.pdf|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an operational entrance next to Wellington High School on Taranaki Street. The storage area contains film, large equipment and paper documentation.  In 2012/13 the store was reorganised and filled to 85% of capacity.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Annual Report (2012/13)|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMTIvMjMvNHg0OGlnazk2aV9OVFNWQW5udWFsUmVwb3J0MjAxMjIwMTMucGRmIl1d/NTSVAnnualReport20122013.pdf?sha=fa434cba75e9ce63|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vault reaches temperatures over 18C, well above best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C) and paper based documentation (13-18C).&lt;ref name="ntsv-kpi-jul-aug-sep-2017" /&gt;

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision purchased 21 Northpoint Street, Plimmerton for $253,590 in September 2009. In 2011 the archive built a purpose-built storage facility to hold data tapes, film and video masters.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2011-2012"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|title=Annual Report (2011/12)|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMTIvMjMvOHRoeWNkc3VsM19OVFNWQW5udWFsUmVwb3J0MjAxMTIwMTIucGRmIl1d/NTSVAnnualReport20112012.pdf?sha=a90720d91790a260|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; The facility is referred to in corporate documents as Northpoint.  The temperature of the vault is currently around 15C, well above best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C).&lt;ref name="ntsv-kpi-jul-aug-sep-2017" /&gt;

There are two vaults at Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's head office at 84 Taranaki Street, Wellington - a cold vault and a documentation vault. The archive notes that the cold vault is poorly sealed and that the documentation vault lacks humidity control.&lt;ref name="oia-6042"&gt;

Archives New Zealand contributed $100,000 towards the project&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; which cost in total $366,000. &lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; After construction, Ngā Taonga moved four tonnes of flammable [[Nitrate film#Film|nitrate film]] from Makomako&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2011-2012" /&gt; in North Wairarapa to the new vault over a one-week period.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;  The vault also holds nitrate collections from Archives New Zealand and the [[Te Papa|Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-report-20150227" /&gt; Even though it was purpose-built by the archive and publicised as having "controlled preservation conditions"&lt;ref name="ntsv-blog-nitrate-vault" /&gt;, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision now believes the storage conditions in the vault are below standard and not within best practice. Currently the nitrate film is stored at 15C, where ideally it should be stored between 2-4C.&lt;ref name="ntsv-kpi-jul-aug-sep-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision KPI report (Jul-Sep 2017)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6943/response/23572/attach/4/Resending%20last%204%20pages%20of%20attachment%204.pdf|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 public concerns were raised over the vault's close proximity to a newly proposed radio transmission mast, potentially heightening the risk of inadvertent ignition of flammable atmospheres by radio frequency radiation&lt;ref name="oia-7350"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request 7350|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7350-location-compliance-certificate-for-whitireia-park-titahi-bay-dangerous-goods-store|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; - particularly when archive staff do regular “wind-throughs” of nitrate film reels.&lt;ref name="ntsv-blog-nitrate-vault" /&gt;

===Former locations===

====Blackheath Place (Christchurch, 2017-2018)====
After the closure of the Cashel Street location in 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision established a small satellite office located within the Blackheath Place office complex at 73 Durham Street South.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-contact" /&gt; The building is listed with [[Heritage New Zealand]] as an Historic Place Category 2.&lt;ref name="blackheath-place-heritage-listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackheath Place|url=http://www.heritage.org.nz/the-list/details/1829|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits were by appointment only.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; In early 2018 the office was relocated to shared business accommodation in Addington.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-contact" /&gt;

====Cashel Street (Christchurch, 2011-2017)====
324 Cashel Street was the former location of the RNZ Sound Archive, and latterly the location of the majority of Ngā Taonga's sound archiving operations. It was the site of the archive's largest audio storage vault, in which over 90,000 items&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt; were housed in controlled archival conditions. These included early audio cylinders, acetate discs, open reel tapes, cassette tapes and digital audio tapes.  The branch also held publicity materials and documentation relating to the sound collection.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-cashel-street"&gt;{{cite web|title=Access points: Christchurch|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/access-points/christchurch|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation, cataloguing and client supply activities took place,&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-cashel-street"/&gt; and there were also public listening facilities (by appointment only).&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-locations-2014" /&gt; 10-12 staff were based there in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; As part of the 2016/17 restructure Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision closed the facility in the first half of 2017, moving the collection to Avalon and remaining staff to Blackheath Place, Christchurch.&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

====Karangahape Road (Auckland, -2015)====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had a branch site located at 300 Karangahape Road which was primarily moving-image focused. The facility, which was a former New Zealand Film Archive branch, was open to the public weekdays 11am-5pm, with free admission.  It had viewing and research facilities, along with a frequently changing exhibition space. The Auckland branch also held regular public screenings in association with partner institutions, including [[Auckland University of Technology]] and Colab.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-locations-2014" /&gt;

Six staff were based there in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision closed the facility in December 2015, moving staff to the Hobson Street site.&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-karangahape-close-2015"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/about/news/nga-taonga-sound-vision-auckland-is-moving|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Auckland is Moving|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Former collection locations====
=====Henderson (Auckland, 2005-2017)=====
In April 2005 RNZ Sound Archives moved the Ngā Taonga Kōrero audio collection to a purpose-built archive facility at RNZ's transmission site in Henderson, Auckland.&lt;ref name="sound-archives-about-2014-04-15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Archives Ngā Taonga Kōrero: About|url=http://www.soundarchives.co.nz/about_us|access-date=2017-12-29|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415053535/http://www.soundarchives.co.nz/about_us|archivedate=2014-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision moved the collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;

=====Titahi Bay (Porirua)=====
The RNZ transmitter site at Titahi Bay held parts of the RNZ Sound Archives collection.  This site was still being utilised by Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision after the amalgamation.&lt;ref name="rnz-ntsv-agreement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transfer of Sound Archive material and related assets and on-going provision of service|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4928/response/16322/attach/2/RNZ%20NTSV%20Transfer%20Agreement.pdf|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts at co-location===

====Christchurch (2012-2015)====
Following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake RNZ Christchurch and RNZ Sound Archives shared the same building at 324 Cashel Street. The 2012 transfer agreement between RNZ and the then New Zealand Film Archive, pointed in principle to both parties again cohabiting a new RNZ Christchurch facility that was being developed. The agreement pointed out that there was no legal obligation on either party to follow through with the accommodation proposal.&lt;ref name="rnz-ntsv-agreement" /&gt;

By January 2014, the archive was in discussions with the Department of Internal Affairs and the University of Canterbury over a possible combined site at Ilam.  This would house the former RNZ Sound Archives, be the South Island headquarters for Archives NZ and the location for the University Library archives.&lt;ref name="nzfa-monthly-report-jan-2014"&gt;New Zealand Film Archive monthly report, January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision reported that the Department of Internal Affairs could find it difficult to meet the archive's preferred timetable to accommodate the long term needs of its sound archiving operations by 2016.  The archive said it would continue discussions with the Department but it would also re-enter conversations with RNZ over its accommodation in Christchurch.&lt;ref name="ntsv-monthly-report-nov-2014"&gt;Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision monthly report, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wigram (2015/16)====
On 23 January 2015 an agreement was signed between Archives New Zealand and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision in relation to co-locating the two archives in a proposed new specialised facility at Wigram, Christchurch.&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-1-fyi-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act document release (4909/part 1)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4909/response/16419/attach/4/P1%20Redacted%20document%20Davis%20Documents%20for%20Release.pdf|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision said that it would bring the archive alongside other Christchurch heritage agencies and would "provide an enhanced public access service to the region."&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;

Archives NZ is a part of the Department of Internal Affairs.  The Department led the co-location project, with the primary aim to build a new facility for Archives NZ in Christchurch after the 2011 earthquake damaged their Peterborough Street building and surrounding land.&lt;ref name="wigram-rebuild-2015-05-22" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision would tenant 300 square metres of storage space, and have sound-proof preservation studios, office spaces and a front-of-house area.&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-2-fyi-release" /&gt;

Budget 2015 confirmed $6.1 million in operating funding (over 4 years) and $13 million of capital funding from the Future Investment Fund to build the new facility. Construction was scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2016. Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said "The Archives project is good news for the people of Christchurch and a clear signal of the Government’s intent to keep the Christchurch rebuild on-track".&lt;ref name="wigram-rebuild-2015-05-22"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives New Zealand to rebuild Christchurch facility|date=May 22, 2015|url=http://www.rebuildchristchurch.co.nz/blog/2015/5/archives-new-zealand-to-rebuild-christchurch-facility|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the new facility at Wigram followed Archives NZ negotiations with the New Zealand Defence Force. The two parties saw mutual benefit in having Archives NZ situated in close proximity to the Air Force Museum, as Archives NZ is the main primary research source for people researching New Zealand's military history.&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-1-fyi-release" /&gt;

Negotiations between Archives NZ and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision were sometimes tense, with an Archives NZ contractor noting in an email that they would have to explain to Ngā Taonga "in words of one syllable".&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-1-fyi-release" /&gt;  Another internal Archives NZ email noted "the irony is [that] they are getting a really good deal with a purpose built design and fit out essentially free of charge and security of tenancy (and rent) in a volatile rental market."&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-1-fyi-release" /&gt;

By October 2015 the co-location was in jeopardy because of changing project timeframes.&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-2-fyi-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act document release (4909/part 2)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4909/response/16420/attach/5/4740995DA%20P2%20Redacted%20document%20Davis%20Documents%20for%20Release.pdf|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision requested an urgent investigation to find the cost differential between "access storage" and "preservation storage" options at the new facility.&lt;ref name="ntsv-board-report-20151211"&gt;{{cite report|title=Report of the 198th meeting of the Board of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMDUvMDMvOXEyaWFrd2szbV9Cb2FyZF9SZXBvcnRfMTFfRGVjXzIwMTUucGRmIl1d/Board%20Report%2011%20Dec%202015.pdf?sha=92d22b94d8622a1a|date=December 11, 2015|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal Archives NZ email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had "a number of difficult property decisions to make."&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-2-fyi-release" /&gt;

By early 2016 both parties were again committed, discussing specific building and furniture requirements.&lt;ref name="oia-4909-part-2-fyi-release"/&gt; In July 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had an operational restructure and then published its Strategic Plan 2016-2024.  As part of its strategic direction, the archive said it was "committed to remaining in Christchurch as part of the Canterbury recovery".&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt; However a couple of weeks later, an Archives New Zealand email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy had advised them that the political pressure to have the sound archives in Christchurch had been removed, and that the archive was not wedded to keeping the archive in that region.&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3" /&gt;

By mid-September a Department of Internal Affairs email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision were "pleading poverty" over the costs involved, and by 30 September 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had withdrawn completely from the co-location project, pointing to their inability to pay the rental charges.&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3" /&gt;

The late stage withdrawal saw the Department of Internal Affairs seeking other tenants.  An internal email noted that this would be much more preferable than having to scale down the building. Another internal email noted that "there was a lot of effort put into the design to accommodate [Ngā Taonga] which does have a cost implication".&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3" /&gt;

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Christchurch staff were told about the withdrawal in mid-October,&lt;ref name="dia-oia-release-4909-pt3" /&gt; and by early November a major staff restructuring was underway.  This would ultimately see the Christchurch preservation facility closed and all of the sound collections moved from Christchurch to Wellington in 2017.

Archives New Zealand continued the development of the Wigram facility at 15 Harvard Avenue which is due to be operational by mid-2018.&lt;ref name="archivesnz-wigram-notice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives New Zealand public notice about Wigram facility|url=http://archives.govt.nz/important-message-all-christchurch-office-archives-new-zealand-customers|date=April 13, 2018|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
===Core public funding===
====Ministry for Culture and Heritage====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision receives core funding from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage from Vote Arts, Culture and Heritage. Over half of the $5 million annually received from the Ministry is for the management of the TVNZ Archive and RNZ Sound Archive collections.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;

=====Funding of the RNZ Sound Archives collection=====

In the 2011/12 financial year, [[NZ On Air]] funded RNZ Sound Archives $677,000.&lt;ref name="nzoa-annual-report-2011-2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ On Air annual report (2011/12)|url=http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/corporate-document-library/annual-report-2011-12/|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the archive was transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision on 1 October 2012 an extra $300,000 per annum was allocated by the Government,&lt;ref name="mch-press-rnz-collection-2012-10-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2012-09-05"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Archive to be amalgamated with NZ Film Archive|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/115135/sound-archive-to-be-amalgamated-with-nz-film-archive|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the Government's total annual investment in the sound collection close to $1 million.  After the transfer, funding was delivered via the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The archive told the Ministry that it proposed to spend $1.5 million annually on audio archiving.&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry for Culture and Heritage memorandum|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7373/response/24633/attach/4/Scanned%20documents%20for%20release%20K%20I%20Davis.pdf|date=2012-07-19|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual income received from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage was initially ring-fenced for sound archiving. The New Zealand Film Archive received $790,368 for 2012/13 (part year),&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt; and $1 million in 2013/14.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; However, by 2014/15 the ring-fencing had disappeared and the $1 million for sound archiving had been channelled into a general fund.  Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's general funding from the Ministry increased in that year from $2,020,000 to $3,019,700.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;

In 2011/12 before its transfer to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, RNZ Sound Archives had expenditure of $884,000.&lt;ref name="rnz-annual-report-2012-2013"&gt;{{cite report|author=Radio New Zealand|title=Annual Report (2012/13)|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/assets/cms_uploads/000/000/043/RNZ_Annual_Report_2013.pdf|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014/15, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Radio Division (i.e. the former RNZ Sound Archive) had expenditure of $823,335. However, by November 2016, and shortly before Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision closed the former RNZ Sound Archive preservation facility in Christchurch, the archive said it was only spending approximately $430,000 per annum to run the Christchurch operation. This included rent, salaries and office overheads.&lt;ref name="minister-ach-oia-release-5315" /&gt;

=====Funding of the TVNZ Archive collection=====
In 2012 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage estimated the annual net cost to TVNZ of running the TVNZ Archive was between $0.5 and $1 million.&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt; For the 2014/15 year Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision received $1,590,000 from the Ministry for the ongoing "management, archiving and increased accessibility" of the TVNZ Archive collection.  Thereafter it received $2 million per year for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="mou-minister-nga-taonga" /&gt; Two documents were used to inform the initial Budget Bid for operating expenses by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage: a financial due diligence report from [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] and a proposal from the New Zealand Film Archive.&lt;ref name="oia-6578-fyi-release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/3/Signed%20response%20to%20Joss%20J..pdf|title=Ministry for Culture and Heritage document release - Official Information Act request 6578|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2017 Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Jane Kominik wrote to the Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry noting that the archive was about to begin discussions with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage over two areas "for which Nga Taonga has never been funded":&lt;ref name="oia-7081" /&gt; access to audiovisual collections beyond current levels and the digitisation of TVNZ Betacam and DigiBeta tape formats beyond business as usual levels.

In November 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision noted to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage that activity-based costings were not conducted at the time of the TVNZ Archive transfer in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt;

====Te Māngai Pāho====
Te Māngai Pāho provides funding to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision for the archiving of television programmes broadcast by the Māori Television Service and the archiving of iwi radio programmes.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; In 2012/13 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision entered into negotiations with Te Māngai Pāho to provide archiving services for the 21 iwi radio stations throughout the country.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt;

====NZ Lottery Grants Board====
NZ Lottery Grants Board provides a fixed percentage of Lottery profits annually.  Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is one of four agencies that receive this type of annual funding.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;

In March 2015 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision created an online Givealittle donation page seeking financial contributions from the public.&lt;ref name="givealittle-page-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://givealittle.co.nz/org/ngataongasoundandvision|title=Ngā Taonga's Givealittle donation page|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Givealittle is an online fundraising platform run by the Spark Foundation.&lt;ref name="about-givealittle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://givealittle.co.nz/content/howgivealittleworks/about|title=About Givealittle|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision Foundation====
On 19 October 2017, the Governor-General of New Zealand Dame Patsy Reddy launched Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's patronage programme at Government House, Wellington.&lt;ref name="gg-patron-speech" /&gt; The archive established the patronage programme because of uncertainty over funding.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-11-25"&gt;RNZ 10:00 news bulletin, November 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The public donation programme initially highlighted the need to preserve and digitise 200,000 [[Betacam]] video tapes from the 1980s&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-11-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gg-website-ntsv-betacam"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gg.govt.nz/governor-general/blog/2017/10/nga-taonga-reception|title=Governor-General blog: Ngā Taonga reception|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were predominantly from the TVNZ Archive collection.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt;

Chief Executive of Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision Rebecca Elvy told RNZ news that it would cost $10-15 million to digitise the Betacam tapes, which otherwise would be lost forever when the technology vanished by 2025.&lt;ref name="rnz-news-report-2017-11-10" /&gt;

==Collections==
As well as acquiring new collection items, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision manages three historic collections: the New Zealand Film Archive collection, the RNZ Sound Archives and the TVNZ Archive collection. Collectively, the RNZ Sound Archives and TVNZ Archive collections form the majority (65% at August 2014) of the total collection. They are considered public records under the Public Records Act 2005. &lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt;

Notably the reported size of the TVNZ Archive collection dropped by 212,000 items between 2013 and 2017. As custodian of the TVNZ Archive Collection since 2014, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage has never audited the size of the collection.  It believes the significant drop in the reported size is because Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision is currently only estimating the size of the collection. The Ministry is waiting on the archive to complete an audit (due by August 2018). The archive will then share the methodology and total number of items with the Ministry.&lt;ref name="oia-7081"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request (7081)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7081-contents-of-tvnz-archive-collection|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand Film Archive collection===
By 2012 the New Zealand Film Archive collection contained over 150,000 items&lt;ref name="nzfa-website-homepage-2012" /&gt; including moving-images from 1895 to the present day.&lt;ref name="nzfa-collections-2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Film Archive collections (2011)|url=http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11|access-date=2018-01-01|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606081258/http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection includes predominantly New Zealand features and short films, newsreels, documentaries, home movies, music videos, television programmes, commercials, experimental films and video art. The collection also contains items with significant Māori content, including records of karanga, whaikorero, iwi and hapu whakapapa, powhiri, wharenui and marae, kapa haka, Waitangi Day events (from 1934), raranga, tukutuku and whakairo.&lt;ref name="nzfa-collections-2011" /&gt;

There are also stills, posters, scripts, clippings, printed programmes, publicity material, production records and files, personal records, storyboards, props and costumes, animation cells, taped interviews, glass advertising slides, ephemera and equipment.&lt;ref name="nzfa-collections-2011" /&gt;

Dating to before the amalgamation of the TVNZ Archive collection, the New Zealand Film Archive maintained the National Television Collection on behalf of [[NZ on Air]]. This involved constantly recording off-air broadcasts including television news, dramas, documentaries, games shows, music videos, infomercials, youth programming and sport. Māori broadcasting was archived on behalf of Te Mangai Paho, the Māori Broadcasting Funding Agency.&lt;ref name="nzfa-collections-2011" /&gt;

The New Zealand Film Archive collection also holds the Chapman Collection.  Deposited by Professor Robert and Noeline Chapman of the Political Studies Department at Auckland University, the collection begins with audio recordings of television news from the 1960s. From 1984 the collection contains VHS recordings of nightly news bulletins. The Chapman collection precedes TVNZ's own archival collection of television news.&lt;ref name="nzfa-collections-2011" /&gt;

===RNZ Sound Archive collection===
In July 2012 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage authored a memorandum that in part outlined how the New Zealand Film Archive would be able to "protect and enhance"&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt; RNZ Sound Archive's work while growing the Film Archive's own business. The Ministry pointed to how the [[National Film and Sound Archive|National Film and Sound Archive of Australia]] handled both sound and film without sound being a "poor relation"&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt; - a reason often cited for not merging the two activities.&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt;

As part of the document the Film Archive set out its vision for a combined archive. The Film Archive wanted to "bring the audio facilities up to the quality established over the last decade for the film and video operation."&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt; Within the new archive there would be a staff of over 60 specialists, and there would be an increase in money spent annually on audio archiving, from the current $884,000&lt;ref name="rnz-annual-report-2012-2013"/&gt; to $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt;

The new archive would put an emphasise on preservation and public accessibility: "Users will be able to access key sounds and images from the last 100 years and combine them in new television and radio programmes, exhibitions, websites, teaching materials and community projects."&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt; Greater access to the audio collections would come from adding an audio dimension to the Film Archive's medianet sites, research libraries in Wellington and Auckland and other community and educational initiatives.

The RNZ Sound Archive staff and collection were transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision on 1 October 2012.&lt;ref name="mch-press-rnz-collection-2012-10-01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra funding for sound archives|url=http://mch.govt.nz/news-events/ministers-releases/extra-funding-sound-archives|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the collection are subject to the Public Records Act 2005.&lt;ref name="mch-briefing-2014-017"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=March 21, 2014|title=TVNZ Archive transfer - update (briefing 2014/107)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|page=16|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the collection was valued at $800,000.&lt;ref name="rnz-annual-report-2013-2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=RNZ annual report (2013/14)|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/assets/cms_uploads/000/000/061/RNZ-Annual-Report-2014.pdf|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2016 RNZ transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision the full legal ownership and title of physical assets used by RNZ Sound Archives at the time of the archive's transfer in 2012.&lt;ref name="rnz-ntsv-agreement" /&gt; The net book value of radio assets held by Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision was $423,946 on 1 July 2014, dropping to $172,029 on 30 June 2017.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;

====Collection contents====
The RNZ Sound Archive collection is made of two distinct parts: the general Radio New Zealand historical collection and Ngā Taonga Kōrero - a collection of Māori and Pacific recordings.&lt;ref name="santk-website-about-2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=RNZ Sound Archive - About web page (2012)|url=http://www.soundarchives.co.nz/about_us|access-date=2018-01-20|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204202121/http://www.soundarchives.co.nz/about_us|archivedate=2012-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All together there are over 110,000 items&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2017" /&gt; - both physical items and digital files. The collection includes early audio cylinders, acetate discs, open reel tapes, cassette tapes and digital audio tapes.  The collection also contains publicity materials and documentation relating to the sound collection.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-cashel-street"/&gt;

=====General collection=====
The RNZ general historical collection dates back to the late 1930s when the State broadcaster established a "special library".&lt;ref name="santk-website-about-2012" /&gt; 100,000 physical items from the collection were relocated from Christchurch to Wellington as part of the 2016/17 restructure.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;

=====Ngā Taonga Kōrero collection=====
The Ngā Taonga Kōrero collection dates from the early 1960s when the Māori section of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was established.  Leo Fowler and Wiremu Kerekere travelled throughout the country recording hui, marae openings, cultural festivals, welcomes and farewells.  Both raw and edited audio was kept.&lt;ref name="santk-website-about-2012" /&gt;

For many years the collection was held in Papatoetoe, before moving in 1985 with the associated programme unit, then known as Te Reo o Aotearoa, to RNZ's Cook Street facility.&lt;ref name="santk-website-about-2012" /&gt;  In the 2000s the audio preservation staff moved with RNZ to a new Hobson Street site and the collection was moved to a purpose-built archive facility at RNZ's transmission site in Henderson.&lt;ref name="sound-archives-about-2014-04-15" /&gt; Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision moved the collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.&lt;ref name="press-2016-12-08" /&gt;

====Sound digitisation project (2013-2015)====
As part of the transfer of RNZ Sound Archives to the New Zealand Film Archive (now Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision), the archive received one-off project funding of $1 million from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage for the digitisation of the sound collection over two years.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt;

The project was titled the Sound Archive Digitisation Project and formed part of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage (2012/13). The archive had to submit a plan to the Ministry for how it would use the funding by 15 December 2012.  They also had to report separately on the plan's progress at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="oia-7373"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request (7373)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7373-1-million-dollar-audio-digitisation-project|date=March 4, 2018|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson said "This is an important project that not only ensures the secure storage and preservation of these important records, but through digitisation will help make the living history contained in the archives more readily accessible."&lt;ref name="chris-finlayson-press-20130218"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministers welcome sound archive transfer|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1302/S00248/ministers-welcome-sound-archive-transfer.htm|date=February 18, 2013|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in private the money was also seen by some as a contingency fund. The archive had been concerned about taking on the cost of redundancy provisions that the former RNZ Sound Archives staff had under their RNZ employment agreements. Employment contracts at the New Zealand Film Archive did not have redundancy provisions.&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt;

In January 2013 the Chief Executive of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage Lewis Holden wrote to the Chair of the New Zealand Film Archive Jane Kominik noting that $141,670 of the digitisation fund could, if required, be retained for a few years and used to cover RNZ Sound Archive staff redundancy payments. Mr Holden stated "provided that the [archive] delivers the services that have been agreed with the Minister, it is free to decide when to spend allocated monies".  Mr Holden went on to state "With respect to one-off transition costs [...] we remain prepared to consider any request for additional relief as a charge against funds from the one-off project."&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt;

The New Zealand Film Archive/Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision received from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage $150,000 in 2013&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2012-2013" /&gt;, $610,000 in 2014&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt; and $224,000 in 2015&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt; for the radio digitisation project. The archive's Annual Report (2013/14) noted project expenditure of $0 in 2013 and $144,235 in 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;

The digitisation project was due to begin in July 2013 with the aim of digitising an estimated 20,000 audio items by mid-2015. However technical and methodological issues delayed the project until the start of 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2013-2014" /&gt;
The archive was meant to submit regular monthly reports along with six-monthly updates in 2014 and 2015, plus additional reports in July 2014 and 2015 detailing progress on the project to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt; However in response to an Official Information Act request in August 2018, the ministry confirmed that it did not hold any reports from the archive relating to the sound digitisation project. It also could not provide an itemized list of expenditure for the project and said it held no further information (other than Lewis Holden's letter) relating to the possible use of project funding for other purposes.&lt;ref name="oia-7925"&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to Official Information Act request (7925)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/7925-use-of-funding-for-other-purposes|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TVNZ Archive collection===
{{Main|Television New Zealand Archive}}
The TVNZ Archive collection holds over 600,000 hours of television spanning almost 55 years of New Zealand's public television history.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=Draft speech|first=Craig|last=Foss|event=Function to mark the transfer of responsibility for the TVNZ Archives to the New Zealand Film Archive|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=July 31, 2014|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage appointed Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision as the initial Archive Manager to manage the collection on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection" /&gt; Since then, the archive has failed to comply with preservation and access targets set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (2014-2018) with the Crown.  This has attracted national media and public criticism.

==Access to the collections==

===Audiences===
Radio broadcasts of collection material have produced the biggest audiences for Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, with 924,000 listens in a year to a regular archival audio segment during Jessie Mulligan's afternoon radio programme on [[RNZ National]].&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt;

===Delivery times for re-use===

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision estimates that it would take up to eight weeks to supply a requester with a viewing copy of moving-image material or an item from the documentation collection. This was due to collection material not being production-ready. The 2-month delivery period covered research, retrieval, preparation of material, transfer time, clearances and delivery.&lt;ref name="ntsv-re-use-moving-image-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-use of moving-image collection items|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/re-use-of-collection-items/moving-image|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsv-re-use-documentation-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-use of documentation collection items|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/re-use-of-collection-items/documentation|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound items have a faster supply time, with standard orders of up to three items usually available within fifteen days.&lt;ref name="ntsv-re-use-audio-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-use of sound collection items|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/re-use-of-collection-items/sound-collection|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In-person access===
In its Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision noted that the archive had a predominantly white, middle-class, Wellington clientele.  The archive had targeted 'art-lovers' and film aficionados "at the expense of every other group".&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

====Cinema (Wellington)====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision run a regular screening programme in the 107-seat cinema of content from the archive's collection. The cinema is also used for educational screenings and can be hired by community organisations and groups.&lt;ref name="ntsv-cinema-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wellington cinema|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/access-points/wellington/cinema-hire|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the archive itself described the cinema as uncomfortable, cold and not large enough.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

====Gallery space (Wellington)====
A gallery space operated in the Taranaki Street building and featured regularly changing exhibitions.

A news report at the time of Rebecca Elvy's appointment as Chief Executive in 2015, noted that Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision had an extensive range of film-related memorabilia including scripts, advertisements, posters and props, costumes and animation cells which the archive was working to make available via public display. "We want to find a way to share that with the public. There's lots of things that people aren't aware of that they can come take a look at" Ms Elvy said.&lt;ref name="dom-post-report-2015-05-14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big changes for Nga Taonga Sound &amp; Vision|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/68490909/Big-changes-for-Nga-Taonga-Sound-Vision|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the gallery closed in 2015, with the final exhibition highlighting the [[Pacific Films]] production company. The exhibition's title was Don't Let It Get You, a reference to the [[Don't Let It Get You|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2014-2015" /&gt;

====Media library (Wellington)====
Selected titles in the collection can be viewed in the Media Library at the Taranaki Street site. In 2016 the archive noted that the library contained predominantly video formats which were becoming obsolete.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

====Medianet====
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision operates medianet, a digital video resource that provides access to a small curated selection of ﬁlm and TV items at sites across New Zealand.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-medianet-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medianet|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/collections/access-points/medianet|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 medianet had 915 moving image titles available.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2011-2012" /&gt; The number of medianet sites dropped from seventeen in 2016&lt;ref name="ntsv-website-about-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision - About web page (2016)|url=http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/about|access-date=2018-01-13|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331010149/http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/about|archivedate=2016-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to thirteen in 2018.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-medianet-2018" /&gt;

Kiosks allow the viewer to browse by category, decade, title or through descriptive tags, and view full-length videos at full screen quality. Playlists provide curated sets of videos of particular interest to local communities. As of 2018, medianet operated in Lower Hutt, Hawke's Bay, Otago, Manawatu, Nelson, Northland, Rotorua, Southland, Taranaki, Tauranga, Waikato and Wellington.&lt;ref name="ntsv-access-points-medianet-2018" /&gt;

====Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision website====
The Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry launched Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's new website in January 2016.  For the first time, the website brought together the collections of the former RNZ Sound Archive and the New Zealand Film Archive. The online catalogue was powered by Supplejack - [[DigitalNZ|DigitalNZ's]] tool for aggregating content.&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2015-2016" /&gt;

In 2014 Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision noted that the Ministers of Broadcasting and Arts, Culture and Heritage had an expectation that a substantial proportion of the archive's collections be digitised and made available online by 2018.&lt;ref name="ntsv-bim-2014" /&gt; The archive’s Statement of Intent 2015-2018 aimed for 20,000 items online.&lt;ref name="ntsv-soi-2015-2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Intent (2015-2018)|url=https://www.ngataonga.org.nz/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTYvMDEvMjEvODFhOGMydW9pMF9OVFNWU3RhdGVtZW50T2ZJbnRlbnQyMDE1XzIwMTgucGRmIl1d/NTSVStatementOfIntent2015-2018.pdf?sha=3885b144b7558a08|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016 noted that there was still only a small amount of the collection available online.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

==Acquisition and deposit==

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, noted significant issues with the archive's acquisition and deposit activities. The Strategic Plan noted the Selection and Acquisition Policy was out of date, there were three different deposit agreements and there was a significant backlog of material that hadn't been accessioned/catalogued.  There were also a large number of depositors who had been promised a copy of their items but had not received them - with some waiting over ten-years.&lt;ref name="ntsv-strategic-plan-2016-2024" /&gt;

===Collecting scope===

In 2012 the New Zealand Film Archive noted in a document to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage that the archive not only wanted to combine the existing national collections of film, television and radio but potentially enlarge the archive's mandate by collecting recorded music, oral histories, computer gaming and new audiovisual media.&lt;ref name="mch-memorandum-19july2012" /&gt;

In February 2017 a revised Selection and Acquisition Policy was published, broadening the scope of what the archive collected.  This included film, television, radio, sound, digital, moving image and sound works created by New Zealand artists, musical works, oral histories, software, live broadcasts, recordings of meetings and recordings of nature such as bird-life.  The archive would also continue to collect equipment, documentation and supporting material - photographs, posters, costumes, books, publicity material etc.&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017" /&gt;

===Collection rights===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision accepts material on deposit.  The depositor can withdraw material at any time, with the rights pertaining to the material unchanged by the act of depositing with the archive.&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017" /&gt;

Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision has three layers of rights clearance: the depositor, the work's copyright holder and the cultural values of iwi and Māori. The archive undertakes to honour the wishes of all rights holders.&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017" /&gt;

===Collection care===
Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision measures itself against the internationally agreed standards of the [[Image Permanence Institute]] (IPI) and the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA).&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; 

In its Selection and Acquisition Policy, the archive undertakes to store collection items in optimum conditions to ensure their long-term survival, document items so that they can be easily found and make them accessible in a way that does not compromise their long-term preservation.&lt;ref name="ntsv-sa-policy-2017" /&gt; In 2012 the archive noted how it had attracted international interest for "its innovative approach to low-cost, high-quality collection storage using technology adapted from the horticulture sector."&lt;ref name="oia-7373" /&gt;

Ngā Taonga's 2016/17 Annual Report noted that only 56% of the collection was held in best practice storage conditions,&lt;ref name="ntsv-annual-report-2016-2017" /&gt; and a 2017 report from the archive to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage noted that the entire film collection was stored in conditions that it considered was below standard. The former Sound Archive's acetate disc collection was also stored in below standard conditions.&lt;ref name="ntsv-kpi-jul-aug-sep-2017" /&gt;

'''''Night at the Museum''''' is a 2006 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]]-[[comedy film]] directed by [[Shawn Levy]] and written by [[Robert Ben Garant]] and [[Thomas Lennon]], based on the 1993 [[The Night at the Museum|children's book of the same name]] by [[Croatia]]n illustrator [[Milan Trenc]]. The film stars [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a [[divorce]]d father who applies for a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at New York City's [[American Museum of Natural History]] and subsequently discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, come to life at night.

It was released on December 22, 2006 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The first installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' trilogy]], the film was a box office success despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, grossing over $574 million.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Plot==
Larry Daley is a divorced man from [[Brooklyn]], hoping to find a good job to impress his ten-year-old son Nick, but his ex-wife Erica believes he is a bad example for their son. Larry is hired at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to replace the retiring [[security guard]]s Cecil Fredericks, Gus, and Reginald. Larry meets the museum's neurotic curator Dr. McPhee, and very attractive [[museum docent]] Rebecca Hutman, who plans to write a [[dissertation]] on [[Sacagawea]]. On his first night, Cecil hands Larry an instruction manual on what to do in the museum, warning him not to let anything "in or out."

Larry soon discovers that at night, the museum's exhibits come to life and cause havoc for him. Amongst the lively exhibits are a playful ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton named Rexy; a mischievous [[capuchin monkey]] named Dexter who destroys the instructions; the warring miniature factions of [[cowboy]]s and [[Roman legion|legionnaires]] led by Jedediah and General Octavius; violent [[Attila the Hun]] and his army; a talking [[Easter Island Head]] that desires gum who calls Larry "dum dum"; the fire-seeking [[neanderthal]]s; and a wax model of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who is in love with Sacagawea.

Roosevelt explains to Larry that the exhibits have come to life every night since the arrival of an Egyptian artifact, the Tablet of Akhmenrah, the mummified pharaoh trapped in his sarcophagus. He also explains to Larry that as night guard, it is his job to make sure that no exhibit sets foot out of the museum, otherwise they will disintegrate into dust if the sun rises while they are outside. The next day, Cecil advises Larry to research history to make up for the instructions' destruction. He studies in libraries and from Rebecca. Larry puts his new knowledge to good use on his second night, but some of his plans backfire and the neanderthals set their exhibit on fire, leading to one becoming dust after venturing outside. After having doubts and almost getting fired the next day, Larry offers to introduce Sacagawea to Rebecca, but she thinks he is mocking her.

On his third night, Larry brings Nick to the museum to watch the exhibits come to life, but they strangely do not. They catch Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing artifacts, who explain the tablet's magic has allowed them to feel physically young in their old age, and plot to frame Larry for the theft while they enjoy a happy retirement. Nick activates the tablet, but Cecil steals it, locking Larry and Nick in the Egyptian exhibit. They free Akhmenrah, and rally the exhibits to stop the thieves and retrieve their colleagues who fled out into [[Central Park]]. Gus and Reginald are captured, but Cecil escapes by [[stagecoach]].

Larry and several exhibits give chase, where they stop Cecil and recover the tablet, using its magic to escort all of the exhibits back into the museum before sunrise. Rebecca witnesses this and makes amends with Larry and is subsequently introduced to Sacagawea. The next day, McPhee fires Larry after watching news reports of sightings of the exhibits last night, but once they start to leave the museum, they find out that the reports have caused an increased number of visitors, and Larry is immediately rehired. Near the end of the film, Larry, Nick, and the exhibits throw a party in the museum. During the credits, it is shown that Cecil, Gus, and Reginald have been forced to serve as museum janitors for their crimes.

==Production==
The building featured in the film, which was constructed on a sound stage in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], is based on the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, external shots of which were used in the movie.&lt;ref name="MLG"&gt;{{cite web | title=MovieLocationsGuide.com | work=Night at the Museum Filming Locations | url=http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Night_at_the_Museum/filming_locations | accessdate=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trainers spent several weeks training Crystal, who plays the troublemaking monkey Dexter, to slap and bite Stiller in the film.

Robin Williams' Theodore Roosevelt costume closely resembles that of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''The Shootist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Classic Movies |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/classic-movies/8009291/John-Wayne-one-last-shot-before-the-final-farewell.html |title=John Wayne: one last shot before the final farewell |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Shawn Levy]] credited Ben Stiller for the ensemble cast: "When actors hear that Ben Stiller is in a movie they want to work with him. It['s] a high-water mark and it absolutely draws actors in and I'm convinced that's a big part of why we got this cast."&lt;ref name="S2S"/&gt;

==Music==

===Songs===
[[Image:Benstillertrex.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ben Stiller claimed that he watched [[Tom Cruise]] in the ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' films to learn how to imitate his running technique, shown here as Stiller portraying his film character running for dear life from the ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' skeleton (Rexy).&lt;ref name="S2S"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sun2Surf.com | work=Stiller shifts to the Museum | url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16582 | accessdate=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* "[[Sorry's Not Good Enough/Friday Night|Friday Night]]" - performed by [[McFly (band)|McFly]]; not featured in American version of the film, but heard in some international cuts, used during the end credits. It can be heard on the American DVD on the Spanish dub.
* "[[September (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song)|September]]" - performed by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]]; used before the end credits where everyone in the museum is partying.
* "[[Weapon of Choice (song)|Weapon of Choice]]" - performed by [[Fatboy Slim]]; used in the scene where Larry returns to the museum for his second night and is preparing for the chaos.
* "Tonight" - performed by [[Keke Palmer]] and [[Cham (singer)|Cham]]; used for the end credits.
* "[[Eye of the Tiger]]" - performed by Ben Stiller; used in the scene where Larry is bored and messes around with the telephone at the front desk beatboxing the music.
* An [[Elevator music|instrumental]] version of "[[Mandy (Barry Manilow song)|Mandy]]" by [[Barry Manilow]] is used when Larry is standing in the elevator, while escaping from Attila the Hun.
* "[[Dem Bones|Ezekiel Saw Them Dry Bones]]" is the tune Larry whistles as he passes the empty ''T. rex'' exhibit on his first night.
* "[[Camptown Races]]" by Stephen Foster is sung by the townspeople of the American West miniature diorama. This is a period-correct song.

===Critical reaction===
''Night at the Museum'' received mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Parents might call this either a spectacle-filled adventure or a shallow and vapid CG-fest, depending on whether they choose to embrace this on the same level as their kids".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_at_the_museum | title=Night at the Museum | work=rottentomatoes.com | accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/night-at-the-museum | title=Night at the Museum | work=metacritic.com | accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave it 2 stars out of 4, and commented on Stiller's performance by stating "It might be fair to give Ben Stiller an 'A' for effort, but to call what he does in this movie "acting" is a misnomer. He does a lot of running around, occasionally falling down or bumping into things."&lt;ref name="RV"&gt;{{cite web | title=Reelviews.com | work=Night at the Museum | url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/n/night_museum.html | accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One positive review by William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', gave it a B-, and stated that the film was "Out to impress and delight a family audience with the pageantry of human and natural history, and that's a surprisingly worthy ambition for a Hollywood comedy."&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite news | title=SeattlePI.com | work=Shallow 'Museum' exhibits some appealing qualities | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/296769_museum22q.html | accessdate=January 7, 2007 | first1=William | last1=Arnold | date=December 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of [[life imitating art]], museum officials at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] have credited the film for increasing the number of visitors during the holiday season by almost 20%.

'''Paul Rebillot''' (May 19, 1931 &amp;ndash; February 11, 2010) was a member of the [[human potential movement]]. He is the author of ''The Call to Adventure: Bringing the Hero’s Journey to Daily Life''.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Paul Rebillot was born on May 19, 1931 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. His initial academic training was in philosophy and education at the [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] and was followed by a Masters in Communication Arts, specialising in drama, from the [[University of Michigan]]. Before and after his university years he worked with several theatre companies as a writer, producer and actor.
 
Rebillot's military service took him, for a year, to Japan where he produced and directed radio programs for the U.S. Army's [[Far East Network|Far East Radio Network]]. His exposure to the Japanese culture and particularly to [[Noh]], the stylised and ritualised form of Japanese drama, was subsequently to become an important influence on his use of ritual and gesture in his work.

Returning to the United States, Rebillot developed an experimental theater department at [[San Francisco State College]] and, in the same period, worked with Mumako, a Japanese mime, developing his understanding of ritual gesture, meditation postures which shape the energies to the attitude expressed by the gesture, which became a key element in his work.  In 1968, after a year of teaching at Stanford University’s theater department, he founded in San Francisco The Gestalt Fool Theater Family, a commune and a radical performance group, and commenced experimental work combining theatre, ritual and therapy.

=== Esalen ===
The theater work, as well as a severe existential crisis, led him in 1971 to the [[Esalen Institute]] in Big Sur, California. There, he worked with [[Stan Grof]] and [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]], trained in [[Gestalt Practice]] with Esalen's co-founder [[Dick Price]] and studied group process with [[Will Schutz]]. Rebillot met [[Joseph Campbell]], an expert in [[comparative mythology]] who believed [[monomyth]]s, motifs of adventure and transformation to be found in all heroic tales, could be found in all cultures. These encounters with Price, Schutz and Campbell laid the foundations of Rebillot's subsequent work in the human potential movement.

In 1972, Rebillot worked on the psychiatric wards of community hospitals in [[Turlock, California|Turlock]] and [[Martinez, California]]. He shared his own experience of mental suffering and how he emerged from it. In 1973, drawing on Campbell's work and integrating Gestalt practice, movement, meditation, ritual, group process, drama, art, and music, he structured The Hero's Journey. Rebillot's name is most widely associated with this self-discovery process.

=== Europe ===
In 1974, while continuing to offer workshops and Gestalt trainings at Esalen Institute, Rebillot brought The Hero's Journey to Europe. There, he worked at various centers, including the Centre de développement du potentiel humain and the [[Gerda Boyesen|Boyesen]] Institute, France, Jay Stattman’s Institute of Unitive Psychology in The Netherlands and the Irish Foundation for Human Development. As his yearly tours throughout Europe developed, he attracted an eclectic mix of participants including many from the teaching and caring professions. Europe gradually became the location for most of his work and remained so for over thirty years.

In 1987 Rebillot was awarded a [[Laurance Rockefeller]] grant to work on a book about The Hero’s Journey. In 1993, ''The Call to Adventure: Bringing the Hero’s Journey to Daily Life'', was published, with a foreword by Stanislav Grof.

Rebillot had already published "The Hero’s Journey: Ritualizing the Mystery" in ''Spiritual Emergency: When Personal Transformation Becomes a Crisis'' (1989), a collective work edited by [[Stanislav Grof|Stanislav and Christina Grof]], to which he had contributed with [[Ronald David Laing|Ronald Laing]], [[Roberto Assagioli]], John Weir Perry, [[Ram Dass]], Lee Sannella, [[Jack Kornfield]], Holger Kalweit, Anne Armstrong and Keith Thompson.

Rebillot initiated his last project in 2006 when he asked a cross-cultural group of nine students to join him and develop a journey based on the life of [[Abraham]]. The resulting workshop ''In the Footsteps of Abraham'' was delivered by that group in Rebillot's presence in Germany in 2007 and, after his retirement, in Ireland in 2009.

In March 2008, Rebillot retired from work in Europe, but continued to do training and consultancy work from his home in San Francisco. Upon his return he worked extensively with the [http://www.RadicalChangeGroup.com Radical Change Group] founders ([http://www.TherenaissancePath.com Mahipal Lunia], [http://www.SergeyBerezin.com Sergey Berezin] &amp; Arman Darini)to record and present his work to the world. In June 2009, just after his students facilitated ''In the footsteps of Abraham'' in Ireland, he fell ill. After struggling for eight months to overcome the effects of [[respiratory failure]], he died at his home in [[San Francisco]] on February 11, 2010.&lt;ref name=irishtimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Major force in psychotherapy and human potential movement|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=March 13, 2010|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2010/0313/1224266190399.html|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==

Paul Rebillot was particularly struck by the suffering and confusion resulting from contemporary society's lack of significant [[rites of passage]]. He felt that, without [[shamanism|shamans]] or ritual masters to guide them, modern women and men have to find their own lonely and sometimes traumatic paths from one stage of life to another. Hence, a fundamental theme of his work is personal transformation through ritual enactment.

His understanding of the power of myth and ritual helped him design self-discovery processes that he felt would enrich, heal and awaken individuals to their inner quest and the [[transpersonal]] dimensions of their lives. His experience of Gestalt practice led him to believe that each character in a myth represents a facet of oneself. Hence, experiencing a myth from inside, and from all points of view, he viewed as a way to reconnect with oneself and to reach renewed awareness. His background in theatre had convinced him of the capacity of bodily gesture and movement to reveal and to transform the point of view of the mind and the attitude of the heart. He believed that uniting the dimensions of body, heart and mind in order to ensure that one is true to oneself would lead to liberation. To this approach he added work with group processes, whereby group members support one another in their individual inner journeys, which he considered to be one of the most healing aspects of his work.

== Training ==

In 1988 Paul Rebillot inaugurated the School of Gestalt and Experiential Teaching, in Switzerland, a four-level professional training program combining Gestalt theory and practice with ritual, myth, and group process. Taking place over four years, this training offered practising therapists an opportunity to explore the nature of transformational processes such as the ones he had created, and to learn how to conceive and facilitate their own, according to the standards he had set.  A North American training programme began in August 1993. In May 1996, he started a ''Rites of Passage'' training programme in Germany. From that time on, he offered advanced training programmes in Germany as well as in France, Ireland, England and Austria.

Parallel to this, students who wished to facilitate one of his structures, such as ''The Hero's Journey'', had to get his approval after completing a specific apprenticeship programme inspired by the practice of many theater companies and of the medieval guilds, in which students travel, live and work with their teachers as part of their training.

== Legacy ==

After The Hero's Journey, created in 1973, Paul Rebillot developed numerous structures of inner journeys, including:

* ''The Lover's Journey: A Quest for the Inner Man and Woman''
* ''Owning the Shadow''
* ''Exorcising the Demon Should''
* ''Death and Resurrection''
* ''Rituals of Transformation''
* ''Family Circles''
* ''Dancing with the Gods''
* ''Manifesting your Personal Myth''
* ''The Quest for the Golden Fleece''

Before he retired to San Francisco, Paul Rebillot appointed some of his students to carry on with his work. In Ireland, the Rebillot School of Gestalt and Experiential Teaching and, in France, the Ecole de Gestalt et processus expérientiels and in Germany the Institut fuer Gestalt und Erfahrung were formed. The mission of all schools is to promote, deliver and safeguard Rebillot's work. They offer the opportunity to experience the inner journeys designed by Rebillot himself or by his students, according to his principles and standards, as part of their training and certification, or subsequent to their certification. The Ecole de Gestalt et processus expérientiels delivers advanced training in French, the Institut fuer Gestalt und Erfahrung in German.

'''Piraeus Artemis''' refers to two bronze statues of [[Artemis]] excavated in [[Piraeus]] in 1959, along with a large theatrical mask (possibly in honor of Dionysus) and three pieces of marble sculptures. Two other statues were found in the buried cache as well: a larger-than-lifesize bronze [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]] [[Apollo]] ([[Piraeus Apollo]]) and a similarly sized bronze fourth century-style [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John. Greek Sculpture; The Late Classical Period And Sculpture in Colonies and Overseas. London: Thames and Hudson, 1995. pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues are now exhibited in the [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]].

Piraeus possessed a primary seaport, [[Port of Piraeus|Cantharus]], and, due to the foreign influence of trade and the mercenary garrison on [[Munychia]] hill, the city was also entry point for new cults in [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Robert. The Piraeus: from the fifth to the first century B.C. London, Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd., 1987. pp. 104&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that this cache was a shipment that may have been overtaken when the Roman general, [[Sulla]], sacked Piraeus in 86 B.C.E. However, since the various statues date from a time span of approximately five centuries, it could not have been shipped on private commission. It is possible that these bronze cult statues all come from one sanctuary that had been dedicated over the centuries before the collection was removed in the first century B.C.E. The cache could have been transported to Piraeus from almost anywhere, though as there are two representations of Artemis and one of Apollo, it's thought that the cache may be from Delos, the divine twins' birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Caroline. Greek Monumental Bronze Sculpture. New York: The Vendome Press, 1983. pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Artemis statues are thought to be Hellenistic due to the hairstyle and stance, and both show a full-bodied Artemis with a long skirt that covers her legs.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John. Greek Sculpture; The Late Classical Period And Sculpture in Colonies and Overseas. London: Thames and Hudson, 1995. pp. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Artemis A figure is similar to the others in the collection and larger than life, the Artemis B statue is somewhat smaller than life-size.

== Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt ==
[[File:7330 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|Detail, head of A]]
Artemis, a virgin goddess who kept away from men and civilization, signifying the wild aspect that was always apparent in Ancient Greek culture, came to be worshipped as a huntress and a sanctifier of solitude.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Ginette. Pagan Meditations: The Worlds of Aphrodite, Artemis, and Hestia. Dallas, Texas: Spring Publications Inc., 1986. pp. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was associated with young women and girls and biological maturation, and both Piraeus Artemis statues show the goddess as a curvaceous woman, not a wild young girl. The anger of the goddess was also feared and recounted in legends, and part of the worship consisted of appeasing the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Susan Guettel. "Domesticating Artemis." Sue Blundell, Margaret Williamson. The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece. London and New York: Routledge, 1998. 27-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The statues convey this aspect; though in both depictions Artemis's stance is approachable, she carries her weapon, showing her ability to quickly withdraw favor. Often worshipped close to territorial frontiers and a little aways from settlements, female worshippers of Artemis were frequently in danger; a necessary aspect that came with worshipping the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Jost, M. "The Distribution of Sanctuaries in Civic Space in Arkadia." Osborne, S. Alcock and R. Placing the Gods: Sanctuaries and Sacred Space in Ancient Greece. Oxford: Oxford, 1994. 217-230; Cole, Susan Guettel. Landscapes, Gender, and Ritual Space: The Ancient Greek Experience. London: University of California Press, 2004. pp.178-197.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several theories attempt to explain the placement of Artemis's sanctuaries. M. Jost proposed that the temples on borders are associated with Artemis as a huntress and separating her from the temples in low, marshy areas honoring her as a fertility goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Jost, M. "The Distribution of Sanctuaries in Civic Space in Arkadia." Osborne, S. Alcock and R. Placing the Gods: Sanctuaries and Sacred Space in Ancient Greece. Oxford: Oxford, 1994. 217-230; Cole, Susan Guettel. Landscapes, Gender, and Ritual Space: The Ancient Greek Experience. London: University of California Press, 2004. pp.178-197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frontisi proposed that the location represents the goddess's realm as transitioning between nature and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Frontisi-Ducroux, F. 1981. Artémis bucolique. RHR 198: 25-56; Cole, Susan Guettel. Landscapes, Gender, and Ritual Space: The Ancient Greek Experience. London: University of California Press, 2004. pp.178-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess's reputation as not only a protector but a huntress becomes much clearer in fourth-century statuary.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John. Greek Sculpture; The Late Classical Period And Sculpture in Colonies and Overseas. London: Thames and Hudson, 1995. pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Though the two Piraeus Artemises are portrayed in long dresses, it is perfectly clear from her bow and quiver that she is a huntress, while other statues of Artemis depict her in a short or double-belted dress and indicate a more active Artemis.

The goddess was both wild and a peaceful, a key aspect of civilization, and these statues reflect this idea by showing her as strong and womanly, approachable and dangerous, capable of protecting or punishing her worshippers.

== The Piraeus Artemis Statues ==
=== Piraeus Artemis A ===
[[File:7323 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Hellenistic hair style]]
* Late Classical, second half of the fourth century B.C.E.
* Height: 1.94 meters
* Found: 1959 in Piraeus, currently in the Piraeus museum.

The taller of the two Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally over the figure's right shoulder and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay that was used to anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This stance is in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.

Though the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Piraeus+4647&amp;object=Sculpture Artemis A's] design seems to be derived from an archaic model, there are clear Classical terms with which the artist chose to portray the statue. For example, the figure is shown with a [[Polykleitos|Polyclitan]] stance, as indicated from most of her weight resting mainly on the right leg, leaving the left leg to bend and step to the side. The arms seem to be able to move independently of the figure's torso, judging by the way her arms are outstretched. Her head tilts to the side as well, leading the Caroline Houser to interpret the stance of the statue as a way of creating an illusion of an animate statue.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Caroline. Greek Monumental Bronze Sculpture. New York: The Vendome Press, 1983. pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess wears a [[peplos]]; a dress made of one piece of uncut fabric that drapes around the body, falling in folds. The dress folds at the shoulders, hanging doubled over to her hips and held down by round drapery weights.
Most of her left foot and sandal is exposed due to her stance, while only her toes are shown on the right foot. However, the sandal straps have disappeared, as they were cast separately from the rest of the shoe.
The statue's features are extremely elaborate as well, and separately cast from the rest of the bronze statue. Her lips are made of copper-rose, and part to reveal teeth made of white marble, while her bronze lashes frame eyes made of marble and chestnut irises. However, due to the condition of the irises the statue looks cross-eyed.
Her hair is coiffed in the 'melon' style; the wavy hair has been parted into equal sections, twisted and pulled back, and then combed into two large braids and coiled around the top of her head.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Caroline. Greek Monumental Bronze Sculpture. New York: The Vendome Press, 1983. pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piraeus Artemis B ===
[[File:7405 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Artemis Piraeus B]]
* Early Hellenistic (possibly from the 1st part of the 3rd century B.C.E.)
* Height: 1.55 meters 
* Found in Piraeus in 1959, currently in the Piraeus Museum

This is the smaller of the two Artemises and the smallest of the bronze statues found in the Piraeus excavation. In keeping with Greek art, the sculptor took a traditional form and recast it, resulting in a figure with a recognizable but original design.
This statue is the least well-preserved of the statues found in the Piraeus cache; the bronze has crumbled slightly, and other sections have separated completely. The right side of her head is also slightly disfigured due to swelling.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Caroline. Greek Monumental Bronze Sculpture. New York: The Vendome Press, 1983. pp. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7420 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Re-attached quiver]]
The figure is in a similar stance to that of Artemis A, but rather than taking a Polyclitan stance, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Piraeus+4648&amp;object=Sculpture Artemis B's] stance is clearly [[Praxiteles|Praxitelean]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John. Greek Sculpture; The Late Classical Period And Sculpture in Colonies and Overseas. London: Thames and Hudson, 1995. pp. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Artemis A, whose gaze is more uniform and slightly to the right, Artemis B turns much more dramatically to the right, her head tilted and focused in the direction of her outstretched right arm. She looks almost fully rotated, creating a real sense of movement to the viewer's eye. Her arms also seem to be positioned farther from her body in comparison to the other statues found in the Piraeus cache. Her left hand is positioned to hold a bow, and, like with Artemis A, evidence of a bronze circle attached to her thumb indicates that she held a phial in her right hand.

Here, rather than the two straps that cross around Artemis A's chest, only one strap crosses over the figure's right shoulder and under her left arm, supporting part of the quiver that is still intact. The quiver itself was cast separately from the rest of the statue and had to be reattached to the statue at some point in antiquity, setting the quiver in a slightly different position than it had been originally. The quiver strap itself is also elaborate; it is decorated with a meander and dot pattern with silver inlay.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Caroline. Greek Monumental Bronze Sculpture. New York: The Vendome Press, 1983. pp. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure wears a belt around her waist that is tied in a knot in the front. The knot was cast separately from the torso, made from cut and hammered bronze.  This goddess also wears a peplos that was made separately from the skirt underneath, as well as a cloak that wraps around her right shoulder and across her back, hanging past her left hip.

The Artemis B wears a Hellenistic hairstyle similarly coiled to that of Artemis A, though the coils of hair lie somewhat higher on her head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Productivity software''' (also called '''personal productivity software''' or '''office productivity software'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=office productivity software|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/66246/office-productivity-software|website=[[PC Magazine]] Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is application software used for producing information (such as [[document]]s, [[presentation]]s, [[worksheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[chart]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]], [[digital paintings]], [[electronic music]] and [[digital video]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=productivity software|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49780/productivity-software|website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its names arose from the fact that it increases [[productivity]], especially of individual [[white-collar worker|office workers]], from [[Data entry clerk|typists]] to [[knowledge worker]]s, although its scope is now wider than that. [[#Office suite|Office suite]]s, which brought [[word processor|word processing]], [[spreadsheet]], and [[relational database]] programs to the [[desktop computer|desktop]] in the 1980s, are the core example of productivity software. They revolutionized the office with the magnitude of the productivity increase they brought as compared with the pre-1980s office environments of typewriters, paper filing, and handwritten lists and ledgers. Some 78% of "middle-skill" occupations (those that call for more than a [[high school]] diploma but less than a [[bachelor's degree]]) now require the use of productivity software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/digital-skills-gap/ Crunched by the Numbers: The Digital Skills Gap in the Workforce], Burning Glass Technologies, March 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, productivity software has become even more [[consumerization|consumerized]] than it already was, as computing becomes ever more integrated into daily personal life.

==Details==
Productivity software traditionally runs directly on a computer. For example, [[Commodore Plus/4]] model of computer contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] for applications of productivity software. Productivity software is one of the reasons people use [[personal computer]]s.

Productivity software can fall into the following categories:

'''Time Management Software''': With time management software, one is able to track time on a desktop without any user intervention. This allows the person to analyse how much time is spent on each task and what one can do to re-prioritise his tasks and spend time on the most important tasks. 

'''Project Management Software''': With project management software, one is able to delegate, track major projects and have a quick overview of the progress made by each team member.

==Office suite==
[[File:LibreOffice Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice]], an example of office suite, showing Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw]]
An '''office suite''' is a collection of bundled productivity software (a [[software suite]]) intended to be used by [[knowledge worker]]s. The components are generally distributed together, have a consistent [[user interface]] and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways that the [[operating system]] would not normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=office suite|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/48311/office-suite|website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest office suite for personal computers was [[Starburst (office suite)|Starburst]] in the early 1980s, comprising the word processor [[WordStar]], together with companion apps CalcStar (spreadsheet) and DataStar (database).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/whatever-happened-to-wordstar-2/ |title=Whatever Happened to Wordstar? |author=John C. Dvorak |authorlink=John C. Dvorak |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other suites arose in the 1980s, and over the course of the 1990s [[Microsoft Office]] came to dominate the market,&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief History of Computing,'' by Gerard O'Regan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7kWyJXB7z0C&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; a position it retains {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}.

=== Typical office suite components ===

'''RTFM''' is an [[initialism]] for the expression "'''read the fucking manual'''".

In [[expurgation|expurgated]] texts, substitutions such as "read the frickin' manual", "read the factory manual", "read the flaming manual", "read the fine manual", "read the friendly manual", "read the [pause] manual" or similar variants are used.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael, David LeBlanc, and [[John Viega]]. ''19 Deadly Sins of Software Security: Programming Flaws and How to Fix Them''. New York: McGraw-Hill/Osborne, 2005. {{ISBN|0-07-226085-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initialisms similar to RTFM include "STFW" ("search the fucking web"), "GIYF" ("[[Google search|Google]] is your friend") and "LMGTFY" ("let me Google that for you"). These indicate that the questioner could have easily found the answer to their question on the [[World Wide Web]].

==Possible origins==
The initialism appeared in print in 1979 on the table of contents page of the ''[[LINPACK]] User's Guide''&lt;ref&gt;Dongarra, J. J., C. B. Moler, J. R. Bunch, and G. W. Stewart. ''LINPACK User's Guide''. Philadelphia: SIAM, 1979.  {{ISBN|0-89871-172-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  in the form ''"R.T.F.M." -- Anonymous'', suggesting that it was already well established. [[Cleve Moler]] has since revealed that a visit to [[Argonne National Laboratory]] by [[Tektronix]] software manager Ned Thanhouser during the development of [[MATLAB]] led to the anonymous quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moler|first=Cleve|title=The Tektronix 4081|url=http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2014/02/17/the-tektronix-4081|work=Cleve's Corner|publisher=MathWorks Blogs|accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bear]]'s 1983 book ''Computer Wimp! 166 Things I Wish I Had Known Before I Bought My First Computer!'' discusses the author hearing employees of a computer store mention RYFM ("read your fucking manual").&lt;ref name="sperberg19840403"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Don't Be a Computer Wimp | work=PC Magazine | date=1984-04-03 | accessdate=24 October 2013 | author=Sperberg, Luther | pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7511">'''Site Finder''' was a [[wildcard DNS record]] for all [[.com]] and [[.net]] unregistered domain names, run by .com and .net [[top-level domain]] operator [[VeriSign]] between 15 September 2003 and 4 October 2003.

==Site Finder==
All Internet users who accessed any unregistered domains in the .com and .net domain space, were redirected to a VeriSign [[web portal]] with information about VeriSign products and links to "partner" sites. This gave VeriSign the advantage of receiving greater revenue from advertising and from users wishing to register these domain names. It had the effect of "capturing" the [[web traffic]] for several million mis-typed or experimental web accesses per day, and meant that VeriSign effectively "owned" all possible .com and .net domains that had not been bought by others, and could use them as an advertising platform.

VeriSign described the change as an attempt to improve the Web browsing experience for the naive user. VeriSign's critics saw this claim as disingenuous. Certainly, the change led to a dramatic increase in the amount of Internet traffic arriving at verisign.com. According to the web traffic measurement company [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], in the year prior to the change verisign.com was around the 2,500th most popular website. In the weeks following the change, the site came into the top 20 most popular sites, and reached the top 10 in the aftermath of the change and surrounding controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;r=4y&amp;u=verisign.com Alexa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and controversy== 
There was a storm of controversy among network operators and competing domain registrars, particularly on the influential [[North American Network Operators' Group|NANOG]] and [[ICANN]] mailing lists, some of whom asserted:
* that the redirection was contrary to the proper operation of the [[Domain Name System|DNS]], ICANN policy, and the Internet architecture in general;
* that VeriSign breached its trust with the Internet community by using technical architecture for marketing purposes;
* that the redirection broke various [[Request for Comments|RFC]]s and disrupted existing Internet services, such as [[email]] relay and filtering ([[Spamming|spam]] filters were not able to detect the validity of domain names);
* that the redirection amounted to [[typosquatting]] where the unregistered domain being resolved is a spelling mistake for a famous registered domain;
* that VeriSign abused its technical control over the .com and .net domains by exerting a ''de facto'' monopoly control;
* that VeriSign may have been in breach of its contracts for running the .com and .net domains;
* that the Site Finder service assumed that all DNS traffic was caused by Web clients, ignoring the fact that DNS is used by other applications such as networked [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s, [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] software, and dedicated communications applications. If users of these applications accidentally entered a wrong host name, instead of a meaningful "host not found" error they would get a "request timed out" error, making it look like the server existed but is not responding. No statement by VeriSign in support of Site Finder even acknowledged the existence of DNS traffic not caused by Web clients,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} although they published implementation details which mentioned this traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041109202247/http://www.verisign.com/static/002702.pdf VeriSign Site Finder implementation] VeriSign Naming and Directory Services, August 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* that Site Finder contained an [[end-user license agreement]] which stated that the user accepts the terms by using the service—but since mistyping an address automatically caused the service to be used, users could not refuse to accept the terms.

Others were concerned that the Site Finder service was written entirely in [[English language|English]] and therefore was not accessible by non-English speakers.

The [[Internet Architecture Board]] composed a document detailing many of the technical arguments against registry-level wildcards;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iab.org/documents/docs/2003-09-20-dns-wildcards.html IAB Commentary: Architectural Concerns on the use of DNS Wildcards], September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; this was used by ICANN as part of its supporting arguments for its action.

==Fallout==
A number of workarounds were developed to locally disable the effects of Site Finder on a per-network basis. Most notably, the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] announced that it had produced a version of the [[BIND]] DNS software that could be configured by [[Internet service provider]]s to filter out wildcard DNS from certain domains; this software was deployed by a number of ISPs.

On October 4, 2003, as a result of a strong letter from [[ICANN]], VeriSign disabled Site Finder. However, VeriSign has made public statements that suggest that they may be considering whether they will change this decision in the future. On February 27, 2004, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN, claiming that ICANN had overstepped its authority. The claim regarded not only Site Finder, but also VeriSign's much-criticised [[Wait Listing Service]]. The claim was dismissed in August 2004; parts of the lawsuit continued, and culminated in a March 1, 2006 settlement between VeriSign and ICANN which included "a new registry agreement relating to the operation of the .COM registry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/announcements/announcement-28feb06.htm ICANN Board Approves VeriSign Settlement Agreements] ICANN, February 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2004, the ICANN ''Security and Stability Advisory Committee'' (SSAC) handed down its findings after an investigation on Site Finder. It found that the service should not be deployed before ICANN and/or appropriate engineering communities were offered the opportunity to review a proposed implementation, and that [[domain name registry|domain name registries]] that provide a service to third parties should phase out wildcard records if they are used.

'''Roscoe Monroe Brumbaugh''' (born '''Rosco Monroe Merrick'''; December 18, 1928 – November 3, 2006) better known by his [[ring name]] '''Sputnik Monroe''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He was a headliner in many territories, and was best known in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he and Billy Wicks set an attendance record that lasted until the [[Monday Night Wars]] boom period.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;{{cite news | first = Hicks | last = Brady | title = 2006: The year in wrestling | work = PWI Presents: 2007 Wrestling Almanak and book of facts | publisher = Kappa Publications | id = 2007 Edition | page = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Monroe was born in [[Dodge City, Kansas]]. His father was killed in an [[airplane]] crash one month before his birth. His formative years were spent living with his grandparents. Later, his mother remarried, and his stepfather, whose last name was Brumbaugh, [[Adoption|adopted]] him at age 17. As a result, Monroe's legal name became Roscoe Monroe Brumbaugh.

He had a brother, Gary "Jet" Monroe, who was his manager during certain parts of his career.&lt;ref name="Sputnik Monroe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bruce-hart.html|title=Sputnik Monroe Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Debuting as '''Rock Monroe''' in 1945, Monroe began his career by wrestling in traveling carnivals. He changed his name to '''Rocky Monroe''' in 1949, and adopted the nickname "Sputnik" in 1957.

Monroe was a noteworthy figure in Memphis cultural history. During a period where legal segregation was the norm at public events, and during a general decline in the popularity of professional wrestling, Monroe recognized that the segregated wrestling shows (whites sat in floor seats while blacks were required to sit in the [[balcony]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/sports/20061202-121718-9427r.htm Sputnik wrestled against prejudice By Thom Loverro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cantstopthebleeding.com/?p=8089 Sputnk Monroe, RIP]&lt;/ref&gt; were not properly marketing to black fans. The witty, flamboyant Monroe began dressing up in a purple gown and carrying a diamond tipped cane and drinking in traditionally black bars in the black area of Memphis. As a result of this, he was frequently arrested by police on a variety of trumped up charges, such as [[mopery]]. He would then hire a black attorney and appear in court, pay a fine, and immediately resume fraternizing with black citizens and drinking in their bars. Due to this, and in spite of the fact that he was a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] at the time, his popularity soared among the black community. At his shows, although floor seats in arenas would be half empty with white patrons, the balcony would be packed to capacity with black patrons with many others unable to enter due to the balcony selling out.&lt;ref name="sap"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzn59P1vtOg|title=Interview with Jim Cornette|publisher=The Steve Austin Podcast|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monroe, having become the biggest wrestling draw in the territory, soon refused to perform unless patrons, regardless of their race, were allowed to sit in any seat at the [[Ellis Auditorium]]. As a result, promoters were obliged to desegregate his wrestling shows, which then completely sold out with Monroe's black fans filling the auditorium. Soon, other southern sporting events, recognizing the enormous financial benefits, began to desegregate as well.&lt;ref name="sap"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Monroe had three children, the youngest of them, [[Bubba Monroe|Quentin Bell]] was also a pro wrestler. Monroe trained him.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Gordon, Robert. ''It Came From Memphis''.

==Death and legacy==
Monroe died in his sleep on November 3, 2006 in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Almanac"/&gt; He was 77 years old. In May 2007, [[HBO]] announced that they would make a film based on Monroe's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=20211 "Nitzberg Penning Sputnik Biopic"]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Julien Nitzberg confirmed that the first draft of the film's script had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marksfiles.com/interview1.html "Interview with Julien Nitzberg about Sputnik Monroe movie] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080705210832/http://www.marksfiles.com/interview1.html |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosted by actor [[Tom Cavanagh]], '''''Stories from the Vaults''''' is a series of 30-minute shows featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the world's largest museum complex. The new series, produced by [http://www.caragolwells.com Caragol Wells Productions], showcases the Smithsonian's rarest treasures as Tom Cavanagh meets with the experts behind the Smithsonian and discusses what it takes to preserve these precious artifacts for the generations to come. Stories from the Vaults debuted September 2007 on [[Smithsonian Networks]]. The second season premiered Sunday July 12, 2009.

== SEASON 1 ==

===Episode 1: "Famous Donors"===
Cavanagh visits with Dr. Hans-Deiter Seus and collections manager Linda Gordon who oversee 580,000 mammal specimens. They discuss the science of tracking environmental and ecological changes and examine the Smithsonian's vast collection of specimens. Cavanagh also stops by to see the Entertainment Collection curator to enjoy a collection of jokes donated by the first woman to enjoy a comedy career in television.

===Episode 2: "Superlatives"===
Tom Cavanagh goes in search of the most misunderstood, the best and the tiniest to learn what it takes to stand out in a collection of 142 million objects. Paul Rhymer discusses the art of taxidermy with Tom before Cavanagh heads over to the [[National Museum of American History]] for a unique test. In a "cello challenge" Cavanagh has to identify the difference in sound between an ordinary cello and that of a 300-year-old [[Stradivarius]], one of the finest instruments in the world.

===Episode 3: "No Place Like Home"===
In "No Place Like Home", Tom examines four unique forms of homes: the earliest [[space suits]], the [[tipi]] of the plains Indians, mobile homes, and the life of the [[roundworm]] – a parasite able to make its home in almost any type of ecosystem.

===Episode 4: "Beauty"===
Beauty comes in many forms and in this episode Tom Cavanagh explores the subject through the perspective of three Smithsonian curators and their views on [[ants]], [[orchids]] and the world of advertising.

===Episode 5: "Firsts"===
In the world of technological innovation there are many important firsts. Join Tom Cavanagh as he examines the cockpit of a jumbo jet, [[Thomas Edison]]'s earliest light bulbs, and the first [[video game consoles]] ever invented.

===Episode 6: "Life after Death"===
At the Smithsonian, many researchers and historians find valuable clues about life through the study of death. From a colony of flesh-eating [[beetles]] to the idea seeking immortality by posing for a portrait, the Smithsonian presents many ways to answer the question, "Is there life after death?"

===Episode 7: "Random"===
The Smithsonian collection is anything but random. Each of its objects has a scope that encompasses answers to questions as yet unasked, from photography, providing a multiplicity of meaning a single image, to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], housing animals and [[DNA]] for study in future centuries.

== SEASON 2 ==

=== Episode 1: "Let's Eat!"===
Learn how to cook Native American dishes with the executive chef of Mitsitam Café; discover the origins of the American coffee break at the [[National Museum of American History]] and visit the [[National Museum of Dentistry]], where host Tom Cavanagh learns how food takes a toll on our teeth.

===Episode 2: "Top Secret"===
The Smithsonian's most compelling mysteries are revealed. Can an artist outsmart the world's top spies? How does a [[missile]] filled with mail make a political statement to the world? These questions are answered.

===Episode 3: "Nature's Vault"===
The [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] in Panama tracks [[sloth]]s.  Then search the [[Panama Canal]] for clues to the creation of the [[Isthmus of Panama|Panamanian Isthmus]], and rise sixteen stories atop the rainforest in a construction crane to do bug research.

===Episode 4: "Crystal Ball"===
The Smithsonian's Vaults and labs feature designers who have shaped our future, sneak a peek at museum of the future, and talk to scientists helping to preserve the future of the tropical rainforest.

=== Episode 5: "Going, Going, Gone"===
This episode goes behind the scenes and see what might be called "extreme conservation": like saving animals from the brink of [[extinction]]; finding new ways to preserve a provocative work of art; or reviving an entire genre of music. Also learn what Smithsonian experts are doing to protect the best aspects of our world for future generations.

===Episode 6: "Sex 101"===
People may not like to talk about it, but sex is everywhere ... even at the Smithsonian. The topic may not be featured in major museum exhibitions, but the vaults and labs of the Smithsonian feature stories about "the birds and the bees."  Host Tom Cavanagh goes behind the scenes of the Smithsonian to find evidence of romance and sex.

===Episode 7: "Villains and Rogues"===
Explore the crime "scene" at the Smithsonian's Vaults: photographic evidence from the Crime of the Century; everyone's favorite natural villain, the snake; and America's first "Lone Gunman": [[John Wilkes Booth]].

'''''Sztuka kochania''''' (Polish title; literally ''The Art of Loving'') published in English as '''''A Practical Guide to Marital Bliss''''') is a popular [[sex manual]] written by the pioneering Polish sexologist [[Michalina Wisłocka]], first published in 1978. The book has achieved great publishing success.  About 7 million copies were sold in Poland, not including pirated reprints.

The author describes methods of [[contraception]], a list of [[sexual position]]s and [[sex game|games]], historical texts on [[erotic talk|love talk]] and methods of satisfying the sexual needs of lonely people.  On the other hand, the author of ''Sztuka kochania'' also talks a lot about love and the need to understand another human being.

== 2016 republication ==
In 2016, the book was republished, with an introduction by professor [[Zbigniew Izdebski]] and a new chapter on contraception. The new edition was released just before the premiere of the biographical film ''The Art of Loving: Story of Michalina Wislocka'' directed by Maria Sadowska, with [[Magdalena Boczarska]] in the role of Michalina Wisłocka.

[[File:Tangyun - Chinese Dictionary Museum.JPG|thumb|''Tangyun'' excerpt in the Chinese Dictionary Museum, [[Jincheng]], [[Shanxi]]]]

The '''''Tangyun''''' ({{zh|t=唐韻|s=唐韵|p=Tángyùn|l=Tang rhymes}}) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[rime dictionary]], published in 732 CE during the [[Tang dynasty]], by Sun Mian (孫愐), which is a revised version of ''[[Qieyun]]'', a guide for Chinese pronunciation by using the [[fanqie]] method. The original has lost. According to ''Shigutang Shuhua Huikao'' (式古堂書畫匯考) by [[:zh:卞永譽|Bian Yongyu]] (卞永譽), Tangyun has 5 volumns, 195 rimes totally. The statistics is the same as from ''Kanmiu Buque Qieyun'' (刊謬補缺切韻) by Wang Renxu (王仁昫), which has respectively one more rimes in Shangshen (上聲) and Qusheng (去聲) than [[Qieyun]].

The Buddhist [[Kingdom of Qocho|Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho]] used the Qianziwen (the [[Thousand Character Classic]]), Qieyun and it was written that "In Qocho city were more than fifty monasteries, all titles of which are granted by the emperors of the Tang dynasty, which keep many Buddhist texts such as the ''[[Tripitaka]]'', ''Tangyun'', ''[[Yupian]]'', and ''Jingyin'' 經音."&lt;ref name="Yakup2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdurishid Yakup|title=The Turfan Dialect of Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk12I01qTPUC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Turfan+chinese+speaking&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ihYwVKzzJpD8sATb_IDgDg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turfan%20chinese%20speaking&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05233-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Animal Ignorance''''' is the second title in a series of books based on the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and head-researcher [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]]. It is a [[trivia]] book, consisting largely of little-known facts about various animals, alongside factual corrections to ''other'' pieces of supposedly "well-known" trivia that, although widely believed, are not always accurate. It is a sequel to ''[[The Book of General Ignorance]]''.

==Publication history==
{{See also|The Book of General Ignorance}}

'''The Book of Animal Ignorance''' was first published in the UK by [[Faber and Faber]] on 4 October 2007, almost exactly a year after ''The Book of General Ignorance'', and clearly targeted towards the same Christmas market. An American printing is likely to be forthcoming, since the success of ''General Ignorance'' in the UK Christmas market 2006 reputedly prompted "a two-book, six-figure"&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news | last = Jury | first = Louise | authorlink = Louise Jury | title = How interesting: 'QI' is surprise Christmas hit | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 4 December 2006 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts/books/news/article2037434.ece | accessdate = 4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; sale of the US publication rights, although the UK edition is already available through [[Amazon.com]]. From November 2007, it is distributed in Australia by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]. A Dutch translation of the book, ''Het grote boek van foute feiten over dieren'', was published on 1 March 2009 by Uitgeverij Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boekerij.nl/forum/boeken-verwacht.asp Books expected from Forum]. Retrieved 6 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Differing from its forebear, the QI ''[[The Book of General Ignorance|Book of General Ignorance]]''{{'}}s structure as a question-and-answer trivia tome, ''The Book of Animal Ignorance'' instead opts for an encyclopaedic listing of 100 animals, providing information and facts for each. This change in style may be dictated simply by the content, but could also be as a direct result of criticism directed at the former title by [[Marcus Berkmann]], referring to its disappointing similarity in format to a number of titles, and specifically [[New Scientist]]'s 2005 book ''[[Does Anything Eat Wasps?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Berkmann | first = Marcus | authorlink = Marcus Berkmann | title = QI News: Critic's view | date = 8 December 2006 | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=54 | accessdate = 20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Touted on the cover as being "from the team that brought 'Ignorance' to millions", it promised to be a "bestiary for the 21st century,"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]] &amp; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] ''The Book of Animal Ignorance'' (Faber&amp;Faber, 2007), ''from the inside-dustjacket blurb''&lt;/ref&gt; and contains almost-completely new "quite interesting" facts on 100 different animals, described in Fry's introduction as "the oats in the ''QI'' muesli".&lt;ref name=QI&gt;{{cite book | last = Fry | first = Stephen | authorlink = Stephen Fry | author2 = [[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]]| author3=[[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] | lastauthoramp=y | title = QI: The Book of Animal Ignorance | publisher = Faber and Faber | date = 4 October 2007 | | isbn = 978-0-571-23370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}&lt;ref name="Animal Ignorance at the QI Shop"&gt;[http://www.qi.com/shop/animal_ignorance.php ''Animal Ignorance'' at the QI Shop] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121064707/http://www.qi.com/shop/animal_ignorance.php |date=21 January 2008 }}. Retrieved 5 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This new style and emphasis on new material clearly demonstrates the evolution of the ''QI'' brand, moving as it does away from the look of the initial book, a far more obvious simple rehashing of content from the TV series ('"General Ignorance" round), rather than being a complementary companion volume in its own right, as is ''Animal Ignorance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/09/exclusive-review-book-of-animal.html The ''QI'' Blog's Exclusive Review of ''The Book of Animal Ignorance'']. Retrieved 6 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animal Ignorance'' again features forewords from both regular [[QI]] personalities, [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Alan Davies]]. In contrast to the preceding books' "Four words," Davies here contributes a 'proper' foreword, labelled a "Fore'''paw'''", in keeping with the book's subject matter.&lt;ref name=QI/&gt;{{rp|xi}} It comprises two-page spreads on 100 diverse mammals, reptiles, rodents, fish, birds and other beasts ranging from [[aardvark]] to [[worm]] (and not strictly "Aardvark to [[Zebra]]" as initially reported).&lt;ref name="Indie"/&gt; The book was designed, typeset also illustrated (with "400 diagrams and cartoons") "by the brilliant [[Ted Dewan]]".&lt;ref name="Animal Ignorance at the QI Shop"/&gt;

{{Portal|France|Politics}}
'''Third Way''' ({{lang-fr|Troisième voie}}) is a [[France|French]] [[Third Position]] organization founded in 1985 by a merger of the small [[Neo-Fascism|neo-fascist]] ''Mouvement nationaliste révolutionnaire'', which gathered former members of [[François Duprat]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups]], with dissidents from the [[Party of New Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme-droite.htm#TV Annuaire de l'extrême-droite en France: Troisième Voie]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Led by [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]], the party adopted the slogan of "neither [[Trust company|trusts]] nor [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]" ("{{lang|fr|ni trusts, ni soviets}}") and stood against [[communism]], [[capitalism]], and [[Zionism]]. It used a [[trident]] as its emblem. For a time the party was associated with the [[Groupe Union Défense]] but maintained a generally poor relationship with the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN). This was the case until 1991 when Malliarakis decided to approach the FN, leading to a schism within the party from those who felt the FN did not conform to their way of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1992 |title=Antisemitism World Report, 1992 |publisher=Institute of Jewish Affairs |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Christian Bouchet]] and his followers split off to form [[Nouvelle Résistance]], a group that was to be more [[National Bolshevism|National Bolshevik]] in tone. The Third Way itself remained in the hands of Malliarakis but was dissolved soon after the split. 

''Troisième voie'' also maintained links with the [[white power music]] scene as Gaël Bodilis, who set up the [[Rebelles Européens]] [[record label]] in [[Brest, France|Brest]], was for a time a member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |editor-last=Blamires |editor-first=Cyprian P. |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |volume=2 |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tonight We Improvise''''' ({{lang-it|Questa sera si recita a soggetto}} {{IPA-it|ˈkwesta ˈseːra si ˈrɛːtʃita a ssodˈdʒɛtto|}}) is a play by [[Luigi Pirandello]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pirandelloweb.com/teatro/1930_questa_sera_si_recita_a_soggetto/questa_sera_si_recita_a_soggetto_copertina.htm Text of ''Tonight We Improvise'' (Italian)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617040310/http://www.pirandelloweb.com/teatro/1930_questa_sera_si_recita_a_soggetto/questa_sera_si_recita_a_soggetto_copertina.htm |date=2011-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his play ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', it forms part of his "trilogy of the [[Metatheatre|theatre in the theatre]]." It premiered in 1930 in a [[German language|German]] translation in [[Königsberg]], and had its first [[Italian language|Italian]] performance in [[Turin]] on April 14, 1930.

It has been translated into [[English language|English]] by [[Samuel Putnam]] (1932), [[Marta Abba]] (1959), and J. Douglas Campbell and Leonard Sbrocchi (1987).

==Plot synopsis==

A company of actors under the direction of Doctor Hinkfuss is to present an improvisation on Pirandello's novella ''Leonora, Addio!'' Hinkfuss explains that his plan for having the actors improvise, as the spirit moves them, is an attempt to allow the work to stage itself, with characters rather than actors. However, his actors are frustrated at the conflict inherent in Hinkfuss's instructions: to completely become their characters, but also to come when they are called and adapt themselves to Hinkfuss's decisions about what should happen when.

After some argument between the actors and Hinkfuss, the play begins. It concerns the La Croce family – Signor Palmiro, a sulfur mine engineer, his forceful wife Signora Ignazia, and their four daughters, Mommina, Totina, Dorina, and Nenè – who have moved from [[Naples]] to the more socially conservative [[Sicily]]. The family is popular with a local company of [[Italian Air Force|air force]] officers, who love the mother and flirt with the daughters; however, this behavior earns the family the disapproval of the rest of the town, as well as of Rico Verri, one of the other officers.

One night, Signor Palmiro is brought home bleeding by a cabaret singer whom he loves, after having been stabbed defending her honor, and dies. This having coincided with a fight among the actors as to how much they should keep to the script, the Old Comic Actor's entrance is ruined, and the actors, angry at Hinkfuss's meddling, throw him out of the theatre.

The next scene takes place years later. Mommina has married Rico Verri, who is mad with jealousy over what he imagines to be her sexual history with the other officers. After he abuses her and leaves, Mommina – guided by the offstage voices of her mother and sisters – finds a handbill in his coat advertising a production of ''[[Il Trovatore]]'' in which Totina, now a famous opera singer, is performing. She describes the theatre to her two children, who have never seen it, and tells them the story of the opera, singing snatches of it, with her heart beating ever faster and her breath growing ever weaker, until she sings Manrico's line in the Act IV farewell duet – ''Leonora, addio!'' – and falls dead.

The other actors end the play, running on to find Mommina dead. They believe that the Lead Actress has fainted, but she gets up, and after the actors insist on written parts, Doctor Hinkfuss, who has returned, apologizes to the audience for the night's irregularities.

[[Image:Vinegar Valentine 01.JPG|thumb|Vinegar Valentine, circa 1900]]

'''Vinegar valentines''' were a type of insulting cards.  They are decorated with a caricature, and featured below an insulting poem.  Ostensibly given on [[Valentine's Day]], the caricature and poem is about the "type" that the recipient belongs to—[[spinster]], [[floozy]], [[dude]], [[scholar]], etc. They enjoyed popularity from the 1840s to the 1940s.

These cynical, sarcastic, often mean-spirited greeting cards were first produced in America as early as the 1840s by a variety of printing companies, including Elton, Fisher, Strong and Turner. By the 1870s, other entrepreneurs such as New York printer, John McLoughlin, and his cartoonist, Charles Howard were creating their own lines of cards. While different European companies also produced the humorous cards in the early 19th century, one of the most prestigious firms to create them around 1900 was Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons, "Publishers to Their Majesties the King and Queen of England."

Cheaply made, vinegar valentines were usually printed on one side of a single sheet of paper and cost only a penny. Some people mistakenly call them [[Penny Dreadful|penny dreadfuls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zarrelli|first1=Natalie|title=The Rude, Cruel, and Insulting 'Vinegar Valentines' of the Victorian Era|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/vinegar-valentines-victorian|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that term refers to a form of [[potboiler]] fiction. They often featured garish caricatures of men like the "Dude" or women like the "Floozy." One reason they rapidly became popular throughout America and Europe was because literacy rates were increasing at that time among the poor and working classes who rarely had much more than a penny to spend on such luxuries. But, according to noted valentine authority Nancy Rosin, president of the National Valentine Collectors Association, their use wasn't restricted to the lower economic classes.

The unflattering cards reportedly created a stir throughout all social levels, sometimes provoking fisticuffs and arguments. The receiver, not the sender, was responsible for the cost of postage up until the 1840s. A person in those days paid for the privilege of being insulted by an often anonymous "admirer." Millions of vinegar valentines, with verses that insulted a person's looks, intelligence, or occupation, were sold between the 19th and 20th centuries. Art and design historian Annebella Pollen has extensively researched their production and reception in Britain, where they were more commonly called 'mock' or 'mocking' valentines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollen|first1=Annebella|title=‘The Valentine has fallen upon evil days’: Mocking Victorian valentines and the ambivalent laughter of the carnivalesque|journal=Early Popular Visual Culture|date=21 August 2014|volume=12|issue=2|pages=127–173|doi=10.1080/17460654.2014.924212|url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/13357/1/EPVC%20-%20The%20Valentine%20has%20Fallen%20Upon%20Evil%20Days%20-%20for%20repository.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cards are usually simply a sheet of thin, colored paper, about the size of a modern greeting card.  They were later also produced in the form of postcards.  They were usually sent anonymously.  Postmasters sometimes confiscated these cards as unfit to be mailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Petrulis |url=http://www.metropostcard.com/topicalsv.html |title=MetroPostcard Topicals V |publisher=Metropostcard.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1940s and 50s, the cost of the vinegar valentines was five cents.

The cards were first produced in the late [[Victorian era]] and enjoyed their greatest popularity in that period and in the first quarter of the 20th century.

One [[pop culture]] reference to vinegar valentines is found in [[Bill Watterson]]'s [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic strip.  Calvin often gives [[Susie Derkins]] vinegar valentines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10116">In [[computing]], the '''working directory''' of a [[process (computing)|process]] is a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] of a hierarchical [[file system]], if any,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_DX10"/&gt; dynamically associated with each process. It is sometimes called the '''current working directory (CWD)''', e.g. the [[BSD]] {{man|3|getcwd|FreeBSD||inline}} function, or just '''current directory'''.&lt;ref name="SetCurrentDirectory"/&gt; When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative [[path (computing)|path]] (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a [[root directory]]), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process. So for example a process with working directory &lt;tt&gt;/rabbit-shoes&lt;/tt&gt; that asks to create the file &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt; will end up creating the file &lt;tt&gt;/rabbit-shoes/foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

==In operating systems==
{{further|cd (command)|operating system shell}}
In most computer file systems, every directory has an entry (usually named "&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;") which points to the directory itself.

In most [[DOS]] and [[Unix|UNIX]] [[command-line interface|command shell]]s, as well as in the [[Microsoft Windows]] command line interpreters [[cmd.exe]] and [[Windows PowerShell]], the working directory can be changed by using the &lt;tt&gt;[[cd (command)|cd]]&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;[[cd (command)|chdir]]&lt;/tt&gt; [[command (computing)|command]]s. In [[Unix shell]]s, the &lt;tt&gt;[[pwd]]&lt;/tt&gt; command outputs a full pathname of the current working directory; the equivalent command in DOS and Windows is &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; without [[parameter (computer science)|arguments]] (whereas in Unix, &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; used without arguments takes the user back to his/her [[home directory]]).

The [[environment variable]] &lt;tt&gt;PWD&lt;/tt&gt; (in Unix/Linux shells), or the [[pseudo-environment variable]]s &lt;tt&gt;[[CD (pseudo-environment variable)|CD]]&lt;/tt&gt; (in Windows [[COMMAND.COM]] and [[cmd.exe]], but not in OS/2 and DOS), or &lt;tt&gt;_CWD&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;_CWDS&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;_CWP&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;_CWPS&lt;/tt&gt; (under [[4DOS]], [[4OS2]], [[4NT (shell)|4NT]] etc.)&lt;ref name="4DOS_8.00_HELP"/&gt; can be used in scripts, so that one need not start an external program. [[Microsoft Windows]] [[file shortcut]]s have the ability to store the working directory.

COMMAND.COM in [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher provides &lt;tt&gt;ECHOS&lt;/tt&gt;, a variant of the &lt;tt&gt;[[ECHO (DOS command)|ECHO]]&lt;/tt&gt; command omitting the terminating linefeed.&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_NEW703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4DOS_8.00_HELP"/&gt; This can be used to create a temporary batchjob storing the current directory in an environment variable like &lt;tt&gt;CD&lt;/tt&gt; for later use, for example:&lt;code&gt;
: ECHOS SET CD=&gt; SETCD.BAT&lt;br/&gt;
: CHDIR &gt;&gt; SETCD.BAT&lt;br/&gt;
: CALL SETCD.BAT&lt;br/&gt;
: DEL SETCD.BAT
&lt;/code&gt; Alternatively, under [[Multiuser DOS]] and [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher, various internal and external commands support a parameter &lt;tt&gt;/B&lt;/tt&gt; (for "Batch").&lt;ref name="CCI_1997_HELP"/&gt; This modifies the output of commands to become suitable for direct command line input (when redirecting it into a batch file) or usage as a parameter for other commands (using it as input for another command). Where &lt;tt&gt;CHDIR&lt;/tt&gt; would issue a directory path like &lt;code&gt;C:\DOS&lt;/code&gt;, a command like &lt;tt&gt;CHDIR /B&lt;/tt&gt; would issue &lt;code&gt;CHDIR C:\DOS&lt;/code&gt; instead, so that &lt;tt&gt;CHDIR /B &gt; RETDIR.BAT&lt;/tt&gt; would create a temporary batchjob allowing to return to this directory later on.

The current working directory is also displayed by the &lt;tt&gt;$P&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_PROMPT"/&gt; token of the &lt;code&gt;[[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]&lt;/code&gt; command &lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER"/&gt; To keep the prompt short even inside of deep subdirectory structures, the DR-DOS 7.07 COMMAND.COM supports a &lt;tt&gt;$W&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_PROMPT"/&gt; token to display only the deepest subdirectory level. So, where a default &lt;tt&gt;PROMPT $P$G&lt;/tt&gt; would result f.e. in &lt;code&gt;C:\DOS&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;C:\DOS\DRDOS&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;tt&gt;PROMPT $N:$W$G&lt;/tt&gt; would instead yield &lt;code&gt;C:DOS&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;C:DRDOS&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. A similar facility (using &lt;tt&gt;$W&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$w&lt;/tt&gt;) was added to [[4DOS]] as well.&lt;ref name="4DOS_8.00_HELP"/&gt;

==In programming languages==
&lt;!-- can become a separate article [[chdir]], if one is willing to split --&gt;
Most [[programming language]]s provide an [[application programming interface|interface]] to the [[file system]] functions of the operating system, including the ability to set (change) the working directory of the program.

In the [[C language]], the [[POSIX]] function '''&lt;code&gt;chdir()&lt;/code&gt;''' effects the [[system call]] which changes the working directory.&lt;ref name="OGBS"/&gt; Its argument is a [[string data type|text string]] with a path to the new directory, either absolute or relative to the old one. Where available, it can be called by a process to set its working directory.

There is the same function in other languages. In [[Visual Basic]] it is usually spelled &lt;code&gt;CHDIR()&lt;/code&gt;.

Unlike the [[Windows API]] or [[POSIX]] [[C (programming language)|C]] function, neither the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language nor the [[Java Virtual Machine]] supports &lt;code&gt;chdir()&lt;/code&gt; directly;{{clarification needed|reason=So, how the working directory can be changed?|date=February 2014}} a [[change request]] remained open for over a decade while the team responsible for Java considered the alternatives, though by 2008 the request was denied after only limited support was introduced (affecting first &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Runtime&lt;/code&gt; and later, &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ProcessBuilder
&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt;

* [[chroot]] (Linux systems)
* [[Load drive]] (a different, but related concept)

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_DX10"&gt;There are [[operating system]]s that support a [[hierarchical file system]] but have no concept of "working directory"; for example [[Texas Instruments]]' [[DX10 operating system|DX10]], used for the [[TI-990]] series.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_PROMPT"&gt;In the same way as &lt;tt&gt;$O&lt;/tt&gt; works as alternative to &lt;tt&gt;$P&lt;/tt&gt; under [[DR-DOS]] [[COMMAND.COM]], &lt;tt&gt;$W&lt;/tt&gt; has an alias &lt;tt&gt;$Y&lt;/tt&gt; except for that it gets suppressed on [[floppies]] in order to avoid [[critical error]] messages or delays when trying to retrieve the path of a non-inserted floppy.&lt;/ref&gt;
