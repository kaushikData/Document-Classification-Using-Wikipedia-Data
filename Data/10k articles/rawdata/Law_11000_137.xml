'''''A Brief History of Blasphemy: Liberalism, Censorship and the Satanic Verses''''' is a 1990 book by [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], in which the author discusses the [[The Satanic Verses controversy|controversy]] over [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988). Webster critiques the freedom to [[blaspheme]], and argues against ''The Crime of Blasphemy'' (which advocated the abolition of [[Britain's blasphemy laws]] "without replacement").

==Summary==

Webster notes that he named the book after the fourth section of ''The Crime of Blasphemy'', a pamphlet issued by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie and his Publishers, and that his work is influenced by [[Karen Armstrong]]'s ''Holy War'' (1988) and [[Norman Cohn]]'s books ''[[The Pursuit of the Millennium]]'' (1957), ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'' (1967), and ''[[Europe's Inner Demons]]'' (1975). He also approvingly cites Muslim writer [[Shabbir Akhtar]]'s ''Be Careful With Muhammad!'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web90|Webster 1990]]. pp. 14, 15, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster describes ''A Brief History of Blasphemy'' as "an attempt to show, without ever aspiring to completeness or comprehensiveness, that the picture of blasphemy which is presented by the authors of the International Committee's document is incomplete, and in some respects, seriously misleading."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web90|Webster 1990]]. pp. 14, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Webster gives the controversy surrounding [[Monty Python]]'s film ''[[The Life of Brian]]'' (1979), which he calls "a rather slight production" as a satire on religion, as an example of the way in which blasphemy has been restrained not by force of law but by internalised censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web90|Webster 1990]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''A Brief History of Blasphemy'' was first published in 1990 by The Orwell Press.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web90|Webster 1990]]. p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''A Brief History of Blasphemy'' was widely praised in the immediate aftermath of the controversy over ''The Satanic Verses''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wof11|Woffinden 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers suggested that Webster shows that liberal support for unrestricted freedom of speech is inconsistent with other liberal values, and demonstrates the religious origins of belief in freedom of expression. The book has been described as "thoughtful" and "closely argued" by the journalist [[Tim Radford]],&lt;ref name="Radford"&gt;[[#Rad90|Radford 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; and "energetic and ingenious" by academic [[Lorna Sage]],&lt;ref name="Sage"&gt;[[#Sag90|Sage 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Webster has been credited with explaining how "we have internalised puritan [[iconoclasm]] to the point where we mistake it for a secular universal truth",&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; and with showing that the western liberal concept of "inner conscience" upon which the secularist arguments of ''The Crime of Blasphemy'' were founded is a secular transformation of Puritanism.&lt;ref name="McGuigan"&gt;[[#McG92|McGuigan 1992]]. pp. 202-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have interpreted ''A Brief History of Blasphemy'' as a broadly liberal critique of liberalism,&lt;ref name="McGuigan" /&gt; or an attempt to criticize the liberal establishment on its own terms.&lt;ref name="Sage" /&gt; Webster shows, in Petersson's view, that Rushdie combines a potentially violent and offensive code with the holiest Islamic traditions, and that the language in ''The Satanic Verses'' has a charge that he was too careless with.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pet96|Petersson 1996]]. pp. 41, 204-205.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ruvani Ranashina, Webster shows that a civilised society should have constraints on the freedom to act in ways that have adverse effects on others, and that freedom without responsibility is dangerous, especially if offensive and damaging to a community. She believes his critique of the freedom to blaspheme implicitly supports the group of Muslims who unsuccessfully sought to invoke [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|British blasphemy laws]] that applied only to Christianity against ''The Satanic Verses'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ran07|Ranashina 2007]]. pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Webster has been credited by the novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]] with showing that "Rushdie has been made to stand for an entire intellectual establishment" that compounded the outrage ''The Satanic Verses'' caused to Muslims by celebrating it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coe96|Coetzee 1996]]. p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of ''The Crime of Blasphemy'' (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws "without replacement") is seen as convincing by academic Jim McGuigan.&lt;ref name="McGuigan" /&gt; French author Patrice Dartevielle described Webster's work as "anti-liberal" and condemned support for "repressive legislation" (i.e. new or renewed blasphemy laws), while also acknowledging that Webster's concern about Muslims was "noble".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dar11|Dartevielle 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in the James Callaghan Memorial lecture "Religious Hatred and Religious Offence" delivered in January 2008, called the book "immensely intelligent", stating that Webster shows that absolute freedom of speech is neither desirable nor possible. Williams said that Webster "offers some extraordinary examples of 'liberal' aggression and ignorant bigotry" during the controversy over ''The Satanic Verses'' in 1989 and 1990, and that he approved of his argument that writers and dramatists who defend the right to offend religion show a lack of imagination, in that they fail to understand the possibility that offending religion may cause real mental suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil11|Williams 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23190">'''Animal law''' is a combination of  [[statutory law|statutory]] and [[case law]] in which the nature{{snd}} legal, social or biological{{snd}} of nonhuman animals is an important factor. Animal law encompasses [[companion animals]], [[wildlife]], animals used in entertainment and animals raised for food and research. The emerging field of animal law is often analogized to the environmental law movement because "animal law faces many of the same legal and strategic challenges that environmental law faced in seeking to establish a more secure foothold in the United States and abroad".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eli.org/eli-press-books/what-can-animal-law-learn-environmental-law What Can Animal Law Learn From Environmental Law?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021003913/https://www.eli.org/eli-press-books/what-can-animal-law-learn-environmental-law |date=October 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal law issues encompass a broad spectrum of approaches{{snd}} from philosophical explorations of the rights of animals to pragmatic discussions about the rights of those who use animals, who has standing to sue when an animal is harmed in a way that violates the law, and what constitutes legal cruelty.&lt;ref name=animallawprogram/&gt; Animal law permeates and affects most traditional areas of the law{{snd}} including tort, contract, criminal and constitutional law. Examples of this intersection include:

A growing number of state and local bar associations now have animal law committees.&lt;ref name=animallawprogram&gt;[http://www.animallawprogram.org/articles/NewJersey_Lawyer.pdf Animal Law Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616115412/http://www.animallawprogram.org/articles/NewJersey_Lawyer.pdf |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] was founded by attorney Joyce Tischler in 1979 as the first organization dedicated to promoting the field of animal law and using the law to protect the lives and advance the interests of animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldf.org http://www.aldf.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205114106/http://www.aldf.org/ |date=December 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal law in academia==

===North America===
[[File:Prof. Dr. Tom Regan.jpg|thumb| ''Prominent Animal Rights scholar [[Tom Regan]]'']]
Animal law has been taught in at least 119 law schools in the US, including Harvard, Stanford, UCLA, Northwestern, University of Michigan, Georgetown, Duke, and Lewis &amp; Clark and is currently taught in at least 117 schools.&lt;ref name="Animal law courses"&gt;[http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 "Animal law courses"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613170018/http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 |date=June 13, 2010 }}, Animal Legal Defense Fund&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabranimallaw.org/LawSchools/AnimalLawCourses/tabid/625/Default.aspx "Animal Law Courses"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{snd}} National Association for Biomedical Research{{snd}} animal law section&lt;/ref&gt; Animal law is also currently taught in seven law schools in Canada.&lt;ref name="Animal law courses"/&gt; In the US there are Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF) chapters in 132 law schools, with an additional seven chapters in Canada.

Each chapter sets out cases and commentary where animal law affects those broader areas.

===Europe===
Animal law is being taught in a few European universities in Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), in Spain, is the only European university to offer a [http://www.uab.cat/servlet/Satellite/postgraduate/master-in-animal-law-and-society/basic-details-1217916968009.html/param1-2826_en/param2-2012/ Master’s Degree in Animal Law and Society (Derecho Animal y Sociedad)]. The highly interdisciplinary program, directed by Prof. Dr. Teresa Giménez-Candela,&lt;ref name="Gimenez-Candela"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.derechoanimal.info/images/pdf/Cv-T-Gimenez-Candela-eng.pdf | title=Cv Gimenez-Candela | work=DerechoAnimal | date=2011–2012 | accessdate=April 16, 2016 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is taught in Spanish and English. It aims to provide students knowledge of animals in the fields of law, ethology, nutrition and welfare, ethical dimensions, artistic representations and entertainment, organization and social responsibility. 
The program is based on a [[comparative law]] perspective, keeping in mind the needs of society as a whole. A postgraduate diploma is also available in that specific field.

Initially, the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB, in Catalan the school is "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona") Law School was the first Spanish university to officially offer optional courses in "Animal Law and Animal Welfare Law: comparative perspective (Derecho Animal y Derecho del Bienestar Animal: perspectiva comparada)" in 2007–2008. Due to student demand, a Postgraduate Degree in Animal Law and Society was established in 2009–2010. The first edition of the Master's program in Animal Law and Society was launched in 2011–2012 and is currently accepting students for its eighth edition (Oct. 2018– Dec. 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://derechoanimal.info/es/master/master-presencial|title=Máster Presencial|website=derechoanimal.info|language=es|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; UAB also offers an online Master's in Animal Law and Society, and is currently accepting applications for its fifth edition (Jan. 2019 - Oct. 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://derechoanimal.info/es/master/master-online|title=Máster Online|website=derechoanimal.info|language=es|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Affiliated with the Master’s program in Animal Law and Society is the [http://www.derechoanimal.info/ Derecho Animal Web Center], the first website in Spain which provides, since 2007, a database on legislation and jurisprudence regarding animals. It provides a service that is both scientific and educational. The same year was founded the Research Group ADS (Animales, Derecho y Sociedad), directed by Prof. Dr. Teresa Giménez-Candela. The international and multidisciplinary group aims to promote research in the field of Animal Law and Policy.

Although animal law is not yet taught in French universities, the [[University of Limoges]] has been publishing a biannual Law Review especially dedicated to animal law related topics since 2009. 
The [http://www.unilim.fr/omij/publications-2/revue-semestrielle-de-droit-animalier/ ''Revue Semestrielle de Droit Animalier''] founded and directed by Prof. Dr. Jean-Pierre Marguénaud, relies on distinguished law professors and professionals, philosophers, and scientists who form the editorial board. Animal rights advocates and researchers are also invited to contribute on certain topics.

The [[University of Basel]] (Switzerland) in collaboration with the [[University of Zurich]], launched in 2012 a doctoral program entitled [https://ius.unibas.ch/fakultaet/projekte/law-and-animals/ “Law and Animals: Ethics at Crossroads”], under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Anne Peters.

In 2012, the [http://www.gjal.abo.fi/ ''Global Journal of Animal Law''] was established by Prof. Dr. Anna Birgitta Wahlberg of the Department of Law of the [[Åbo Akademi University]], in Finland. 
The primary objective of this online semi-annual publication is to define legal approaches to non-human animals in different legal systems and to analyze the legal status of animals within these systems. The Global Journal of Animal Law focuses on legislation, implementation, interpretation, enforcement and compliance. The first issue was published in June 2013.

In February 2013, was created the EuroGroup for Animal Law Studies (EGALS), a collaborative partnership aimed to increase the interest of the European legal community for animal law and thus to encourage and facilitate the emergence of Animal Law Studies in European universities as well as to further research in this area. The founding partners are:  Prof. Dr. Teresa Giménez-Candela (Autonomous University of Barcelona), Prof. Dr. Anne Peters (University of Basel), Dr. Margot Michel (University of Zurich) and the [http://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/ Fondation Droit Animal, éthique et sciences (LFDA)].

The 2nd Global Animal Law Conference was held on July 11 and 12, 2014 at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) by the [http://www.derechoanimal.info/ Research Group ADS and the Derecho Animal Web Center], in collaboration with the [http://animallaw.info/ Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center] ([[Michigan State University College of Law]]) and the [http://law.lclark.edu/centers/animal_law_studies/ Center for Animal Law Studies] ([[Lewis &amp; Clark School of Law]]).

===Asia===
[[KIMEP University]] in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] introduced a course of Animal Law in 2013 upon initiative of Dr. Maria Baideldinova (Assistant Professor, KIMEP School of Law).

==Recent legal changes influenced by animal rights activists==
Regarding the campaign to change the status of animals as property, the [[animal rights]] activists have seen success in several countries. In 1992, [[Switzerland]] amended its [[Constitution of Switzerland|constitution]] to recognize animals as ''beings'' and not ''things''.&lt;ref name="APBerlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/18/germany-rights.htm |title=Germany guarantees animal rights in constitution |accessdate=2008-06-26 |date=2002-05-18 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1999, the Swiss constitution was completely rewritten. A decade later, [[Germany]] guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first [[European Union]] member to do so.&lt;ref name="APBerlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/21/germany.animals/index.html |title=Germany guarantees animal rights |accessdate=2008-06-26 |date=2002-06-21 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Civil Code]] had been amended correspondingly in 1997. In 2015 the General Assembly of the [[Province of Quebec]] adopted a modification of the Quebec Civil Code according animals the status of sentient beings instead of property, as previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/assemblee-nationale/41-1/journal-debats/20150605/148869.html#10h Journal des débats de l'Assemblée nationale] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065643/http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/assemblee-nationale/41-1/journal-debats/20150605/148869.html#10h |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-bill-calls-animals-sentient-beings-and-includes-jail-time-for-cruelty-1.3102399 Quebec bill calls animals 'sentient beings' and includes jail time for cruelty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205120728/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-bill-calls-animals-sentient-beings-and-includes-jail-time-for-cruelty-1.3102399 |date=December 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140621194408/http://animalsarenotobjects.ca/ Manifesto for the Evolution of Animals’ Legal Status in the Civil Code of Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment, however, has not had much impact in German legal practice yet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The greatest success of the animal rights activists has certainly been the granting of basic rights to five [[great ape]] species in [[New Zealand]] in 1999. Their use is now forbidden in research, testing or teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol_7p35.pdf |title=A Step at a Time: New Zealand's Progress Towards Hominid Rights |first=Rowan |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[UK]] government banned experiments on great apes in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

''Animal Rights: Moral Theory and Practice'' (Second Edition), 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} is campaigning for the [[United Nations]] to adopt its [[Declaration on Great Apes]], which would see [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orang-utan]]s included in a "community of equals" with human beings. The declaration wants to extend to the non-human apes the protection of three basic interests: the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- was {{cite web|url=http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113015805/http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.html |archivedate=2013-01-13 |df= }} now redirects (ir did to Brazil version) to: --&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projetogap.org.br/en/world-declaration-on-great-primates/|title=World declaration on great primates|work=[[Great Ape Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[great ape personhood]]).

[[New Zealand]] has effectively phased out live exports for slaughter purposes since 2007 due to concerns about animals.&lt;ref name="Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banliveexport.com/facts/frequently-asked-questions.php|title=Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anonymous birth''' is a birth where the mother gives birth to a child without disclosing her identity, or where her identity remains unregistered. In many countries, anonymous births have been legalized for centuries in order to prevent formerly frequent [[infanticides|killings of newborn children]], particularly outside of marriage.

In an anonymous birth, the mother's right of [[informational self-determination]] severely curtails the children's right to know about their biological [[ancestry]], therefore going beyond the concept of a [[confidential birth]], where the identity of the mother is registered but remains undisclosed, unless the grown up child requests disclosure at a later point.

== History ==
{{section expand |date=October 2015}}
Early anonymous birth legislation can be found in [[Sweden]] where the [[Infanticide Act (Sweden)|Infanticide Act]] of 1778 granted mothers both the right and all means to give birth to their child anonymously.

In [[France]], the tradition of anonymous births can be traced to 1638 when [[Vincent de Paul]] who instituted the ''tour'', a form of [[baby hatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal Freedom through Human Rights Law?: Autonomy, Identity and Integrity under the European Convention on Human Rights|last=Marshall|first=Jill|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|isbn=9789047412083|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French Revolution]] anonymous births were legalized in 1793, when Article 326 of the [[Code Civil]] introduced both the concepts of ''anonymous'' and ''confidential births''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lefaucheur|first=Nadine|date=2004-12-01|title=The French ‘tradition’ of Anonymous Birth: The Lines of Argument|url=http://lawfam.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/319|journal=International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=319–342|doi=10.1093/lawfam/18.3.319|issn=1360-9939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree provided for the creation of safe spaces for women to give birth safely. In 1811 the assistance was replaced with a system of baby hatches. This however caused a surge in [[Child abandonment|abandoned babies]] and was never fully implemented and officially abolished in 1904. Since that time all hospitals must provide wards where women can give birth anonymously. The official birth certificates in France say "sous X" in the place of their birth-giver. {{Margaria, Alice. "Anonymous Birth." The International Journal of Children's Rights. 22.3 (2014): 552-580. Print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a 'national council for access to personal origins' (CNAOP) is created to mediate between the anonymous mothers and children. The birth mother is asked to leave information about their identity behind in a sealed envelope that can be opened by the CNAOP if the child ever asks so that the birth mother can be contacted. However, the information will not be given to the child without consent.

==Legal situation==
In 2003 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in a case involving anonymous birth in Odièvre v. France.&lt;ref&gt;Odièvre v. France [GC], no. 42326/98, ECHR 2003-III, {{ECLI|ECLI:CE:ECHR:2003:0213JUD004232698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant's mother had given birth anonymously; when the applicant later asked for more information, she was only given non-identifying information. The applicant appealed to the Court citing [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], stating that it was a violation to the right to a family life. The Court noted that the case could not simply be viewed as a conflict between the rights of the birth mother and the child, because it also affected the rights of the adoptive parents and any family of the birth mother. The Court ruled that, given that the recently created National Council on Access to Information about Personal Origins presented an avenue to contact the birth mother in a controlled way, the state had attempted to strike a sufficient balance between the competing rights; the application was therefore denied.

A '''bill of costs''' is an itemized list of expenses a prevailing party in a [[lawsuit]] or action needs to pay for services procured from a lawyer. It can have varying levels of detail, and should describe the nature of the work done by the lawyer for the client, and any other expenses incurred.  Recoverable costs vary by jurisdiction, but often include copying fees, filing fees, travel expenses, court reporter fees, and electronic legal research costs.[http://www.jeffvail.net/2010/06/bill-of-costs-litigation-checklist.html (example checklist of expenses recoverable in a bill of costs)]

In some cases, particularly those in which [[attorney's fees]] are part of the [[Legal remedy|relief]] demanded by the [[plaintiff]], a bill of costs may be submitted to the [[court]], in order to determine how much of the prevailing party's costs the losing party must pay.

'''Civil law''', or '''civilian law''', is a legal system originating in Europe, intellectualized within the framework of [[Roman law]], the main feature of which is that its core principles are [[Codification (law)|codified]] into a referable system which serves as the primary source of law. This can be contrasted with [[common law]] systems, the intellectual framework of which comes from judge-made [[case law|decisional law]], and gives [[precedent]]ial authority to prior court decisions, on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions (doctrine of judicial [[precedent]], or ''[[stare decisis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Washington Probate, "Estate Planning &amp; Probate Glossary", ''Washington (State) Probate'', s.v. [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525183721/http://www.wa-probate.com/Intro/Estate-Probate-Glossary.htm "common law"], [htm], 8 Dec. 2008, retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Arnold-Baker]], ''[[The Companion to British History]]'', s.v. "English Law" (London: Loncross Denholm Press, 2008), 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a civil law is the group of legal ideas and systems ultimately derived from the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', but heavily overlaid by [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]], [[Early Germanic law|Germanic]], [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]], feudal, and local practices,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arnold Baker, ''The Companion to British History'', s.v. "Civilian" (London: Routledge, 2001), 308.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as doctrinal strains such as [[natural law]], codification, and [[legal positivism]].

Conceptually, civil law proceeds from abstractions, formulates general principles, and distinguishes [[substantive law|substantive rules]] from [[procedural law|procedural rules]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Fromont, ''Grands systèmes de droit étrangers'', 4th edn. (Paris: Dalloz, 2001), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds [[case law]] secondary and subordinate to [[statutory law]]. Civil law is often paired with the [[inquisitorial system]], but the terms are not synonymous.

There are key differences between a [[statute]] and a codal article. The most pronounced features of civil systems are their [[legal codes]], with brief legal texts that typically avoid factually specific scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;“The role of legislation is to set, by taking a broad approach, the general propositions of the law, to establish principles which will be fertile in application, and not to get down to the details. . . .” Alain Levasseur, Code Napoleon or Code Portalis?, 43 Tul. L. Rev. 762, 769 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The short articles in a civil law code deal in generalities and stand in contrast with statutory systems, which are often very long and very detailed.

==Overview==
The purpose of codification is to provide all citizens with manners and written collection of the laws which apply to them and which judges must follow. It is the most widespread system of law in the world, in force in various forms in about 150 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=Iran&amp;countryCode=ir&amp;regionCode=me#2100|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws heavily from Roman law, arguably the most intricate known legal system dating from before the modern era.

Where codes exist, the primary source of law is the [[Civil code|law code]], a systematic collection of interrelated articles,&lt;ref name="Neubauer, David W. 2007, pg.28"/&gt; arranged by subject matter in some pre-specified order,&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary of Legal Terms", ''12th District Court – Jackson, County, MI'', retrieved on 12 June 2009: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061024211358/http://www.d12.com/glossary/glossary.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; that explain the principles of law, rights and entitlements, and how basic legal mechanisms work. Law codes are simply laws enacted by a [[legislature]], even if they are in general much longer than other laws. Other major legal systems in the world include [[common law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Halakha]], and [[Canon Law|canon law]].

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|upright=1.35|Legal systems of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/syst-onu/index-alpha.php Alphabetical Index of the 192 United Nations Member States and Corresponding Legal Systems], Website of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law based systems are in turquoise.]]

Civil law countries can be divided into:
* those where Roman law in some form is still living law but there has been no attempt to create a [[civil code]]: [[Andorra]] and [[San Marino]]
* those with uncodified mixed systems in which civil law is an academic source of authority but common law is also influential: Scotland and the [[Roman-Dutch law]] countries ([[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Guyana]])
* those with codified mixed systems in which civil law is the background law but has its public law heavily influenced by common law: [[Puerto Rico]], [[Philippines]], [[Quebec]] and [[Louisiana]]
* those with comprehensive codes that exceed a single civil code, such as France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Spain: it is this last category that is normally regarded as typical of civil law systems, and is discussed in the rest of this article.

The Scandinavian systems are of a hybrid character since their background law is a mix of civil law and Scandinavian customary law and they have been partially codified. Likewise, the laws of the [[Channel Islands]] ([[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], [[Sark]]) mix [[Norman law|Norman customary law]] and [[French civil law]].

A prominent example of a civil-law is the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1804), named after French emperor [[Napoleon]]. The code comprises three components: 
* the law of persons 
* property law
* commercial law
Rather than a compendium of statutes or catalog of [[case law]], the code sets out general principles as rules of law.&lt;ref name="Neubauer, David W. 2007, pg.28"/&gt;

Unlike [[common law]] systems, civil law jurisdictions deal with case law apart from any [[precedent]] value. Civil law courts generally decide cases using codal provisions on a case-by-case basis, without reference to other (or even superior) judicial decisions.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} In actual practice, an increasing degree of precedent is creeping into civil law [[jurisprudence]], and is generally seen in many nations' highest courts.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} While the typical [[French-speaking]] [[supreme court]] decision is short, concise and devoid of explanation or justification, in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]], the supreme courts can and do tend to write more verbose opinions, supported by legal reasoning.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} A line of similar case decisions, while not precedent ''per se'', constitute ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} While civil law jurisdictions place little reliance on court decisions, they tend to generate a phenomenal number of reported [[legal opinion]]s.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} However, this tends to be uncontrolled, since there is no statutory requirement that any case be reported or published in a [[law report]], except for the councils of state and constitutional courts.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=58}} Except for the highest courts, all publication of legal opinions are unofficial or commercial.{{sfn|Reynolds|1998|p=59}}

Civil law is sometimes referred to as neo-Roman law, Romano-Germanic law or Continental law. The expression "civil law" is a translation of Latin ''jus civile'', or "citizens' law", which was the [[Roman law|late imperial]] term for its legal system, as opposed to the laws governing conquered peoples (''[[Jus gentium|jus gentium]]''); hence, the Justinian Code's title ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. Civil law practitioners, however, traditionally refer to their system in a broad sense as ''[[jus commune]]'', literally "common law", meaning the general principles of law as opposed to laws specific to particular areas.  (The use of "common law" for the Anglo-Saxon systems may or may not be influenced by this usage.)

==History==

Civil law takes as its major inspiration classical [[Roman law]] (''c''. AD 1–250), and in particular [[Justinian I|Justinian]] [[Corpus Juris Civilis|law]] (6th century AD), and further expanded and developed in the late [[Medieval Roman Law|Middle Ages]] under the influence of [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0859206.html |title=Roman Law and Its Influence |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code's doctrines provided a sophisticated model for [[contract]]s, rules of procedure, [[family law]], wills, and a strong [[monarchy|monarchical]] [[constitution]]al system.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pennington, "Roman and Secular Law in the Middle Ages", ''Medieval Latin: An Introduction and Bibliographical Guide'', edd. F.A.C. Mantello and A.G. Rigg (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University Press of America, 1996), 254–266; [html], available at {{cite web |url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/law508/histlaw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014718/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/histlaw.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}, retrieved 27 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law was received differently in different countries. In some it went into force wholesale by legislative act, i.e., it became [[positive law]], whereas in others it was diffused into society by increasingly influential legal experts and scholars.

Roman law continued without interruption in the [[Byzantine Empire]] until its final fall in the 15th century. However, given the multiple incursions and occupations by Western European powers in the late medieval period, its laws became widely implemented in the West. It was first received in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] partly because it was considered [[Roman law#classical Roman law|imperial law]], and it spread in Europe mainly because its students were the only trained lawyers. It became the basis of [[Scots law]], though partly rivaled by received feudal [[Norman law]]. In England, it was taught academically at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], but underlay only [[probate]] and [[marriage|matrimonial]] law insofar as both were inherited from canon law, and [[maritime law]], adapted from ''[[lex mercatoria]]'' through the [[Bordeaux]] trade.

Consequently, neither of the two waves of Roman influence completely dominated in Europe. Roman law was a secondary source that was applied only when local customs and laws were found lacking on a certain subject. However, after a time, even local law came to be interpreted and evaluated primarily on the basis of Roman law, since it was a common European legal tradition of sorts, and thereby in turn influenced the main source of law. Eventually, the work of civilian [[glossator]]s and commentators led to the development of a common body of law and writing about law, a common legal language, and a common method of teaching and scholarship, all termed the ''[[jus commune]]'', or law common to Europe, which consolidated canon law and Roman law, and to some extent, [[feudal law]].

==Codification==
An important common characteristic of civil law, aside from its origins in Roman law, is the comprehensive [[Codification (law)|codification]] of received Roman law, i.e., its inclusion in civil codes. The earliest [[Codification (law)|codification]] known is the [[Code of Hammurabi]], written in ancient [[Babylon]] during the 18th century BC. However, this, and many of the codes that followed, were mainly lists of civil and criminal wrongs and their punishments. The codification typical of modern civilian systems did not first appear until the Justinian Code.

Germanic codes appeared over the 6th and 7th centuries to clearly delineate the law in force for Germanic privileged classes versus their Roman subjects and regulate those laws according to [[Anglo-Saxon law|folk-right]]. Under [[feudal]] law, a number of private [[custumal]]s were compiled, first under the [[Norman law|Norman empire]] (''Très ancien coutumier'', 1200–1245), then elsewhere, to record the [[manorialism|manorial]] – and later regional – customs, court decisions, and the legal principles underpinning them. Custumals were commissioned by lords who presided as lay judges over manorial courts in order to inform themselves about the court process. The use of custumals from influential towns soon became commonplace over large areas. In keeping with this, certain monarchs consolidated their kingdoms by attempting to compile custumals that would serve as the law of the land for their realms, as when [[Charles VII of France]] in1454 commissioned an official custumal of Crown law. Two prominent examples include the ''Coutume de Paris'' (written 1510; revised 1580), which served as the basis for the Napoleonic Code, and the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' (c. 1220) of the [[bishopric]]s of [[Magdeburg]] and [[Halberstadt]] which was used in northern Germany, Poland, and the [[Low Countries]].

The concept of codification was further developed during the 17th and 18th centuries AD, as an expression of both [[Natural Law|natural law]] and the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The political ideals of that era was expressed by the concepts of [[democracy]], protection of [[property]] and the [[rule of law]]. Those ideals required certainty of law, recorded, uniform law. So, the mix of Roman law and customary and local law gave way to law codification.

Also, the notion of a [[nation-state]] implied recorded [[law]] that would be applicable to that state.

There was also a reaction to law codification. The proponents of codification regarded it as conducive to certainty, unity and systematic recording of the law; whereas its opponents claimed that codification would result in the [[wikt:ossification|ossification]] of the law.

In the end, despite whatever resistance to codification, the codification of European private laws moved forward. Codifications were completed by Denmark (1687), Sweden (1734), Prussia (1794), France (1804), and [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austria]] (1811). The French codes were imported into areas conquered by Napoleon and later adopted with modifications in Poland ([[Duchy of Warsaw]]/[[Congress Poland]]; Kodeks cywilny 1806/1825), Louisiana (1807), Canton of Vaud (Switzerland; 1819), the [[Burgerlijk Wetboek|Netherlands]] (1838), [[Serbian civil law|Serbia]] (1844), Italy and Romania (1865), Portugal (1867) and Spain (1888). [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Germany]] (1900), and [[Swiss civil code|Switzerland]] (1912) adopted their own codifications. These codifications were in turn imported into colonies at one time or another by most of these countries. The Swiss version was adopted in Brazil (1916) and Turkey (1926).

In the United States, [[U.S. state]]s began codification with New York's "[[David Dudley Field II|Field Code]]" (1850), followed by California's [[California Codes|code]]s (1872), and the federal [[Revised Statutes of the United States|revised statutes]] (1874) and the current [[United States Code]] (1926).

In Japan, at the beginning of the Meiji Era, European legal systems—especially the civil law of Germany and France—were the primary models for the judicial and legal systems. In China, the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing dynasty]], emulating Japan. In addition, it formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], which remains in force in Taiwan. Furthermore, Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria, former Japanese colonies, have been strongly influenced by the Japanese legal system.

Some authors consider civil law the foundation for [[socialist law]] used in [[Communism|communist]] countries, which in this view would basically be civil law with the addition of [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideals. Even if this is so, civil law was generally the legal system in place before the rise of socialist law, and some Eastern European countries reverted to the pre-socialist civil law following the fall of socialism, while others continued using a socialist legal systems.

Several civil-law mechanisms seem to have been borrowed from medieval Islamic [[Sharia]] and ''[[fiqh]]''. For example, the Islamic ''[[hawala]]'' (''hundi'') underlies the ''avallo'' of Italian law and the ''aval'' of [[French civil law|French]] and [[Spanish law|Spanish]] law.&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|jstor=839667|publisher=The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 26, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Courts and other government branches are theoretically subordinate to the [[Sharia|Shari'a]]. In practice, courts historically made the Shari'a, while today, the religious courts are generally subordinate to the executive.

Civil law is primarily contrasted with [[common law]], which is the legal system developed first in England, and later among [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] peoples of the world. Despite their differences, the two systems are quite similar from a historical point of view. Both evolved in much the same way, though at different paces. The Roman law underlying civil law developed mainly from customary law that was refined with case law and legislation. Canon law further refined court procedure. Similarly, English law developed from Anglo-Saxon customary law, [[Danelaw]] and [[Norman law]], further refined by case law and legislation. The differences are
* Roman law had crystallized many of its principles and mechanisms in the form of the Justinian Code, which drew from case law, scholarly commentary, and senatorial statutes 
* civilian case law has persuasive authority, not binding authority as under common law

[[Codification (law)|Codification]], however, is by no means a defining characteristic of a civil law system. For example, the statutes that govern the civil law systems of Sweden and other [[Nordic countries]] and the Roman-Dutch countries are not grouped into larger, expansive codes like those in French and German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Subgroups==
The term ''civil law'' comes from English legal scholarship and is used in English-speaking countries to lump together all legal systems of the ''jus commune'' tradition. However, [[comparative law|legal comparativists]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] {{Who|date=December 2017}} prefer to subdivide civil law jurisdictions into four distinct groups:
*'''Napoleonic''': France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Brazil, other [[CPLP]] countries, Macau, former [[Portuguese India|Portuguese territories]] in India ([[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]), Romania, and most of the Arab world{{which|date=September 2014}} when Islamic law is not used.  Former colonies include Quebec (Canada) and Louisiana (U.S.).
**[[Chilean Civil Code|The Chilean Code]] is an original work of jurist and legislator [[Andrés Bello]]. Traditionally, the Napoleonic Code has been considered the main source of inspiration for the Chilean Code. However, this is true only with regard to the [[law of obligation]]s and the [[law of things]] (except for the [[principle of abstraction]]), while it is not true at all in the matters of family and successions. This code was integrally adopted by Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela (although only for one year). According to other Latin American experts of its time, like [[Augusto Teixeira de Freitas]] (author of the "Esboço de um Código Civil para o Brasil") or [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]] (main author of the Argentinian Civil Code), it is the most important legal accomplishments of Latin America.
**Cameroon, a former colony of both France and United Kingdom, is bi-juridical/mixed
*'''Germanistic''': Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia, [[Roman Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]], Czech Republic, Russia, Lithuania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Ukraine, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand{{why|date=September 2014}}
**South Africa, a former colony of the United Kingdom, was heavily influenced by colonists from the Netherlands and therefore is bi-juridical/mixed.
*'''Nordic''': Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden
*'''[[Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese]]''' (except Hong Kong and Macau) is a mixture of civil law and socialist law. Presently, Chinese laws absorb some features of common law system, especially those related to commercial and international transactions. Hong Kong, although part of China, uses common law. The Basic Law of Hong Kong ensures the use and status of common law in Hong Kong. Macau continues to have a Portuguese legal system of civil law.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:

'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence''': The Italian civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132|title=Towards a civil code: the italian experience|work=teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been imitated by other countries, including Portugal (1966), the Netherlands (1992), Brazil (2002) and Argentina (2014). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title="On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code" by Mitchell Franklin |work=duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence''': The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the Republic of Turkey is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

Some systems of civil law do not fit neatly into this typology, however. [[Law of Poland|Polish law]] developed as a mixture of French and German civil law in the 19th century. After the reunification of Poland in 1918, five legal systems (French Napoleonic Code from the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German BGB]] from Western Poland, Austrian ABGB from Southern Poland, Russian law from Eastern Poland, and Hungarian law from [[Spisz]] and [[Orava (region)|Orawa]]) were merged into one. Similarly, [[law of the Netherlands|Dutch law]], while originally codified in the Napoleonic tradition, has been heavily altered under influence from the Dutch native tradition of [[Roman-Dutch law]] (still in effect in its former colonies). [[Scotland]]'s [[Scots law|civil law tradition]] borrowed heavily from Roman-Dutch law. Swiss law is categorized as Germanistic, but it has been heavily influenced by the Napoleonic tradition, with some indigenous elements added in as well.

[[Louisiana law|Louisiana private law]] is primarily a Napoleonic system. [[Louisiana]] is the only [[U.S. state]] partially based on [[Law of France|French]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish]] codes and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la-legal.com/modules/article/view.article.php?c8/29 |title=How the Code Napoleon makes Louisiana law different |publisher=[[LA-Legal]] |accessdate=2006-10-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031041737/http://www.la-legal.com/modules/article/view.article.php?c8%2F29 |archivedate=2006-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Louisiana, private law was codified into the [[Louisiana Civil Code]]. Current Louisiana law has converged considerably with American law, especially in its [[public law]], judicial system, and adoption of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (except for Article 2) and certain legal devices of American common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Louisiana-Judicial-system.html |title=Louisiana – Judicial system |publisher=City-data.com |date=|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, any innovation, whether private or public, has been decidedly common law in origin.{{Citation needed|reason=Most innovations in Louisiana law come from the Louisiana State Law Institute, a civil law organization, so this statement appears to be incorrect|date=December 2013}} [[Quebec]] law, whose private law is also of French civil origin, has developed along the same lines,  adapting in the same way as Louisiana to the public law and judicial system of [[Canadian law|Canadian common law]]. By contrast, Quebec private law has innovated mainly from civil sources. To a lesser extent, other states formerly part of the Spanish Empire, such as Texas and California, have also retained aspects of Spanish civil law into their legal system, for example [[community property]]. The [[Law of Puerto Rico|legal system of Puerto Rico]] exhibits similarities to that of Louisiana: a civil code whose interpretations rely on both the civil and common law systems. Because [[Civil Code of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]'s Civil Code is based on the Spanish Civil Code of 1889, available jurisprudence has tended to rely on common law innovations due to the code's age and in many cases, obsolete nature.

Several Islamic countries have civil law systems that contain elements of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565815/Civil_Law.html Civil Law]". Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR3YCSY?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565815/Civil_Law.html Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] of 1810 that developed in the early 19th century&amp;mdash;which remains in force in Egypt is the basis for the civil law in many countries of the [[Arab world]] where the civil law is used&amp;mdash; is based on the Napoleonic Code, but its primary author [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] attempted to integrate principles and features of Islamic law in deference to the unique circumstances of Egyptian society.

Japanese Civil Code was considered as a mixture of roughly 60 percent of the German civil code and roughly 30 percent of the French civil code and 8 percent of Japanese customary law and 2 percent of the English law.&lt;ref&gt;和仁陽「岡松参太郎――法比較と学理との未完の綜合――」『法学教室』No.183 {{ja icon}} P.79&lt;/ref&gt; The code includes the doctrine of [[ultra vires]] and a precedent of [[Hadley v Baxendale]] from English common law system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">The '''companionship exemption''' refers to federal labor regulations in the United States that exclude workers providing companionship services to the elderly or disabled from the federal [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]] and [[overtime]] protections that apply to most other American workers.

The exemption came into existence in 1974 through an amendment to the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA). While the main purpose of the amendment was to expand labor protections to [[domestic worker]]s, two exceptions were included: one for those serving as “casual” babysitters and another for those providing “companionship services for individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|29|213(a)(15)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy Over Application to Home Care Workers ==

The [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL) holds significant discretion over how the companionship exemption is interpreted and applied in the workplace. Under the DOL’s current interpretation, the companionship exemption applies to most [[home care]] workers (also known as [[Personal Care Assistant|personal care assistants]]), allowing their employers—unless they are in a state with regulations superseding those at the federal level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Pay for Home Care Workers: Reforming the U.S. Department of Labor’s Companionship Rules Under the Fair Labor Standards Act|url=http://www.nelp.org/page/-/Justice/2011/FairPayforHomeCareWorkers.pdf?nocdn=1|publisher=National Employment Law Project|accessdate=24 May 2011|author1=Paul K. Sonn |author2=Catherine K. Ruckelshaus |author3=Sarah Leberstein }}&lt;/ref&gt;—to pay below minimum wage and avoid overtime compensation.

Since the companionship exemption was put in place, a variety of unsuccessful efforts have been made through legislation, court challenges, and by the DOL itself to narrow the exemption so that more home care workers become eligible for minimum wage and overtime. In 2007, the case ''Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke'' &lt;ref&gt;Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 167 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; brought the issue of the companionship exemption in front of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In this case, home care worker Evelyn Coke claimed she was unfairly denied minimum wage and overtime pay by her employer. While the court ruled against Coke, its decision reaffirmed the DOL’s authority to change its interpretation of the exemption at any time. The New York Times has written three editorials calling for an end to the companionship exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caring for the Caregivers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/opinion/28wed1.html|accessdate=24 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fair Pay for Caregivers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/opinion/09thur2.htm|accessdate=24 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lilly and Evelyn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/opinion/29fri3.html|accessdate=24 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disability community and many home care workers are concerned that the proposed changes will force seniors and people with disabilities into institutions, cut the take-home pay of attendants, reduce the available attendant workforce, force people with disabilities to cut the hours of longtime attendants and bring strangers into their homes, and devastate consumer directed services.  They point out that the administration failed to adequately engage the disability community as described in [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/18/improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review-executive-order Executive Order 13563].  The [www.ncd.gov National Council on Disability] sent a [http://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/DOL10012012 letter] urging the Obama administration to use a negotiated rule-making to address this oversight.

== Current Status ==

The Obama administration announced in December 2011 that it has [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/business/wage-protection-planned-for-home-care-workers.html proposed a regulation] amending the companionship exemption. If implemented, the regulation would grant minimum wage and overtime protections to home care workers throughout the U.S.

The regulation will become a final rule following a [http://www.leadingage.org/Article.aspx?id=4056 60-day comment period].

[[ADAPT]] still considers the issue unresolved. Source: http://www.adapt.org/main.2012

On September 17, 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a final rule extending the Fair Labor Standards Act’s minimum wage and overtime protections to most of the nation’s workers who provide essential home care assistance to elderly people and people with illnesses, injuries or disabilities. The Obama Administration anticipated that this change would provide FLSA protections to nearly two million direct care workers—such as home health aides, personal care aides and certified nursing assistant and help guarantee that those who rely on the assistance of direct care workers have access to consistent and high-quality care from a stable and increasingly professional workforce.   With an unprecedented 15 month implementation timeframe, the narrowing on the companionship exemption under FLSA, becomes effective January 1, 2015.  The final rule, released October 2013, is intended to provide additional protections under FLSA for homecare workers and has been accompanied by dedicated webpages on the DOL's Wage an Hour website at www.dol.gov/whd/homecare.

'''Credit agreements in South Africa''' are agreements or contracts in South Africa in terms of which payment or repayment by one party (the debtor) to another (the creditor) is deferred. This entry discusses the core elements of credit agreements as defined in the National Credit Act, and the consequences of concluding a credit agreement in South Africa.

== Definitions of types of credit transactions ==
It is essential that the meanings of important terms used in the practice of consumer law are clearly understood. Most of the definitions below are obtained from the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (“the Act”).

=== Agreement ===
An “agreement” simply means a contract.

=== Credit ===
“Credit” means a deferral or delay of payment of a sum of money to another person, or a promise to pay money.

The critical role of credit in the economy is explained in the August 2004 policy framework of the Department of Trade and Industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit enables people to have use of a product or service, at a cost represented by an interest rate, prior to their having paid for that product or service or, where an item cannot be afforded from a single month’s salary, to spread payments over a number of months.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This document goes on to describe credit as a “double-edged sword,” because of the “considerable imbalance of power between consumers and credit providers,” due to poor consumer education levels and knowledge of consumer rights, and inability to enforce such rights through negotiation or legal action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Credit cannot therefore be seen as a universal basic service to which access should be extended in the same way as access to water, health care and electricity. There is a greater need to balance access to credit with protection for consumers, especially the vulnerable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Credit provider ===
A credit provider is the party who supplies goods or services (in terms of an instalment sale agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured money loan, overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often also referred to as “the creditor,” in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.

=== Consumer ===
A consumer is the party to whom goods or services are sold, or to whom money is loaned in any of the examples referred to above. When steps are taken to recover amounts due, the consumer is often referred to as “the debtor.”

=== Credit agreement ===
An agreement is a credit agreement if it provides for a deferral or delay of payment, and if there is a fee or interest charged for the deferred payment. The Act does not require that a credit agreement be in writing and signed by both parties, although this is implied throughout the Act. A credit agreement may be a credit facility, a credit transaction or a credit guarantee (or a combination of these). These three terms are defined in section 8 of the Act.

==== Credit facility ====
A credit facility is an agreement in terms of which a credit provider supplies goods or services, or pays an amount to the consumer. The consumer's obligation to pay the price or repay the money is deferred, in exchange for which the consumer pays interest and fees. Examples of a credit facility are credit advanced

* on an overdrawn cheque account in terms of an overdraft facility; or
* on a credit card account.

==== Credit transaction ====
A “credit transaction” may refer any one of a number of different types of transactions. Most important for present purposes are the follow

===== Instalment agreements =====
In terms of instalment agreements, movable goods (like furniture, clothing or a car) are sold, the price is paid in instalments, and the item is delivered to the consumer. The consumer becomes owner only once all instalments have been paid.

===== Unsecured money loans =====
Unsecured money loans are usually smaller money loans (micro-loans) re-payable in instalments, where the lender is given no security for re-payment of the debt.

===== Pawn transactions =====
In terms of pawn transactions, money is lent and the borrower provides an item of property as security, the resale value of which is greater than the loan. The creditor is entitled to sell the property if the money is not repaid by an agreed date, and to keep the proceeds of the sale.

===== Mortgage agreements =====
Mortgage agreements are money loans secured by the registration of a mortgage bond over land, the proceeds of which are usually used to buy land or housing.

===== Secured loans =====
In terms of secured loans, money is paid, and the credit provider receives a pledge of any movable property or something else of value as security for repayment of the loan.

===== Leases of movable goods =====
Leases of movable goods—that is, not land or housing—would include, for example, a telefax machine or a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, together with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, it will not be a credit transaction in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a credit transaction in terms of the Act.

==== Credit guarantees ====
In terms of a credit guarantee, a third party agrees to pay to a creditor the amount due by a consumer, on demand (as, for example, in the case of suretyship, in terms of which personal security is provided for the debt of another person resulting from an overdrawn cheque account).

==== Incidental credit agreements ====
Incidental credit agreements occur when goods or services are provided to a consumer over a period of time and a fee or interest is charged only if payment is not made by an agreed date. Examples include

* accounts for municipal services, such as water or electricity; and
* sales of clothing where no interest is charged provided that the account is paid by a certain date.

Incidental credit agreements do not fall under the definition of credit agreements in the Act. Section 5 sets out the limited provisions of the Act applicable to them.

A number of other agreements are not regarded as credit agreements by the Act, including

* transactions between a [[stokvel]] (a voluntary association involving a rotating financial scheme with entertainment, social or economic functions) and its members;
* an insurance policy; and
* a lease of immovable property.

== National Credit Act ==
The National Credit Act is a complicated and lengthy piece of legislation that tries to regulate closely every sector of the consumer credit market. The last provisions of the Act became effective on June 1, 2007. The Act repealed the Usury Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 73 of 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Credit Agreements Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 75 of 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and bears very little resemblance to these Acts. It represents a clean break from the past. All consumer credit law is contained within the Act, which applies to all credit agreements and all credit providers.

The Act has the ambitious and extremely difficult objective of promoting a competitive, efficient and effective credit industry and market which is at the same time fair, transparent, responsible and accessible. The overriding theme of the Act is consumer protection. Section 3 of the Act sets out a number of methods that the Act adopts to achieve this.

=== Important consumer credit institutions ===

Much of the responsibility for implementing the purposes of the Act lies with the National Credit Regulator (NCR), which oversees the entire consumer credit industry, including all the functions and responsibilities of the former Micro-finance Regulatory Council (in the micro-lending context). The NCR is an independent organisation governed by a Board, with a Chief Executive Officer who may appoint inspectors and investigators.

The NCR has an enormous number of responsibilities. These are set out in great detail in sections 13 to 18 of the Act. It remains to be seen whether or not it will have the necessary capacity to perform all these functions. Its responsibilities include

* the promotion and development of a credit market accessible to all;
* monitoring and reporting annually certain market trends to the Minister;
* conducting research and proposing policies to the Minister regarding the consumer credit industry;
* regulating the industry by registering credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors, and suspending or cancelling registration;
* enforcing the Act in numerous ways listed in section 15;
* promoting public awareness of consumer credit matters in various ways listed in section 16 (consumer education);
* engaging with provincial regulatory authorities;
* advising the Minister; and
* recommending and reporting to the Minister on various aspects of consumer credit practice, policy and legislation.

==== National Consumer Tribunal ====
The National Consumer Tribunal is an independent body, separate from the NCR. It has jurisdiction throughout South Africa, and comprises a chairperson and at least ten other members appointed by the President. A tribunal of record, it conducts its proceedings in public in an informal, inquisitorial manner. It applies principles of natural justice, and has the function of ruling on any matter brought before it in terms of the Act. The Act provides rules of practice, procedure, evidence and a list of possible orders in relation to the Tribunal.

The powers of the Tribunal are mentioned throughout the Act, the most important of which are

* to hear cases of alleged contraventions of the Act, mostly by credit providers;
* to impose fines;
* to make orders reflecting resolutions agreed in other fora; and
* to function as an appeal body. (Decisions of the NCR, for example, may be taken on appeal to the Tribunal.)

==== Registers ====
The NCR is required to establish and maintain two important registers:

# a register of certain persons; and
# a national register of credit agreements.

===== Register of certain persons =====
Credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors are required to register with the NCR. Before a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (threshold is R zero) it has to register with the NCR.

The NCR has the power to suspend or cancel registration in certain circumstances.

Any person may access this register on the NCR website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr.org.za.|title=Home|website=www.ncr.org.za.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may obtain a copy of an extract from the register on payment of a fee. Any person may also obtain a copy of a registration certificate on payment of a fee.

Credit providers and credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Debt counsellors may register at any time.

===== National register of credit agreements =====
The NCR may be required by the Minister to establish a single national register of outstanding credit agreements, but it has not done so yet. Once established, credit providers will have to submit the following information in relation to every credit agreement:

* names and addresses of the credit provider and the consumer;
* the registration number of the credit provider;
* the identity number of the consumer;
* the principal debt under a credit agreement;
* the credit limit under a credit facility; and
* the amount and schedule of the monthly instalments payable.

Certain information regarding credit agreements entered into prior to the coming into effect of the Act must also be provided. This register will be accessible to any person on application in the prescribed form. It will also provide a way of monitoring South Africa's consumer debt levels, which the NCR is required to do.

==== Credit bureaux ====
A credit bureau is an entity that is engaged for payment in the business of receiving reports or investigating credit applications and agreements, payment history or patterns, and other consumer credit information. Credit bureaux are also in the business of compiling and maintaining data and issuing reports concerning consumers based on this data. As indicated above, credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Credit bureaux assist credit providers with information that could prevent over-indebtedness of consumers and the granting of reckless credit.

==== Debt counsellors ====
Debt counsellors are not defined in the Act. The NCR's “Debt Counsellor Training Program Learners’ Guide” describes the debt counsellor as “a registrant who is required to do certain tasks stipulated in the Act—including facilitating, investigating, and recommending solutions for over-indebtedness.”

Debt counsellors have a number of functions which appear throughout the Act. The main role of debt counsellors is to evaluate consumers’ indebtedness (upon referral of the consumer by a court, or upon application by the consumer directly to the debt counsellor). The debt counsellor may then recommend to the court

* that the consumer is over-indebted;
* that one or more credit agreements are reckless (and should be set aside or suspended); and
* that the consumer's debts be re-structured.

This procedure is explained in more detail below.

Debt counsellors must apply to the NCR to be registered as such. The Act contains a lengthy list of reasons for disqualification as a debt counsellor. In addition, the Regulations provide that debt counsellors must

* have a Grade-12 or equivalent qualification;
* complete an NCR-approved debt counselling course;
* have a minimum of 2 years’ working experience in certain fields; and
* show an ability to manage their own finances, and to provide counselling or transfer skills.

==== Consumer courts ====
Consumer courts are tribunals established by provincial legislation. The Act allows these courts to be used in various circumstances. There is only one instance where these courts operate at the same level as the National Consumer Tribunal, which is when the NCR refers a complaint to it. Most provinces have introduced their own legislation, but only Gauteng presently has a properly-functioning consumer court.

==== Ombuds ====
The Act uses the gender-neutral term “ombud” (often known as ombudsman). The Act provides that certain disputes between a financial institution (like a bank) and a consumer, arising from a credit agreement, may be referred to the relevant ombud. The ombud will then act as mediator between the institution and the consumer with a complaint.

== Conclusion of credit agreements ==

=== Pre-agreement disclosure ===
Before concluding a credit agreement, the credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a statement and quotation in the form prescribed by the Regulations (Form 20 to the Regulations, in the case of small credit agreements). No agreement is entered into at this stage; the consumer does not have to sign anything or pay any fee. This is a new development in the law, designed to protect consumers. This document must contain the financial details of the proposed agreement (like the amount of credit provided, the number and amount of instalments payable, interest and other fees, deposit required and credit insurance). Consumers must accept or reject the quotation within five days, giving them a chance to shop around for better or cheaper credit. Once the consumer has accepted the quotation, the credit agreement itself can then be concluded.

=== Form and contents of credit agreements ===
The form of the document that records the credit agreement is prescribed by regulation, and varies for different-size credit agreements. The details required for a small credit agreement (a principal debt of less than R15 000) are set out in Form 20.2 to the Regulations. This is not really a form, but rather a framework for the minimum contents of the agreement. These details include

* the parties’ personal particulars;
* the financial details of the agreement (similar to those required for the pre-agreement disclosure above); and
* certain of the consumer's statutory rights and duties (discussed below).

The credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a copy of the signed credit agreement (in paper form or printable electronic form).

Credit agreements may be altered only in very specific circumstances, most importantly in relation to the reduction or increase in credit limits.

== Rights and duties of consumers and credit providers ==
Many consumer rights are contained in the Act, but very few rights for credit providers. (By contrast, credit providers have many duties.) The Act is biased towards consumers, because it seeks to redress imbalances inherent in our common law. This is not unusual for legislation of this kind.

=== Right to apply for credit and non-discrimination ===
Every adult person has the right to apply for credit, but no-one has the right to be granted credit. A credit grantor may choose to refuse credit for reasonable business reasons, but may not unfairly discriminate against a consumer relative to other consumers on the grounds of race, religion, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, language, etc. A consumer may ask for reasons for the refusal of credit, which must be given by the credit provider in writing.

=== Right to understandable language ===
The consumer has the right to be given a quotation and credit agreement in an official language that he reads or understands, to the extent that this is reasonable. Any documents where no form is prescribed must be in plain language (language which an ordinary consumer with average literacy skills and minimal credit experience will understand).

=== Rights regarding information held by credit bureaux ===
Credit bureaux have an important role. For example, they provide credit providers with information on the creditworthiness of consumers. This information could, of course, be damaging to consumers. Credit bureaux are therefore obliged to check with other sources that the information given to them by credit providers is correct. Consumers have the right to have information relating to rescinded judgments expunged (removed) from the records of credit bureaux. Likewise, a consumer who has satisfied all his obligations in terms of a debt rearrangement has the right to have the fact that a debt rearrangement previously existed removed from these records.

A credit provider must advise a debtor before reporting unfavourable information to a credit bureau. Any person may challenge the accuracy of any information reported to or held by a credit bureau. The credit bureau or NCR is then obliged to investigate at no charge and rectify any incorrect information.

The regulations prescribe maximum periods of time that different categories of consumer credit information may be retained by credit bureaux. For example, civil judgments may be retained for the earliest of

* five years;
* until date of rescission by a court; or
* abandonment by credit provider.

Anyone has the right to a free credit bureau report once per year. After that it will cost R20 per enquiry. Two important credit bureaux, with contact numbers, are:
• ITC — 086 148 2482 (Website: www.mycredit.co.za).
• Experian — 086 110 5665 (Website: www.creditexpert.co.za)

=== Protection against marketing practices ===
The Act contains a number of rules in this regard:

* The advertising and marketing of credit must contain prescribed information on the cost of credit (interest and all other charges).
* Negative-option marketing (in terms of which an agreement will automatically come into existence unless the consumer declines an offer) is not permitted.
* Advertisements must not be misleading, fraudulent or deceptive.
* Credit providers may not harass anyone, or try to coerce or persuade anyone to apply for credit.
* Credit sales at a person's home are strictly prohibited, unless
** the sale of credit occurs during a pre-arranged visit for that purpose by the consumer; or
** the provision of credit is incidental to the sale of goods or services.
* A credit provider may require that a consumer have credit life insurance during the existence of a credit agreement, but has a duty to ensure that suitable options for insurance cover are offered to the consumer.

=== Right to confidentiality and privacy ===
Credit bureaux are required to protect the confidentiality of consumer credit information that they hold or report on. Credit providers must also present to consumers the options of being excluded from telemarketing campaigns, marketing or customer lists sold or distributed and mass distribution of e-mail or SMS messages.

=== Right of cooling-off ===
In certain circumstances, consumers may terminate agreements (in writing and properly delivered) within five business days of signing them. This cooling-off right applies only to leases and instalment agreements that are concluded at a location other than the registered business premises of the credit provider. Typically, this right will apply to credit sales on instalments (as in the cases of cars, books, household appliances) concluded at the consumer's home or place of work. The consumer must return the goods bought, and the credit provider must refund amounts paid by the consumer within seven days of termination, less the following:

* reasonable costs of return and repair of damages after sale;
* rent for use of the goods, unless they are still in their original packaging; and
* compensation for depreciation in value of the goods (by agreement or court order only).

=== Early settlement and repayments ===
Consumers are entitled to settle their debts in advance at any time, with or without advance notice, after requesting a statement from the credit provider of the amount required to settle the account. No settlement charge is payable for small agreements; interest and other fees are payable only until date of settlement. This means that a consumer may request from the credit provider the balance due, pay the entire amount, and not be penalised for doing so.

This, however, does not apply to large agreements such as mortgage bonds. If a consumer wishes to settle a bond he must first give notice of cancellation for a period of three months to the credit provider. When a mortgage bond is cancelled, the consumer will be liable for bond cancellation costs.

Consumers may prepay any amount due under a credit agreement (e.g. instalments due) and credit providers are obliged to accept such amounts, even if they are not due. Such payments are used for unpaid interest and fees first, and then to reduce the principal debt.

=== Surrender of goods ===
A consumer may, at any time, return to a credit provider goods that are subject to a credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. The credit provider must then sell the goods and use the proceeds to settle the account. In terms of the former Credit Agreements Act, this procedure applied only when the consumer was in default. This new provision gives the consumer an extraordinary right, enabling him to rid himself of the agreement when he chooses to.

The following procedure must be followed if the consumer elects to enforce this right:

# The consumer must notify the credit provider in writing of the termination of the agreement, and return the goods to the credit provider.
# If the credit provider is already in possession of the goods, the consumer may require the credit provider to sell the goods.
# The credit provider must notify the consumer within ten days of the estimated value of the goods.
# Once the consumer receives this notice of estimated value, he may withdraw his notice of termination within ten days, and resume possession of the goods, unless he is in default under the agreement.
# If the consumer does not respond to the credit provider's notice of estimated value within ten days, the credit provider must sell the goods as soon as possible for the best price possible.
# After the goods have been sold, the credit provider must credit or debit the consumer's account with the proceeds of the sale, less the reasonable costs of the sale.
# The credit provider must give to the consumer a notice indicating the settlement amount before the sale, the amount realised by the sale, and the net proceeds of the sale (after deduction of default charges and the costs of the sale).
# If the result of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a debit balance, the credit provider may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the outstanding balance.
# If the consumer is not satisfied that the goods were sold as soon as possible or for the best price possible, he may attempt to resolve the dispute with the credit provider, or through alternative-dispute methods, or through referral to the National Consumer Tribunal. The Tribunal may award the consumer an additional amount if this is deemed necessary.

=== Statements of account ===
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding statements of account. The Regulations prescribe the form and content of statements in the case of small agreements. Credit providers must deliver to consumers periodic statements of account, usually once a month (but once every two months for instalment sale agreements).

Credit providers are also obliged to provide consumers with statements of account on request, at no charge. The consumer may choose how the statement must be delivered:

* orally (in person, or by telephone); or
* in writing (in person, by SMS, by mail, by fax or by email—provided that the credit provider has these facilities).

Credit providers need not give written statements on demand more than once every three months.

=== Right to apply for debt review and re-structuring of debt ===
These provisions are explained in detail below.

=== Duty to report location of goods ===
In the case of certain credit agreements (typically instalment agreements), the consumer becomes the owner only once the full purchase price has been paid, and the credit provider has a right to repossession on breach of the agreement. Until then, the credit provider has an interest in the whereabouts of the goods.

The consumer has a duty to inform the credit provider of any of the following changes:

* changes of business or residential address;
* changes of the premises where the goods are kept; and
* changes of the name and address of any other person who has possession of the goods.

The consumer must also give to the credit provider or sheriff, on request, the address where the goods are kept, and the name and address of the landlord of the premises.

=== Rights of credit providers ===
The credit provider's most important rights are

* the right to enforce the agreement;
* the right to receive payment of the credit extended, together with agreed interest and fees; and,
* upon breach of contract, the right to cancel the agreement and recover any goods sold.

A credit provider may suspend a credit facility (like a credit card or cheque account) at any time if the consumer is in default, or otherwise close the facility on ten business days’ notice.

A credit provider who has incurred costs in the attachment of goods while enforcing a debt may ask a court to order the consumer to pay the costs of attachment. The court will make such an order only if the consumer provided false information about his address or the location of the goods.

=== Duties of credit providers ===
Every consumer right entails a duty on the part of credit providers. The duties on credit providers are onerous; they provide many administrative burdens. Some of the credit provider's more important duties are

* to register as a credit provider once it has 100 credit agreements or a book debt of R500,000;
* to make a credit assessment of the consumer;
* to give to the consumer a pre-agreement statement and quotation;
* to give to the consumer a copy of the agreement;
* to give to the consumer periodic statements of account, and further statements on request;
* to protect the confidentiality of information about consumers;
* to report to the NCR, or to a credit bureau, the details of every credit agreement concluded, as well as the termination of the agreement when the debt has been paid in full;
* to propose to the consumer to seek advice when the consumer is in default;
* to maintain records of credit applications, agreements and accounts as prescribed in the Regulations;
* to sell goods subject to a credit agreement as soon as possible, for the best price possible, should the consumer request it, and to provide the consumer with a financial statement.

== Over-indebtedness and reckless credit ==
Over-indebtedness is frequently a disastrous consequence of the high cost of credit. Levenstein summarises this state of affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, in South Africa, too many people with too little money have been given too much credit. This ultimately leads to over-indebtedness which results in a never-ending circle of frustration for the consumer who can never repay his debts.&lt;ref&gt;Without Prejudice (2006) 6 at page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Department of Trade and Industry's 2004 policy framework describes credit as “a double-edged sword:”

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst credit allows access to products or services that cannot be acquired out of a single month’s income, it can also be a dangerous instrument that can lead to high levels of debt and indebtedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite easy for credit to lead to financial hardship and destroy a household’s wealth. Taking on extra loans in order to pay back existing loans can lead people into a debt spiral out of which it may be difficult to escape. Over-indebtedness has a negative impact on families and has in some extreme cases even led to family suicides. Over-indebtedness further has an impact upon the workplace, can lead to de-motivation, absenteeism and even a propensity to commit theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Human Sciences Research Council survey on household indebtedness in South Africa showed that, in 2000, over sixty per cent of the regular disposable income of households earning less than R5,000 per year was used to service debt: that is, to pay interest on debt. Levels of indebtedness increased by more than 200 per cent between 1995 and 2000 in the poorest households, with incomes of less than R25,000 per year. This trend seems to have continued since.

It has been argued that consumers are often to blame for allowing themselves to become over-indebted by unwisely borrowing too much money, or by buying too much on credit. This is usually the result of economic desperation and lack of understanding of the difficulties of repaying or servicing their debt. Credit providers are, however, often to blame for recklessly giving too much credit to consumers who cannot afford to service their debt. One of the most important objectives of the Act is to combat over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting. Sections 78 to 88 of the Act contain detailed, far-reaching and extremely important provisions in this regard.

=== Over-indebtedness ===
A consumer is over-indebted if the available information indicates that the consumer is unable to pay the amounts due under a credit agreement in time. When deciding whether or not a consumer is over-indebted, a court must consider the consumer's

*  financial means (primarily income);
* financial prospects (income-earning potential);
* other debt; and
* history of debt repayment.

In any court proceedings, a court may declare a consumer to be over-indebted. Alternatively, a debt counsellor may have a role in one of two ways:

# A court may refer a consumer to a debt counsellor for a recommendation as to whether or not the consumer is over-indebted.
# A consumer may apply in person to a debt counsellor to be declared over-indebted (although this is not permitted if the credit provider has already taken steps to recover the debt). The consumer must apply by completing and submitting Form 16 to the Regulations. The consumer must provide details of the debt and pay a fee of R50 to the debt counsellor.

A debt review must then take place. The debt counsellor must notify all credit providers and credit bureaux listed in the application; they must co-operate fully with the debt counsellor. The debt counsellor must then evaluate the consumer's indebtedness. The evaluation can have one of three possible results:

# The consumer is over-indebted. The debt counsellor may recommend to the magistrate's court thatone or more credit agreements be declared reckless, and/or that one or more of the consumer's debts be re-arranged (for example, by extending the period of a contract and requiring smaller payments, and/or by postponing the dates of payments).
# The consumer is not over-indebted, but is having difficulty paying his debts on time. The counsellor may recommend that the consumer and credit providers try voluntarily to agree on a plan of debt re-arrangement, which may be filed as a consent order in court. If no agreement can be reached, the debt counsellor may make a recommendation to the court, which may make an appropriate order.
# The consumer is not over-indebted, and the application is rejected. The consumer may then apply himself to the magistrate's court for a debt review by completing and submitting Form 18 to the Regulations.

A credit agreement may be declared to be reckless only if the consumer is found to be over- indebted. If the debt counsellor finds that the consumer is not over-indebted, but is of the view that one or more credit agreements are reckless, these agreements may not be declared to be reckless. Credit providers may therefore still enforce credit agreements that are in fact reckless, but they may not be formally declared to be reckless.

While this process is under way, a consumer may not use his credit facility (for example, his credit card); nor may he enter into another credit agreement. A credit provider who enters into a credit agreement with a consumer while the consumer is under debt review runs the risk of the credit agreement's being declared reckless credit.

Also, if a consumer is in default under a credit agreement, and the credit provider has already commenced debt-enforcement proceedings, that agreement may not be subject to the debt review. This could encourage credit providers to start proceedings to recover debt earlier than they otherwise might have done.

The debt-review procedure might well be used by shrewd consumers to delay or avoid payment under a credit agreement. This is so because there are many provisions in the Act which limit the rights of credit providers to enforce debts under review. However, if the consumer is in default under a credit agreement subject to review, the credit provider may give notice to the consumer, the debt counsellor and the NCR to terminate the review. This notice may be given at least sixty days after the date of application for debt review: that is, if the debt-review process is dragging on too long. The credit provider may then take steps to enforce the agreement. The court then has the discretion to order that the debt review resume if appropriate. Finally, it should be noted that an application for debt review by a consumer has serious implications for the consumer as to his creditworthiness and the conclusion of future agreements.

=== Reckless credit ===
A credit provider must not enter into a reckless credit agreement with a consumer. Before entering into a credit agreement, a credit provider must first take reasonable steps to assess the consumer's

* general understanding of the risks and costs of the proposed credit;
* debt repayment history; and
* existing financial means, prospects and obligations.

A credit agreement is reckless

* if, at the time it was concluded, the credit provider failed to conduct the necessary assessment (described above), irrespective of what the outcome of the assessment might have been; or
* if the credit provider entered into the agreement despite the fact that information available to the credit provider after the assessment showed that
** the consumer did not generally understand the consumer's risk and the costs or obligations under the proposed credit agreement; or
** the conclusion of the agreement would cause the consumer to become over-indebted.

This provision helps to prevent credit providers from taking shortcuts by simply accepting seemingly creditworthy debtors at face value. A credit provider may use its own assessment mechanisms, provided these are fair and objective. The consumer, in turn, must fully and truthfully provide the requested information. Failure by the consumer to do so could provide the credit provider with a complete defence to an allegation of reckless credit granting.

In any proceedings that concern credit agreements, a court may declare that a credit agreement is reckless, in which case the court may make an order

* setting aside all or part of the consumer's rights and obligations under that agreement (so that, for example, the consumer may not have to repay a loan or pay the instalments on a credit sale at all); or
* suspending the force and effect of the agreement for a specific period.

If a court declares that a specific credit agreement is reckless, it must also decide whether or not the consumer is over-indebted at the time of the court proceedings. All the debt of the consumer must be considered. If the court finds the consumer to be over-indebted, it may make an order

* suspending the force and effect of that agreement for a specific period; and
* restructuring the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt;

While an agreement is suspended (not set aside),

* the consumer is not required to pay anything in terms of the credit agreement;
* no interest or fee may be debited to the consumer; and
* the credit provider's rights in terms of the agreement are unenforceable.

After the period of suspension ends, all the parties’ rights and obligations are revived and become enforceable again. However, interest or fees that would normally have accrued during the period of suspension may not be charged to the consumer. This is a drastic remedy indeed.

The reckless-credit provisions do not apply to a number of credit agreements, including

* a school loan;
* a student loan; and
* an emergency loan.

A student loan, for example, could be granted to an unemployed consumer, who might not have a credit record (so that the credit provider does not know his payment history). The consumer might not be creditworthy, and there is no security. The nature of these agreements excludes them from being reckless lending.

The negative results for credit providers of either

* contracting with over-indebted consumers; or
* concluding reckless credit agreements

are serious. Many of the provisions are designed to penalise credit providers. Credit providers will be very careful to reduce the risk of bad debt. These provisions are therefore likely to reduce over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that credit grantors will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.

== The cost of credit ==
It is critical that one understand the full implications of the new cost-of-credit provisions in the
National Credit Act and Regulations.

=== Interest rates until 1 June 2007 ===
Until June 1, 2007, the Usury Act (which has now been repealed by the National Credit Act) prescribed limits on the interest rates that credit providers could charge. Until this date, the maximum interest rate was twenty per cent per year on all credit agreements up to R10,000 and seventeen per cent per year on credit agreements over R10,000. However, registered micro-lenders were made exempt from the Usury Act from 1992, meaning that they were entitled to charge whatever interest rates they liked. This resulted in exorbitant interest rates, with micro-lenders charging typically thirty per cent per month (or 360 per cent per year)—eighteen times more than the limit of twenty per cent per year for other credit. Because of the enormous profits that micro-lenders could make, the industry spiralled out of control, growing rapidly year-on-year. In the three years between September 2003 and August 2006, for example, industry disbursements more than doubled. The industry grew by an average of over thirty per cent per year. For the twelve months ending August 2006, the total Rand-value of loans disbursed in the registered micro-finance sector was over R30,000,000,000.

=== The socio-economic impact of excessive interest rates ===
Excessive interest rates have caused terrible socio-economic hardships and suffering for low-income individuals and communities. A high percentage of personal income is used to service micro-lending debt, leaving very little of borrowers’ personal income to pay for other household expenses. Borrowers on thirty-day loans in particular are very soon caught in debt traps from which they are unable to escape. Tens of billions are lost to lower-income communities in the form of interest on micro-loans every year, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Levels of indebtedness are high and appear to be increasing. The problem of over-indebtedness is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent of the adult population of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry to function without legislated and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted to legislated economic abuse.

=== The cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Act ===
The National Credit Act prescribes limits on interest rates for all forms of credit, including micro-loans. However, the Act introduces other fees (the initiation fee and the service fee) which cause the total cost of credit to remain extremely high. No longer is it sufficient to consider only interest rates. Interest rates, initiation fees and service fees must all be carefully calculated in order to work out the total cost of credit for borrowers. The new cost-of-credit provisions came into force on June 1, 2007.

==== Interest ====
Different interest rates apply to different categories of credit agreements:

===== Short-term credit transactions =====
“Short-term credit transactions” are agreements up to R8,000 repayable within six months; usually these are micro-loans. The maximum interest rate permitted is five per cent per month, or sixty per cent per year.

===== Unsecured credit transactions =====
“Unsecured credit transactions” are agreements for which there is no security for the debt at all (like loans or sales on credit). There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Repurchase Rate ((Repurchase Rate x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.

===== Credit facilities =====
Secured bank loans, credit card or cheque accounts fall under the category “credit facility.” The maximum interest rate is also linked to the SARB Bank Repurchase Rate, and is currently 29.8 per cent per year.

===== Developmental credit agreements =====
“Developmental credit agreements” are credit agreements entered into to develop a small business, an educational loan, or a loan for purposes of building low-cost housing. The maximum interest rate is 38.8% per year.

===== Mortgage bond agreements =====
For mortgage bond agreements, the maximum interest rate is 24.9 per cent per year.

==== The initiation fee ====
The initiation fee is intended to cover the costs of initiating a credit agreement, although it is not clear exactly what costs the fee is intended to cover. It is a once-off payment made by the consumer on conclusion of the credit agreement or payable in instalments (as a separate loan attracting interest).

The maximum initiation fee in terms of the Regulations is R150 per credit agreement, plus ten per cent of the amount of the agreement in excess of R1,000, but never to exceed R1,000. Also, the initiation fee may never exceed fifteen per cent of the principal debt.

It will be extremely difficult for consumers to find the necessary cash to pay the initiation fee up front at a time when they are taking out a loan precisely because they are in need of cash. Most lenders will thus be unable to afford to pay the initiation fee on taking out a loan, particularly in the case of the very poor borrowing for consumption purposes. These people will thus be forced to allow the initiation fee to be capitalised and re-paid, probably in the same number of instalments as the initial loan, and subject to the same interest rate as the initial loan. The result will be that the effective monthly cost of credit will increase.

==== The service fee ====
The service fee is defined as a fee that may be charged periodically (usually monthly) by a credit provider in connection with the routine administrative cost of maintaining a credit agreement. The maximum service fee in terms of the Regulations is R50 per month, or R600 per year. The same “flat-rate” maximum service fee of R50 is applicable to all categories and sizes of credit agreements. It appears that the service fee was standardised in order to simplify the application of the Act, justifiable on the basis that every loan, no matter what its size, needs to be administered.

[[File:Table B - The effective cost of the service fee on different size loans.png|thumb|The effect of the flat-rate service fee of R50 per month on different size loans in terms of South African law, shown as a percentage of the loan amount.]]

The smaller the loan, the more expensive will be the service fee relative to the loan. When this cost is shown as a percentage, it is clear that the service fee adds significantly to the cost of the loan, increasing rapidly with smaller and smaller loan amounts. The “flat-rate” service fee of R50 per month is exorbitant in the case of small loans of less than R1,000 and is still too high in the case of loans up to R5,000.

This result is so unfair that borrowers of very small loans (who are almost invariably from the poorest communities) will be discriminated against. The Act itself provides that the service fee must vary relative to the principal debt: that is, that it should be higher for bigger loans, and lower for smaller loans. This is not so. The Regulations should be amended to set the service fee at a percentage of the loan amount, subject to both a minimum and a maximum rand amount (as is the case for the initiation fee). Alternatively, the service fee should be scrapped on smaller credit agreements, and the maximum interest rate increased if necessary. If the service fee is not amended or scrapped, then it should be challenged in court.

==== Maximum limits and probable market costs ====
The prescribed interest rates and fees are maximum amounts only. The Department of Trade and Industry hopes that the credit industry will not “jump to the maximum rates”, and has said that it has the power to adjust these rates quickly if necessary.

The micro-lending industry in particular was born and grew on the strength of exorbitant interest rates, and many micro-lenders will struggle to stay in business with the new limits in place. It is therefore very likely that most lenders will charge the maximum rates of interest and fees to keep their profits as high as possible. Bigger lenders such as banks, on the other hand, are able to afford to be competitive, and are likely to charge lower rates.

==== The danger of masking the total cost of credit ====
The drastic reduction in interest rates has the effect of masking or obscuring the true total cost of credit when the initiation and service fees are added. It is possible that these fees could to a large extent remain hidden, with the emphasis being placed on interest rates (which are more familiar to consumers) when products are marketed. The fees help to keep interest rates lower, which makes credit look cheaper, when in fact credit may not be cheaper. The skewing of credit costs away from interest and towards fees (which are not familiar to consumers) will increase the chances of consumers’ being misled as to the actual cost of credit. Many will be lured into borrowing money which will cost much more than they had initially expected. It is essential that paralegals understand the danger of this masking of the true cost of credit, in order to be able to warn their clients of this danger.

==== The combined impact of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee ====
[[File:Table C - Illustration of the cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Regulations.png|thumb|The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) applied to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly cost of credit is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total cost of credit in each case. The annual cost may be obtained by multiplying these figures by twelve. It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total initiation fee is charged to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total cost of credit even more expensive.]]

The new credit limits have a negative impact on smaller loans. The smaller the loan, the more expensive it is. A one-month loan of R500 will cost about the same as the typical thirty per cent per month charged prior to the Act. Smaller loans will be even more expensive than that. A R200 loan will cost 46 per cent per month (552 per cent per year), which is more than nine times the maximum interest of five per cent per month.

The positive impact of capped interest rates, furthermore, is negated by the high maximum initiation and service fees.

The impact of the initiation and service fees on smaller loans amounts to a skewing of the cost of credit away from interest and towards these fees, so that interest decreases relative to these fees. This skewing has the dangerous effect of masking the true cost of credit from the consumer, and of misleading the consumer.

A more equitable result could be achieved by removing or reducing the initiation and service fees, reducing the maximum permissible interest rate, and reducing the maximum size amount of short-term credit transactions. This will require amendments to the Regulations.

=== The socio-economic consequences of the new cost of credit ===
The new structure for costing of credit will work best for the biggest credit advances, in excess of R8,000. The cost of credit on agreements of less than R1,000 is comparable with the typical thirty per cent per month charged with no interest limits on small loans, The vast majority of borrowers of micro-loans are from low-income groups. The poorest households carry the greatest debt-servicing burden. Low-income individuals and communities who borrow small amounts are therefore likely to continue to suffer the same devastating socio-economic hardships referred to above, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty.

Borrowers of one-month loans are most vulnerable, since these loans are much more expensive than other short-term loans. Low-income borrowers are usually unable to afford to pay back these loans at the end of the month; repeated loans have often to be taken out to fund in full the re-payment of previous loans. Borrowers are caught in debt spirals and subsequent debt traps, with the disastrous consequence that borrowers in effect remain permanently indebted.

[[File:Table D - Illustration of the application of the new cost of credit to one-month loans and resultant debt spiral.png|thumb|The new cost of credit, applied to two examples. In each case, the cost of credit is calculated as follows: interest at 5% per month + initiation fee at 15% of loan amount (+ 5% interest per month) + service fee (always R50). In Example A, by Month 2 the loan repayment (R840) has already exceeded the old-age pension of R820. In Example B, the loan repayment in Month 3 almost exceeds the total wage. These examples confirm that debt spirals and debt traps will continue to occur on a wide scale when the new cost of credit is applied, and could prove to be one of its greatest dangers.]]

=== Conclusion ===
The National Credit Act has made great strides towards consumer protection, and the new limits on interest rates will provide welcome relief for many borrowers. The combined effect of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee will, however, cause the cost of credit on small loans to remain exorbitant. This will have a devastating negative impact on poorer individuals and communities.

== Legal remedies provided by the Act ==
The Act provides only a relatively short list of offences that attract criminal penalties. By contrast, the Usury Act provided that any person who contravenes any provision of the Act commits an offence. Thus, for example, it was a criminal offence to charge interest higher than the Usury Act maximum, which is no longer the case.

However, the Act does provide a number of civil legal remedies for consumers, some of which are drastic departures from previous law. The most important of these remedies are outlined below.

=== Unlawful credit agreements ===
Section 89 lists a number of credit agreements that are unlawful, including

* an agreement with a consumer who is a minor unassisted by a guardian;
* an agreement with a person who has been declared mentally unfit;
* an agreement with a person under an administration order without the administrator's consent;
* an agreement resulting from negative-option marketing (explained above);
* an agreement with an unregistered credit provider who was supposed to be registered (unless application for registration is made within thirty days after the credit agreement was concluded);&lt;ref&gt;See above for how to establish whether or not a credit provider is registered.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* an agreement with a credit provider who was subject to a notice by the NCR to stop extending credit.

If a credit agreement is found to be unlawful, a court must order

* that the credit agreement is void;
* that the credit provider refund to the consumer any monies paid by the consumer, with interest; and
* that the credit provider's rights to recover monies paid or goods delivered to the consumer be cancelled or forfeited to the State (if the court is of the view that the consumer would otherwise be unjustifiably enriched).

The credit provider will not get back the money lent or property sold, and the court does not have a discretion to order this. This is a drastic remedy and a departure from the common law. It was not previously available in the case of unregistered micro-lenders, and is a significant new remedy readily available to consumers.

Thus, for example, a court will be able to declare a loan from an unregistered micro-lender to be void (if the Act requires the micro-lender to be registered), and order the micro-lender to refund all instalments paid, with interest. Furthermore, the court must order that the loan amount paid to the consumer be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State. The amount loaned is therefore lost to the unregistered micro-lender altogether.

=== Unlawful provisions of credit agreements ===
Section 90 lists numerous provisions of credit agreements (as opposed to the entire agreements&lt;ref&gt;s 89.&lt;/ref&gt;) that are unlawful and not permitted. They are too many to list here. The list is broadly-worded and far-reaching; many of the provisions will probably be open to a wide range of interpretations, which is likely to lead to uncertainty. For example, a provision is unlawful if its general purpose or effect is to defeat the purposes or policies of the Act, or to “deceive” the consumer. Further, a provision is unlawful

* if it avoids a credit provider's obligation or duty in terms of the Act;
* if it sets aside or overrides the effect of any provision of the Act;
* if it authorises the credit provider to do anything that is unlawful in terms of the Act, or to fail to do anything that is required in terms of the Act;
* if it waives or deprives a consumer of a right afforded by the Act;
* if it waives any common-law rights applicable to the credit agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to a pre-determined value of costs of enforcement of the agreement;
* if it expresses the consumer's consent to the jurisdiction of the High Court, or any court that would normally not have jurisdiction for reasons of its geographical location;
* if it provides for the consumer's depositing an identity document, credit or debit or access card, or providing a PIN;
* if it authorises a person acting on behalf of the credit provider to enter premises to repossess goods; or
* if it contains an undertaking to sign in advance any documentation relating to the enforcement of the agreement (like a consent to judgment or emoluments-attachment order).

An unlawful provision is void. Whenever a court has a matter before it which concerns a credit agreement that contains an unlawful provision, the court may

* sever (remove) the unlawful provision from the credit agreement;
* alter the provision to render it lawful; or
* even declare the whole credit agreement unlawful and make orders similar to those provided for unlawful credit agreements, set out above (another major departure from the common law).

The consumer alleging the unlawful provision is entitled to apply to court for orders in these terms.

Thus, for example, if a credit agreement for the sale of furniture provides for interest or fees in excess of the maximum amounts permissible, a court must declare the offending provisions to be void and enforce the remainder of the agreement. However, it seems that the court may be able to declare the entire agreement void, order the furniture shop to refund all amounts paid, and order that the furniture sold be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State.

=== In duplum rule ===
The Act has codified the in duplum rule for the first time in South Africa's legislative history, and extended the rule further to include all credit costs. This rule states that, while a consumer is in default, all credit costs will stop being added to the debt when their total equals the unpaid balance of the principal debt. It is likely that increased use will be made of the rule since it has been legislated. It must be remembered, however, that it will apply only when the consumer is in default.

=== Reckless credit and over-indebtedness ===
Other legal remedies for consumers already discussed above include

* a court order declaring a loan agreement to be reckless, which could result in the setting aside of all or part of the borrower's rights and obligations under the agreement, or the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement for a determined period; and
* a finding that a consumer was over-indebted at the time of the conclusion of the agreement, in which event the court may order the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement and the restructuring of the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.

== Dispute settlement and debt enforcement ==

=== Dispute settlement ===
If the Act has been contravened, a person has one of two options:

# to lodge a complaint with the NCR; or
# to make use of one of the other dispute-resolution mechanisms established by the Act.

==== Lodging a complaint with the NCR ====
The Act contains detailed provisions regarding the role of the NCR.&lt;ref&gt;ss 136-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints to the NCR must be lodged by completing and submitting to the NCR Form 29 to the Regulations. The NCR may resolve complaints lodged with it; the resolution may become a consent order by a court or the Tribunal. The NCR may also refer the dispute to a debt counsellor, an ombud with jurisdiction or a consumer court. After investigating the matter, the NCR may refer the matter to a provincial consumer court or the Tribunal for an order allowed by the Act.

==== Other dispute-resolution methods ====
Alternatively, disputes may be referred for resolution directly to the relevant ombud if the credit provider is a financial institution (like a bank), to a consumer court or to an alternative dispute resolution agent.&lt;ref&gt;ss 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; With the consent of the parties, the resolution may be recorded in writing and made an order of court or the Tribunal.

In his book ''The National Credit Act Explained'', Otto concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, the muscle of the National Credit Regulator, the far-reaching powers of the National Consumer Tribunal and the courts, the almost paternalistic protective inclination of the legislature, and the extensive network of dispute-solving account for consumer legislation that is going to have a huge impact on the enormous credit industry in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debt enforcement ===
The Act limits the credit provider's common-law rights to enforce debt: that is, to claim what is due in terms of the credit agreement. This is in line with international consumer legislation, but the Act's provisions have been criticised as being unusually cumbersome and detrimental to credit providers.&lt;ref&gt;Visagie 2006 De Rebus at page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Default notice to the consumer ====
If a consumer is in default, the credit provider must notify the consumer of his default in writing. This is effectively a letter of demand. The notice must do more, however: The credit provider must propose to the consumer that the consumer refer the credit agreement to, among others, a debt counsellor to resolve the dispute or agree on a plan to get payments up to date.

As regards the method of delivery of the written default notice, the consumer may choose to be informed in one or more of these ways:

* in person at the credit provider's business premises;
* at any other place chosen by the consumer, at the consumer's expense; or
* by ordinary mail fax or email or printable web-page.

Must the default notice actually reach the consumer to be effective? The Constitutional Court held in Sebola v Standard Bank&lt;ref&gt;2012 (5) SA 142 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act, although it gives no clear meaning to “deliver,” requires that the credit provider, in seeking to enforce a credit agreement, must aver and prove that the notice was delivered to the consumer. Where the credit provider posts the notice, proof of registered despatch to the address of the consumer, together with proof that the notice reached the appropriate post office for delivery to the consumer, will constitute sufficient proof of delivery (in the absence of contrary indication).

==== Debt procedures in court ====
A credit provider may go to court to enforce a credit agreement only if

* the consumer has been in default for at least 20 business days;
* at least ten business days have elapsed since the credit provider delivered the default notice;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* the consumer has not responded to the notice or responded by rejecting the proposals in the notice;
* the consumer has not surrendered to the credit provider the goods subject to the credit agreement him/herself (in the case of an instalment agreement, secured loan or lease agreement).&lt;ref&gt;See below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty days and ten days referred to above may run concurrently: that is, the ten-day period may occur during the 20-day period.

Where a case has been referred to the National Consumer Tribunal, debt counsellor, ombud, alternative-dispute-resolution agent or consumer court, or the credit agreement is subject to a debt review, the court will adjourn the case.

A much larger number of requests for default judgment on credit agreements now have to be referred to a magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;s 2(5) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than being dealt with by the clerk of the court. This will greatly increase the workload of the magistrates, and could cause debt enforcement procedures to take much longer, resulting in frustration for credit providers.

==== Attachment and sale of goods ====
If a credit provider properly cancels a credit agreement, the court may order the attachment of the goods, allowing for the sale of the goods to settle the account. This procedure follows the usual common law.

If the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to settle the account, the credit provider may approach the court for an order to recover the outstanding balance. This applies in the case of the instalment agreement, secured loan or lease. Strangely absent from this list is the mortgage agreement. This implies that the mortgagee (a bank, usually) will be able to rely only on the proceeds of the sale of the property to settle the account—even if this is insufficient, and even if the mortgagor (the debtor) is very wealthy and has other assets that could be attached.

==== Interim attachment orders ====
Common practice is that a credit provider asks the court for an “interim attachment order,” pending cancellation of the agreement, in order to protect goods at risk (like a motor car) from deterioration or damage. This order will allow the sheriff to attach the goods for safekeeping until such time as the court action is finalised, which can take a long time. It is not clear from the Act whether or not credit providers will still be able to obtain interim attachment orders. The past practice of obtaining such orders may well continue.

==== Re-instatement of credit agreement by consumer ====
At any time before cancellation, a consumer may reinstate a credit agreement that is in default by paying all amounts overdue, plus default charges and the costs of enforcing the debt to date. The consumer may then repossess property attached, but not if the goods have already been sold.

==== Surrender of goods ====
The consumer may choose at any time to surrender the goods that are subject to the credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. This provision is discussed in detail above.

==== Unlawful collection practices ====
A credit provider may not use an identity document, credit or debit card, access card or PIN to enforce a credit agreement or collect on the agreement. A contravention of this provision is a criminal offence.

{{cite BAILII|litigants='''Dextra Bank &amp; Trust Company Limited v Bank of Jamaica''' |court=UKPC |year=2001 |num=50 |date={{date|2001-11-26}}}} is an important case in [[unjust enrichment]] in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]].

==Facts==

Dextra drew a [[cheque]] for $2,999,000 from its bankers to lend to the [[Bank of Jamaica]]. Its agents told Dextra the money was for a loan. The Bank of Jamaica was told the money was for foreign currency purchased by its agents. They gave the money to the agents, but the agents were fraudsters. Dextra wanted restitution.

==Judgment==
The Privy Council held that the claim failed, first because Dextra had made no relevant mistake of fact, and second because the Bank of Jamaica had changed its position. On the question of the change of position defence, Dextra argued that the Bank of Jamaica were relatively at fault, and therefore their defence should fail. [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]] and [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] said in the course of their advice,

{{cquote|28. Their Lordships turn to Dextra's claim to recover its money as having been paid to the BOJ under a mistake of fact. To succeed in an action to recover money on that ground, the plaintiff has to identify a payment by him to the defendant, a specific fact as to which the plaintiff was mistaken in making the payment, and a causal relationship between that mistake of fact and the payment of the money: see ''[[Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd]]'' [1980] 1 QB 677, 694. In the opinion of their Lordships, there are difficulties with regard to the second and third of these elements in the present case.

29. Their Lordships turn then to the second element, viz. that Dextra must have paid the money to the BOJ under a mistake of fact. It is the contention of Dextra that the money was paid under a mistake, in that Dextra had intended to make a loan. The difficulty with this proposition is that this does not appear to have been a mistake as to a specific fact, like for example a mistake as to the identity of the defendant, but rather a misprediction as to the nature of the transaction which would come into existence when the Dextra cheque was delivered to the BOJ, which is a very different matter: see Birks, Introduction to the Law of Restitution, pp. 147-8. In that passage, [[Peter Birks|Professor Birks]] explains the rationale of this distinction in terms relevant to the present case, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The reason is that restitution for mistake rests on the fact that the plaintiff's judgment was vitiated in the matter of the transfer of wealth to the defendant. A mistake as to the future, a misprediction, does not show that the plaintiff's judgment was vitiated, only that as things turned out it was incorrectly exercised. A prediction is an exercise of judgment. To act on the basis of a prediction is to accept the risk of disappointment. If you then complain of having been mistaken you are merely asking to be relieved of a risk knowingly run …

    The safe course for one who does not want to bear the risk of disappointment which is inherent in predictions is to communicate with the recipient of the benefit in advance of finally committing it to him. He can then qualify his intent to give by imposing conditions, or sometimes by making a trust ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, unfortunately, Dextra failed to communicate directly with the BOJ to make sure that the BOJ understood that the money was being offered as a loan. Instead, it left the communication of this vital matter to its agent, Phillips. Dextra's misplaced reliance on Phillips led it to assume that a loan would result; and this prediction proved to be mistaken. But a misprediction does not, in their Lordships' opinion, provide the basis for a claim to recover money as having been paid under a mistake of fact.

30. Dextra did however argue that it suffered under a mistake of fact when it was deceived by Wildish into believing that the BOJ had previously agreed to take a loan from Dextra. In fact, the BOJ had not so agreed. But, although this can be regarded as a mistake of fact on the part of Dextra, it cannot be said to have caused Dextra's payment to the BOJ. This is because it was overtaken by the specific instructions given by Dextra to Phillips that the cheque was not to be handed over to the BOJ except against the delivery to him of a promissory note evidencing the loan and its terms. It was upon the compliance by Phillips with this instruction that Dextra relied to ensure that a loan was made upon the terms acceptable to it. The significance of the earlier deception by Wildish was only that it contributed to Dextra instructing Phillips to ensure that the cheque was handed over as a loan. Dextra's payment was not however caused by any such mistake of fact as that now alleged by Dextra; it was caused by a misprediction by Dextra that Phillips would carry out his instructions and that a loan would eventuate.

31. Their Lordships have however considered whether Dextra could recover its money as having been paid under a mistake of fact not at the time of delivery of the cheque to the BOJ, but at the time of payment of the cheque, on the basis that, if Dextra had known what had happened, it would have stopped payment of the cheque by its bank, the Royal Bank of Canada; but, since it did not know the true facts, it did not do so. Their Lordships have however been driven to the conclusion that there are insuperable objections to any such conclusion.

32. Beckford delivered the cheque to the BOJ which gave value for it in good faith and without notice of any want of authority on the part of Beckford or his associates. The BOJ then negotiated the cheque by endorsement and delivery to its bank, Citibank, for the purpose of collecting payment from the drawees, the Royal Bank of Canada. Citibank itself indorsed the cheque and presented it to the Royal Bank of Canada for payment. The Royal Bank of Canada paid the cheque and debited Dextra's account. The payment of the cheque was authorised by Dextra, and indeed the Royal Bank of Canada was under a duty to Dextra to honour the cheque, the payment of which discharged the liability of Dextra under the cheque. Furthermore the BOJ, having (in the opinion of their Lordships) acquired a good title to the cheque and having given value for it, would have succeeded if it had had to sue Dextra on the cheque. The same of course applies to Citibank, which was a holder in due course. In presenting the cheque for payment Citibank was asserting its own rights under the cheque and received payment on its own behalf.

33. It follows that Dextra cannot succeed against the BOJ on a claim for money had and received based upon what happened at the time of the payment of the cheque. It can only succeed, if at all, on the basis of the circumstances in which the BOJ acquired the cheque; and these disclose not a relevant mistake of fact but a misprediction. 

[...]

45. ...it has been well settled for over 150 years that the plaintiff may recover “however careless [he] may have been, in omitting to use due diligence”: see ''[[Kelly v Solari]]'' (1841) 9 M &amp; W 54 at p. 59, per Parke B. It seems very strange that, in such circumstances, the defendant should find his conduct examined to ascertain whether he had been negligent, and still more so that the plaintiff's conduct should likewise be examined for the purposes of assessing the relative fault of the parties. Their Lordships find themselves to be in agreement with Professor Peter Birks who, in his article already cited on Change of Position and Surviving Enrichment at p. 41, rejected the adoption of the criterion of relative fault in forthright language. In particular he stated (citing ''[[Thomas v Houston Corbett &amp; Co.]]'' [1969] NZLR 151) that the New Zealand courts have shown how hopelessly unstable the defence [of change of position] becomes when it is used to reflect relative fault. Certainly, in the case of Thomas, the reader has the impression of judges struggling manfully to control and to contain an alien concept.’ (at [45]}}

The decision in ''Dextra'' has been broadly accepted by academic lawyers, although it has been pointed out that the difference between a "misprediction" and a "mistake of fact" is a very narrow one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goff |first1=Robert |author-link1=Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley |last2=Jones |first2=Gareth |author-link2=Gareth Jones (lawyer) |year=2007 |title=The Law of Restitution |edition=7th |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |at=4-002 |isbn=9780421926004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In {{Cite bailii|litigants=Papmichael v National Westminster Bank plc|court=EWHC|year=2003|div=Comm|num=164}} the court held that where the claimant paid [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] into an account under the mistaken belief that the drachmas would be converted into US dollars, that was a mistake of fact which could found a restitutionary claim.

The '''Digital Economy Act 2010''' (c. 24) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  The act addresses media policy issues related to digital media, including copyright infringement, Internet domain names, Channel 4 media content, local radio and video games. Introduced to Parliament by [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]] on 20 November 2009, it received [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010. It came into force two months later, with some exceptions: several sections - 5, 6, 7, 15, 16(1)and 30 to 32 - came into force immediately,  whilst  others required a [[Statutory instrument|statutory instrument]] before they would come into force.&lt;ref name="dea_sec47"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/47?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 16: Commencement|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some provisions have never come into force since the required statutory instruments were never passed by [[Parliament]] and considered to be "shelved" by 2014,&lt;ref name="shelved"&gt;http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/july/digital-economy-act-copyright-regime-shelved-by-uk-government&lt;/ref&gt; and other sections were [[repeal]]ed.

== Provisions ==

=== Online infringement of copyright provisions  (sections 3-16) ===
Sections 3 to 16 contained [[copyright infringement]]  provisions, which were controversial.&lt;ref name="guardian_dea"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/digital-economy-bill|title=Digital Economy Bill on The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions  established a "code" to be created which would define a system of procedures covering notifications to Internet Service Providers to notify their customers when an allegation was made of downloading copyright-infringing content online, subscriber appeals, conditions under which subscribers could be identified to third parties, and conditions for disconnecting persistent infringers. The objective was to provide evidence that copyright holders could use in court action against subscribers who repeatedly infringed. A second element of the provisions comprises the ‘technical measures’, where a sanction would be applied directly via a subscriber's Internet provider.

Under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/3 DEA Section 3] the allegations were to be transmitted to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs)  by the copyright holders. The ISPs would then be obliged to transmit  notifications to their subscribers, informing them of the allegation. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/4 DEA Section 4] mandated the ISPs  to keep a list of repeat offenders (a "copyright infringement list" ) who had reached a pre-determined threshold  in  terms of the number of infringements committed, and the data should be anonymous. The aim is that copyright holders could later seek a court order to identify subscribers against whom they want to take action.

==== Code not passed into law ====
The Act provided for this in the form of an [[Enabling Act]], which required [[Ofcom]] (the communications regulator for the UK) to produce a draft Code that would then be passed by Parliament and come into force as a [[Statutory Instrument]]. However, by 2013, when the draft code was produced, the political climate had changed and a substantial controversy existed over the practicalities of the proposed Code. The draft code to create the Code was never passed into law or pursued after that date, and was "shelved" by 2014.&lt;ref name="shelved" /&gt;

==== Outline of Code provisions ====
The Code had comprised the following components:

;Initial obligations code
The act does not specify the implementation detail for the measures. Instead,  provides for the implementation to be drafted by Ofcom, in an Initial Obligations Code. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/5  Section 5] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/6 Section 6] establish the process for Ofcom to write the code. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/7 Section 7] establishes in a very broad way what the code should contain, but leaves all the detail for Ofcom. The code must be approved by Parliament under the annulment procedure before  it can come into force.

The decision to use the code of practice instead of specifying the measures in full within the text of the act has itself formed part of the controversy surrounding the measures. For example, the act did not  specify the standard of evidence required. It also did not specify the threshold - number of infringements - for entry onto the copyright infringement list.

On 28 May 2010 Ofcom published a draft initial obligations code for consultation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/copyright-infringement/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623065234/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/copyright-infringement/|date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, it issued a second consultation document &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/infringement-notice/|title=Online Infringement of Copyright and the Digital Economy Act 2010 Notice of Ofcom’s proposal to make by order a code for regulating the initial obligations| date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Obligations to limit Internet access (technical measures)
After the Initial Obligations Code has been in force for one year, the act provides for a second set of measures to be brought in. The technical measures specified in the act  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/9 Section 9] are the restriction or limitation of the speed of the broadband connection, restricting access to particular material online, and suspension (disconnection) of the service.  The most controversial of them however, was  disconnection of the subscriber for a period of time.  It would function as an alternative to taking people to court, and in effect an extrajudicial process. 
Technical measures are to be brought in under another code, known as the code about obligations to limit Internet access [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/11 Section 11] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/12 Section 12]. This Code would be subject to the super-affirmative procedure in the British Parliament.

; Appeals
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/13 Section 13] of the act requires the provision of an independent appeals process,  so that subscribers who wish to do so, may challenge a notification or (when implemented) a technical measure. Ofcom is required to set up an  appeals body. This body will be an administrative body, independent of copyright holders and ISPs. Cases will not be heard in person. If technical measures are implemented, there will be a right to appeal to a First Tier Tribunal.

; Obligations on ISPs and copyright holders
The act amends the Communications Act 2003. In this context, it places obligations on the ISP to apply both of the codes, and it gives Ofcom the responsibility of enforcing those obligations. Ofcom has the power to fine the ISPs  up to £250,000 if they fail to meet those obligations.  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/14 Section 14]

The act also provides for the cost allocation to be determined by a further statutory instrument. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/15 Section 15]. To date, two draft statutory instruments have been laid before Parliament but neither has been passed into law.

=== Blocking Internet locations (sections 17-18) ===

: ''This section of the act [[#Ofcom review of sections 17 and 18|has been repealed]].''
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/17 Section 17] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/18 18]  would have allowed copyright holders to apply to a court to obtain website blocking injunctions where  "a substantial amount of material has been, is being or is likely to be made available in infringement of copyright", or where a location  "facilitates" such behaviour.
In deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court would have been required to consider:
* Steps taken by the operator of the location to prevent infringement
* Steps taken by the copyright owner to facilitate lawful access to the material
* Any representations made by a Minister of the Crown
* Whether the injunction would be likely to have a disproportionate effect on any person’s legitimate interests
* The importance of [[freedom of expression]]

Sections 17 and 18 would have had to be brought into force by a statutory instrument. However, following a review by Ofcom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/media_releases/7756.aspx|title=Ofcom to review aspects of the Digital Economy Act|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were repealed on the basis that copyright holders already had the ability to use Section 97 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act to take court action against websites.

=== Other provisions ===
Other provisions in the act include 
* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/42 Section 42] an amendment to the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] to increase the penalty in connection with criminal liability for copyright and performing rights to a maximum of £50,000.
* Age classification of content is also in the act, which adopts the [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) standard for video game ratings, and transferring content rating from the [[British Board of Film Classification]] to the [[Video Standards Council]].&lt;ref name="dea_sec40"&gt;{{cite web

* The functions of the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]]
* The regulation of television and radio services
* The regulation of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum
* The [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]
* Public lending right in relation to electronic publications. (Authors receive a 10p royalty for physical books lent from UK libraries but not [[ebook]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This act extends that royalty to cover some ebooks and audio books lent by libraries electronically. However the appropriate legislation has not yet been amended for this to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plr.uk.com/registrationservice/faq.htm#sound|title=Are audio-books and ebooks eligible for PLR?|publisher=British Library|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Legislative process ==
The Digital Economy Act followed the [[Digital Britain]] report of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/final-report/ Digital Britain final report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413182036/http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/final-report/ |date=2010-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy document which outlined the United Kingdom Government's strategic vision for its digital economy. [[Stephen Carter, Baron Carter of Barnes|Lord Carter]],  Digital Britain minister, spent eight months considering the matter before releasing his final report in June 2009.  The Digital Economy Bill was announced in the [[Queen's Speech]] on 18 November 2009 to the United Kingdom parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91118-0001.htm#09111813000012 |title=Lords Hansard text for 18 Nov 200918 Nov 2009 (pt 0001) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill went through three readings in the House of Lords, before being presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for its first reading on 16 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430180932/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html |archivedate=2010-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wash-up ===
The general election was called on 6 April 2010, which meant that the Digital Economy Act was running out of Parliamentary time, as Parliament was dissolved on 8 April. The Digital Economy Bill went into what is called [[Wash-up period|wash-up]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/a-copyright-masquerade A Copyright Masquerade: How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms] ZedBooks, pp248-265, uses Hansard to put together an account of the wash-up&lt;/ref&gt; The wash-up is an accelerated parliamentary process used after general elections have been called to rush unopposed legislation through parliament before dissolution. This meant it was not debated at length in the Commons. In return for supporting the Digital Economy Bill in the final wash-up vote the Conservatives demanded the removal of Clause 43 which related to [[orphan works]], copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be located, which had been criticised by photographers. Other clauses that were removed during wash-up included provisions for the funding of regional news consortia.&lt;ref name="Out-Law Prinsent Masons"&gt;{{cite web| title = Digital Economy Bill Passed by House of Commons| publisher = Out-Law Prinsent Masons| date = 8 April 2010| url = http://www.out-law.com/page-10901| accessdate = 8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received its second reading in the House of Commons on 6 April 2010.

There was support for the bill from both the governing Labour party and the opposition Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/apr/06/digital-economy-bill-conservative-support Mark Sweney, Digital economy bill gets reluctant Conservative support in ''The Guardian'', 6 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  It passed [[third reading]] on 7 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/apr/07/digital-economy-bill-internet | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Digital Economy bill: liveblogging the crucial third reading | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Royal Assent]] granted on 8 April. The Act is in force, however the requirements for the sections relating to online piracy (ss.3-18) to have legal effect were never implemented.

== Initial controversies arising from the proposed Act ==

=== Controversial aspects ===
Aspects of the proposed Act which were strongly criticised included:
:* The Digital Economy Bill incorporated a [[graduated response]] policy despite the alleged file sharer not necessarily having to be convicted of copyright offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html Digital Economy Bill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430180932/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html |date=30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also introduced fines of up to £50,000 for criminal offences relating to copyright infringement – for example if music is downloaded with intent to sell. The high penalty is considered to be ''proportionate to the harm caused to UK industries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/2009/11/copyright/ |title=Digital Economy Bill Copyright Factsheet November 2009 |publisher=Interactive.bis.gov.uk |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402172820/http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/2009/11/copyright/ |archivedate=2 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeals process exists whereby the accused can contest the case however, the concern has been expressed that this process will be costly and that, in requiring the individual to prove their innocence, ''the bill reverses the core principles of natural justice''.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bobbie Johnson, technology correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/16/digital-economy-lords |title=Johnson, Bobbie (2010) "Concern as Lords Pass Digital Economy Bill to Lords" The Guardian 16th March 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=16 December 2011 |date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Critics saw serious repercussions and perceived the concepts as ill-considered and likely to prove "disastrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/820835-digital-economy-bill-passes-as-critics-warn-of-catastrophic-disaster |title=Phillips, Tom (2010) Digital Economy Bill passes as critics warn of "catastrophic disaster" Metro | date=8 April 2010 |publisher=Metro.co.uk |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[British Phonographic Institute]] claimed the bill was ''vital'' for the future of creative works in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; The Conservative party spokesman for Culture and Media stated that those downloading should be given a criminal record. Conversely, the Liberal Democrat party spokesman for Culture and Media claimed the bill was ''reckless and dangerous'' stating that children could unwittingly be file sharing causing an entire family to lose their internet connection. In addition to this, there was concern that hackers may access internet connections to download files and leave the bill payer responsible.
:* Providers of public [[Wi-Fi]] access is uncertain. Responsibility for breaches could be passed on to the provider due to the difficulty in identifying individual users. The internet provider therefore may risk losing internet access or facing a hefty fine if an infringement of copyright takes place. Many libraries and small cafés for example may find this impossible to adhere to as it would require detailed logging of all those requiring internet access. In libraries in particular this may provide challenges to the profession’s importance of user privacy and could force changes in future policies such as Acceptable Use Policies (AUP). Public libraries utilise AUPs in order to protect creative works from copyright infringement and themselves from possible legal liability. However, unless the AUP is accompanied by the provision of knowledge on how to obey laws it could be seen as unethical, as blame for any breaches is passed to the user.&lt;ref&gt;Britz, J. J. (2002). Information Ethics: its Demarcation and Application. In: Lipinski, T. A. (eds.) Libraries, Museums, and Archives: Legal and Ethical Challenges in the New Era of Information. Maryland: The Scarecrow Press. pp. 194–219.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[hospitality sector]] considered that it would be badly affected by the Act. The [[British Hospitality Association]] has stated that hotels would have particular problems in providing details of guest’s internet access to Internet Service Providers and entire hotels may face disconnection. They have also expressed their concern that an individual's actions may lead to such a drastic outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, C. (2010). Opposition to the Digital Economy Bill. The Guardian. Availability: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/05/digital-economy-bill. Last accessed 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Internet service providers were also hostile towards the bill. [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] stated that suspending access to the internet breached human rights. This view may be shared by many, as a survey carried out by the BBC found that ''87% of internet users felt internet access should be the "fundamental right of all people"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8548190.stm |title=Internet access is a fundamental right BBC News |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, people require access to the internet for many aspects of their life for example shopping, online banking, education, work and even socialising. Furthermore, TalkTalk Director of Regulation, Andrew Heaney has acknowledged that file sharing is a problem but the answer is to educate people and create legal alternatives. Heaney has also argued that disconnected offenders will simply create other user names to hide their identity and continue downloading. TalkTalk has claimed that 80% of youngsters would continue to download regardless of the bill and that internet service providers are being forced to police this without any workable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressoffice.talktalk.co.uk/news/item/music_fans_will_sidestep_filesharing_clampdown_says_talktalk/ "Music fans will sidestep filesharing clampdown says TalkTalk" TalkTalk Press Centre 15 March 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925033052/http://pressoffice.talktalk.co.uk/news/item/music_fans_will_sidestep_filesharing_clampdown_says_talktalk/ |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Cable television|Cable]] company [[Virgin Media]] also criticized the Digital Economy Bill believing it to be ''heavy handed'' and likely to ''alienate customers''.

There was also a high level of [[public activism]] and protest against the Act, in many forms. The Guardian reported that hundreds were expected to march outside the House of Commons on 24 March 2010.&lt;ref name=Guardian2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/24/digital-economy-bill-protests |last=Arthur | first=Charles | title=Hundreds expected outside parliament to protest at digital economy bill  |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=16 December 2011 |date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, an estimated 12,000 people sent emails to their MPs, through the citizen advocacy organization 38 degrees. 38 degrees objected to the speed with which the bill was rushed through parliament, without proper debate, due to the imminent dissolution of parliament prior to a general election.&lt;ref name=Guardian2010 /&gt; In October 2009 TalkTalk launched its Don't Disconnect Us campaign asking people to sign a petition against the proposal to cut off the internet connections of those accused of unauthorized file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dontdisconnect.us/ |title=Don't Disconnect Us campaign group website |publisher=Dontdisconnect.us |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2009 the petition had almost 17,000 signatories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6643510/Stephen-Fry-backs-Digital-Economy-Bill-protests.html |title=Beaumont, Claudine (2009) "Stephen Fry backs Digital Economy Bill protests" Telegraphy 14th November 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=16 December 2011 |date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by December had reached over 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/2009/12/14/our-don-t-disconnect-us-petition-passes-30-000-signatories/ |title=Heaney, Andrew (2009) "Our Don't Disconnect Us petition passes 30,000 signatories" TalkTalk Blog |publisher=Talktalkblog.co.uk |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124195331/http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/2009/12/14/our-don-t-disconnect-us-petition-passes-30-000-signatories/ |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pirate Party UK|Pirate Party]] in the UK called for non-commercial file sharing to be legalized. Formed in 2009 and intending to enter candidates in the 2010 UK general election, the Pirate Party advocates reform to copyright and patent laws and a reduction in government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Pirate Party Official website, http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to the bill===
The provisions relating to copyright infringement and especially technical measures were highly controversial and were criticised by digital rights campaigners. The [[Open Rights Group]], a privacy and digital rights organisation, took their concerns to the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ORG briefing to the house of Lords | url =http://www.openrightsgroup.org/ourwork/reports/digital-economy-bill-briefing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were raised about the impact on businesses offering Internet access to their customers, such as libraries and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,40057470,00.htm |title=Open Wi-Fi 'outlawed' by Digital Economy Bill |author=David Meyer |date=26 February 2010 |work=ZDNet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, called the bill "an utter disgrace. This is an attack on everyone's right to communicate, work and gain an education". He said that "politicians have shown themselves to be incompetent and completely out of touch with an entire generation's values".&lt;ref name="Out-Law Prinsent Masons"/&gt;

[[38 Degrees]], who worked with the Open Rights Group to mobilise opposition to the Act, state that over 22,000 people have emailed their MPs through their web site. 38 Degrees have also raised over £20,000 in donations to fund newspaper advertisements against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.38degrees.org.uk |title=38 Degrees - People, Power, change |publisher=Blog.38degrees.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 35,000 people signed a Number 10 petition,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dontdisconnect.us&lt;/ref&gt; started by Andrew Heaney at ISP [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]], objecting to being disconnected without fair trial. Over 100 people protested outside Parliament on 24 March 2010, including Labour MPs [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] and [[John Grogan (UK politician)|John Grogan]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] Bridget Fox, and writer and activist [[Cory Doctorow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/uk-digital-bill-enters-wash-up-despite-protest-6089. Almost 35,000 people have signed a petition calling for the bill's disconnection provisions to be dropped.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/819096-web-blocking-bill-set-to-become-law-without-full-debate |title=Web blocking bill set to become law without full debate &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TalkTalk, Britain's second-largest ISP, has been a vociferous critic of the act. They opposed it from its earliest stages by staging media events,&lt;ref name="bbc09_talktalk-stunt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8305379.stm|title=ISP in file-sharing wi-fi theft|date=16 October 2009|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that they would fight against the new laws in court, and commissioning research to demonstrate that music fans would simply transition to other, non-P2P tools (such as "applications which scan thousands of internet radio stations and download the desired tracks").&lt;ref name="talktalk_sidestep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalkgroup.com/press-centre/news/press-office/173/music-fans-will-sidestep-filesharing-clampdown-says-talktalk|title=Music fans will sidestep filesharing clampdown says TalkTalk |date=15 March 2010|publisher=[[TalkTalk Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; TalkTalk have also argued that the requirement in Ofcom's draft code of conduct that only ISPs with 400,000 customers or more would initially be subject to the Act "could [lead to] huge swathes of customers moving to smaller ISPs to avoid detection". BT said that they felt compelled to act "for our customers who otherwise run the risk of being treated unfairly".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The [[Pirate Party UK]] were strongly opposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2010/apr/9/digital-economy-bill-has-passed/ |title=The Digital Economy Bill has passed |author=Philip Hunt |date=9 April 2010 |work=Pirate Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], whose [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) sit with the two Swedish Pirate Party MEPs in the same group, opposed the bill. "The Digital Economy Bill is deeply flawed and illiberal...Any Green MPs will provide a rallying point for opposition to the Digital Economy Bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/19-04-2010-greens-debill-opposition.html |title=Elect Green MPs to fight the Digital Economy Bill |date=19 April 2010 |work=Green Party UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] opposed the parts that relate to the blocking of people's Internet connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/16/digital-economy-bill-nick-clegg | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Repeal the digital economy act – Nick Clegg | first=Simon | last=Jeffery | date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parts were later dropped by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government (see below).&lt;ref name="bbc_14372698"/&gt;

===Industry lobbying===
The Secretary of State [[Lord Mandelson]] was widely believed to be responsible for the copyright infringement provisions that would see the disconnection of internet subscribers.In August 2009 Lord Mandelson was accused of caving in to a "big [[lobbying]] operation" after ordering for disconnection to be included in the Digital Economy Bill even though the Digital Britain report had rejected this type of punishment.
&lt;ref name=timesAug2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6809329.ece|first=Sam|last=Coates|title=Families could lose broadband access as Mandelson takes on web pirates|publisher=DailyMail.co.uk |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=21 April 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[The Independent]]'' reported that according their [[Whitehall]] sources Lord Mandelson was persuaded that tough law were needed to reduce online copyright infringement following an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-net-closes-in-on-internet-piracy-1772820.html |title=The Net closes in on internet piracy – News, Music |publisher=The Independent |date= 16 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also reported that there had been a meeting with [[DreamWorks]] co-founder [[David Geffen]] at the [[Rothschild]] family villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Lord Mandelson's spokesperson claimed that there had been no discussion of internet piracy during the Corfu dinner and suggested that the decision to reverse Lord Carter's findings had been taken in late July before the trip.&lt;ref name=Geffen/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' reported after the Corfu meeting that an unnamed Whitehall source had confirmed that before this trip, Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the [[Digital Britain]] agenda, which has been ongoing for several years. According to ''The Times'', Mandelson returned from holiday and effectively issued an edict that the regulation needs to be tougher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article6797844.ece|title=Mandelson targets web pirates after dinner with mogul|publisher=The Times Online|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=6 January 2009 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Mandelson denied that the two events were linked.&lt;ref name=Geffen&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Martin |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1206901/Mandelson-launches-crackdown-file-sharing--just-days-meeting-record-producer.html |title=Mandelson launches crackdown on file sharing... just days after meeting with record producer &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=DailyMail.co.uk |date= 17 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 a [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information]] (FOI) request showed that Lord Mandelson had decided to approve the inclusion of technical measures, such as the disconnection of internet access, some time before public consultation had finished. Letters from Lord Mandelson's office document talks with [[Lucian Grainge]], CEO of [[Universal Music Group]] on 2 July 2009, and that on the following day Lord Mandelson advised [[Stephen Carter, Baron Carter of Barnes|Lord Carter]] about the "possibility of [the Secretary of State] having a power to direct Ofcom to go directly to introduce technical measures". The government made an  announcement that disconnection, was being considered for inclusion in the Digital Economy Bill on 25 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Wilson | first = Dean| title = Documents show the Digital Economy Act was a done deal all along| publisher = The Inquirer| date = 1 August 2011| url = http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2098344/documents-digital-economy-act-deal| accessdate = 14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/a-copyright-masquerade A Copyright Masquerade: How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms] ZedBooks, pp196-210, on Lord Mandelson's reversal on internet disconnection and analysis of the FOI responses&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the bill===
The [[Design and Artists Copyright Society]] and the [[British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies]] support the [[orphan works]] provision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003816/http://www.dacs.org.uk/index.php?m=21&amp;s=21&amp;c=156 DACS]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Community Media Association]] supports the Act for the radio clauses stated to bring significant benefits to the community broadcasting sector as FM spectrum becomes available following digital radio switchover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commedia.org.uk/2010/01/20/digital-economy-bill-community-radio/ Digital Economy Bill Benefits Community Radio]&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes of [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs) towards the copyright infringement provisions in the bill were mixed. In interviews with ISPs by TechRadar, [[Virgin Media]] said that they shared the commitment to address copyright infringement, but that persuasion not coercion is the key; a heavy-handed, punitive regime would simply alienate Internet users. [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]], which is both an ISP and a content provider, was supportive of the government's commitment to underpin the fight against illegal file sharing through legislation, but not directly of the "website banning" proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/sky-virgin-and-talktalk-respond-to-digital-economy-bill-change-675082 TechRadar interviews with Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Sky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cable.co.uk/news/sky-everyone-must-tackle-filesharing-19386739/ Sky: Everyone must tackle filesharing] cable.co.uk, 30 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ofcom review of sections 17 and 18 ===
Following calls by citizens to repeal all or part of the Digital Economy Act on the ''Your Freedom'' website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Repeal Digital Economy Act|url=http://yourfreedom.hmg.gov.uk/repealing-unnecessary-laws/repeal-digital-economy-act|work=Your Freedom|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=16 November 2011|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100824180635/http://yourfreedom.hmg.gov.uk/repealing-unnecessary-laws/repeal-digital-economy-act|archivedate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government asked [[Ofcom]] in February 2011 to review whether [[#Section 17 and 18 - Blocking Internet locations|sections 17 and 18]] of the act on website blocking are technically workable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ofcom to review aspects of Digital Economy Act| publisher = Department for culture, media and sports| date = 1 February 2011| url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/media_releases/7756.aspx| accessdate = 8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the review by Ofcom, the government announced on 3 August 2011, that sections 17 and 18 of the act were to be dropped as they were not practically enforceable, and also as the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] had been successfully used to block access to a website on the grounds of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="bbc_14372698"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government drops website blocking|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14372698|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp &amp; Others v British Telecommunications|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2011/twentieth-century-fox-film-corp-others-bt-judgment|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales|accessdate=16 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211121853/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2011/twentieth-century-fox-film-corp-others-bt-judgment#|archive-date=11 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost of implementation ===
In response to a [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information]] (FOI) request [[Ofcom]] disclosed that it had spent £1.8 million in the 2011/12 financial year on the implementation of the online copyright infringement provisions, section 3 to 16 of the Digital Economy Act, and the site blocking provisions, section 17 and 18. Ofcom planned to spend another £4.0 million in 2012/13. These figures include £100,000 spent on reviewing the technical workability of section 17 and 18, a review commissioned by the Government in February 2011. According to Ofcom the Digital Economy Act provides that internet service providers and copyright owners bear the cost of section 3 to 16, including the cost to Ofcom and an appeals body. They are also liable to pay Ofcom's cost incurred prior to actual implementation. However, Ofcom notes that the April 2011 ruling by the High Court on the judicial review of the online copyright infringement provisions provides that  internet service providers are not liable to pay towards Ofcom' cost or that of an appeals body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Halliday| first = Josh| title = Digital Economy Act will cost nearly £6 million| publisher = Guardian.co.uk| date = 17 June 2010| url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/17/digital-economy-act-cost| accessdate = 19 June 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-legislative legal inquiries into the Act==

=== Judicial review ===
On 8 July 2010 TalkTalk were joined by [[BT Group|BT]], Britain's biggest ISP, in seeking a [[judicial review]] of the Act on the grounds of it receiving "insufficient scrutiny" and having the potential to "harm citizens and impact both businesses".&lt;ref name="bbc10_judicialreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/news/Articles/ShowArticle.cfm?ArticleID=98284B3F-B538-4A54-A44F-6B496AF1F11F|title=BT and TalkTalk in legal challenge to Digital Economy Act|date=8 July 2010|publisher=[[BT Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They questioned whether the provisions were proportionate, respected privacy law, complied with EU law on ISP liability, and suggested that they would hinder a single European market in telecommunications services.&lt;ref name="jr-docs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of facts and grounds|url=http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/download/sfg-final.pdf|date=8 July 2010|publisher=[[TalkTalk Group]]|access-date=5 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104053841/http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/download/sfg-final.pdf#|archive-date=4 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Select committee inquiry ===
On 10 November 2010, the same day as the judicial review, the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Parliament]] announced an inquiry into the act. The inquiry will consider "the implementation, practicality and likely effectiveness of the relevant measures contained in the act", and "the scope for additional and new approaches to ensure that original work is appropriately rewarded in online".&lt;ref name="select-committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee launches a new inquiry into the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights Online |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/committee-announces-new-inquiry/|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=5 January 2011|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Economy Act 2017 ==
This legislation was updated by the [[Digital Economy Act 2017]], which updates the anti-infringement provisions of existing laws, creates or updates criminal copyright breach provisions, and provides for a wider range of sentencing for criminal infringement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5132">A '''document dump''' is the act of responding to an adversary's request for [[information]] by presenting the adversary with a large quantity of data that is transferred in a manner that indicates unfriendliness, [[hostility]], or a legal conflict between the transmitter and the receiver of the information.  The shipment of ''dumped'' documents is unsorted, or contains a large quantity of information that is extraneous to the issue under inquiry, or is presented in an untimely manner, or some combination of these three characteristics.  The phrase is often used by [[lawyer]]s, but is in increasing use in the [[blogosphere]].  It is often seen as part of the characteristic behavior of an entity that is engaging in an ongoing pattern of activities intended to [[cover up]] unethical or [[criminal]] conduct.

==Examples==

As one facet of the [[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]] in 2007, relevant committees of both houses of the [[United States Congress]], controlled by the [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic Party]], requested, and then subpoenaed, [[backstory]] information from the [[United States Department of Justice]] on how the process that resulted in these dismissals had taken place.  The Justice Department was reluctant to respond in a friendly manner to these requests, which they regarded as hostile; the Department responded with significant quantities of unsorted and extraneous information.  Many U.S. [[Liberalism|liberals]] saw this response as a series of document dumps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/50895 |title=New Technique Lets Bloggers Tackle Late-Night News Dumps |publisher=''[[The New York Sun]]'' |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |date= 2007-03-21 |accessdate= 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communicated amongst themselves accordingly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A big new bundle of documents just got dumped by the Department of Justice. Here's a link to the documents in PDF form at the House Judiciary Committee website. As per our routine in recent document dumps, if you'd like to help us cull through the mails and reports, use this thread to share your findings with us and other TPMm Readers. Identify the items you find by document dump set number and page number.  ([[Josh Marshall]], April 27, 2007).&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh|last=Marshall|title=DOJ Document Dump Muckracking Thread|website=democraticunderground.com|accessdate=March 24, 2013|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=389x774642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The practice has seen use by both sides of the political spectrum. Conservatives accused members of the [[Clinton Administration]] of document dumps during the investigation of the [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy]]. One such dump included, among other things, 1,000 sheets of blank paper, 35 copies of the [[résumé]] of [[Charlie Trie]], and a copy of the [[menu]] from his [[restaurant]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/scandals_arc.html |title=Clinton Scandal Summary Archive |accessdate=2007-06-16 |work= WhatReallyHappened.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Document dumps are not restricted to the field of politics. Large organizations of all types have become adept at overwhelming news organizations and other entities requesting information under state and federal [[Freedom of information in the United States|freedom of information and open records laws]]. In a 2011 example, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] responded to an appeals court order to release certain records related to 11 specific athletes with a document dump of thousands of pages of phone records and parking tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/unc/story/9735819|title=UNC football players racked up $13K in parking tickets|author=WRALSportsFan|work=WRALSportsFan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's order was related to a media request under North Carolina open records law related to an ongoing [[NCAA]] investigation of the [[2010 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|UNC football program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2011/06/unc_denied_temporary_stay_on_release_of_football_records|title=UNC denied petition to delay release of football records|website=dailytarheel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An underlying principle of [[information theory]] is that information must be comprehensible in order to be useful.  One universal characteristic of a document dump is that its shippers intend to slow down the process through which their adversaries can make this information comprehensible. In an effort to minimize negative coverage by the [[news media]], document dumps will often take place at times when [[reporter]]s are not on duty, such as late on a Friday when media members have left for the weekend.

The term "document dump" is rarely used in public by the shipper or its workers.  Public use of the phrase tends to be confined to the recipients of the information.

The '''Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee''' (EJCDC) is a coalition of [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s in the project delivery process who have developed a set of [[engineering]] and [[construction]] contract documents with a specific focus on horizontal [[infrastructure]] in the [[United States]]. The EJCDC effort reflects a contract perspective that is more closely aligned with the engineer for engineer-lead construction. The EJCDC document set is alternative to a perceived bias in [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] documents for water and [[waste water]] horizontal infrastructure projects.

EJCDC is a joint venture of three major organizations of professional engineers and contractors:
*The [[American Council of Engineering Companies]] (ACEC)
*The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE)
*The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE)

EJCDC has existed since 1975 to develop and update fair and objective standard documents that represent the latest and best thinking in [[contract]]ual relations between all parties involved in engineering design and construction projects. EJCDC includes a major portion of the professional groups engaged in the practice of providing engineering and construction services for engineer-lead constructed projects, and includes the participation of more than 15 other professional engineering design, construction, owner, legal, and [[risk management]] organizations.

'''''Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.''''', 567 U.S. 239 (2012), was a [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case about whether the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s scheme for regulating speech is unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court excused the broadcasters from paying the fines, with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] writing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/business/media/justices-reject-indecency-fines-on-narrow-grounds.html|title=Supreme Court Rejects F.C.C. Fines for Indecency|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=June 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is a continuation of the [[Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations (2009)|2009 case involving the same parties]], which had addressed the nature of the fine itself, but did not actually address the ban.

==Initial case==
{{main|Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations (2009)}}
The case entered the Supreme Court's docket in October 2007 and specifically concerns obscene language broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network from two ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Awards shows from 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-10-24-dirtywords_n.htm|title=Fight over TV indecency is on high court's doorstep|last=Biskupic|first=Joan|date=2007-10-25|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 show, while accepting her Lifetime Achievement Award, [[Cher]] said "[[fuck]] 'em" regarding people who she believed criticized her; in the 2003 show, presenter [[Nicole Richie]] stated regarding her television show: “Why do they even call it ''[[The Simple Life]]''? Have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a Prada purse? It’s not so fucking simple.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200811/swear-words|title=Freedom's Curse|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=November 2008|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherworld.com/cher-news/cher-nailed-for-f-word-indecency/|title=Cher nailed for F-word indecency - Cherworld.com - Cher Photos, Music, Tour &amp; Tickets|author=|date=8 November 2006|website=cherworld.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, after two instances of [[fleeting expletives]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Awards show in 2002 and 2003, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) changed its rules on expletives to prohibit "single uses of vulgar words" under any circumstances, including previous instances where it gave leeway for "fleeting" expletives that networks unknowingly allowed to enter the airwaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1847143,00.html|title=The Supreme Court's 2008 Docket|last=Romero|first=Francis|date=2008-10-06|work=Time|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox was subsequently fined through its [[Owned-and-operated station|owned and operated]] [[Fox Television Stations|television stations group]], and challenged its fine in the courts. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] ruled in the initial case ([http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTE3NjAtYWdfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-1760-ag_opn.pdf 06-1760]) that the FCC cannot punish broadcast stations for such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/business/media/05decency.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Court Rebuffs F.C.C. on Fines for Indecency |last=Labaton|first=Stephen|date=2007-06-05|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC appealed to the Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402969.html|title=Fox Refuses To Pay FCC Indecency Fine|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|date=2008-03-25|work=The Washington Post|page=D1|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2009 case, the Supreme Court [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-582.pdf reversed the Second Circuit], finding that the new policy was not arbitrary. However, the issue of constitutionality was remanded back to the Second Circuit, which had not considered the issue initially.

==Background of this case==
Upon remand to hear the initially deferred issue of Constitutionality, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re-heard the case in January 2010. On July 13, 2010, in a unanimous decision written by Judge [[Rosemary S. Pooler]], the Second Circuit vacated the FCC order and policy on First Amendment grounds, finding that "by prohibiting all 'patently offensive' references to sex, sexual organs, and excretion without giving adequate guidance as to what 'patently offensive' means, the FCC effectively chills speech, because broadcasters have no way of knowing what the FCC will find offensive. To place any discussion of these vast topics at the broadcaster’s peril has the effect of promoting wide self-censorship of valuable
material which should be completely protected under the First Amendment." The Second Circuit added {{Quote|We do not suggest that the FCC could not create a constitutional policy. We hold only that the FCC’s current policy fails constitutional scrutiny."&lt;ref name=2ndcir2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/e324584c-b565-4896-b8b3-610715bc0e54/1/doc/06-1760-ag_opn2.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/e324584c-b565-4896-b8b3-610715bc0e54/1/hilite/|title=Second Circuit opinion against FCC on constitutional grounds|author=|date=|website=uscourts.gov|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The FCC requested that the full Second Circuit hear the case [[en banc]], but was denied. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this round on January 10, 2012.

==Ruling==
In an 8-0 decision (Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] recused herself because she had previously sat on the Second Circuit) written by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], the Supreme Court ruled that because the regulations at the time did not cover "fleeting expletives" (the regulations have since been amended to that end), the fines issued were invalidated as "unconstitutionally vague" under the [[Due Process Clause]]. Because the case was resolved on that basis, the Court declined to address the First Amendment implications of the FCC's indecency regulations or to reconsider ''[[Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation|FCC v. Pacifica]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;''FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.'', slip op. at 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ginsburg concurrence===
Ginsburg authored a one-paragraph concurrence in which she agreed with the decision, but argued that the Supreme Court should have revisited ''Pacifica'', as she felt it was “wrong when it was issued.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/10-1293/concur4.html|title=Fed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2969">The '''gift register''' ({{lang-de|Schenkungsbuch}}) of an [[abbey]] or [[monastery]] was a record of the properties forming its [[estate (land)|estate]], the majority of which came from [[Gift (law)|gifts]] (''Schenkungen''). The register served as proof of the legitimacy of these properties and thus provided some security and protection for them. As a rule, the register comprised transcripts of the original documents, not the deed itself, as in the case of the sometimes protocular [[tradition book]]s. In order to facilitate the management of the estate, documents spanning several centuries were often organised geographically. The entries were kept up-to-date over a longer period of time.

== Reichenbach Gift Register ==
The Reichenbach Gift Register (''Reichenbacher Schenkungsbuch'') belonging to [[Reichenbach Abbey (Baden-Württemberg)|Reichenbach Abbey]] in the [[Northern Black Forest]] was preserved in three volumes: first the St. Paul Manuscript (1099-1105), then the [[Stuttgart]] Manuscript (1143-1152) and finally the [[Wiblingen]] Manuscript (16th century). The latter, however, has been missing since 1963. The original text, which was not preserved, was probably written by the time of Abbot William (died 1091).

== Gift register of Lorsch Abbey ==
Like those at [[Fulda Abbey|Fulda]], documents about the estates of the [[Lorsch Abbey|imperial abbey of Lorsch]] have survived dating as far back as the 8th century. The [[Lorsch Codex]] compiled in the 12th century contains the names of more than 1000 places, which are mentioned for the first time.

Among the place first recorded in the Codex are [[Sersheim]], [[Lohra]], Neckargröningen, now part of [[Remseck am Neckar]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Nauheim]].
&lt;!-- Perhaps someone could expand this list using the links to the Lorsch Codex. The original editor only selected a few examples. Whether a "List of places first mentioned in the Lorsch Codex" is useful is worth considering --&gt;

== Gift register of Hirsau Abbey ==

The ''[[Codex Hirsaugiensis]]'' was created as an edited version of the ''Traditiones Hirsaugenses'' tradition, in order to enable a systematic access to the monastery's documents. Personalities mentioned in the [[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]] gift register include [[Conrad I of Württemberg]].

He later served as Tennessee state [[Tennessee Commissioner of Environment and Conservation|Commissioner of Conservation]] under Governor [[Winfield Dunn]], and was the Legislative Liaison ([[lobbyist]]) for Governor [[Lamar Alexander]] from 1978-1986.

== Political career ==
Hinton was elected to the House from the 31st [[floterial district|Floterial District]] in 1966 at the age of 37,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/archives/85GA/Members/31.html Tennessee House Representative: 85th General Assembly - Members: Granville Hinton]&lt;/ref&gt; and served three terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/archives/87GA/Members/31.htm Tennessee House Representative: 87th General Assembly - Members: Granville Hinton]&lt;/ref&gt; During his last term in office, he served as assistant minority [[whip|floor leader]]. He was succeeded by fellow Republican (and insurance agent) [[Ray Bodiford]].

Subsequently, he was appointed Commissioner of Conservation by Governor Winfield Dunn, serving from 1973-75.

In December 1978, Governor-elect Lamar Alexander appointed Hinton his Legislative Liaison (chief lobbyist).&lt;ref&gt;"Governor-Elect Names Hinton to Position". [[Daily News (Kingsport)|''Kingsport Daily News'']] December 13, 1978; p. 2, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Admiralty law}}

The '''Hague–Visby Rules''' is a set of international rules for the international [[Ship transport|carriage of goods by sea]]. They are a slightly updated version of the original [[Hague Rules]] which were drafted in Brussels in 1924.

The premise of the Hague–Visby Rules (and of the earlier English [[common law]] from which the Rules are drawn) was that a carrier typically has far greater [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] than the shipper, and that to protect the interests of the shipper/cargo-owner, the law should impose some minimum [[affreightment]] obligations upon the carrier.  However, the Hague and Hague–Visby Rules were hardly a charter of new protections for cargo-owners; the [[English Law#Common law|English common law]] prior to 1924 provided more protection for cargo-owners, and imposed more liabilities upon "common carriers".&lt;ref&gt;Liver Alkali Company v. Johnson (1874), L.R., 9 Ex. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The official title of the Hague Rules the "International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading". After being amended by the Brussels Amendments (officially the "Protocol to Amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading") in 1968, the Rules became known colloquially as the Hague–Visby Rules.

A final amendment was made in the [[Special drawing rights|SDR]] Protocol in 1979. Many countries declined to adopt the Hague-Visby Rules and stayed with the 1924 Hague Rules.&lt;ref&gt;The Jackson Parton Miscellany, 2nd ed. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other countries which upgraded to Hague-Visby subsequently failed to adopt the 1979 SDR protocol.

==Implementing legislation==
The Hague–Visby Rules were incorporated into English law by the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]]; and English lawyers should note the provisions of the statute as well as the text of the rules. For instance, although Article I(c) of the Rules exempts live animals and deck cargo, section 1(7) restores those items into the category of "goods". Also, although Article III(4) declares a [[bill of lading]] to be a mere "prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods", the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] section 4 upgrades a bill of lading to be "conclusive evidence of receipt".

Under Article X, the Rules apply if ("a) the bill of lading is issued in a contracting State, or (b) the carriage is from a port in a contracting State, or (c) the contract (of carriage) provides that(the) Rules ... are to govern the contract". If the Rules apply, the entire text of Rules is incorporated into the contract of carriage, and any attempt to exclude the Rules is void under Article III (8).

==Carriers' duties==
Under the Rules, the carrier's main duties are to "properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried" and to "exercise [[due diligence]] to ... make the ship seaworthy" and to "... properly man, equip and supply the ship". It is implicit (from the common law) that the carrier must not deviate from the agreed route nor from the usual route; but Article IV(4) provides that "any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of these Rules".

The carrier's duties are not "strict", but require only a reasonable standard of professionalism and care; and Article IV allows the carrier a wide range of situations exempting them from liability on a cargo claim. These exemptions include destruction or damage to the cargo caused by: [[fire]], perils of the sea, [[Act of God]], and act of war.  A controversial provision exempts the carrier from liability for "neglect or default of the master ... in the navigation or in the management of the ship".  This provision is considered unfair to the shipper; and both the later [[Hamburg Rules]] (which require contracting states to denounce the Hague–Visby Rules) and [[Rotterdam Rules]] (which are not yet in force) refuse exemption for negligent navigation and management.

Also, whereas the Hague–Visby Rules require a ship to be seaworthy only "before and at the beginning" of the voyage, under the Rotterdam Rules the carrier will have to keep the ship seaworthy throughout the voyage (although this new duty will be to a reasonable standard that is subject to the circumstances of being at sea).

==Shipper's duties==
By contrast, the shipper has fewer obligations (mostly implicit), namely: (i) to pay freight; (ii) to pack the goods sufficiently for the journey;  (iii) to describe the goods honestly and accurately; (iv) not to ship dangerous cargoes (unless agreed by both parties);   and (v) to have the goods ready for shipment as agreed; (q.v."notice of readiness to load"&lt;ref&gt;The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164&lt;/ref&gt;).  None of these shippers' obligations are enforceable under the Rules; instead they would give rise to a normal action in contract.

==Criticism==
With only 10 Articles, the Rules have the virtue of brevity, but they have several faults. When, after 44 years of experience, the 1924 Rules were updated with a single minor amendment, they still covered only carriage ''wholly'' by sea (thereby ignoring [[multi-modal transport]]), and they barely acknowledged the [[Intermodal container|container]] [[containerization|revolution]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules: Article IV Rule 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/sea.carriage.hague.visby.rules.1968/doc.html#31&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[UNCTAD]] felt that they had actually diluted the protection to shippers once provided by English common law, and proposed instead the more modern [[Hamburg Rules]] of 1978, which were embraced by many developing countries, but largely ignored by ship-operating nations. The modern [[Rotterdam Rules]], with some 96 articles, have far more scope and cover multi-modal transport but remain far from general implementation.

The '''Heritage Places Protection Act''' is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[statute]] which allows for the recognition and protection of [[cultural heritage]] and [[natural heritage]] properties in the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Places of Prince Edward Island|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/tourism/index.php3?number=1037412&amp;lang=E|work=Heritage Places Recognition Program|publisher=Department of Tourism and Culture|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Act requires the province's Minister of Tourism and Culture to establish a register of "heritage places", sites containing or comprising immovable "historic resources" (defined as any work of nature or of man that is primarily of value for its palaeontological, archaeological, prehistoric, historic, cultural, natural, scientific or aesthetic interest).  A place may consist of a single property and/or building, a heritage trail or corridor, or a [[Heritage conservation district|heritage district]] comprising more than one heritage place.  There are two levels of historic recognition for heritage places included on the register:

#''Registered Heritage Place'': Any site or structure that has been researched and has been deemed to be a provincial heritage resource. This level of recognition identifies the place as being of historic value, yet does not place any restrictions on the property owner.
#''Designated Heritage Place'': Any site or structure designated by the Minister.  Designation is the highest level of recognition under the Act.  No owner can demolish or alter a building or structure within a Designated Heritage Place, nor can they build or undertake works that may adversely affect any designated land, without a permit from the Minister.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Edward Island Provincial Heritage Places Recognition Program: A guide for heritage property owners|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/sites/tourismw/file/PEI%20PHPRP%20Guide%20web%202011.pdf|publisher=Tourism and Culture|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Places Protection Act|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/h-03_1.pdf|publisher=Legislative Counsel Office|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Prince Edward Island has a heritage plaque program to provide public recognition for Designated Heritage Places which are designated under the terms of the Act.  The navy blue and gold enamel plaques are provided at no cost to the owners of designated buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Edward Island Heritage Plaque Program|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/forms/pdf/1593.pdf|publisher=Tourism and Culture|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Minister may delegate any of his or her powers under the Act to a [[municipality]], with the consent of the municipal council in question, as long as the municipality has a heritage plan in place setting out its objectives, policies and programs for the conservation of its heritage.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt; The Province's two most populous municipalities, [[Charlottetown]] and [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]], accordingly have civic recognition programs for historic sites within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt;

A '''hosted service provider''' ('''xSP''') is a business that delivers a combination of traditional IT functions such as infrastructure, applications ([[software as a service]]), security, monitoring, storage, web development, website hosting and email, over the Internet or other [[wide area network]]s (WAN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 3-step plan to make your website harder to hack|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2945835/the-3-step-plan-to-make-your-website-harder-to-hack.html|publisher=[[Pcworld.com]]|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An xSP combines the abilities of an [[application service provider]] (ASP) and an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP).

This approach enables customers to consolidate and outsource much of their IT needs for a predictable recurring fee. xSPs that integrate web publishing give customers a central repository  to rapidly and efficiently distribute information and resources among employees, customers, partners and the general public.

Hosted Service Providers benefit from economies of scale and operate on a [[one-to-many (data model)|one-to-many]] business model, delivering the same software and services to many customers at once. Customers are charged on a subscription basis.

==Services offered==
As defined by analyst Ovum.

* Repeatable business process-led services shared among several clients
* Remotely delivered application services using shared resources
* Infrastructure services (both remotely managed and/or hosted services spanning data centre services, managed servers and databases, performance monitoring, security services, storage services and business continuity)
* Web hosting- the provision of infrastructure and application services to support the hosting of Web sites.

[[Image:Flugschein.JPG|right|thumb|An [[airline ticket]] showing the price in the ISO 4217 code "[[Euro|EUR]]" (''bottom left'') and not the [[currency sign]] [[Euro sign|€]]]]

'''ISO 4217''' is a standard first published by [[International Organization for Standardization]] in 1978, which delineates [[currency]] designators, [[country code]]s (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:
* Table A.1 – ''Current currency &amp;amp; funds code list''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html|title=Current currency &amp; funds code list – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Table A.2 – ''Current funds codes''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a2.html|title=Current funds codes list – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Table A.3 – ''List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp;amp; funds''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a3.html|title=List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp; funds – ISO Currency|website=SIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by [[SIX Interbank Clearing]] on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/amendments/secretariat.html|title=Currency Code Services – ISO 4217 Maintenance Agency|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISO 4217 code list is used in [[banking]] and [[business]] globally. In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that [[exchange rate]]s published in newspapers or posted in [[bank]]s use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous [[currency symbol]]s. ISO 4217 codes are used on [[airline ticket]]s and international [[train]] tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.

== Code formation ==
[[Image:South East Asia Exchange Rates (6031878489).jpg|right|thumb|A list of exchange rates for various base currencies given by a [[money changer]] in Thailand, with the Thailand Baht as the counter (or quote) currency. Note the Korean currency code should be KRW]]
The first two letters of the code are the two letters of the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] [[country code]]s (which are also used as the basis for [[Country code top-level domain|national top-level domains]] on the [[Internet]]) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. So [[Japan]]'s currency code is '''JPY'''—JP for Japan and Y for [[Japanese yen|yen]]. This eliminates the problem caused by the names ''[[dollar]], [[franc]], [[peso]]'' and ''[[Pound (currency)|pound]]'' being used in dozens of countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for "new" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term "new" itself (for example, the code for the [[Mexican peso]] is '''MXN'''). Other changes can be seen, however; the [[Russian ruble]], for example, changed from '''RUR''' to '''RUB''', where the B comes from the third letter in the word "ruble".

{{Numismatics}}

=== X currencies ===
In addition to codes for most active national currencies ISO 4217 provides codes for "supranational" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are "similar to" currencies:
* Codes for the [[precious metal]]s [[gold]] (XAU), [[silver]] (XAG), [[palladium]] (XPD), and [[platinum]] (XPT) are formed by prefixing the element's chemical symbol with the letter "X".  These "currency units" are denominated as one [[troy ounce]] of the specified metal as opposed to "USD 1" or "EUR 1". XBT is used by some exchanges for the cryptocurrency [[Bitcoin]] even though it is not ISO 4217 approved.
* The code XTS is reserved for use in testing.
* The code XXX is used to denote a "transaction" involving no currency.
* There are also codes specifying certain monetary instruments used in international finance, e.g. XDR is the symbol for [[special drawing right]] issued by the [[International Monetary Fund]].
* The codes for most [[supranational]] currencies, such as the [[East Caribbean dollar]], the [[CFP franc]], the [[CFAF|CFA franc]] BEAC and the CFA franc BCEAO.  The predecessor to the euro, the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU), had the code XEU.

The use of an initial letter "X" for these purposes is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned.  Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future country code.  ISO 3166 country codes beginning with "X" are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes.  For instance, the ISO 3166-based [[NATO]] [[List of NATO country codes|country codes]] ([[STANAG 1059]], 9th edition) use "X" codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for "Brownland" to XXR for "Redland", as well as for major commands such as XXE for [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] or XXS for [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic|SACLANT]]. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use "X" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.

The inclusion of EU (denoting the [[European Union]]) in the [[ISO 3166-1]] reserved codes list, allows the [[euro]] to be coded as EUR rather than assigned a code beginning with X, even though it is a supranational currency.

=== Treatment of minor currency units (the "exponent") ===
The ISO 4217 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency "exponent" and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the [[United States dollar]]) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the "[[Cent (currency)|cent]]". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY ([[Japanese yen]]) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. [[Mauritania]] does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 [[Mauritanian ouguiya|ouguiya]] (UM) equal to 5 [[khoums]], and [[Madagascar]] has 1 [[ariary]] = 5 [[iraimbilanja]]. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to negligible value.

=== Currency numbers ===
There is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of [[ISO 3166]]. This numeric code is usually the same as the [[ISO 3166-1 numeric]] code. For example, USD ([[United States dollar]]) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).

== Position of ISO 4217 code in amounts {{anchor|codeposition}} {{anchor|PositionOfIso4217CodeInAmounts}} ==
The ISO standard does not regulate either the spacing, prefixing or suffixing in usage of currency codes. According however to the [[European Union]]'s Publication Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm#position |title=Publications Office — Interinstitutional style guide — 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units|first=Publications Office -|last=OP/B.3/CRI|website=publications.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[English language in England|English]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] texts, the ISO&amp;nbsp;4217 code is to be followed by a [[Non-breaking space|hard space]]&lt;ref&gt;The original document uses “hard space” NOT “fixed space” that is confusable. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space#cite_note-1&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount:

:''a sum of EUR&amp;nbsp;30''

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the order is reversed; the amount is followed by a [[Non-breaking space|hard space]] and the ISO&amp;nbsp;4217 code:

:''une somme de 30&amp;nbsp;EUR''

Note that, as illustrated, the order is determined not by the currency, but by the native language of the document context.

== History ==
In 1973, the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade, commerce or banking. At the 17th session (February 1978), the related [[United Nations|UN]]/[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]] Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, "Codes for the representation of currencies and funds", would be suitable for use in international trade.

Over time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, these changes are due to the formation of new governments, treaties between countries standardizing on a shared currency, or revaluation of an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), [http://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html SIX Interbank Clearing], is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.

The following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.
In the standard the values are called "alphabetic code", "numeric code", and  "minor unit".

===USD/USS/USN, three currency codes belonging to the US===
The [[US dollar]] has two codes assigned: USD and USN (next day). The USS (same day) code is not in use any longer, and was removed from the list of active ISO 4217 codes in March 2014.

According to UN/CEFACT recommendation 9, paragraphs 8–9 ECE/TRADE/203, 1996, [http://www.unece.org/cefact/recommendations/rec09/rec09_ecetrd203.pdf available online]:
: 8. In applications where monetary resources associated with a currency (i.e. funds) need not be specified and where a field identifier indicating currency is used, the first two (leftmost) characters are sufficient to identify a currency—example: US for United States dollars for general, unspecified purposes where a field identifier indicating currency is present. (A field identifier can be a preprinted field heading in an aligned document or a similarly-agreed application in electronic transmission of data.)
: 9. In applications where there is a need to distinguish between types of currencies, or where funds are required as in the banking environment, or where there is no field identifier, the third (rightmost) character of the alphabetic code is an indicator, preferably mnemonic, derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund—example: USD for general, unspecified purposes; USN for United States dollar next-day funds, and USS for funds which are immediately available for Federal Reserve transfer, withdrawal in cash or transfer in like funds (same-day funds). Since there is no need for such a distinction in international trade applications, the funds codes have not been included in the Annex to the present Recommendation.

== Future codes ==
As of August 2018, there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard.
&lt;!--
The following is a list of future codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.
In the standard the values are called "alphabetic code", "numeric code", and  "minor unit".

==Non ISO 4217 currencies==

===Currencies without ISO 4217 currency codes===
A number of currencies are not included in ISO 4217, because these currencies are: (a) minor currencies pegged 1:1 to a larger currency, even if independently regulated (b) a legal tender only issued as commemorative banknotes or coinage, or (c) a currency of an [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized or partially recognized state]]. These currencies include:
* [[Alderney pound]] (1:1 [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the pound sterling)
* [[Cook Islands dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the New Zealand dollar)
* [[Faroese króna]] (1:1 pegged to the Danish krone)
* [[Guernsey pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Isle of Man pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Jersey pound]] (1:1 pegged to the pound sterling)
* [[Kiribati dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* [[Maltese scudo]] (1:0.24 pegged to the [[euro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofmalta.int/catalogue/38626/a-little-history/?lang=en |title= The Order of Malta, A little history |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Sahrawi peseta]] of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] in [[Western Sahara]], sometimes given the code "EHP" but this has not been assigned by the ISO
* [[Somaliland shilling]] (state of issue is viewed as ''[[de jure]]'' part of [[Somalia]], exchange rate not fixed)
* [[Transnistrian ruble]] (state of issue is viewed as ''de jure'' part of [[Moldova]])
* [[Tuvaluan dollar]] (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* [[Zimbabwean bonds]] (1:1 pegged to the US dollar)

See [[:Category:Fixed exchange rate]] for a list of all currently pegged currencies.

=== Unofficial currency codes ===
Despite having no official recognition in ISO 4217, the following non-ISO codes are sometimes used locally or commercially.

===Cryptocurrencies===
Recently, [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] have unofficially used ISO codes on various cryptocurrency exchanges, for instance LTC for [[Litecoin]], NMC for [[Namecoin]] and XRP for [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple]]. [[SIX Interbank Clearing]] (a Maintenance Agency of ISO) is currently studying the impact and role of cryptocurrencies and other independent currencies on ISO 4217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.six-interbank-clearing.com/dam/downloads/en/clearit/63-64/4217.pdf|title=SIX Interbank ISO 4217: A controversial standard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical currency codes ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
A number of currencies were official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by the [[euro]] or other currencies. The table below shows the ISO currency codes of former currencies and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names). These codes were first introduced in december 1988 after a request from the reinsurance sector was accepted&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.currency-iso.org/dam/downloads/dl_currency_iso_amendment_24.pdf New "table 3" of historic denominations published on 14 December 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli [[nationality law]]''' ({{lang-he|(חוק האזרחות (ישראל)}}) regulates who are and can become [[citizenship|citizens]] of [[Israel]].

The law rests on two [[statutes]]; the [[Law of Return]] enacted in 1950, allowing every Jew to immigrate to Israel, and the Citizenship act of 1952 that defines how Israeli nationality could be acquired and lost. The Law of Return has since been [[amendment|amended]] twice and the Citizenship act 13 times.&lt;ref name=harpaz2018/&gt;

The primary principles of Israeli citizenship is ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by descent) for Jews and ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by place of birth) for others.&lt;ref name="safran1997"&gt;{{cite journal|first=William|last=Safran|date=1997-07-01|title=Citizenship and Nationality in Democratic Systems: Approaches to Defining and Acquiring Membership in the Political Community|publisher=SAGE Publishing|journal=International Political Science Review|accessdate=3 November 2018|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019251297018003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Apart from citizenship, there is another civil status which can be held by residents of Israel; the [[permanent residency]] status. It is most common among [[Syria]]n citizens of the [[Golan Heights]] and among Arab [[East Jerusalem]] residents, but it occurs also among other [[Alien (law)|non-citizens]].

==History== &lt;!-- TODO: much more needed here --&gt;
This section describes the major changes to the Israeli nationality law from the establishment of the State in 1948 until today.

Prior to the establishment of Israel in 1948, the area that became Israel was part of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Its inhabitants were citizens of Mandatory Palestine. The mandate came to an abrupt end in 1948 and the State of Israel was established during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The nascent state had no citizenship law and technically speaking, no citizens. Neither Jews nor Palestinians had official citizenship status, but had identity cards or Temporary Residence Permits. 

This omission brought on a host of legal issues and Israeli courts provided conflicting positions on the question of citizenship. In a question relating to the nationality of former Palestinian citizens, the Tel Aviv District Court, referring to [[public international law]], ruled that&lt;ref name = "mazen2005"/&gt;

: "every individual who, on the day of the establishment of the State of Israel, was a resident in the territory which today constitutes the State of Israel, is also a national of Israel. Any other view must lead to the absurd result of a state without national."

Other courts held that former Palestine citizens had lost their citizenship with the termination of the Mandate without acquiring any other.&lt;ref name = "goodwin2007p460"&gt;{{cite book|edition=3rd|title=The Refugee in International Law|first1=Guy S.|last1=Goodwin-Gill|first2=Jane|last2=McAdam|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=460|isbn=978-0-19-928130-5|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Voting rights for the [[Knesset]]'s first two sessions in 1949 and 1951 were therefore based on residence and not nationality.

===Enactment of the citizenship law and its impact===
On July 5, 1950 the Knesset enacted the [[Law of Return]], a precursor to the nationality law that would be enacted later. The law specified that "every Jew has the right to come to his country as an oleh [Jewish immigrant]" but were otherwise mute on the question of citizenship. 

The first nationality law was the Citizenship act of 1952. The law explicitly repealed the [[Palestinian Citizenship Order, 1925|Palestinian Citizenship Order 1925]] retroactively from the day of the establishment of the State.&lt;ref name = "goodwin2007p460"&gt;{{cite book|edition=3rd|title=The Refugee in International Law|first1=Guy S.|last1=Goodwin-Gill|first2=Jane|last2=McAdam|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=460|isbn=978-0-19-928130-5|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enumerated four ways to acquire Israeli nationality, by return, by residence, by birth and by naturalization.

The most controversial stipulations of the law were those concerning acquisition of nationality by residence. Although Israel was the [[successor state]] to the Palestine Mandate, the law did not automatically recognize nationals of Palestine as Israeli. Jewish and Arab residents of the mandate became citizens using different means: Jews using the Law of Return whereas Arabs only if they

# Previously held Palestinian nationality.
# Were registered residents of Israel since 1949.
# Were still registered as residents in 1952 on the day of the law coming into effect.
# Were "in Israel, or in an area which became Israel territory after the establishment of the State, from the day of the establishment of the State to the day of the coming into force of this Law, or entered Israel legally during that period."

The intention of these stipulations was to limit the number of Arabs who would be eligible for citizenship and to deny it to those who tried to return after the 1948 war. During the war, a large number of [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian Arabs had fled]] from Israeli-occupied territory and as they weren't registered as residents they did not gain Israeli nationality.  

Neither did they receive citizenship in any of the surrounding Arab states that they sought refuge in, with the exception of [[Jordan]] so they became [[Statelessness|stateless]]. This led to the promulgation of the [[Palestinian refugees|Palestinian refuge crisis]], one of the most intractable and long-lived [[refugee crisis|refugee crises]] in the world. Scholars who have argued in favor of the Palestinian refugees [[right of return]] have argued that the 1952 Citizenship act constituted a "denationalization" and was a breach of [[international law]].&lt;ref name = "mazen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2483882|title=The Implications of the Acquisition of a New Nationality for the Right of Return of Palestinian Refugees|journal=Asian Journal of International Law|year=2014|first=Masri|last=Mazen|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; About three-quarter of a million  Palestinians left and 160,000 remained in the territories that became Israel.&lt;ref name = davis1995&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jinsiyya Versus Muwatana: The Question of Citizenship and the State in the Middle East: The Cases of Israel, Jordan and Palestine|journal=Arab Studies Quarterly|year=1995|publisher=Pluto Journals|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41858111?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|pp=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following 1948, many [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] Palestinians and Palestinians outside the borders of Israel managed to return to their former places of residence. Due to the court's strict interpretation of the "by residence" clauses of the citizenship act, such as requiring ''continuous'' residence in the state, they were denied citizenship and only granted permanent residency status. This left tens of thousands of former Palestinian citizens stateless.&lt;ref name = davis1995/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, several court cases were brought forward by Palestinians who challenged the strict rules for citizenship by residence. &lt;!-- musa case here --&gt; The question was finally settled in 1980, when further means of acquiring citizenship by residence was amended to the law so that it was retroactively made available for this group.&lt;ref name = "harpaz2018"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Yossi|last1=Harpaz|first2=Ben|last2=Herzog|title=Report on citizenship law: Israel|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/56024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal definition of Jew===
{{Main|Who is a Jew?}}
While the law of Return allowed every Jew to immigrate to Israel, it did not define "[[Who is a Jew?]]" which brought on some legal issues such as the case of ''Rufeisen v Minister of the Interior'' in 1962. [[Oswald Rufeisen]] was a Polish Jew who had converted to [[Catholicism]] and sought to immigrate to Israel. The Supreme Court ruled that by converting to another religion he had forfeited his right to return. This decision of the court would make its way into the second amendment of the Law of Return in 1970 in which "Jew" was defined:

:4B. For the purposes of this Law, "Jew" means a person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism and who is not a member of another religion.

This interpretation differs from Jewish religious law, [[halakha]] in which a person born Jewish and a member of another religion would be considered a Jew.

===Amendment for relatives of Jews===
&lt;!-- more work needed --&gt;
In 1970 the Law of Return was expanded to grant the same rights to the spouse of a Jew, the children of a Jew and their spouses, and the grandchildren of a Jew and their spouses:
:"The rights of a Jew under this Law and the rights of an oleh under the Nationality Law, (5712--1952), as well as the rights of an oleh under any other enactment, are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion."

In 1999, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that Jews or the descendants of Jews that actively practice a religion other than Judaism are not entitled to immigrate to Israel as they would no longer be considered Jews under the Law of Return, irrespective of their status under Halakah.

On April 16, 2008, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by a number of people with Jewish fathers and grandfathers whose applications for citizenship had been rejected on the grounds that they were [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messianics]]. The argument was made by the applicants that they had never been Jews according to Halakha, and were not therefore excluded by the conversion clause. This argument was upheld in the ruling, and the government agreed to reprocess their applications.

===Nationality amendment of 1971===
In 1971 the third amendment of the nationality law as enacted in the Knesset. The amendment added a new paragraph to Section 2 dealing with citizenship by return and read:
:(e)Where a person has expressed his desire to settle in Israel, being a person who has received, or is entitled to receive, an oleh's visa under the Law of Return, 5710-1950, the Minister of the Interior may at his discretion, grant him, upon his application, nationality by virtue of return even before his aliya.
The amendment was in response to the large number of [[Soviet Jews]] in the period following the [[Six-day war]] who where denied [[exit visas]] and therefore unable to leave the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13501677108577093 |first=Leonard|last=Schroeter |title=Soviet Jews and Israeli citizenship: The nationality amendment law of 1971 |journal=Soviet Jewish Affairs|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family reunification for Palestinians===
In 2003, the [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]] was passed. Originally intended as a [[temporary law]] it has since been extended on several occasions and is currently on the books. 

The law prohibits citizenship by [[family reunification]] between Israeli citizens and non-Jewish spouses from countries which some have termed "enemy nationals", Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and the Palestinian territories. In January 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] upheld the validity of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-16526469 | title=Israel upholds citizenship bar for Palestinian spouses | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=12 January 2012 | accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquiring Israeli citizenship by decree of the [[Minister of the Interior]] was added in 1968 (2nd amendment).&lt;ref name = "harpaz2018"/&gt;

===Is "Israeli" a Nationality?===
According to [[international law]], Israeli citizens are Israeli nationals having Israeli nationality so the nationality exists. But an ongoing debate in Israeli politics is whether an Israeli nationality exists in a "deeper" sense. Does an Israeli nationality exist, distinct from a Jewish or Palestinian nationality?

Domestic Israeli law does not recognize an Israeli nationality.&lt;ref name = "schechla2004"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Joseph|last=Schechla|year=2004|title="Jewish Nationality," "National Institutions" and Institutionalized Dispossession|magazine=al-Majdal|publisher=[[BADIL]]|url=http://www.badil.org/phocadownload/Badil_docs/publications/al-majdal-24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|date=November 2018}}Citizens are registered along mostly ethnic affiliations, the main ones being Jewish, Arab, Druze and Circassian but foreign nationalities such as Egyptian, Georgian and Russian are also allowed. This registration is imprinted on [[Israeli identity card]], which citizens are required to carry at all times under the field ''le'om'' (לאום) the Hebrew word for "nationality" or "ethnic affiliation."

Two lawsuits have been brought forward by citizens requesting to have their nationality registered as "Israeli" to the Supreme Court. Both times the request have been denied. The first of which was by human rights advocate and psychologist [[Georges Tamarin]] in 1971 who carried a plea to the Supreme Court to have his nationality identification as Jew changed to Israeli. An unanimous court ruled against him arguing that "there is no Israeli nation separate from the Jewish people."&lt;ref name = "tekiner1991"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Roselle|last=Tekiner|title=Race and the Issue of National Identity in Israel|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/163931?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, retired computational linguist professor Uzi Ornan, head of the [[I am an Israeli]] movement, and other Israeli scholars such as [[Joseph Agassi]] lead a lawsuit challenging this system, demanding to have their affiliation listed as "Israeli."&lt;ref name = "ornan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/content/lawsuit-challenges-israels-discriminatory-citizenship-definition/8767|title=Lawsuit challenges Israel’s discriminatory citizenship definition|website=Electronic Intifada|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request, ostensibly about the existence of an "Israeli nationality," was in 2013 denied by the Supreme Court, citing concerns about preserving the Jewish character of the Israeli State.&lt;ref name = "sc2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/supreme-court-rejects-israeli-nationality-status/|title=Supreme Court rejects ‘Israeli’ nationality status|access-date=2018-11-06|website=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and obligations for citizens==
Although not a part of the nationality law, Israeli citizens have the following rights:
* to fully participate in the [[political system]] of [[Israel]].
* to an [[Israeli passport]].
* to travel into and out of Israel whenever they wish, but this right may be limited at certain times with special warrants.

Other rights are granted equally to citizens and permanent residents of Israel, among them: the right to work within Israel, the right to extenuation of tax payments, the right to a pension when needed from the social security services, and the right to vote within the scope of local ordinances. Residents who are not citizens may, however, lose their status (and thus any rights provided to them in Israel) if they move outside Israel's borders (outside the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] including the [[Golan Heights]] and [[East Jerusalem]]), contrary to the privileges of citizens which enable them to re-settle in Israel at any time.

Israeli citizens are required to have an [[Israeli passport]] at all times when outside the country, which must have been acquired before leaving Israel.

[[Israel Defense Forces|Military service]] is legally mandatory for most Israeli citizens and residents although various exemptions can be granted. [[Arab citizens of Israel]] and [[Haredi Judaism|haredi Jews]] (ultra-Orthodox) have received a blanket exemptions.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
This section lists the various ways of acquiring Israeli citizenship.

===Citizenship by Return===
{{Main|Law of Return}}
The Law of Return grants all Jews (given the law's definition of "Jew" described above) the right to immigrate to Israel and claim Israeli citizenship upon arrival in Israel. 

Israeli law distinguishes between the Law of Return, which allows for Jews and their descendants to immigrate to Israel, and Israel's nationality law, which formally grants Israeli citizenship. In other words, the Law of Return does not itself determine Israeli citizenship; it merely allows for Jews and their eligible descendants to permanently live in Israel. Israel does, however, grant citizenship to those who immigrated under the Law of Return if the applicant so desires.

A non-Israeli Jew or an eligible descendant of a non-Israeli Jew needs to request approval to immigrate to Israel, a request which can be denied for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to) possession of a criminal record, currently infected with a contagious disease, or otherwise viewed as a threat to Israeli society. Within three months of arriving in Israel under the Law of Return, immigrants automatically receive Israeli citizenship unless they explicitly request not to.

===Citizenship by residence===
Citizenship by residence provisions of the citizenship act were intended for non-Jewish residents of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], such as [[Arabs]]. Such residents who were continuously present within the territorial confines of Israel from the establishment of the state until the date of the enactment of the citizenship law were granted Israeli citizenship. In order to determine who was eligible for citizenship under this provision, the State conducted a population registration in 1952 and again in the 1980s. Those found to meet the requirements obtained Israeli citizenship. For purposes regarding modern Israeli citizenship, this section is usually irrelevant.

===Citizenship by descent===
A child (including children born outside Israel as first generation out of Israel) automatically acquires Israeli citizenship at birth if either or both of his or her parents are Israeli citizens. Persons born outside Israel are Israeli citizens if their father or mother holds Israeli citizenship, acquired either by birth in Israel, under the Law of Return, by residence, or by naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/8/Acquisition%20of%20Israeli%20Nationality |title=Acquisition of Israeli Nationality |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=2001-08-20 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizenship by descent, on the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', is limited to only one generation born abroad. Despite this limitation, descendants of an Israeli national born abroad may be eligible to Israeli citizenship through other methods, such as the Law of Return.

===Citizenship by adoption===
In 1996 the citizenship law was amended (6th amendment) to allow Israeli citizenship by adoption.&lt;ref name = "harpaz2018"/&gt; A non-Israeli child adopted by Israeli citizens is entitled to Israeli citizenship on the day of the adoption if it is made under Israeli law. A child adopted outside of Israel by Israeli citizens who are not residents of Israel can receive Israeli citizenship if both adoptive parents consent to it.&lt;ref name=shortcut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelishortcut.org/Services.aspx?l=2|title=Acquiring or canceling Israeli citizenship|first=אוריון - שיווק|last=באינטרנט|website=www.israelishortcut.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship by naturalization===
Adults may acquire Israeli citizenship through [[naturalization]]. To be eligible for naturalization, a person must have resided in Israel for three years out of the previous five years, have the right to reside in Israel on a permanent basis, renounce his or her previous citizenship and swear an [[oath of citizenship]] to the state reading:&lt;ref name=safran1997/&gt;
:"I declare that I will be a loyal national of the State of Israel."
In 2010, a controversial bill was proposed to change the wording of the oath to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11510765|title=Israeli cabinet backs controversial Jewish loyalty oath|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"I swear that I will be a loyal citizen to the state of Israel, as a Jewish and democratic state, and will uphold its laws."
But the bill didn't garner a majority in the Knesset and wasn't enacted.

The application must also have "some knowledge" of [[Hebrew]] but no language tests are used.&lt;ref name = "shohamy2009"&gt;{{cite article|first1=Elana|last1=Shohamy|first2=Tzahi|last2=Kanza|year=2009|title=Language and Citizenship in Israel|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15434300802606622|journal=Language Assessment Quarterly|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; No similar requirement is made for [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name = "amara1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Muhammad|last=Amara|year=1999|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|title=Politics and Sociolinguistic Reflexes: Palestinian Border Villages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LG5seycNTAcC&amp;pg=PA90|isbn=978-9-02-724128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All naturalization requests are at the discretion of the Minister of the Interior.

===Citizenship by marriage===
Traditionally, Israel granted citizenship to a non-Israeli spouse or partner of a Jewish Israeli citizen under the Law of Return. However, this practice was suspended in 1999 due to immigration concerns if the Jewish spouse had done Aliyah previous to the marriage or is an Israeli citizen by birth.{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

The [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]] of 2003 suspended the right of naturalization by marriage of a non-Israeli spouse who lives in the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lawoffice.org.il/en/marriage-visa-israel-033724722/ GRANTING STATUS TO THE FOREIGN SPOUSE OF AN ISRAELI CITIZEN]&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension was extended several times, most recently in 2016. The practice was suspended because some West Bank militants used the process to gain access to Israel proper with all related privileges, such as unrestricted movement.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Process for obtaining citizenship by descent===
From inside Israel the Israeli parent(s) must go to the Ministry of the Interior with the child and the child's original birth certificate that lists the Israeli parent(s) as the parents of the child. In addition, the Israeli parent(s) need(s) to bring their [[Israeli identity card|identity cards]] or their Israeli passport and the child's foreign passport.&lt;ref name="moin"&gt;http://www.moin.gov.il/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; If the parents are not married or did not register their marriage with the Ministroy of the Interior or Foreign Affairs, both of the parents must be in attendance at the Ministory of the Interior.&lt;ref name="moin"/&gt; After all of the information is verified, the child will be issued an identity number and an Israeli passport. If the child is 16 years or older, he or she will also receive an identity card.&lt;ref name="moin"/&gt; It is important to note that in Israel there is no separation of religion and state.&lt;ref name="moin"/&gt; If the mother is not Jewish by Orthodox standards then the child can not be registered as Jewish, nor can the child be married to a Jewish person inside of Israel without first undergoing an Orthodox [[conversion to Judaism]].&lt;ref name="moin"/&gt; By the same token, a child born to a mother considered Jewish by Orthodox standards is automatically also registered as Jewish.&lt;ref name="moin"/&gt;

==Cancellation and renunciation of citizenship==
There are cases in which the state can initiate a cancellation of citizenship of an Israeli citizen. Article 11 of the Israeli nationality law establishes three circumstances for which citizenship can be revoked:

* If the person entered a state which is considered an enemy of Israel, or obtained citizenship of an enemy state.
* If the person committed an act which is considered a breach of loyalty to the country.
* If the person's citizenship was given to him/her on the basis of false information. In such a case, the revocation might also apply to the citizenship of the person's children. 

With regard to citizenship being obtained on the basis of false information, the Interior Minister may cancel the Israeli citizenship of anyone who obtained it through such means within three years of them having acquired it. If the person had acquired Israeli citizenship more than three years prior to the discovery of it having been obtained with false information, the Interior Ministry must first obtain permission from an administrative court to cancel it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-amendment-authorizing-revocation-of-israeli-nationality-passed/|title=Israel: Amendment Authorizing Revocation of Israeli Nationality Passed - Global Legal Monitor|date=23 March 2017|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 amendment to the ''Nationality Law of 1952'' designated nine countries as enemy states: [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]], as well as the [[Gaza Strip]].

Per article 10 of the citizenship act, Israeli citizens living abroad renounce their Israeli citizenship by filing an application with an Israeli embassy. The application is transferred to the [[Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration]], acting on behalf of the Minister of Interior, which reviews and either grants or rejects the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ConsularServices/Pages/Renouncing_Israeli_citizenship.aspx Renouncing Israeli citizenship]&lt;/ref&gt; The request may be denied for any reason, such as if the person is obligated to serve in the military or if the person cannot prove that he or she has secured another state's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4610990,00.html|title=Increasing number of Israelis renouncing their citizenship|first=Itamar|last=Eichner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report from the [[Population and Immigration Authority]], 8 308 Israelis renounced their citizenship from 2003 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4819737,00.html|title=8,308 Israelis renounced citizenship over past 12 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Israel allows its citizens to hold [[Multiple citizenship|dual (or multiple) citizenship]]. A dual national is considered an Israeli citizen for all purposes, and is entitled to enter Israel without a [[visa (document)|visa]], stay in Israel according to his own desire, engage in any profession and work with any employer according to Israeli law. 

There are two exceptions to this principle. Under an additional law added to the [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law: the Knesset]] (Article 16A) according to which [[Knesset members]] cannot pledge allegiance unless their foreign citizenship has been revoked, if possible, under the laws of that country. Israeli citizenship cannot be acquired by naturalization unless one renounces his or her previous citizenship. 

A dual national is not considered a foreign citizen under Israeli Security Service Law and is subject to a mandatory military service according to that law. He or she is considered a citizen regarding the criminal liability of Israeli civilians according to the Israeli [[Penal code|Penal Law]] (and accordingly is not entitled to consular access by a representative of the other country). He or she is considered a citizen according to the Israeli laws of personal status, such as the authority jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts in the matters of marriage and divorce, according to the Israeli Rabbinical courts jurisdictions law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html|title=Bet Din and Judges|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Join Hands Day''' is the first Saturday in May. It is a national [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event sponsored by the [[American Fraternal Alliance]].

==Background==

The day was launched by what was then called America's Fraternal Benefit Societies in 2000, in partnership with [[Points of Light Foundation]]. It is meant to have a focus not just on volunteering, but also on developing youth and adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 19, 2000 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org/main.html, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/62e73be8-cfe2-472d-bb2a-3e640ed30171.pdf Join Hands Day 2014 brochure], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thrivent.com/leader-resources/activities-programs/activities/join-hands-day.html Thrivent Financial for Lutherans Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assuredlife.org/natlservcampaigns/natlservcampaigns-join_hands_day.aspx Assured Life Association Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two years of Join Hands Day, organizations were asked to register their Join Hands Day projects via the official web site. In some years, a certain number of groups were chosen to receive a cash award for the beneficiary of their project or another cause and a physical award, and were recognized at the National Fraternal Congress of America (NFCA) annual conference. It was not always on the first Saturday in May; the 2001 day was held on June 16.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 3, 2001 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers of Join Hands Day offer participants ideas for group volunteering events that can bring adults and youth together in community service, such as repairing bicycles to give disadvantaged children and teaching bicycle maintenance, collecting chairs of various shapes and sizes to paint and then auction for a worthy cause, or repairing gravestones and improve landscaping in a cemetery and documenting historic grave sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/993266a0-2235-4dea-9e54-d38e39dfac85.pdf 50 Great JOIN HANDS DAY Project Ideas that Work], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Engisch''' (15 March 1899 - 11 September 1990) was a [[Germany|German]] [[jurist]] and a [[philosophy of law|Philosopher of Law]].&lt;ref name=KElautAK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.badw.de/fileadmin/nachrufe/Engisch%20Karl.pdf|title=Karl Engisch: 15.3.1899 - 11.9.1990|author=[[:de:Arthur Kaufmann (Jurist)|Arthur Kaufmann]]|publisher=Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, München|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KESpiegel391990&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13502753.html|title=Gestorben: Karl Engisch|date=24 September 1990| volume=39/1990|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)| accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was described by [[:de:Hans Joachim Hirsch|Hans Joachim Hirsch]] as one of the "outstanding theorists of criminal justice of the [twentieth] century" (''"herausragenden Strafrechtstheoretiker des vergangenen Jahrhunderts"'').&lt;ref&gt;Hans Joachim Hirsch, In: Festschrift für Nikolaos K. Androulakis, p. 225, Athen 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Karl Engisch was born at the tail end of the nineteenth century in [[Gießen]], a mid-sized university town north of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;    Friedrich Engisch (1871-1943), his father was a lawyer.   He passed his [[Abitur|Abitur (school final exams)]] which would normally have opened the way to a university education, but these were the [[First World War|war years]], and the eighteen year old was now sent to take part in the fighting.&lt;ref name=KElautDeG&gt;{{cite web|title=Nachruf: Karl Engisch| work=Zeitschrift für die gesamte Strafrechtswissenschaft|volume=Volume 103, Issue 3| pages=623–635| issn=0084-5310| publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zstw.1991.103.issue-3/zstw.1991.103.3.623/zstw.1991.103.3.623.xml|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was wounded twice.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction of: Andreas Maschke: Gerechtigkeit durch Methode: Zu Karl Engischs Theorie des juristischen Denkens. Heidelberg 1993, p. 1 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;   After the war he studied law at [[University of Giessen|Gießen]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] between 1918 and 1921.   His teachers included Wolfgang Mittermaier, [[:de:Leo Rosenberg|Leo Rosenberg]], [[:de:Ernst von Beling|Ernst Beling]] and [[:de:Reinhard Frank|Reinhard Frank]].    From very early on Engisch was strongly drawn not so much to the mainstream [[Jurisprudence]] curriculum but to the [[philosophy of law]], seen then as now as more of a niche specialism.   Two leading scholars who particularly influenced him in this field were [[Max Weber]] at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] and [[:de:Ernst von Aster (Philosoph)|Ernst von Aster]] at [[University of Giessen|Gießen]].&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;   During his time at Gießen Karl Engisch, like his younger brother Ludwig Engisch (1900–1957),&lt;ref name=LudwignochHassiaKontakt1952&gt;{{cite web|page=171|url=http://www.giessener-hochschulgesellschaft.de/resources/NGH/NGH-21-1952.pdf|title=Liste des Vorstandes und der Mitglieder nach dem Stand von Mitte Februar 1952|work=Nachrichten der Gießener Hochschulgesellschaft Einundzwanzigster Band (Annual news/report to Giessen University Alumni Association)|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[:de:Corps Hassia-Gießen zu Mainz|"Corps Hassia"]] [[Studentenverbindung|fraternity]].   In 1924 Karl Engisch received his doctorate.  Supervised by [[:de:Otto Eger|Otto Eger]], his dissertation concerned [[:de:Imperativentheorie|Imperative Theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Die Imperativentheorie", jurisprudence dissertation, Gießen 1924 (unpublished), excerpts published in "Auszüge aus den der juristischen Fakultät der Universität Gießen vorgelegten Dissertationen". Gießen 1925, pp. 42–47 (faculty files)&lt;/ref&gt; an aspect of  [[philosophy of law|Legal Philosophy]], and a theory which German sources&lt;!---well ... starting with German wiki:  maybe it's called something else in English---&gt; impute to [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]].&lt;ref name="Engländer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Armin Engländer|title=Footnote 34|work=Grund und Grenzen der Nothilfe| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8mCUChEbVkC&amp;pg=PA242|year=2008|publisher=Mohr Siebeck| isbn=978-3-16-149723-0|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He undertook a  [[:de:Rechtsreferendariat|Rechtsreferendariat (''loosely "training, clerkship or under articles"'') period]] between 1924 and 1927, working in his father's law practice.&lt;ref name=KElautHG&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~n31/bestand/files/Engisch.html| date=26 March 2009| work=Repertorien des Universitätsarchivs Heidelberg   ....   Abteilung 5: Nachlässe und Handakten   ....   Rep 141/5| title= Nachlass Karl Engisch| accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He took on the [[criminal law]] cases.   In 1929 he received his [[habilitation]] (higher academic qualification) at [[University of Giessen|Gießen]].   His work was supervised by the criminologist Wolfgang Mittermaier (1867–1956) and comprised a substantial monograph on criminal intent and negligence which even today, despite dramatic swings back and forth in the evolution of criminal sciences in the intervening decades, continues to be regarded by admirers as a standard work in its field.&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;

A powerful influence during this period was the Munich-based criminologist [[:de:Ernst von Beling|Ernst von Beling]], to whom Engisch later dedicated his "Logische Studien zur Gesetzesanwendung" (''loosely: "Logical studies in the application of law"'').   He accepted teaching posts in Criminal Law at [[University of Freiburg]] (1929) and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] (1932).&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;   In October 1933 he returned to take up a criminal law teaching post at [[University of Giessen|Gießen]].&lt;ref name=KElautHG/&gt;

The [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933 was followed, in April 1933, by the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|so-called "Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service" (''"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums"'')]].   The law was progressively implemented across the civil service (which in German included the universities sector) over the next few months.   The man who held the teaching chair in Criminal Law at [[Heidelberg University]], [[Gustav Radbruch]], had been a government minister during the early 1920s.   He was a [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]].   Despite not being Jewish, Radbruch's political record meant that he was just the sort of person whom the authorities had in mind when designing their law.   He was dismissed.  Karl Engisch was by now a party member and well regarded in the relevant academic circles.   He took over the teaching chair in criminal law, criminal process and the philosophy of law at [[Heidelberg University]].   Despite the circumstances, Radbruch reacted with generosity.   He said that he could think of no successor that he would prefer, and there are suggestions that Engisch would not have disappointed him.   Clearly Engisch was not deeply political, and he failed to see through the Nazis in the early years.   But sound academic scepticism protected him from slavish adherence to anyone's party line.&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;   Where he cited Jewish authors in his written work, he simply ignored government strictures that they should go unacknowledged, even as many academic colleagues simply stopped acknowledging Jewish contributions in their work.   Engisch displayed a certain amount of backbone in May 1935 after the student union called for a boycott of non-Aryan lecturers.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2017"&gt;{{cite book| author=Klaus-Peter Schroeder|title=Von Versailles zu den Nürnberger Rasseesetzen|work="Sie haben kaum Chancen, auf einen Lehrstuhl berufen zu werden": Die Heidelberger Juristische Fakultät und ihre Mitglieder jüdischer Herkunft| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfMNSeCDoH8C&amp;pg=PA276|date=12 June 2017|publisher=Mohr Siebeck| isbn=978-3-16-154980-9| page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As dean of the faculty he protested (unsuccessfully) when [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi "SA" paramilitaries]] intervened against the university administration to enforce a boycott of Jewish lecturers, notably in respect of [[Ernst Levy (jurist)|Ernst Levy]].&lt;ref name="Schroeder2017"/&gt;   He was one of those jurists who rejected the intervention of Nazi ideology into the law, and avoided the inclusion of such themes in his own books.  On the other hand, he did expressly, if crudely, support the government in a review he contributed in 1936 to [[:de:Archiv für die civilistische Praxis|"Archiv für die civilistische Praxis"]], a venerable and distinguished legal journal:  
:"The Laws of the National Socialist state are the leader's orders, and that makes them laws.   Resistance by judges' and enforcement officers cannot carry the weight of law.  Acts of forcible resistance cannot be called law where they blatantly contradict basic principles of National Socialism.   In the final analysis these are personally generated concepts that border on embarrassing".&lt;ref name=RezensionTJ/&gt;{{efn|Despite careful avoidance in his own books of any inclusion of those strands of Nazi ideology that the authorities sought to introduce into Germany's legal structure, Engisch did go on record in 1936 with a fulsome if crude endorsement of the government's approach to law.

"The Laws of the National Socialist state are the leader's orders, and that makes them laws" &lt;br&gt;(''"Die Gesetze des nationalsozialistischen Staates sind Führerbefehle und als solche Recht"'').&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Resistance by judges' and enforcement officers cannot carry the weight of law." &lt;br&gt;(''"Richterliche und behördliche Zwangsreaktionen, die diesen Gesetzen widersprechen, sind kein Recht und können es auch nicht durch gleichsinnige Häufung werden"'').&lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;"Acts of forcible resistance cannot be called law where they blatantly contradict basic principles of National Socialism."   &lt;br&gt;(''"Ebensowenig könnten typische Zwangsreaktionen Recht heißen, die eklatant den Grundsätzen der nationalsozialistischen Rechtsanschauung zuwiderlaufen."'').&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; "In the final analysis these are personally generated concepts that border on embarrassing"&lt;br&gt; (''"Das sind schließlich Selbstverständnisse, die man sich fast auszusprechen geniert."'')&lt;ref name=RezensionTJ&gt;Rezension zu Theodor Jaehner: Der Mythos vom Recht und seine empirischen Grundlagen (1933), AcP 1936, 116, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{right| ''Karl Engisch, 1936, writing in [[:de:Archiv für die civilistische Praxis|Archiv für die civilistische Praxis]]''}}}}

During this period Engisch turned down invitation to take up academic posts at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] (1933), [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1938) and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] (1940).   In June 1942 the [[Bernhard Rust|Minister for Culture and Education]] appointed him Legal Counsel (''"Rechtsbeirat"'') to the [[University of Heidelberg]] with responsibilities covering academic discipline.&lt;ref name=KElautHG/&gt;

[[End of World War II in Europe|War ended]] in May 1945, and the twelve Nazi years came to an end.   The western two thirds of Germany was now divided into [[Allied occupation of Germany|military occupation zones]].  Heidelberg University was a high-profile institution within the US occupation zone.   On 2 January 1946 Karl Engisch was dismissed from his university posts on the orders of the US military commander.   On 5 December 1946 his professorship was reinstated, however, and on 16 December 1950 he was granted tenure at Heidelberg for life.   (In April 1950 he had turned down an invitation to move to [[Hamburg University]].)

In 1953 he finally accepted an invitation to move.   He transferred to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], taking over the teaching chair vacated by [[:de:Edmund Mezger|Edmund Mezger]].&lt;ref name=KElautAK/&gt;   He retired from the post only in April 1967.&lt;ref name=KElautHG/&gt;   In the meantime, at the [[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (association of student fraternities)]] congress, held on 27 May 1955, he delivered the main address at the [[Würzburg Residence]] (palace).&lt;ref name=HassiaGeschichte&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hassia-giessen.de/geschichte.html|title=Unsere Geschichte |publisher=Corps Hassia Gießen zu Mainz|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He returned to [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] where, on 30 November 1972, he accepted an honorary professorship and, till his death on 11 September 1990, delivered lectures on criminal law and the philosophy of law.&lt;ref name=KElautHG/&gt;

== Evaluation and celebration ==
In his lectures Engisch knew how to expand his subject's horizons beyond the framework commonly accepted in the law faculty, introducing concepts from the worlds of philosophy and literature.   Those whom he most frequently cited included [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]].

He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Heidelberg, Mannheim and Saragossa.   He was awarded the [[Bavarian Order of Merit]] in 1961, and enjoyed membership of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Heidelberg]] and [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], conferred respectively in 1938 and 1956.   In 1971 he became a corresponding member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].

Engisch was a co-editor of two academic journals.   He also possessed one of the largest specialist private libraries on legal theory of the times.   Part of it had to be stored out of town at a separate site.

== Works ==
Among students his best known publication  is probably "Einführung in das juristische Denken" (''"Introduction to Legal Thinking"'') which first appeared in 1956.   By 2005 it had reached its tenth edition.   The work has been translated into Portuguese (1965), Spanish (1967) and Greek (1981)

In [[law]], the '''last injurious exposure rule''' is the principle that when an [[occupational disease]] was caused by a succession of jobs, or could have been caused by any one of a succession of jobs, the most recent employer with the [[risk]] exposure is [[liable]].&lt;ref name="Oran"&gt;{{cite book | last = Oran | first = Daniel| authorlink = Daniel Oran | title = Oran's Dictionary of the Law (West Legal Studies), 4th Edition | publisher = Delmar Cengage Learning |date=June 2007 | location = Florence, KY | pages =  | isbn = 1-4180-8091-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latvian nationality law''' ({{lang-lv|Pilsonības likums}}) is based on the Citizenship Law of 1994 (as at 2013, amended four times, most recently through the amendments approved by the [[Parliament of Latvia]] on May 9, 2013). It is primarily based on [[jus sanguinis]].&lt;ref name=law/&gt;

==History==
The first nationality law of Latvia was adopted in August, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;''Puriņš G.'' [http://home.lu.lv/~politics/raksti/Pilsoniba/pilsoniba.htm Latvijas pilsonība ab ovo], 2000 {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 1940, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] adopted a decree on the order of receiving USSR citizenship by the citizens of the Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian SSRs.&lt;ref&gt;Указ ВС СССР «О порядке приобретения гражданства СССР гражданами Латвийской, Литовской и Эстонской Советских Социалистических Республик»/ Ведомости Верховного Совета СССР. — 1940. — № 31. Also published in: Полпреды сообщают. Сборник документов об отношениях СССР с Латвией, Литвой и Эстонией: Август 1939 г. — август 1940 г. — М. Международные отношения, 1990. {{ISBN|5-7133-0354-3}}. — стр. 508-509 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, 1991, the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]] has adopted a resolution "On the renewal of Republic of Latvia citizens' rights and fundamental principles of naturalization" declaring the 1940 decree null and void with regard to Republic of Latvia citizens.&lt;ref&gt;B. Bowring [http://www.barhumanrights.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/biblio/missionlatvia.pdf Report of a Second Mission to the Republic of Latvia] [[FIDH]], [[Bar of England and Wales]] Human Rights Committee, 1994 — see Appendix 3, pp. 76-78 (pp. 37-39 of .pdf document)&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2012, the Central Election Commission received a draft for amendments to the Citizenship Law, providing that, from 1 January 2014, all non-citizens (a status held by former USSR citizens who do not possess citizenship of Latvia or any other state and who do not apply for citizenship while residing in Latvia), who by 30 November 2013 had not applied, under the rules of the Cabinet of Ministers, to retain the status of non-citizen shall be considered to be citizens of Latvia; these amendments would have automatically granted citizenship to any person who might have the status of non-citizen, without regard for place of residence, interest in acquiring citizenship of Latvia, and awareness of the amendments. The Central Election Commission sought opinions from legal experts before itself making any decision on the admissibility and sufficiency of the popular initiative. The majority of the experts requested were inclined to consider there to have been sound arguments for ceasing organisation of the popular initiative, the Central Election Commission went along with their opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", Juridica International. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
[[Dual citizenship]] is not prohibited by Latvian citizenship law. According to the amendments to the Citizenship Law which came into force on 1 October 2013,&lt;ref name=newlaw&gt;{{cite paper
  | title = Pilsonības likums, 01.10.2013
  | url = http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=57512%22%20\l%20%22p11.&amp;pd=1
  | format = .html }}&lt;/ref&gt; citizenship of Latvia may be retained for persons who have acquired the citizenship of:
* another [[EU Member State]] or an [[EFTA]] Member State;
* another [[NATO]] Member State;
* [[Australia]], [[Brazil]] or [[New Zealand]];
* such a country with which Latvia has concluded an agreement on the recognition of dual citizenship (no such agreement is currently concluded);
* a country not referred to previously if due to important national interests permission from the [[Government of Latvia]] is received to retain dual citizenship;
* a country not referred to previously if it has been acquired automatically (ex lege), through marriage or as a result of adoption.
Children of citizens of Latvia may hold dual citizenship with any country.  Some countries, such as Japan, however, [[Japanese nationality law|do not permit their nationals to also, after reaching adulthood, hold a foreign citizenship]].  A dual Latvian-Japanese national must declare, to Japan's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], his or her intention as to which citizenship to keep, before turning 22.

Before October 1, 2013, the newly acquired non-Latvian citizenship is simply not recognised by the [[Republic of Latvia]], with the exception of a transitional clause: Latvia allows dual citizenship for those and their descendants who were forced to leave Latvia during the Soviet or Nazi occupations and adopted another citizenship while away from Latvia. In order to be eligible for dual citizenship, they had to claim it by July 1, 1995. If such a claim is made after this date, they shall renounce the citizenship of another state. If by a law of another state a Latvian citizen may be a citizen of this state, in relations with Latvia this person is considered solely as a Latvian citizen.&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite paper
  | title = Translation of Latvian Citizenship Law, 1999
  | url = http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN018407.pdf
  | format = .pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In general terms, you might be '''eligible to get Latvian citizenship''' by descent and keep existing citizenship (dual citizenship) if:
# One of your parents, grandparents or grand-grandparents were Latvian citizen prior to 1940.
# They withdrew or were exiled from Latvia during 1940-1990 period.

Application procedure requires having documents that prove your connection to the family member with Latvian heritage and proof that they withdrew or were exiled. If ancestors of applicant left prior to 1940, he/she still be able to qualify for citizenship, but will not qualify to have dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.latviancitizenship.eu/eligibility Eligibility criteria for Latvian citizenship]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel Freedom &amp; Quality of Nationality==
In 2017, the Latvian nationality is ranked twenty-third in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). The QNI considers travel freedom and internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Latvia forms part of the [[European Union]], Latvian citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Latvia (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/latvia/index_en.htm | title=Latvia | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Latvian embassy, Latvian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136743">{{Insolvency}}
[[Personal bankruptcy]] (also known as personal insolvency) law allows, in certain jurisdictions, an individual to be declared [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], which is a legal status of a person or other entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor. Personal bankruptcy is distinguished from corporate bankruptcy, which generally does not directly affect the business owners' personal assets.

Modern bankruptcy law often distinguishes ''reorganization'', in which only some of the bankrupt's assets are taken, a repayment plan is devised and part of the debt is [[Bankruptcy discharge|discharged]], from [[liquidation]]. In the latter type of bankruptcy, all of the debtors assets are included in the bankruptcy estate, sometimes in addition to his disposable income for a period of time, after which all of the debts are discharged.

The details vary between jurisdictions. In the USA, the liquidation bankruptcy is governed by [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] of the [[Title 11 of the United States Code]] and is generally available to individuals passing a [[means test]]. Reorganization bankruptcy is governed by Chapters [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|11]] and [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|13]].&lt;ref name="CampbellBasinger"&gt;{{cite web | title="Who Owns Kim Basinger?

'''Made in Germany''' is a merchandise mark indicating that a product has been manufactured in [[Germany]].

== History ==
[[File:FAG made in Germany pic1.JPG|thumb|FAG ([[Schaeffler Group|Fischers Aktien-Gesellschaft]]) metal tin]]
The label was originally introduced in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] by the ''[[Merchandise Marks Act 1887]]'',&lt;ref name="National_Archives_1"/&gt; to mark foreign produce more obviously, as foreign manufactures had been falsely marking inferior goods with the marks of renowned British manufacturing companies and importing them into the United Kingdom. Most of these were found to be originating from Germany, whose government had introduced a protectionist policy to legally prohibit the import of goods in order to build up domestic industry (Merchandise Marks Act - Oxford University Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreist, dreister, Deutschland|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/made-in-germany-vom-stigma-zum-qualitaetssiegel-a-947688.html|website=Spiegel Online|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Asaf Zussman, Department of Economics, Hebrew University in "The Rise of German Protectionism in the 1870s: A Macroeconomic Perspective∗", the [[German tariff of 1879|"Rye and Iron" tariffs]] introduced by Bismarck’s Germany in 1879 caused a major reduction of imports in order to protect Germany's industries. As a response, the Free-trade Liberal government in the UK introduced the Merchandise Marks act to allow consumers to be able to choose whether or not they would continue to purchase goods from protectionist economies.

Germany successfully leveraged the ''Made in Germany'' tag as a brand synonymous of product reliability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How much is 'Made in Germany' really worth?|url=http://www.dw.de/how-much-is-made-in-germany-really-worth/a-17372908|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tighter 'Made in Germany' rules criticised|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20120116/40137|publisher=The Local|date=16 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unpopular EU Proposal: 'Made in Germany' Label At Risk|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/unpopular-eu-proposal-made-in-germany-label-at-risk-a-809300.html|work=Spiegel Online|date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Made in Germany’ in times of globalisation|url=http://blog.inpolis.com/2012/02/27/made-in-germany-in-times-of-globalisation/|access-date=2015-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230057/http://blog.inpolis.com/2012/02/27/made-in-germany-in-times-of-globalisation/|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.

"Made in Germany" is not controlled by a central regulatory body. However, {{Citation needed span|text=its status has been defined by several court rulings in Germany.|date=August 2011}} In 1973, the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] made a ruling that ''Made in Germany'' does not enable people to properly distinguish between the two Germanys of the time, so '''Made in [[West Germany]]''' and '''Made in [[East Germany|GDR]]''' became popular.

&lt;/gallery&gt; --&gt;
In 1995, the [[Oberlandesgericht]] [[Stuttgart]] ruled that the term ''Made in Germany'' is misleading according to Germany's Fair Trades Act when the largest part is not German raw materials or German craftsmanship.

'''Mariticide''' (from [[Latin]] ''maritus'' "husband" + ''-cide'', from ''caedere'' "to cut, to kill") literally means killing of one's husband. The killing of a wife is called [[uxoricide]].

==Prevalence==
[[Uxoricide]] (the murder of a wife) is much more common than Mariticide.

==English common law==
Under [[England|English]] common law it was a [[petty treason]] [[Offences against the Person Act 1828|until 1828]], and until it was altered under the [[Treason Act 1790]] the punishment was to be strangled and [[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]].&lt;ref name=burgess&gt;{{citation |first=Samuel Walter |last=Burgess |title=Historical illustrations of the origin and progress of the passions, and their influence on the conduct of mankind |publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown &amp; Green |year=1825|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the black comedy film, ''[[To Die For]]'', Suzanne Stone-Maretto had her husband, Larry Maretto, murdered by seducing and manipulating her under-age teen lover, Jimmy Emmett, into doing it, under the guise that he was abusive to her, but in reality, her husband was putting starting a family over supporting her career.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6714">== Overview ==
'''Muragh''' was a tax [[levied]] for the construction or maintenance of [[town walls]]. Muragh, also referred to as murage, was generally a term used for the tax meant for the repairs of the defensive walls that enclosed towns in historical England, Wales, Ireland. Construction of the walls with the use of the muragh tax was a way for a market town to generate the revenue needed to pay for its own defense. Typically, muragh was granted for a short period of time typically lasting a few years with opportunities to renew until the completion of wall. Later, the grant for muragh to be collected could last indefinitely in Ireland. The construction of town walls, or the desire to have them, was higher in Wales and Ireland due to their differences in ethnicities. Due to the nature of the tax, it was possible the tax could be used to collect funds for non-defensive walls, like a safety rail on a bridge, because of the loose classification of the civic improvement taxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/murage/muressay.html#footnote13|title=The Gatehouse website essay regarding murage|website=www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax rate for the muragh was a small percentage of the value of the good which is estimated to be under 1% of the value. Overall, there are records of 1470 muragh grants recorded in England, France, Scotland, and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/murage/murindex.html|title=The index of the Gatehouse website records of royal support for town defences|last=Davis|first=Philip Charles|website=www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collection of muraghs were tasked to individuals granted by royal appointment, although some towns appointed their own collector. 

From Old French, ultimately from Latin "murus" meaning literally: wall.

== Intent ==
The building of walled towns was initially intended to defend against Viking incursions. The intent of the muragh also included walls meant for sea defense and defense against natural disasters resulting from flooding in towns near rivers or the ocean; although, they were mainly intended for military defense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Bristol, England, the recognition of need to use muragh tax collection to repair due to natural disasters was the first allowance of this nature. Due to the River Froom being dangerous and difficult to navigate, the use of muragh to also create trenches around the wall to continue to protect the town and prevent further damage from being done as well as support the local economy through creating a more accessible harbor for trade.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/bristol-duties/pp84-112|title=Chapter 3: Murage, keyage and pavage {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of town walls was a communal act, ordered by the king during those times. A muragh was taken mainly on goods being imported into the town to be sold. 

The first grant of muragh began in Shrewbury's grant of 1220 at a rate of 4d. for a boatload of goods coming into the town, and then smaller derivatives for horse-loads, cows, pigs, goats, and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/murage/muressay.html#footnote13|title=The Gatehouse website essay regarding murage|website=www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many towns copied each-others muragh lists of duties once the taxes for each good were developed. Under King Henry III of England it is recorded the exact prices of all goods coming into Bristol in the Patent Roll for his 16th year of reign.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The advantages of having built a town wall on trade include the opportunity to attract traders and new consumers through the use of impressive gates to show wealth and prestige as well as limiting theft and smuggling outside of the city walls. Prestigious cities attracted more retailers and allowed the price of goods to increase. The addition of decorative doors and gates to the wall did not add to their defensive abilities, but effected the trade within the city.

The reason for the wall was primarily state defense, as the role of medieval royal government was to protect law and order and defend the state. If the town wanted to build a wall for the benefits of market regulation they must have the primary concern of defense. The royal government was often inclined to support the construction of walls because it emphasized state defense, even in cases when the tax hurt the economy. In the case of Coventry in 1370, King Edward III revoked the muragh tax due to the negative effects on the economy and moved the cost of building the wall onto the wealthier citizens of the town to continue the construction of the wall. Additional records of royal orders for England, Wales, and Ireland can be found in The Calendar of Patent Rolls.

The royal government also supported the use of muragh for having town walls because it defended their position as the defenders of the realm. The walls were built with the approval and support of the royal government with the primary goal of defending the town. This provided support for the usefulness and necessity of a central government to the citizens. The support during these times was necessary due to the walls protecting against invasion and civil uprising and war to protect the people while maintaining the integrity of the monarchy. 

The use of mural houses in Oxford allowed citizens to live rent-free or tax-free under the condition that they would repair the town wall.

== Exemptions ==
The church was exempted from the muragh tax in some cases. This was due to the church having lawyers and access to a larger amount of liberties because of their grasp in the legal system. This caused some strife when a town would continue to impose the tax on those exempt from it and was documented. Such cases include St Mary's Abbey and St Leonard's Hospital in 1257 in the town of York, where those exempt from the tax were forced to pay after experiencing difficulties in getting the exemption renewed.

== Decline ==
Following the English Civil War, the use of town gates and walls became too much of a burden. With the increased growth of urban centers and higher traffic there was a need to begin the process of demolition. Surviving gates were often lesser gates, not the main gate, due to the need for larger entrances to support more traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">The '''North American Securities Administrators Association''' ('''NASAA'''), founded in [[Kansas]] in 1919, is the oldest international investor protection organization.  NASAA is an association of state securities administrators who are charged with the responsibility to protect consumers who purchase [[securities]] or investment advice. NASAA's membership consists of 67 administrators from the territories, districts, and states of the [[United States]], from [[Mexico]], and from the provinces of [[Canada]].

In the United States, NASAA is the voice of state securities agencies responsible for efficient capital formation and grassroots investor protection.  NASAA's fundamental mission is protecting consumers who purchase securities or investment advice, and its jurisdiction extends to a wide variety of issuers and intermediaries who offer and sell securities to the public.

Through the association, NASAA members participate in multi-state enforcement actions and [[information sharing]].  NASAA also coordinates and implements training programs and education seminars for state, district, provincial, and territorial securities agency staff.  The [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam]] is written by NASAA and administered by FINRA.

Representative of the nature of its activities are its frequent warnings regarding [[investment fraud]],&lt;ref&gt;http://investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?Id=42356&amp;cat=8&amp;IdSection=8&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews=&amp;IdPub=&lt;/ref&gt; its focus on the [[tax advantage]]s of college plans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/12/09/business/chamberlin/19_22_4012_8_07.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and its involvement in [[naked short selling]] litigation aimed at the [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasaa.org/content/Files/ShortSalesComment.37990-38287.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

NASAA also provides a coordinated review process for companies using [[Regulation A]] of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] to raise capital.

Pirated movies are distributed in a variety of forms by groups such as [[Warez]] and [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|organized piracy groups]]. Within the groups, a movie is usually released in several [[file format|formats]] and different versions, because the primary sources used by a group for a particular movie may vary. Pirated movies are primarily released by these organized groups, commonly referred to as ''scene'' groups or ''warez groups''. The first release of a movie is usually of a lower quality (due to a lack of sources), and is eventually replaced with higher-quality releases as better sources become available.

== History ==
Pirated movies are usually released in several [[file format|formats]] and different versions as better sources become available. The versions are usually encoded in the popular [[file format|format]]s at the time of encoding. The sources for pirated copies have often changed with time in response to technology or [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]] measures.

=== Cams ===
[[Cam (movie piracy)|Cam]] releases were the early attempts at movie piracy which were implemented by recording the on-screen projection of a movie in a cinema. This enabled groups to pirate movies which were in their theatrical period (not released for personal entertainment). Alternative methods were sought, as these releases often suffered distinctly low quality and required undetected videotaping in movie theaters.

=== Pre-release ===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:American pie evil workprint cap.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Screenshot of the [[EViL]] workprint rip of ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'']] --&gt;
Beginning in 1998, feature films began to be released on the internet by [[warez]] groups prior to their theatrical release. These pirated versions usually came in the form of [[Video CD|VCD]] or [[Super Video CD|SVCD]]. A prime example was the release of ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This is notable for three reasons:

# It was released in an uncensored workprint format. The later theatrical release was cut down by several minutes and had scenes reworked to avoid nudity to pass [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] guidelines.
# It was released nearly two months prior to its release in theaters ([[HLN (TV channel)|CNN Headline News]] reported on its early release).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
# It was listed by the movie company as one of the reasons it released an [[Motion picture rating system|unrated]] [[DVD]] edition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

=== DVD and VOD ripping ===
==== DivX ====
In October 1999, [[DeCSS]] was released. This program allowed anyone to remove the [[Content-scrambling system|CSS]] encryption on a DVD. Although its authors only intended the software to be used for playback purposes,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} it also meant that one could decode the content perfectly for [[ripping]]; combined with the ''[[DivX]] 3.11 Alpha'' [[codec]] released shortly after, the new codec increased video quality from near [[VHS]] to almost DVD quality when encoding from a DVD source.

==== Xvid ====
The early DivX releases were mostly internal for group use, but once the codec spread, it became accepted as a standard and quickly became the most widely used format for the scene. With help from associates who either worked for a [[movie theater]], [[movie production]] company, or [[video rental]] company, groups were supplied with massive amounts of material, and new releases began appearing at a very fast pace. When version 4.0 of DivX was released, the codec went commercial and the need for a free codec, [[Xvid]] (then called "XviD", "DivX" backwards&lt;!-- needs a mention of the reason being little-endianess from `int32_t magic = "XviD"` --&gt;), was created. Later, Xvid replaced DivX entirely. Although the DivX codec has evolved from version 4 to 10.6 during this time, it is banned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2005_XViD.nfo | title=The XviD Releasing Standards 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the warez scene due to its commercial nature.

==== x264 ====
In February 2012, a consortium of popular piracy groups officially announced [[x264]], the free [[H.264]] codec, as the new standard for releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/03/superior-h-264-codec-gains-traction-among-tv-torrent-groups-is-now-the-official-standard/
| title       = H.264 Codec Now the 'Official' Standard
}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the previous format, which was Xvid wrapped in an [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] container. The move to H.264 also obsoletes AVI in favor of [[MP4]] and [[Matroska]] that most commonly uses .MKV file name extension

==== x265 (HEVC) ====
With the increasing popularity of online movie-streaming sites like Netflix, some movies are being ripped from such websites now and are being encoded in [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] wrapped in Matroska containers. This codec allows a high-quality movie to be stored in a relatively smaller file size.

== Release formats ==

Below is a table of pirated movie release types along with respective sources, ranging from the lowest quality to the highest. [[Standard (warez)|Scene rules]] define in which format and way each release type is to be packaged and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/ |title=AfterDawn Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align:center;"|Common; Quality issues make this an unpopular format
|-
|colspan="3"|A copy made in a cinema using a [[camcorder]] or mobile phone. The sound source is the camera microphone. Cam rips can quickly appear online after the first preview or premiere of the film. The quality ranges from terrible to adequate, depending on the group of persons performing the recording and the resolution of the camera used. The main disadvantage of this is the sound quality. The microphone does not only record the sound from the movie, but also the background sound in the cinema. The camera can also record movements and audio of the audience in the theater, for instance, when someone stands up in front of the screen, or when the audience laughs at a funny moment in the movie.

||Very common
|-
| colspan="3" |A [[Telesync|telesync (TS)]] is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a [[movie theater]], sometimes filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth. The main difference between a CAM and TS copy is that the audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an [[Microbroadcasting|FM microbroadcast]] provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater). Often, a ''cam'' is mislabeled as a telesync. HDTS is used to label a [[High-definition video]] recording.

| style="text-align:center;"|Very rare
|-
|colspan="3"|A copy made from an unfinished version of a film produced by the studio. Typically a workprint has missing effects and overlays, and often differs from its theatrical release. Some workprints have a time index marker running in a corner or on the top edge; some may also include a [[watermark]]. A workprint might be an uncut version, and missing some material that would appear in the final movie (or including scenes later cut).

| style="text-align:center;"|''TC''&lt;br /&gt;''HDTC''&lt;br /&gt;''TELECINE''
| style="text-align:center;"|Fairly rare
|-
|colspan="3"|A copy captured from a film print using a machine that transfers the movie from its analog reel to digital format. These were rare because telecine machines for making these prints were very costly and very large. However, they have recently become much more common. Telecine has basically the same quality as DVD, since the technique is the same as digitizing the actual film to DVD. However, the result is inferior since the source material is usually a lower quality copy reel. Telecine machines usually cause a slight left-right jitter in the picture and have inferior color levels compared to DVD. HDTC is used to label a High-definition video recording.

| style="text-align:center;"|Pay-Per-View Rip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r5dvd.com/2009/05/14/what-is-ppvrip/ |title=What is PPVRip?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| style="text-align:center;"|''PPV''&lt;br /&gt;''PPVRip''
| style="text-align:center;"|Uncommon
|-
|colspan="3"| PPVRips come from [[Pay-per-view|Pay-Per-View]] sources. All the PPVRip releases are brand new movies which have not yet been released to Screener or DVD, but are available for viewing by customers with high-end TV package deals.

||''SCR''&lt;br /&gt;''SCREENER''&lt;br /&gt;''DVDSCR''&lt;br /&gt;''DVDSCREENER''&lt;br /&gt;''BDSCR''
||Very common
|-
|colspan="3"|These are early DVD or BD releases of the theatrical version of a film, typically sent to movie reviewers, [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members, and executives for review purposes. A screener normally has a message overlaid on its picture, with wording similar to: "The film you are watching is a promotional copy. If you purchased this film at a retail store, please contact 1-800-NO-COPIES to report it." or more commonly if released for awards consideration simply, "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION." Apart from this, some movie studios release their screeners with a number of scenes of varying duration shown in [[black-and-white]]. Aside from this message, and the occasional B&amp;W scenes, screeners are normally of only slightly lower quality than a retail DVD-Rip, due to the smaller investment in DVD mastering for the limited run. Some screener rips with the overlay message get cropped to remove the message and get released mislabeled as DVD-Rips.

''Note: Screeners make a small exception here—since the content may differ from a retail version, it can be considered as lower quality than a DVD-Rip (even if the screener in question was sourced from a DVD).''
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|Digital Distribution Copy or&lt;br /&gt;Downloadable/Direct Digital Content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scenerules.org/t.html?id=VER6_MViD.nfo |title=Music_Video_Council_Rules_v6.0-MVC |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |quote="DDC" refers to Downloadable/Direct Digital Content which is not freely available}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| style="text-align:center;"|''DDC''&lt;br /&gt;''
| style="text-align:center;"| Common
|-
|colspan="3"|A digital distribution copy (DDC) is basically the same as a Screener, but sent digitally (FTP, HTTP, etc.) to companies instead of via the postal system. This makes distribution cheaper. Its quality is lower than one of a R5, but higher than a Cam or Telesync.

In the [[warez scene]] DDC refers to Downloadable/Direct Digital Content which is not freely available.
|-

| style="text-align:center;"|''R5&lt;br /&gt;R5.LINE&lt;br /&gt;R5.AC3.5.1.HQ''
| style="text-align:center;"|Very common
|-
|colspan="3"|What is known as an R5 is a studio produced unmastered telecine put out quickly and cheaply to compete against telecine piracy in Russia. The R5 tag refers to the [[DVD region 5|DVD region 5]] which consists of [[Russia]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], most of [[Africa]], [[North Korea]], and [[Mongolia]]. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they are a direct Telecine transfer of the film without any of the image processing. If the DVD does not contain an English-language audio track, the R5 video is synced to a previously released English audio track. Then a ''LiNE'' tag is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/what-does-r5-mean/ |title=What does "R5" mean? |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the sound often is not as good as DVD-Rips. To account for the lesser audio quality typically present in R5 releases, some release groups take the high quality Russian or Ukrainian 5.1 channel audio track included with the R5 DVD and modify it with audio editing software. They remove the non-English spoken portion of the audio and sync the remaining portion, which contains high quality sound effects and music with a previously recorded source of English vocals usually taken from a ''LiNE'' tagged release. The result of this process is an almost retail DVD quality surround sound audio track which is included in the movie release. Releases of this type are normally tagged ''AC3.5.1.HQ'' and details about what was done to the audio track as well as the video are present in the release notes accompanying the pirated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.cubeupload.com/lFZi4Q.png |title=Man.on.a.Ledge.2012.R5.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.5.1.HQ.Hive-CM8.nfo |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|- style="text-align:center;"
||DVD-Rip
||''DVDRip''/''DVDMux''
||Very common
|-
|colspan="3"|A final retail version of a film, typically released before it is available outside its originating [[DVD#Region codes|region]]. Often after one group of pirates releases a high-quality DVD-Rip, the "race" to release that film will stop. The release is an [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] file and uses the [[XviD]] codec (some in DivX) for video, and commonly [[mp3]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] for audio. Because of their high quality, DVD-Rips generally replace any earlier copies that may already have been circulating. [[Widescreen]] DVDs used to be indicated as WS.DVDRip.

DVDMux differs from DVDRips as they tend to use the [[x264]] codec for video, [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] codec for audio and multiplex it on a [[.mp4]]/[[.mkv]] file.
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[DVD-R]]

| style="text-align:center;"|Very common
|-
|colspan="3"|A final retail version of a film in DVD format, generally a complete copy from the original DVD. If the original DVD is released in the [[DVD-9]] format, however, extras might be removed and/or the video reencoded to make the image fit the less expensive for burning and quicker to download [[DVD-5]] format. DVD-R releases often accompany DVD-Rips. DVD-R rips are larger in size, generally filling up the 4.37 or 7.95 GiB provided by DVD-5 and DVD-9 respectively. ''Untouched'' or [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] rips in the strictest sense are 1:1 rips of the source, with nothing removed or changed, though often the definition is lightened to include DVDs which have not been transcoded, and no features were removed from the user's perspective, removing only restrictions and possible nuisances such as copyright warnings and movie previews.

| style="text-align:center;"|Extremely common
|-
|colspan="3"|TVRip is a capture source from an analog capture card (coaxial/composite/s-video connection). Digital satellite rip (DSR, also called SATRip or DTH) is a rip that is captured from a non-standard definition digital source like satellite. [[HDTV]] stands for captured source from HD television, while [[PDTV]] (Pure Digital TV) stands for any SDTV rip captured using solely digital methods from the original transport stream, not from HDMI or other outputs from a decoder, it can also refer to any standard definition content broadcast on a HD channel. [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] rips often come from free-the-air transmissions (such as digital terrestrial television). With an HDTV source, the quality can sometimes even surpass DVD. Movies in this format are starting to grow in popularity. Some advertisement and commercial banner can be seen on some releases during playback.

Analog, DSR, and PDTV sources used to be often reencoded to 512×384 if fullscreen, currently to 640x480 if fullscreen and 720x404 if widescreen. HDTV sources are reencoded to multiple resolutions such as 720x404 (360p), 960×540 (540p), 1280×720 (720p), and 1920x1080 (1080p) at various file sizes for pirated releases. They can be [[progressive scan]] captured or not ([[480i]] digital transmission or [[1080i]] broadcast for HD caps).

|- style="text-align:center;"
||VODRip
||''VODRip''&lt;br /&gt;''VODR''&lt;br /&gt;
||Uncommon
|-
|colspan="3"|VODRip stands for Video-On-Demand Rip. This can be done by recording or capturing a video/movie from an [[Video on demand|On-Demand service]] such as through a cable or satellite TV service. Most services will state that ripping or capturing films is a breach of their use policy, but it is becoming more and more popular as it requires little technology or setup. There are many online On-Demand services that would not require one to connect their TV and computer. It can be done by using software to identify the video source address and downloading it as a video file which is often the method that bears the best quality end result. However, some people have used screen cams which effectively record, like a video camera, what is on a certain part of the computer screen, but does so internally, making the quality not of HD quality, but nevertheless significantly better than a Cam or Telesync version filmed from a cinema, TV or computer screen.
|- style="text-align:center;"
||WEB-DL (P2P)
||''WEBDL''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB DL''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB-DL''&lt;br /&gt;''HDRip''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB-DLRip''
||Extremely common
|-
|colspan="3"| A file losslessly ripped from a streaming service, such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], [[Crunchyroll]], Discovery GO, [[BBC iPlayer]], etc., or downloaded via an online distribution website such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]]. The quality is quite good, since they are not reencoded. The video (H.264 or H.265) and audio (AC3/AAC) streams are usually extracted from the iTunes or Amazon Video and remuxed into a [[.mkv|MKV]] container without sacrificing quality.
An advantage with these releases is that, like BD/DVDRips, they usually have no onscreen network logos.
HDRips are typically transcoded versions of HDTV or WEB-DL source files, but may be any type of HD transcode.
|- style="text-align:center;"
||WEBRip
||''WEBRip (P2P)''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB Rip (P2P)''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB-Rip (P2P)''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB (Scene)''
||Common, WEB-DL is preferred
|-
|colspan="3"| The file is often extracted using the [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] or [[Real-Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP/E]] protocols and remuxed from a TS, MP4 or FLV container to MKV.
|- style="text-align:center;"
||WEBCap
||''WEB-Cap''&lt;br /&gt;''WEBCAP''&lt;br /&gt;''WEB Cap''&lt;br /&gt;
||Common, WEB-DL is preferred
|-
|colspan="3"| This is a rip created by capturing video from a DRM-enabled streaming service, such as Amazon Instant or [[Netflix]]. Quality can range from mediocre (comparable with low quality XVID encodes) to excellent (comparable with high quality BR encodes). Essentially, the quality of the image obtained depends on internet connection speed and the specifications of the recording machine. WEBCaps are often labeled as WEBRips, with a note attached by the encoder to let others know it was capped &amp; encoded instead of losslessly remuxed.

| style="text-align:center;"|Very Common
|-
|colspan="3"| Blu-ray or Bluray rips are encoded directly from the Bluray disc to 1080p or 720p (depending on disc source), and use the x264 or x265 codec. They can be ripped from BD25 or BD50 discs (or [[Ultra_HD_Blu-ray|UHD Blu-ray]] at higher resolutions). 

BDRips are from a Bluray disc and encoded to a lower resolution from its source (i.e. 1080p to 720p/576p/480p). 

BRRips are an already encoded video at an HD resolution, that is then [[Transcoding|transcoded]] to an SD resolution. BRRips are only from an HD resolution to a SD resolution whereas BDRips can go from 2160p to 1080p, etc as long as they go downward in resolution of the source disc. BDRips are not a transcode, but BRRips are. 

BD/BRRips in DVDRip resolutions can vary between XviD/x264/x265 codecs (commonly 700 MB and 1.5 GB in size as well as larger DVD5 or DVD9: 4.5 GB or 8.4GB), size fluctuates depending on length and quality of releases, but the higher the size the more likely they use the x264/x265 codecs. A BD/BRRip to DVDRip resolution looks better, regardless, because the encode is from a higher quality source. BDRips and BRRips are often confused with each other, but have followed the above guideline after Bluray replaced BDRip title structure in [[Warez_scene|scene]] releases.

BD5/BD9 are also available, which are similar to their counterpart DVD5/DVD9 releases. They are AVCHD compatible using the BD folder structure (sometimes called Bluray RAW), and are intended to be burnt to disk in order to play in AVCHD compatible Bluray players. More common types are complete Bluray copies (images/raw data), referred to as BD25 or BD50 which may or may not be remuxed and are never transcoded. They are commonly burnt onto Bluray discs for playback.

| BD/BRRips come in various versions: the m-720p (or mini 720p), which is a compressed version of a 720p and usually sized at around 2–3 GB; the 720p, which is usually around 4–7 GB and is the most downloaded form of BDRip; the m-1080p (or mini 1080p), which is usually a little bit larger than 720p; and the 1080p, which can be anywhere from 8 GB to as large as 40–60 GB. There are also mHD (or mini HD) versions available, which are encoded in the same resolution but at a lower bitrate and are smaller in size.

'''Richard Matthew Stallman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɔː|l|m|ən}}; born 1953), often known by his initials, '''RMS''',&lt;ref name="initials"/&gt; is an American [[free software movement]] activist and [[programmer]]. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed [[free software]]. Stallman launched the [[GNU Project]], founded the [[Free Software Foundation]], developed the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU Emacs]], and wrote the [[GNU General Public License]].

Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] composed entirely of free software.&lt;ref name="initialgnu"/&gt; With this, he also launched the [[free software movement]]. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,&lt;ref name="gcc-contribs"/&gt; the [[GNU Debugger]]&lt;ref name="RIT"/&gt; and the GNU Emacs text editor.&lt;ref name="multic"/&gt; In October 1985&lt;ref name="fsfbio"/&gt; he founded the Free Software Foundation.

Stallman pioneered the concept of [[copyleft]], which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify and distribute free software, and is the main author of [[free software license]]s which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt;

In 1989, he co-founded the [[League for Programming Freedom]]. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman had spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against [[software patent debate|software patents]], [[digital rights management]] (which he referred to as digital ''restrictions'' management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included [[End-user license agreement|software license agreements]], [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, [[Product activation|activation keys]], [[Software protection dongle|dongles]], [[Copy protection|copy restriction]], [[proprietary format]]s and [[Binary file|binary]] [[executable]]s without [[source code]].

== Early life ==
Stallman was born March 16, 1953,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} in [[New York City]], to a family of [[Jewish]] heritage.&lt;ref name="stallman-jewish-source-1"/&gt; His parents are Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker. Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as "tyrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201611/the-sorcerers-code|title=The Sorcerer's Code|publisher=Psychology Today|date=November 1, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017|author=Matthew Hutson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the [[IBM 7090#IBM 7094|IBM 7094]].&lt;ref name="mgro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Michael|title=Richard Stallman: High School Misfit, Symbol of Free Software, MacArthur-Certified Genius|url=http://mgross.com/writing/books/the-more-things-change/bonus-chapters/richard-stallman-high-school-misfit-symbol-of-free-software-macarthur-certified-genius/|work=The More Things Change|accessdate=April 9, 2014|format=interview transcript|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students.&lt;ref name="mgro"/&gt; Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the [[biology]] department at [[Rockefeller University]]. Although he was interested in mathematics and [[physics]], his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.&lt;ref name="freeasinfreedom-chap3"/&gt;

His first experience with actual computers was at the [[IBM New York Scientific Center]] when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in [[Fortran]].&lt;ref name="mgro" /&gt; He completed the task after a couple of weeks ("I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages") and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in [[APL (programming language)|APL]]&lt;ref name="Berättar"/&gt; and a [[preprocessor]] for the [[PL/I]] [[programming language]] on the [[IBM System/360]].&lt;ref name="emac6"/&gt;

=== Harvard University and MIT ===
As a first-year student at [[Harvard University]] in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in [[Math 55]].&lt;ref name="freeasinfreedom-chap4"/&gt; He was happy: "For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard."&lt;ref name="mgro"/&gt;

In 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and became a regular in the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community, where he was usually known by his initials, ''RMS'' (which he used in his computer accounts).&lt;ref name="initials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Wikipedia Revolution | author=Lih, Andrew | year=2009 | publisher=Hyperion | location=New York City | isbn=978-1-4013-0371-6 |oclc=232977686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman received a bachelor's degree in physics (''[[magna cum laude]]'') from Harvard in 1974.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stallman|first1=Richard|title=Serious Bio|url=https://www.stallman.org/biographies.html#serious|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead he decided to enroll as a graduate student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.&lt;ref name="mgro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emac6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Sam|title=Free as in freedom : Richard Stallman's crusade for free software|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Beijing|isbn=0-596-00287-4|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 6 – The Emacs Commune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under [[Gerald Jay Sussman|Gerry Sussman]],&lt;ref name="emac6"/&gt; Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI [[truth maintenance system]], called ''dependency-directed backtracking''.&lt;ref name="AI9"/&gt; This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s. {{As of|2009}}, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt; The technique of [[constraint learning|constraint recording]], wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.&lt;ref name="russell" /&gt;

As a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as [[TECO (text editor)|TECO]], [[Emacs]] for [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]], and the [[Lisp machine]] operating system (the [[CONS]] of 1974–1976 and the CADR of 1977–1979—this latter unit was commercialized by [[Symbolics]] and [[Lisp Machines, Inc.|LMI]] starting around 1980).&lt;ref name="The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih"/&gt; He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. When MIT's [[Project MAC|Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

== Events leading to GNU ==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[hacker culture]] that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing [[source code]] and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such [[proprietary software]] had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US [[Copyright Act of 1976]].&lt;ref name="Cringely"/&gt;

When [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] in 1979 placed [[Time bomb (software)|time bombs]] in the [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]] markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it "a crime against humanity".&lt;ref name="emac6"/&gt; During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user's freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software.&lt;ref name="unplugged"/&gt; Stallman's [[texinfo]] is a [[GPL]] replacement, loosely based on Scribe;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo |title=Texinfo&amp;nbsp;– GNU Documentation System&amp;nbsp;– GNU Project&amp;nbsp;– Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date=February 19, 2015 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original version was finished in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt Gnu Status], by Richard M. Stallman. 5. Documentation system. I now have a truly compatible pair of programs which can convert a file of texinfo format documentation into either a printed manual or an Info file. Documentation files are needed for many utilities., February 1986, GNU'S BULLETIN, Volume 1 No.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Stallman and some other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed [[laser printer]], the [[Xerox 9700]]. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be able to freely modify the software they use.&lt;ref name="freeasinfreedom-Chap1"/&gt;

[[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]], a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded [[Lisp Machines|Lisp Machines, Inc.]] (LMI) to market [[Lisp machine]]s, which he and [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the [[venture capital]]-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded [[Symbolics]], with the aid of [[Russ Noftsker]], an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker [[Bill Gosper]], who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab's community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

Stallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.&lt;ref name=OpenSources/&gt; The phrase "software wants to be free" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.&lt;ref name="Salus"/&gt; He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral ''value'', and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html|title=Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism|publisher=Gnu.org|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric S. Raymond]], one of the creators of the [[open-source movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/history|title=History of the Open Source Initiative|publisher=Opensource.org|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that moral arguments, rather than pragmatic ones, alienate potential allies and hurt the end goal of removing code secrecy.&lt;ref name="esr"/&gt;

In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983. Since then, he has remained affiliated with MIT as an unpaid&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mit.edu/2001/stallman-1017&lt;/ref&gt; visiting scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/888&lt;/ref&gt; Until "around 1998", he maintained an office at the Institute that doubled as his legal residence.&lt;ref name="Lifestyle"&gt;{{cite web |last=Stallman |first=Richard |year=2018 |title=Lifestyle |url=https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html |website=Richard Stallman's Personal Site |access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GNU project ==
{{main article|GNU Project}}
Stallman announced the plan for the [[GNU operating system]] in September 1983 on several [[ARPANET]] mailing lists and [[USENET]].&lt;ref name="newunix"/&gt; He started the project on his own and describes: "As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it."&lt;ref name="gnuproject"/&gt;

[[File:Richard Stallman 00.jpg|thumb|left|Stallman in 2003 at the opening ceremony of NIXAL (a [[GNU/Linux User Group|GLUG]]) at [[Netaji Subhash Engineering College]], Calcutta, India]]
In 1985, Stallman published the [[GNU Manifesto]], which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with [[Unix]].&lt;ref name="The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih"/&gt; The name GNU is a [[recursive acronym]] for "GNU's Not Unix".&lt;ref name="The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih"/&gt; Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization founded in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="DuBois"/&gt; Stallman popularized the concept of ''copyleft'', a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.

Stallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a [[text editor]] ([[Emacs]]), [[compiler]] ([[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]), [[debugger]] ([[GNU Debugger]]), and a [[build automation|build automator]] ([[GNU make]]). The notable omission was a [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon's Mach [[microkernel]] in a project called [[GNU Hurd]], which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance.

In 1991, [[Linus Torvalds]], a [[Finns|Finnish]] student, used the GNU's development tools to produce the free [[monolithic kernel|monolithic]] [[Linux kernel]]. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name ''[[Linux]]'' to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it ''GNU/Linux''. This has been a longstanding [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|naming controversy]] in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.

[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|Cover picture for [[O'Reilly Media]]'s book ''[[Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|Free as in Freedom]]'']]
Stallman's influences on hacker culture include the name [[POSIX]]&lt;ref name="PE"/&gt; and the [[Emacs]] editor. On [[Unix]] systems, GNU Emacs's popularity rivaled that of another editor [[vi]], spawning an [[editor war]]. Stallman's take on this was to canonize himself as St. IGNUcius of the [[Church of Emacs]]&lt;ref name="Takver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; and acknowledge that "vi vi vi is the [[Number of the Beast|editor of the beast]]", while "using a free version of vi is not a [[sin]]; it is a [[penance]]".&lt;ref name="faif"/&gt; On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: "Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity—but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)".&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt;

In 1992, developers at [[Lucid Inc.]] doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately [[fork (software engineering)|forked]] the software into what would become [[XEmacs]].&lt;ref name="lemacs"/&gt; The technology journalist [[Andrew Leonard]] has characterized what he sees as Stallman's uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:
{{quote|There's something comforting about Stallman's intransigence. Win or lose, Stallman will never give up. He'll be the stubbornest mule on the farm until the day he dies. Call it fixity of purpose, or just plain cussedness, his single-minded commitment and brutal honesty are refreshing in a world of spin-meisters and multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name="leonard"/&gt;}}

== Activism ==
Stallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih"/&gt; The speeches he has regularly given are titled ''The GNU Project and the Free Software Movement'',&lt;ref name="zagreb"/&gt; ''The Dangers of Software Patents'',&lt;ref name="IFSO"/&gt; and ''Copyright and Community in the Age of Computer Networks''.&lt;ref name="copyright-and-globalization"/&gt; In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes.&lt;ref name="gpl3"/&gt;

[[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized Stallman for what he considers "black-and-white thinking".&lt;ref name="black-and-white" /&gt;

Stallman's staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman ([[vrms]]), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a [[Debian]] GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree.&lt;ref name="vrms"/&gt; Stallman disagrees with parts of Debian's definition of free software.&lt;ref name="debbug"/&gt;

In 1999, Stallman called for development of a free online encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles.&lt;ref name="free-encyclopedia"/&gt; The resulting [[GNUPedia]] was eventually retired in favour of the emerging [[Wikipedia]], which had similar aims and was enjoying greater success.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

Stallman is a world traveler and has visited at least 65 countries, mostly to speak about free software and the GNU project.&lt;ref name="shaggygod"/&gt; According to Stallman, the free software movement has much in common with that of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="fsfindia"/&gt; Stallman is also highly critical of the effect that drug patents have had on developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://lawecommons.luc.edu/luclj/vol45/iss2/4/|title=Patent law is, at best, not worth keeping|first=Richard|last=Stallman|journal=Loy.

[[File:NicoBZH - Richard Stallman (by-sa) (10).jpg|thumb|left|Stallman giving a speech on "Free Software and Your Freedom" at the ''biennale du design'' of Saint-Étienne (2008)]]
In [[Venezuela]], Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state's oil company ([[PDVSA]]), in municipal government, and in the nation's military. In meetings with [[Hugo Chávez]] and in public speeches, Stallman criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and privacy.&lt;ref name="chavez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chavezthreat"/&gt; Stallman was on the Advisory Council of Latin American television station [[teleSUR]] from its launch&lt;ref name="chaveztv"/&gt; but resigned in February 2011, criticizing pro-Gaddafi propaganda during the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="politics-feb"/&gt;

In August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of [[Kerala]], he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to a free software operating system.&lt;ref name="kerala"/&gt;

After personal meetings, Stallman obtained positive statements about the free software movement from the then-president of India, [[A.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;J. Abdul Kalam]],&lt;ref name="president-india"/&gt; French 2007 presidential candidate [[Ségolène Royal]],&lt;ref name="stallman-royal"/&gt; and the president of Ecuador [[Rafael Correa]].&lt;ref name="latin-america"/&gt;

On November 30, 2012, Stallman gave the opening lecture at the Goiano Free Software Forum in Brazil, talking about successful cases of switching to free software in government, business and at universities.&lt;ref name="AquareladoBrasil"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionatan Simioni |url=http://www.diolinux.com.br/2012/11/9-forum-goiano-de-software-livre.html |title=9º Fórum Goiano de Software Livre &amp;#124; Richard Stallman estará lá - Diolinux - Notícias, Tutoriais e Games para Linux |publisher=Diolinux.com.br |date=November 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman has participated in protests about software patents,&lt;ref name="kpoe"/&gt; [[digital rights management]],&lt;ref name="mpaa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="protest-france"/&gt; and [[proprietary software]].

Protesting against proprietary software in April 2006, Stallman held a "Don't buy from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], enemy of your freedom" placard at a speech by an ATI representative in the building where Stallman worked, resulting in the police being called.&lt;ref name="protest-ati"/&gt; ATI has since merged with [[AMD]] Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community.&lt;ref name="amd-open"/&gt;

In response to [[Apple Inc|Apple]]'s [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[look and feel]] lawsuits against [[Microsoft]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 1988, Stallman called for a boycott of Apple products on the grounds that a successful look-and-feel lawsuit would "put an end to free software that could substitute for commercial software".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html#SEC9 |title=GNU's Bulletin, vol. 1 no. 5 - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation |publisher=Gnu.org |date=June 11, 1988 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott was lifted in 1995, which meant the FSF started to accept [[patch (computing)|patches]] to GNU software for Apple operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull18.html#SEC13 |title=GNU's Bulletin, vol. 1 no. 18 - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman working on his Lemote Machine.JPG|thumb|Stallman using his [[Lemote]] machine at [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]], Chennai]]
Stallman has characterized [[Steve Jobs]] as having a "malign influence" on computing because of Jobs' leadership in guiding Apple to produce [[closed platform]]s.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jobs"/&gt; In 1993, while Jobs was at [[NeXT]], Jobs asked Stallman if he could distribute a modified GCC in two parts, one part under GPL and the other part, an [[Objective-C]] preprocessor under a proprietary license. Stallman initially thought this would be legal, but since he also thought it would be "very undesirable for free software", he asked a lawyer for advice. The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be "subterfuges" and would be very harsh toward them, and a judge would ask whether it was "really" one program, rather than how the parts were labeled. Therefore, Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs' plan was not allowed by the GPL, which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective-C front end under GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL |title=I hate to have to play this role with a fellow hacker, but... |publisher=Clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Jobs' death, he said, "As Chicago Mayor [[Harold Washington]] said of the corrupt former Mayor [[Richard J. Daley|Daley]], 'I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone.'"&lt;ref name="Jobs"/&gt;

Stallman's remark stirred up accusations of being in bad taste, while [[Eric S. Raymond]], author of ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'', observed that Stallman's statement was not personal, but was simply criticizing [[Walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]].&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

For a period of time, Stallman used a notebook from the [[One Laptop per Child]] program. Stallman's computer is a refurbished [[ThinkPad T series|ThinkPad T400s]] with [[Libreboot]], a free [[BIOS]] replacement, and the GNU/Linux distribution [[Trisquel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html|title=How I do my Computing|website=stallman.org|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the ThinkPad T400s, Stallman used a Thinkpad X60 with Libreboot and Trisquel GNU/Linux&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410035339/https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html|title=How I do my Computing|date=2016-04-10|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. And before the X60, Stallman used the [[Lemote]] Yeeloong [[netbook]] (using the same company's [[Loongson]] processor) which he chose because, like the X60 and the T400s, it could run with free software at the [[BIOS]] level, stating "freedom is my priority. I've campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I am not going to surrender that freedom for the sake of a more convenient computer."&lt;ref name="usesthis" /&gt; Stallman's Lemote was stolen from him in 2012 while in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="argentina" /&gt; Before Trisquel, Stallman has used the [[gNewSense]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |title=An interview with Richard Stallman |publisher=Richard.stallman.usesthis.com |date=January 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=GNU/Linux Meeting 2014: Richard Stallman è approdato a Palermo | language=Italian | url=http://www.html.it/articoli/gnulinux-meeting-2014-richard-stallman-e-approdato-a-palermo/ | website=HTML.it | date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright reduction ===
Stallman has regularly given a talk entitled "Copyright vs. Community" where he reviews the state of digital rights management (DRM) and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF [[Defective by Design]] campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a "reduced copyright" and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on [[cubic root]]s of their popularity to ensure that "fairly successful non-stars" receive a greater share than they do now (compare with [[private copying levy]] which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous [[micropayment]] system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies should be considered a copyright violation.&lt;ref name="tech-help-share"&gt;{{cite web

Stallman has also helped and supported the [[International Music Score Library Project]] in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007, following a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[Universal Edition]].&lt;ref name="IMSLP"/&gt;

[[File:Richard M Stallman Swathanthra 2014 kerala.jpg|thumb|left|Stallman at [[Swatantra 2014]], a conference organized by [[ICFOSS]] in Kerala, India]]
Stallman mentions the dangers some [[e-books]] bring compared to paper books, with the example of the [[Amazon Kindle]] [[e-reader]] that prevents the copying of e-books and allows Amazon to order automatic deletion of a book. He says that such e-books present a big step backward with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story "[[The Right to Read]]" provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded. He objects to many of the terms within typical [[end-user license agreement]]s that accompany e-books.&lt;ref name="elpais-leysinde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMSLP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebook"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://gnu.org/philosophy/the-danger-of-ebooks.en.html |title = The Danger of E-Books |author = Richard Stallman |publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]] |date = 2011–2013 |accessdate = March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman discourages the use of several storage technologies such as DVD or [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] video discs because the content of such media is encrypted. He considers manufacturers' use of encryption on non-secret data ([[User operation prohibition|to force the user to view certain promotional material]]) as a conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html | title = Why Upgrade to GPLv3 | last1 = Stallman | first1 = Richard | website = GNU Project | publisher = Free Software Foundation | accessdate = October 16, 2014 | quote = Under the [DMCA] and similar laws, it is illegal ... to distribute DVD players unless they restrict the user according to the official rules of the DVD conspiracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He recognized the [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal]] to be a criminal act by Sony. Stallman supports a general boycott of [[Sony]] for its [[Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz|legal actions against George Hotz]].&lt;ref name="Sony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/sony |title=Boycott Sony |publisher=Defectivebydesign.org |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallman has suggested that the United States government may encourage the use of [[software as a service]] because this would allow them to access users' data without needing a [[search warrant]].&lt;ref name="chromeos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nochrome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston-review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="examples"/&gt;

He denies being an [[anarchist]] despite his wariness of some legislation and the fact that he has "advocated strongly for user privacy and his own view of software freedom".&lt;ref name="pro-state gland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2900305/opensource-subnet/stallman-joins-the-internet-talks-net-neutrality-patents-and-more.html|title=Stallman joins the Internet, talks net neutrality, patents and more|date=March 23, 2015|publisher=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance resistance ===
Stallman professes admiration for [[whistleblower]]s [[Julian Assange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/nsa-privacy-snowden-stallman-130/ |title='Join fight for privacy now!' Stallman on Snowden &amp; how to escape surveillance |website=RT News |date=July 17, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Snowden]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rwwhxWH1sgb1ZdYQycTuWO/Richard-Stallman-surveillance-is-incompatible-with-democrac.html |title=Richard Stallman: surveillance is incompatible with democracy |publisher=Livemint.com |date=January 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he advocates for Snowden in a prefix at the beginning of each of his emails, which can be found in several mailing lists, after Snowden leaked the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] scandal in 2013: "To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example."

== Terminology ==
[[File:Richard Stallman by gisleh 01.jpg|thumb|Stallman in costume as St. IGNUcius ([[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], [[Tunisia]], 2012)]]
Stallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say ''free software'' and ''GNU/Linux'', and to avoid the terms ''intellectual property'' and ''[[Copyright infringement of software|piracy]]'' (in relation to copyright). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.&lt;ref name="linux gnu"/&gt;

Stallman argues that the term ''intellectual property'' is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of [[copyright]], [[patent]], [[trademark]], and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar.&lt;ref name="torino"/&gt; He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing:
{{quote|These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas&amp;nbsp;– a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.&lt;ref name="mirage"/&gt;}}

An example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:
{{quote|I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).&lt;ref name="athens"/&gt;}}

=== Rejections ===
==== Open source for free software ====
His requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology, are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the free software and [[open-source community|open-source communities]].

After initially accepting the concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiemann |first=Michael |title=History of the OSI |publisher=Open Source Initiative |accessdate=April 16, 2014 |url=http://www.opensource.org/history |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412040818/http://opensource.org/history |archivedate=April 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman rejects a common [[alternative terms for free software|alternative term]], ''[[open-source software]]'', because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: [[freedom (political)|freedom]].&lt;ref name="free-open"/&gt; He wrote, "Free software is a political movement; open source is a development model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Open |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he believes that the use of the term will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom.&lt;ref name="why-open"/&gt; Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are ''software libre'' and ''unfettered software'', but ''free software'' is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term ''[[proprietary software]]'' rather than ''[[closed-source software]]'', when referring to software that is not free software.

==== Linux for the GNU Project ====
{{main article|GNU/Linux naming controversy}}
Stallman asks that the term ''GNU/Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|ɡ|n|uː|_|s|l|æ|ʃ|_|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ə|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|SLASH|_|LIN|əks}}, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the Linux kernel. Stallman refers to this operating system as "a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer".&lt;ref name="linux gnu"/&gt; He claims that the connection between the GNU project's philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.&lt;ref name="in-a-name"/&gt; Starting around 2003, he began also using the term ''GNU+Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|ɡ|n|uː|_|p|l|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ə|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|PLUS|_|LIN|əks}}, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase ''GNU/Linux'' as {{IPAc-en|ɡ|n|uː|_|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ə|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|LIN|əks}}, which would erroneously imply that the Linux kernel is maintained by the GNU project.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Personal life ==
Stallman has said that he is "an atheist of [[Jewish]] ancestry"&lt;ref name="stallman-jewish-source-1"/&gt; and often wears a button that reads "Impeach God".&lt;ref name="freeasinfreedom-chap4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Proulx"/&gt;

Stallman refers to mobile phones as "portable surveillance and [[Mobile phone tracking|tracking devices]]",&lt;ref name="gpl3-22june"/&gt; refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software.&lt;ref name="infoweek"/&gt; He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building&lt;ref name="shaggygod"/&gt; since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, with the exception of a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites: the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, and then the script emails the user the web page content.&lt;ref name="stallman-computing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strawmen"/&gt; More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], except for [[Wikipedia]] (which generally disallows editing from Tor).&lt;ref name="SchuesslerInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchuesslerNewspaper"/&gt;

Stallman is openly [[childfree]].{{r|Stallman, Why It Is (2012)}} He has urged others to not have children, viewing it as objectionable for reasons centered on family tensions and overpopulation.{{r|Stallman, Why It Is (2012)}} He argues that not having children better liberates people to find more productive ways to "make a positive contribution to the world".{{r|Stallman, Why It Is (2012)}}

Stallman resides in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Lifestyle"/&gt;

Barton was also a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] (1884–85), mayor of Winchester from 1899 to 1903, and sat as chair or president on several state and local organizations.&lt;ref name = "handley"/&gt; His term as president of The [[Virginia Bar Association]] was 1892-93.&lt;ref name="VBA" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vba.org/history.htm|title= VBA History and Heritage|publisher=The Virginia Bar Association|accessdate=March 7, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142907/http://www.vba.org/history.htm |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made president of the Farmers and Merchants National Bank of Winchester in 1902.&lt;ref name = "herring"/&gt;

Barton married twice, first to Katie Knight (1868) and then to Gertrude W. Baker (1890). He had two children with Gertrude. He was buried in Mt. Hebron cemetery.&lt;ref name = "handley"/&gt;

The '''second-parent adoption''' or '''co-parent adoption''' is a process by which a marriage partner can [[Adoption|adopt]] her or his partner's biological or adoptive child without terminating the first legal parent's rights. This issue is of significant importance in the context of the [[LGBT adoption]].

In the United States, second-parent adoption was started by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] (formerly the Lesbian Rights Project) in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nclrights.org/publications/adptn0204.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[California]] (2003 &lt;ref&gt;''Sharon S. v.

Snyder|was struck down]] by the [[Supreme Court]] in 2015. 

Courts in many other states have also granted second-parent adoptions to same-sex couples, though there is no statewide law or court decision that guarantees this.  In fact, courts within the same state but in different jurisdictions often contradict each other in practice. {{cn|date=December 2017}}

The [[American Medical Association]]  supported second parent adoption by same-sex partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.shtml|title=H-60.940 Partner Co-Adoption, H-65.973 Health Care Disparities in Same-Sex Partner Households "AMA Policy regarding sexual orientation"|publisher=Ama-assn.org|accessdate=16 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019042918/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|archivedate=19 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that lack of formal recognition can cause health-care disparities for children of same-sex parents.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] supports second parent adoption. &lt;ref name="aap-position"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Coparent or second-parent adoption by same-sex parents | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 339–40 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11826219 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=11826219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Policy Statement—AAP publications retired and reaffirmed | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 845 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19651598 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2009-1415 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=19651598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs of [[Slovenia]] stated that the existing law allows for [[second-parent adoption]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policy.hu/takacs/pdf-lib/Confronting_Homophobia_in_Europe-the_book.pdf |title=Confronting Homophobia in Europe |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/first-adoption-by-gay-partner-of-child-s-parent|title=First Adoption by Gay Partner of Child's Parent|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sloveniatimes.com|language=|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[LGBT adoption and parenting in Australia]], {{as of|2008}}, the best option was to apply to the [[Family Court of Australia]] for a parenting order, as ‘other people significant to the care, welfare and development’ of the child. It provides an important "status quo" if the birth mother were to die, preventing other family members from taking immediate custody of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Same Sex, Same Entitlements |publisher=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission |url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/human_rights/samesex/report/Ch_5.html |accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is second parent adoption possible in Australia? |publisher=Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Lobby |url=http://www.glrl.org.au/issues/relationship_qa.htm#Q4_1 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719183625/http://www.glrl.org.au/issues/relationship_qa.htm%23Q4_1 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Vaidhyanatha, is a Tamil Brahmin, who was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], and attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], earning a BA in History in 1994 and a Ph.D. in 1999 in American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas Exes Alumni Directory'', by The Texas Exes.  Dallas, Texas: PCI The Data Company, 2006, page 1388.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 through the summer of 2007 he worked in the Department of Culture and Communication at [[New York University]], the School of Library and Information Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1988 through 1993 he was a professional journalist working for several Texas daily newspapers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Critical Information Studies==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2010}}
Critical Information Studies is a term coined by Siva Vaidhyanathan in 2006 to describe an emerging, transdisciplinary field concerned broadly with the politics of information in contemporary, connected societies.  It first appeared in print in an essay he authored entitled, "Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto," which was the afterword to a 2006 special issue of the journal '' [[Cultural Studies]].''&lt;ref name="Vaidhyanathan 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Afterword: Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto | author=Vaidhyanathan, Siva | journal=Cultural Studies | year=2006 | volume=20 | issue=2-3 | pages=292–315 | doi=10.1080/09502380500521091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaidhyanathan has argued that academics from many fields associated with what he calls "Critical Information Studies" (which synthesizes, yet also goes beyond, key aspects of both [[Cultural Studies]] and [[Political Economy]]) should be engaged in interrogating the "structures, functions, habits, norms, and practices" of particular aspects of information culture and in analyzing how these issues go beyond simple arguments about digital "rights" to include consideration of the more subtle impacts of cost and access that have the potential for [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]]s on a "semiotic democracy" that is situated in "global flows of information."

Many of those affiliated with the field have been critical voices in professional organizations such as the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] and the [[American Library Association]] who are concerned about how computer architecture may limit the possibilities of what [[Henry Jenkins]] has called "[[participatory culture]]."  Rather than accept utopian enthusiasms about "[[Web 2.0]]" uncritically, these scholars point to possible vulnerabilities in democratic institutions posed by Digital Rights Management, tampering with electronic voting, and otherwise trusting private corporations with public information infrastructure.
[[File:Siva Vaidhyanathan at Georgetown.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
According to Vaidhyanathan, Critical Information Studies is defined by four principal concerns:

{{quote|
* the abilities and liberties to use, revise, criticize, and manipulate cultural texts, images, ideas, and information;
* the rights and abilities of users (or consumers or citizens) to alter the means and techniques through which cultural texts and information are rendered, displayed, and distributed;
* the relationship among information control, property rights, technologies, and social norms; and
* the cultural, political, social, and economic ramifications of global flows of culture and information.}}

Vaidhyanathan goes on to argue that Critical Information Studies is "inchoate."  Rather than an established field in its own right, it is one that is beginning to take shape and gain its own sense of identity.  His essay therefore provides a detailed "taxonomy" of work which, though coming from disparate disciplines, could justifiably be included under this new rubric.  These disciplines include American Studies, Anthropology, Communication, Computer Science, Cultural Studies, Ethnic Studies, Legal Studies, Library and Information Science, Literary Studies, Media Studies, Musicology, Political Science, and Sociology.  Because work in Critical Information Studies cuts across these and other more traditional academic domains, Vaidhyanathan describes it as a "transfield."

Although Vaidhyanathan identifies Critical Information Studies as a scholarly practice, he also stresses its strong commitment to public engagement.

{{Politics of Rhodesia}}
The '''Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly''' was the [[legislature]] of [[Southern Rhodesia]] from 1924 to 1970.

==Background==
In 1898, the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council]], Southern Rhodesia's first elected representative body, was founded. Much of the decisions regarding the administration of [[Southern Rhodesia]] was made by the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC). When BSAC rule was terminated in 1923 and Responsible Government achieved, the Legislative Council was replaced by the Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;Rasmussen, K. &amp; Rubert, S. (1990) ''Historical Dictionary of Zimbabwe'', The Scarecrow Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Constitution, there was provision for the establishment of an [[upper house]] to be known as the Legislative Council, but none was ever established, meaning that the Legislative Assembly remained a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jun/22/southern-rhodesia Southern Rhodesia], ''[[Hansard]]'', HC Deb 22 June 1961 vol 642 cc1696-739&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franchise==
Modelled after the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; the Assembly had limitations placed on its powers of legislation, as the [[British Crown]] reserved the right to block legislation and allowed only legislation on internal matters to be discussed in the parliament.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; 

The [[Letters Patent]] granting the colony the right to self-government in 1923 made no change to the pre-existing franchise. The law provided that voters must have been resident in [[Southern Rhodesia]] for at least six months, and have the ability to complete the claim form for the electoral register in their own handwriting if the registrar required, and to write from dictation 50 words in the [[English language]]. In addition, voters had to meet one of three criteria for their financial means: either occupy property worth £150 in their Electoral District, or own a registered mining claim within the colony (for which residence was not required), or receive annual salary of £100 in the colony.

==Electoral procedure==
No change was made to the basic electoral procedure, which continued to be the [[first past the post]] system, cast by means of the [[secret ballot]].

==Electoral districts==
The Letters Patent created a Legislative Assembly with 30 members, and for simplicity the 15 electoral districts set the previous year for the Legislative Council were used for the new assembly, but with each district returning two members. Voters were therefore entitled to two votes. Until 1961 there were technically no restrictions on the ability for native Africans to vote, but a high property qualification ensured that few were entitled to vote.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; This was altered in 1958, when a special voters' roll was created for Africans, although Africans were limited to voting for 15 Assembly members while Europeans were entitled to elect 50 members.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

==Election results==
The following table reflects only those members elected from general roll electoral divisions.

On the 27th of June 2017, t411 was shut down in a joint operation by French and Swedish police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2017/06/27/le-site-de-telechargement-t411-ferme-a-la-suite-d-une-descente-de-la-police-suedoise_5151816_4408996.html|title=Les autorités françaises font fermer le site de téléchargement T411|last=Leloup|first=Morgane Tual, Martin Untersinger et Damien|date=2017-06-27|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-06-27|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/t411-frances-most-visited-torrent-site-has-disappeared-170627/|title=T411, France's Most-Visited Torrent Site, Has Been Shut Down - TorrentFreak|date=2017-06-27|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2006 a BitTorrent tracker named QuebecTorrent&lt;ref name="branchezvous" /&gt; (in reference to [[Quebec]]) was created. In July 2008, QuebecTorrent was shut down by the Canadian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zataz.com/news/17424/QuebecTorrent.com.html « QuebecTorrent.com n'est plu »] on [[Zataz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being shut down a clone of the original website was created and named Torrent411. Torrent411 was developed by part of the team that created QuebecTorrent and they maintain the website, torrents, and members.&lt;ref name="adviso" /&gt;&lt;ref name="branchezvous"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.branchez-vous.com/techno/actualite/2008/07/quebectorrent_en_malaisie.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121203956/http://www.branchez-vous.com/techno/actualite/2008/07/quebectorrent_en_malaisie.html|title=QuebecTorrent devient Torrent411|archivedate=21 November 2011|work=branchez-vous.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leblogueduql.org/2008/07/quebectorrent-r.html « QuebecTorrent renaît de ses cendres »] on leblogueduql.org&lt;/ref&gt; The website's slogan is "Les pages jaunes du torrent",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torrent411.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221047/http://www.torrent411.com/|title=Torrent411.com - Les Pages Jaunes du Torrent!|archivedate=27 August 2008|work=torrent411.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The Yellow Pages of the Torrent" in English; the 411 in Torrent411 refers to the "White Pages" telephone directory information number in [[Canada]].

In August 2011 Torrent411 moved to the new domain name t411.me to avoid possible censure by [[VeriSign]], the US company that manages the .com top-level domain.

In June 2013, T411 had surpassed 5 million members,&lt;ref name="sts"&gt;
According to statistics from t411.me&lt;/ref&gt; confirming its position as the first francophone tracker.

On October 29, 2014, the site suffered a massive [[DDOS attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.t411.me/news/238|title=Maintenance du tracker|access-date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2015, t411.me becomes t411.io in response to a threat of blocking the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.numerama.com/magazine/32295-t411-change-de-nom-de-domaine.html|title=T411 change de nom de domaine|author=Julien L.|date=21 February 2015|editor=[[Numerama]]|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2015, a French court ordered the French [[DNS]] providers to block t411.me, following a complaint from the SCPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.nextinpact.com/news/93110-pourquoi-producteurs-disques-veulent-bloquer-t411-me.htm|title=Pourquoi les producteurs de disques veulent bloquer t411.me|author=Marc Rees|date=18 February 2015|editor=[[Next INpact]]|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.numerama.com/magazine/32696-bittorrent-t411-sera-bloque-en-france.html|title=BitTorrent : T411 sera bloqué en France|author=Julien L.|date=3 April 2015|editor=[[Numerama]]|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2017, t411 was shut down in a joint operation by French and Swedish police.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">The Johannesburg Beth Din is the [[Beth Din]] (Court of Jewish Law) of the [[Union of Orthodox Synagogues]] of [[South Africa]] it serves Jews throughout South Africa, and other countries on the continent. 

The focus of Beth Din is on areas of family law, divorce and conversion, as well as adjudication of financial disputes. Other areas supervised by the Beth Din are: [[Brit milah|Circumcision]], [[Sofer|Stam]], [[Mikveh|Mikvaot]] and [[Eruv|Eruvin]].

In 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a cherem (excommunication edict) against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by The Johannesburg Beth Din. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bregmans.co.za/court-upholds-jewish-orthodox-right-of-excommunication/|title=Court upholds Jewish Orthodox right of excommunication - Bregmans|date=2014-05-08|work=Bregmans|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, because of its potential implications with regard to the interaction of religious and state law, elicited global interest.
