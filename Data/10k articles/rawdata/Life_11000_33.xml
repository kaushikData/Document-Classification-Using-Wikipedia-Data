'''aaajiao''' （aka.Xu Wenkai） ({{zh|c= 徐文恺}}), is the online handle of Xu Wenkai,  a Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist, avid blogger and free thinker.

Born in 1984, aaajiao grew up in Xi’an, the ancient capital of Qin and Han Dynasty known for the Terracotta Army. The year of 1984, coinciding with [[George Orwell]]’s dystopian masterpiece, seems to explain the perfect alignment between the vivid SciTech-driven imagination and the sometimes-poetic sophistication, frequently seen as the main theme of aaajiao’s work. Many of aaajiao’s works tap into the most current trends of thoughts around the Internet sphere, with a focus on the emerging controversies and phenomenon related to data processing, blogsphere/wemedia and filtered information. In his most recent projects, the artist has adopted a more extended scope of practices, borrowing elements from architecture, electronic music, performance arts, product design, even medicine, to portray the young generation harnessing the power of cyber technology and the ever-present social media.

Being one of the most frequently exhibited Chinese new media artists, aaajiao has been featured in both international and domestic scenes. Highlights include: “Global Control And Censorship - [[ZKM]] | Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe(2015)”, The 2nd “CAFAM Future” Exhibition: Observer-Creator · The Reality Representation of Chinese Young Art Beijing, CAFA Art Museum (2015); Cosmos - Limited and Limitless, Existence and Co-existence Shanghai, 21st Century Minsheng Art Museum (2014),Thingworld - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2014),The West Bund Architecture and Contemporary Art Biennale, Shanghai (2013); “One World” Exposition – Chinese Art in the Age of the New Media, Videotage, TransLife: Media Art China 2011 - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2011),Hong Kong (2011); [[Transmediale]], Berlin (2010), etc. aaajiao is a winner of the Jury Prize from Art Sanya Awards 2014, a nominee of OCAT – Pierre Huber Art Prize, and most recently, a nominee of the “Young Artist of the Year” of 9th “Award of Art China”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">'''Action-specific perception''', or '''perception-action''', is a [[psychology|psychological]] [[theory]] that people [[perception|perceive]] their environment and events within it in terms of their ability to act.&lt;ref name="Witt2011"&gt;Witt, J. K. (2011).  Action's effect on perception. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proffitt, D. R. (2006).  Embodied perception and the economy of action.  ''Perspectives on Psychological Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, softball players who are hitting better see the ball as bigger.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, J. K., &amp; Proffitt, D.R. (2005).  See the ball, hit the ball: Apparent ball size is correlated with batting average.  ''Psychological Science'', ''16'', 937-938.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tennis players see the ball as moving slower when they successfully return the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, J. K., &amp; Sugovic, M. (2010).  Performance and ease influence perceived speed.  ''Perception, 39'', 1341-1353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the perceiver's intention to act is also critical; while the perceiver's ability to perform the intended action influences perception, the perceiver's abilities for unintended actions have little or no effect on perception.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, J. K., Proffitt, D. R., &amp; Epstein, W. (2010).  How and when does action scale perception?  ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 36'', 1153-1160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Action-specific effects have been documented in a variety of contexts and with a variety of manipulations.&lt;ref name = Witt2011/&gt;  The original work was done on perceived slant of hills and perceived distance to targets. Hills look steeper and targets look farther away when wearing a heavy backpack.&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, M., &amp; Proffitt, D. R. (1999). Visual-Motor recalibration in geographical slant perception. ‘'Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception &amp; Performance, 25'', 1076-1096.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proffitt, D.R., Stefanucci, J., Banton, T., &amp; Epstein, W. (2003). The role of effort in perceiving distance. ‘'Psychological Science, 14'', 106-112.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to walking, many other actions influence perception such as throwing, jumping, falling, reaching, grasping, kicking, hitting, blocking, and swimming.  In addition to perceived slant and perceived distance, other aspects of perception are influenced by ability such as size, shape, height, and speed.  These results have been documented in athletes such as softball players, golfers, tennis players, swimmers, and people skilled in [[parkour]].

==Background==
The action-specific perception account has roots in [[James J. Gibson|Gibson's]] (1979) [[Affordance#As action possibilities|ecological approach to perception]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. J. (1979). ''The ecological approach to visual perception'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gibson, the primary objects of perception are [[affordance]]s, which are the possibilities for action.  Affordances capture the mutual relationship between the environment and the perceiver.  For example, a tall wall is a barrier to an elderly person but affords jumping-over to someone trained in parkour, or urban climbing.  Like the ecological approach, the action-specific perception account favors the notion that perception involves processes that relate the environment to the perceiver's potential for action.  Consequently, similar environments will look different, depending on the abilities of each perceiver. Since abilities change over time, an individual's perception of similar environments will also change as their abilities change.

==Criticisms==
The claim that activity and intention influence perception is controversial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  These findings challenge traditional theories of perception, nearly all of which conceptualize perception as a process that provides an objective and behaviorally-independent representation of the environment.{{Attribution needed|date=April 2011}} The fact that the same environment looks different depending on the perceiver's abilities and intentions implies that perception is not behaviorally-neutral.

Alternative explanations for apparent action-specific effects have been proposed, most commonly that the perceiver's ability affects the perceiver's judgment about what they see, rather than affecting perception itself.  In other words, perceivers see the world similarly but then report their impressions differently.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis J M, Philbeck J W, (2008). Measuring spatial perception with spatial understanding and action”, in ''Embodiment, Ego-Space, and Action'' Eds. R L Klatzky, B MacWhinney, M Behrmann (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press) pp. 1–44, here: p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Perception cannot be measured directly.  Instead, researchers must rely on reports, judgments, and behaviors.  However, many attempts have been made to resolve this issue.  One technique is to use many different kinds of perceptual judgments.&lt;ref name = Witt2011/&gt;  For example, action-specific effects have been found when verbal reports and visual matching tasks.{{clarify|date=December 2012}} Action-specific effects are also apparent with indirect measures such as perceived parallelism as a proxy for perceived distance.  Action-specific effects have also been found when using action-based measures such as [[Blindwalking]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4560">An '''active ingredient''' ('''AI''') is the [[ingredient]] in a [[pharmaceutical drug]] or [[Pesticide|pesticide]] that is [[biological activity|biologically active]]. The similar terms '''active pharmaceutical ingredient''' ('''API''') and '''bulk active''' are also used in medicine, and the term '''active substance''' may be used for natural products.  Some medication products may contain more than one active ingredient.  The traditional word for the API is '''pharmacon''' or '''pharmakon''' (from {{lang-el|φάρμακον}}, adapted from [[pharmacos]]) which originally denoted a magical substance or drug. 

The terms '''active constituent''' or '''active principle''' are often chosen when referring to the active [[chemical substance|substance]] of interest in a plant (such as [[salicylic acid]] in [[willow]] bark or [[arecoline]] in [[areca nut]]s), because the word ''ingredient'' in many minds [[connotation|connotes]] a sense of human agency (that is, something that a person combines with other substances), whereas the [[natural product]]s present in plants were not added by any human agency but rather occurred naturally ("a plant doesn't have ingredients"). 

In contrast with the active ingredients, the inactive ingredients are usually called [[excipient]]s in pharmaceutical contexts. The main excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the [[wikt:vehicle#Noun|vehicle]]. [[Petroleum jelly|Petrolatum]] and [[mineral oil]] are common vehicles.

== Pharmaceuticals ==

The [[dosage form]] for a pharmaceutical contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is the drug itself, and [[excipient]]s, which are the substances of the tablet, or the liquid the API is suspended in, or other material that is pharmaceutically [[Inert ingredient|inert]]. Drugs are chosen primarily for their active ingredients. 

Patients often have difficulty identifying the active ingredients in their medication, and are often unaware of the notion of an active ingredient. When patients are on multiple medications, active ingredients can interfere with each other, often resulting in severe or life-threatening complications.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web| author=Lee, Dennis | author2=Marks, Jay M. (ed.) | url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18972 | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in Internet Archive--&gt; | website=[[MedicineNet]] | title=Drug Interactions: Know the Ingredients, Consult Your Physician | date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There now exist online services which can identify the active ingredient of most medications, such as the Medicines database providing information on medications available in Australia.&lt;ref name=finder&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.org.au/medicines | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in Internet Archive--&gt; | title=Medicines | publisher=[[NPS MedicineWise]] | date=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Herbal medicine ==

In phytopharmaceutical or [[herbal medicine]], the active ingredient may be either unknown or may require [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in order to achieve therapeutic goals. This leads to complications in labelling. One way manufacturers have attempted to indicate strength is to engage in [[standardization]] to a [[Biomarker|marker]] compound.  However, standardization has not been achieved yet: different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds.   For instance, [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] is often standardized to the [[hypericin]] which is now known not to be the "active ingredient" for antidepressant use.  Other companies standardize to [[hyperforin]] or both, although there may be some 24 known possible active constituents. Many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.&lt;ref&gt;1992, ''American Herbalism'' edited by [[Michael Tierra]] Crossings Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Aerdeyrn''' ({{circa|lk=no|6th}} century) was a semi-[[Welsh mythology|legendary]] [[pre-congregational saint]] of [[Wales]].
He was a descendant of [[Vortigern]], making him related to the royal house of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]].

'''Alfred Hawthorne''' "'''Benny'''" '''Hill''' (21 January 1924&lt;!--He was born on 21 January 1924. ref birth indexes for 1st quarter (Jan, Feb, Mar) 1924 reveal "Alfred H. Hill" registered Southampton - mother's maiden name "Cave". This is CORRECT - Please do not change to 1925.--&gt; – 20 April 1992) was an English comedian and actor, best remembered for his television programme ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', an amalgam of slapstick, burlesque, and ''double entendre'' in a format that included live comedy and filmed segments, with him at the focus of almost every segment. 

Hill was a prominent figure in British culture for nearly four decades. His show proved to be one of the great success stories of television comedy and was among the most-watched programmes in the UK; the audience peaked at more than 21 million in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |title=Features &amp;#124; Britain's Most Watched TV &amp;#124; 1970s |publisher=British Film Institute (BFI) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122221511/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html |archive-date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alfred Hawthorne Hill was born on 21 January 1924 in [[Southampton]], on the south coast of England. His father, Alfred Hill (later manager of a surgical appliance shop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/51126|title=Hill, Alfred Hawthorne [Benny] (1924–1992), comedian : Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - oi|author=|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=oup.com|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/51126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that mostly sold condoms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPBVO649SEI|title=Living Famously...|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125145125/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPBVO649SEI|archive-date=25 January 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and grandfather, Henry Hill, had both been circus clowns.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; After leaving school, Hill worked at [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]],&lt;ref name=sabotimes&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sabotagetimes.com/funny/the-truth-about-benny-hill/ | title=The Truth About Benny Hill | author=Collins, Andrew | work=[[Sabotage Times]] | date=16 April 2012 | accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[milkman]], a bridge operator, a driver, and a drummer before becoming assistant stage manager with a touring revue. He was [[Conscription|called up]] in 1942 and trained as a mechanic in the [[British Army]]. He served as a mechanic, truck driver, and [[searchlight]] operator in [[Normandy]] after September 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jodavidsmeyer.com/combat/military/benny-hill.htm |title=Benny Hill in WWII - British Army |publisher=CombatFan |accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later transferred to the [[Combined Services Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inspired by the "star comedians" of British [[music hall]] shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. He changed his name to "Benny" in homage to his favourite comedian, [[Jack Benny]].&lt;ref name=sabotimes/&gt;

==Career==
After the Second World War, Hill worked as a performer on radio. His first appearance on television was in 1950. In addition, he attempted a sitcom anthology, ''Benny Hill'', which ran from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played [[Nick Bottom]] in an all-star TV film production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. He also had a radio programme lasting for three series called ''Benny Hill Time'', on [[BBC Radio]]'s [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], from 1964 to 1966. It was a topical show, such as a March 1964 episode which featured James Pond, 0017, in "From Moscow with Love" and his version of "The Beatles". He played a number of characters in the series, such as Harry Hill and Fred Scuttle.

===Films and recordings===
Hill's film credits include parts in five full-length feature films including ''[[Who Done It? (1956 film)|Who Done It?]]'' (1956), ''[[Light Up the Sky! (film)|Light Up the Sky!]]'' (1960), ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'' (1965), ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968), in which he played the relatively straight role of the Toymaker, and ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969). He also made two [[Short film|short]]-subject films, ''The Waiters'' (1969) and ''Eddie in August'' (1970), the latter being a TV production. Finally, a clip-show film spin-off of his early [[Thames Television]] shows (1969–73), called ''[[The Best of Benny Hill]]'' (1974), was a theatrically released compilation of ''[[The Benny Hill Show|Benny Hill Show]]'' episodes. 

Hill's audio recordings include "[[Gather in the Mushrooms]]" (1961), "[[Pepys' Diary (song)|Pepys' Diary]]" (1961), "[[Transistor Radio (song)|Transistor Radio]]" (1961), "[[Harvest of Love]]" (1963), and "[[Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)]]", which was the [[UK Singles Chart]] Christmas number-one single in 1971.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

===''The Benny Hill Show''===
{{Main|The Benny Hill Show}}
Hill had struggled on stage and had uneven success in radio, but in television, he found a form that played to his strengths. ''The Benny Hill Show'' had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo, and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included [[Patricia Hayes]], [[Jeremy Hawk]], Peter Vernon, [[Ronnie Brody]], and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]]. Short, bald [[Jackie Wright]] was a frequent supporting player, who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.

Hill remained mostly with the BBC through to 1968, except for a few sojourns with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] station [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] between 1957 and 1960 and again in 1967. In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where it remained until cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hill's talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer, and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, [[Cherri Gilham]], to whom he wrote from Spain and told her he was using her "Fat Lady idea on the show" in January 1977).

The most common running gag in Hill's shows was the closing sequence, the "run-off", which was literally a [[running gag]] in that it featured various members of the cast chasing Hill, along with other stock comedy characters such as policemen, vicars, and old women. This was commonly filmed using "under-cranking" camera techniques, and included other comic devices such as characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, [[Boots Randolph]]'s "[[Yakety Sax]]", is so strongly associated with the show that it is commonly referred to as "The Benny Hill Theme". It has been used as a form of [[parody]] in many ways by television shows and a small number of films. The [[Wachowskis]] used the same style (and musical theme) in a scene in the film ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=V for Vendetta (2005)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd|accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date= May 2016}}. 

From the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as "Hill's Angels". They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence, or in character as foils against Hill. [[Sue Upton]] was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels.  [[Jane Leeves]] appeared, as well. [[Henry McGee]] and [[Bob Todd]] joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured "Hill's Little Angels", a group of cute children including the families of [[Dennis Kirkland]] (the show's director) and Sue Upton.

The [[alternative comedy|alternative comedian]] [[Ben Elton]] made a headline-grabbing allegation, both on the TV show ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' and in the pages of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine (in its January 1987 issue), that ''The Benny Hill Show'' was single-handedly responsible for the incidences of rape in England during the period in question, and also suggested the programme incited other acts of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v44/ai_12270127/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062641/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v44/ai_12270127 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-03-03 |title=The Benny Hill Show }} &lt;/ref&gt; A writer in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, though, opined that Elton's assault was, "like watching an elderly uncle being kicked to death by young thugs".&lt;ref&gt;Jemima Lewis [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/jemima-lewis-why-did-the-british-disown-benny-hill-479887.html "Why did the British disown Benny Hill?"] ''The Independent'', 27 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Elton later claimed his comment was taken out of context, and he appeared in a parody for ''[[Harry Enfield and Chums]]'', Benny Elton, where Elton ends up being chased by angry women, accompanied by the "Yakety Sax" theme, after trying to force them to be more feminist rather than letting them make their own decisions.

In response to the accusations of sexism, defenders of Hill have said the show used traditional comic stereotypes to reflect universal human truths in a way that was not malicious and fundamentally harmless. Hill's friend and producer [[Dennis Kirkland]] said it was the women who chased Hill in anger for undressing them, all of which was done accidentally by some ridiculous means. An article on 27 May 2006 in ''[[The Independent]]'' quoted Hill and Kirkland as saying they believed this misrepresentation demonstrated critics could not have watched his programmes.{{Citation needed|date= November 2011}}

In an episode about Hill transmitted as part of the documentary series ''Living Famously'', [[John Howard Davies]], the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, who had cancelled the show, stated  he did so for three reasons: "The audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired."{{Citation needed|date= November 2011}}

The loss of his show was devastating for Hill (or, as one former supporting player put it, "He started to die from there",{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}) and what followed was a self-inflicted decline in his health. In 1990, a new show was produced complete with Hill and his usual team, called ''Benny Hill's World Tour: New York!''.

In February 1992, Thames Television, which received a steady stream of requests from viewers for ''The Benny Hill Show'' repeats, finally gave in and put together a number of re-edited shows. Hill died on 20 April 1992, the same day that a new contract arrived in the post from [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]], for which he was to have made a series of specials. He had turned down competing offers from Carlton and Thames.

==Celebrity fans==
[[Johnny Carson]] and side-kick [[Ed McMahon]] were both fans of Hill and tried several times to get him to come to [[Los Angeles]] and be a guest on Carson's ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.  Hill always declined, citing not wanting to travel the great distance to California.

Classic comedy producer [[Hal Roach]] was a fan.  

As related on the [[BBC]] Program ''Living Famously'', Hill visited the home of [[Charles Chaplin]] after Chaplin's death.  Chaplin's son Eugene took Hill into his father's private study and showed him several Benny Hill videotapes on a shelf.  Eugene told Hill that his father was a great fan and used to watch the tapes with great enjoyment in his final years.  Hill, a major fan of Chaplin, was reportedly moved to tears&lt;ref&gt;https://https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00psqbm/episodes/guide&lt;/ref&gt; .

Radio and TV host [[Adam Carolla]] claimed that he was a fan of Hill and that he considered Hill "as American as [[the Beatles]]". Indeed, during an episode of ''[[The Man Show]]'', Carolla performed in what was billed as a tribute to "our favourite Englishman, Sir Benny Hill" (Hill was never knighted) in more risqué versions of some of the sketches. Carolla played a rude and lecherous waiter, a typical Hill role, and the sketch featured many of the staples of Hill's shows, including a [[Jackie Wright]]-esque bald man, as well as the usual scantily clad women.

[[Michael Jackson]] was a Hill fan: "I just love your Benny Hill," the young Jackson told a bemused British music-press critic during a 1970s tour, "he's so funny!" During the decline in Benny Hill's health, he was visited by Jackson, who was in the UK at the time.

The British prog-rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] may have been fans of Hill. In 1987, they filmed a video for their song "[[Anything She Does]]", featuring Benny as his character Fred Scuttle, an incompetent security guard who lets a ridiculous number of fans backstage at a Genesis concert.

In ''Benny Hill: The World's Favourite Clown'', filmed shortly before his death, celebrities such as [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Michael Caine]], [[John Mortimer]], [[Mickey Rooney]], and [[Walter Cronkite]], among others, expressed their appreciation of and admiration for Hill and his humour – and in Reynolds' case, the appreciation extended to the Hill's Angels, as well. More surprisingly, perhaps, the novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] made no secret of his admiration for Hill. Burgess, whose novels were often comic, relished language, wordplay, and dialect, admired the verbal and comedic skill that underlay Hill's success. Reviewing a biography of Hill, ''Saucy Boy'', in the ''Guardian'' in 1990, Burgess described Hill as "a comic genius steeped in the British music-hall tradition" and "one of the great artists of our age". A meeting between the two men was described in a newspaper article by Burgess and recalled in the ''Telegraph'' newspaper by the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3622509/Way-of-the-world.html|title=Way of the world|author=Craig Brown|date=21 January 2006|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, broadcaster and critic [[Garry Bushell]] launched a campaign to erect a statue of Hill in Southampton, with the support of [[Barbara Windsor]], [[Brian Conley]], and other British comedy favourites. Those taking part in the first fundraising concert included [[Neville Staple]], [[Right Said Fred]], and [[Rick Wakeman]].

In a June 2011 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'', the American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] declared himself to be a fan of Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Elizabeth, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/19/snoop-dogg-doggumentary-interview Snoop Dogg: 'Women are getting empowered.

==Personal life==
[[File:Benny Hill lived here.JPG|thumb|left|[[Blue plaque]] commemorating Benny Hill, at his former residence in [[Kensington, London]]]]

Hill never owned his own home in London, and instead preferred to rent a flat rather than buy one.&lt;ref name="everything2.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Benny+Hill|title=Benny Hill|author=|date=|work=everything2.com|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rented a double-room apartment in the [[London]] district [[Queen's Gate]] for 26 years until around 1986 when he moved to Fairwater House in [[Teddington]]. While looking for somewhere to live, he stayed at 22 Westrow Gardens in [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorialmatters.com/memorials.php?page=Alfred-Hill&amp;section=bio|title=Tribute to Alfred Hawthorne  Hill on MemorialMatters.com|author=|date=|work=memorialmatters.com|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also never owned a car, although he could drive.

Despite being a millionaire many times over, he continued with the frugal habits that he picked up from his parents, notably his father, such as buying cheap food at supermarkets, walking for miles rather than paying for a [[taxi]] unless someone picked up the tab for a [[limousine]], and constantly patching and mending the same clothes even when the balance on his account at the [[Halifax Building Society]] reached seven figures.&lt;ref name="everything2.com"/&gt; In one of his obituaries, a story was told of how he reportedly refused to mend his mother's leaky roof because it was "too expensive",{{cn|date=August 2016}} and after she died, he kept the family home in Southampton as a shrine to her and did not change a thing at all. 

Hill never married nor had children. He had proposed to two women, but neither accepted. Because of his eccentricity and reclusive lifestyle, rumours circulated that he was [[gay]], but he always laughingly denied them.&lt;ref name=neatorama.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cellania|first1=Miss|title=The Strange Life of Benny Hill|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2013/10/24/The-Strange-Life-of-Benny-Hill/|website=neatorama.com|publisher=&lt;!-- Blank --&gt;|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was a huge [[Francophile]] and enjoyed his visits to [[France]], notably to [[Marseille]], where until the 1980s, he could go to outdoor cafes anonymously, travelling on public transport and socialising with local women.&lt;ref name="neatorama.com"/&gt; He spoke [[French language|French]] fluently and also knew  basic [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="neatorama.com"/&gt;  Foreign travelling was the only luxury that he permitted himself, and even then, he would stay in modest accommodations rather than [[five-star hotel]]s.&lt;ref name="everything2.com"/&gt;

==Death==
Benny Hill's health declined in the late 1980s. After a mild heart attack on 24 February 1992, doctors told him he needed to lose weight and recommended a [[heart bypass]]. He declined, and a week later was found to have [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. He died at the age of 68 on 20 April 1992.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; On 22 April, after several days of unanswered telephone calls, his producer, Dennis Kirkland, climbed a ladder to the window of Hill's second-floor flat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/|title=The Rise, Fall, and Lonely Death of Benny Hill|author=|date=22 January 2017|website=flashbak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon seeing the body through a window, had the neighbours call the police. The police broke into the flat and found Hill, dead, sitting in his armchair in front of the television. The cause of death was recorded as [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Took|first=Barry|title=Hill, Alfred Hawthorne [Benny] (1924–1992), comedian|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51126|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's body was buried at [[Hollybrook Cemetery]] near his birthplace in Southampton on 26 April 1992. 

During the night of 4 October 1992, following speculation in the media that Hill had been buried with a large amount of gold and jewellery, grave robbers excavated the grave at Hollybrook Cemetery and broke open its coffin, the open grave's condition being found by a passer-by the following morning. After a police examination of the scene, the coffin was reclosed and the grave filled back in by cemetery workers, and as a security measure, a 1-ft-thick concrete slab was placed over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12587521.Grave_of_Benny_Hill_desecrated/|title=Grave of Benny Hill desecrated|author=|date= 5 October 1992|website=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Benny Hill.JPG|thumb|right|Wax figure of Hill]]

In 1998, [[Channel 4]] featured Hill in one of its ''Heroes of Comedy'' programmes. On 28 December 2006, Channel 4 broadcast the documentary ''Is Benny Hill Still Funny?'' The programme featured an audience that comprised a [[Cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of ''[[Little Britain]]'', ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'', and ''[[Borat]]''. The participants were asked to watch a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hill's humour from both his BBC and ITV shows. The responses and results demonstrated that none of the sample of viewers took offence at any of the sketches shown. His silent "Wishing Well" sketch was discovered to be the most popular.{{citation required|date=July 2018}}

'''''Cave of Forgotten Dreams''''' is a 2010 [[3D film|3D]] documentary film by [[Werner Herzog]] about the [[Chauvet Cave]] in southern France, which contains the oldest human-painted images yet discovered. Some of them were crafted around 32,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 124 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 29 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/movies/werner-herzogs-cave-of-forgotten-dreams-filmed-in-chauvet-cave.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Larry | last=Rohter | title=Werner Herzog's 'Cave of Forgotten Dreams,' Filmed in Chauvet Cave | date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/08/werner-herzogs-3d-cave-journey-leads-docs-premiering-at-tiff.php|title=Werner Herzog's 3D Cave Journey Leads Docs Premiering at TIFF|first=S.T.|last=VanAirsdale|date=4 August 2010|website=Movieline.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of images from inside the cave as well as of interviews with various scientists and historians.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2010/09/is-werner-herzogs-new-3d-documentary-a-huge-forward-leap-or-total-folly.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The Big Picture | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also includes footage of the nearby [[Pont d'Arc]] natural bridge.&lt;ref name="tiff"/&gt;

==Production==
Herzog's interest in the Chauvet cave was prompted by Judith Thurman's ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "First Impressions".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/23/first-impressions&lt;/ref&gt; Thurman is listed as one of the co-producers of the film.

The cave is carefully preserved and the general public is not allowed to enter. Herzog received special permission from the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] to film inside the cave.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;
Having received permission, Herzog nonetheless had to film under heavy restrictions. All people authorized to enter must wear special suits and shoes that have had no contact with the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/|title=La Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc|website=La grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc - La Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because of near-toxic levels of [[radon]] and [[carbon dioxide]], nobody can stay in the cave for more than a few hours per day.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

Herzog was allowed to have only three people with him in the cave: the cinematographer [[Peter Zeitlinger]], a sound recorder (Eric Spitzer-Marlyn), and an assistant. Herzog himself worked the lights.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The crew was allowed to use only battery-powered&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943558.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | first=Justin | last=Chang | title=Cave of Forgotten Dreams | date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment they could carry into the cave themselves,&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; and only lights that gave off no excess heat.&lt;ref name="tiff"/&gt; The 3-D cameras were custom-built for the production, and were often assembled inside the cave itself.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Herzog was allowed six shooting days of four hours each.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The crew could not touch any part of the cave's wall or floor, and were confined to a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} walkway.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

The production encountered several technical difficulties in working with the 3-D cameras in a documentary setting. At the time of production, 3-D films were typically shot on stages with heavy use of digital manipulation. Often, foreground and background elements would be shot separately and digitally composited into the finished shot. Techniques for 3-D filmmaking in natural environments with a single camera and no compositing were largely undeveloped, and had to be worked out experimentally by the crew in post-production.&lt;ref name=sabotage/&gt;

Before production of ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams'', Herzog was skeptical of the artistic value of 3-D filmmaking, and had only seen one 3-D film (James Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''). Herzog still believes that 3-D is not suited for general use in cinema, but used it in ''Cave'' to help "capture the intentions of the painters", who incorporated the wall's subtle bulges and contours into their art.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; 
The idea to use a 3-D camera for the film was first suggested by Zeitlinger, who had imagined before ever entering the cave that 3-D might be appropriate to capture the contours of the walls. Herzog dismissed the idea, believing 3-D to be (in Zeitlinger's words) "a gimmick of the commercial cinema". After visiting the cave, however, Herzog immediately decided that the film must be shot in 3-D.&lt;ref name=sabotage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/meet-the-cinematographer-who-pushed-werner-herzog-to-the-third-dimension/|title=Meet The Cinematographer Who Pushed Werner Herzog To The Third Dimension|last=Curtis|first=Lee|date=13 June 2011|publisher=[[Sabotage Times]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the production, Herzog stated that he had no plans to use 3-D again.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

==Release==
The film had its debut on 13 September 2010, at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was finished at the last minute, with only 30 minutes of footage completed on the Wednesday before its showing.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; It was the first 3-D film to screen at the festival's [[Bell Lightbox]] theatre,&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; and the digital projectors jammed only five minutes from the end, interrupting its debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/tiff/2010/2010/09/14/15347546.html|title=Projector snag hits TIFF screening|website=Torontosun.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, [[IFC Films]] announced that it had secured the rights to all US distribution of the film in a "mid-six-figure deal".&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ic5827d475c9bb43687b46432687866fb | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Gregg | last=Kilday | title=IFC Films buys Werner Herzog doc 'Cave' | date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television rights had already been owned by the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], who partially financed the film's production.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

After the film's premiere, Herzog was asked why the French Ministry of Culture, who sponsored the film, did not require its premiere to be in France. Herzog replied, "They didn't know it was finished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/outtakes/2011/04/30/the-cabinet-of-werner-herzog/|publisher=[[artinfo]]|accessdate=13 June 2011|title=The Cabinet of Werner Herzog|last=D'Arcy|first=David|date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, a trailer for ''Cave'' was released which advertised a release date of Spring 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2011/01/09/trailer-for-cave-of-forgotten-dreams-werner-herzogs-first-3d-film-appears/|title=Trailer for Cave of Forgotten Dreams, Werner Herzog's first 3D film, Appears|last=Lyus|first=Jon|date=9 January 2011|website=Heyuguys.co.uk|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2011. Also in March a second trailer was released for US distribution, which announced a US release date of 29 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefilmstage.com/2011/03/15/werner-herzogs-cave-of-forgotten-dreams-theatrical-trailer/|title=Werner Herzog's 'Cave of Forgotten Dreams' Theatrical Trailer|access-date=15 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319103028/http://thefilmstage.com/2011/03/15/werner-herzogs-cave-of-forgotten-dreams-theatrical-trailer/#|archive-date=19 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film opened on 29 April 2011, shown in the US in five theaters in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The ticket sales averaged $25,500 per theater for the opening weekend, which was Herzog's best-ever per theater opening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/2011/05/01/box_office_3-d_dreams_gives_werner_herzog_his_best_debut|title=Box Office: 3-D 'Dreams' Gives Werner Herzog His Best Debut|last=Knegt|first=Peter|date=1 May 2011|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest per theater average of any film in the US for the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&amp;yr=2011&amp;wknd=17&amp;sort=avg&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office, April&amp;nbsp;29 – May 1, 2011|date=1 May 2011|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 12 June 2011, the film had grossed $6.4 million, making it the highest-grossing independently released documentary of 2011, earning over 10 times more than the second-place film, ''[[The Last Lions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/06/independently-released-cave-of-forgotten-dreams-becomes-highest-grossing-documentary-of-2011.html|title='Cave of Forgotten Dreams' becomes highest-grossing independently released documentary of 2011|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|date=19 June 2011|publisher=[[LA Times]] Blog|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film's reception was overwhelmingly positive, currently holding a 96% critic rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 128 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cave_of_forgotten_dreams/|title=Cave of Forgotten Dreams – Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as metacritic score of 86 on the [[Metacritic]], based on 34 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cave-of-forgotten-dreams|title=Cave of Forgotten Dreams – Metacritic|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Harrison Stedman, M.D.''' (1805-1866) was one of the original founders of the first national medical society in the United States, the [[Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane]], now the [[American Psychiatric Association]].  At the time, he was superintendent of the [[Boston Lunatic Asylum]], now the [[Boston State Hospital]].

[[File:Portrait of Charles Harrison Stedman, M.D..JPG|thumb|Charles Harrison Stedman, M.D.]]

==Biography==
Stedman was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts.  He attended [[Yale University]] but did not graduate.  Later, Yale awarded him an honorary master's degree.  He attended the [[Harvard Medical School]] earning his medical degree in 1828.  For the following ten years, he was a resident surgeon at the [[Chelsea Naval Hospital]].  In 1840, he began his surgical practice in Boston.  His surgical experience may have led to his interest in [[neuroanatomy]].  In 1834, he revised [[Johann Spurzheim]]’s book, ''Anatomy of the Brain''.   Stedman noted in the book’s Preface that he revised the American edition since he believed the London translation from the original French was hurried, contained some ambiguity, and had typographical errors.

In 1839, the Boston Lunatic Asylum was opened, the first municipal asylum in the country.  Dr. John Butler was its first superintendent. Butler left in 1842 to go to the [[Hartford Retreat]].  The superintendent position at Boston was offered to and accepted by Stedman.

Stedman left the Boston Lunatic Asylum in 1851 to return to his surgical practice.  He served as a visiting then senior surgeon at the [[Boston City Hospital]] when it opened in 1864.  He served as the first medical coroner in Massachusetts.

He died in 1866.

'''Computational lithography''' (also known as '''computational scaling''') is the set of mathematical and algorithmic approaches designed to improve the resolution attainable through [[photolithography]]. Computational lithography has come to the forefront of [[photolithography]] in 2008 as the [[semiconductor industry]] grappled with the challenges associated with the transition to [[22 nanometer]] [[CMOS]] [[process technology]] and beyond.

==193 nm deep UV photolithography==

The periodic enhancement in the resolution achieved through [[photolithography]] has been a driving force behind [[Moore's Law]]. Resolution improvements enable printing of smaller geometries on an [[integrated circuit]]. The minimum feature size that a projection system typically used in [[photolithography]] can print is given approximately by:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = k_1 \cdot\frac{\lambda}{NA}&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\,CD&lt;/math&gt; is the [[minimum feature size]] (also called the '''critical dimension''').

&lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of light used.

&lt;math&gt;\,NA&lt;/math&gt; is the [[numerical aperture]] of the lens as seen from the wafer.

&lt;math&gt;\,k_1&lt;/math&gt; (commonly called ''k1 factor'') is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors.

Historically, resolution enhancements in [[photolithography]] have been achieved through the progression of [[stepper]] illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths &amp;mdash; from "g-line" (436&amp;nbsp;nm) and "i-line" (365&amp;nbsp;nm) sources based on [[mercury lamp]]s, to the current systems based on [[deep ultraviolet]] [[excimer laser]]s sources at 193&amp;nbsp;nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]] and [[x-ray lithography]], forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193&amp;nbsp;nm optical lithography systems until some form of [[next-generation lithography]] proves viable (although 157&amp;nbsp;nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each).&lt;ref name="Electronics2004"&gt;{{Citation | title = Reticle enhancement technology will extend life of 193nm litho | newspaper = Electronics Weekly | date = 2004-02-25 | url = http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2004/02/25/701/reticle-enhancement-technology-will-extend-life-of-193nm-litho-says.htm | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture have led to the use of [[immersion lithography]]. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much attention has been paid to reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as [[phase-shift photomask]]s. These techniques have enabled [[photolithography]] at the [[32 nanometer]] CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193&amp;nbsp;nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS roadmap]] calling for the [[22 nanometer]] node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22&amp;nbsp;nm technology manufacturable.&lt;ref name="Moretti2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = Moretti | first = Gabe | title = Custom litho addresses 22-nm IC manufacturing | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-10-13 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211200162 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: computational lithography.

==History ==
Computational lithography means the use of computers to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by [[Chris Mack (scientist)|Chris Mack]] at NSA in developing [[PROLITH]], Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of [[Synopsys]]) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997.&lt;ref name="TMA1997"&gt;{{Citation | title = Major US Semiconductor Maker Chooses TMA for OPC Software | newspaper = PRNewswire | pages = | date = 1997-10-16 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19915757.html | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180&amp;nbsp;nm and 130&amp;nbsp;nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, phase shift masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65&amp;nbsp;nm to 45&amp;nbsp;nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45&amp;nbsp;nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in  [[design for manufacturability (IC)|design for manufacturing]] start-up companies.&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrathDFM2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = DFM pumps up the volume | newspaper = EETimes | pages =| date = 2005-12-16 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175004316&amp;queryText=tcad&amp;printable=true&amp;printable=true | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of [[ASML Holding|ASML]]) in 2005&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrath2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = Litho simulation vendor opens Japanese subsidiary | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2005-02-12 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174900246 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions.  As 45&amp;nbsp;nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32&amp;nbsp;nm and 22&amp;nbsp;nm are expected to run on existing 193&amp;nbsp;nm scanners technology. 

Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as source mask optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major mask synthesis vendors have settled on the term "computational lithography" to describe and promote the set of mask synthesis technologies required for 22&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Techniques comprising computational lithography==
Computational lithography makes use of a number of numerical simulations to improve the performance (resolution and contrast) of cutting-edge photomasks.   The combined techniques include [[Resolution enhancement technologies|Resolution Enhancement Technology]] (RET), [[Optical Proximity Correction]] (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO), etc.&lt;ref name="LaPedus2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = LaPedus | first = Mark | title = IBM rolls 'computational scaling' for litho at 22-nm | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-09-17 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210602297 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques vary in terms of their technical feasibility and engineering sensible-ness, resulting in the adoption of some and the continual R&amp;D of others.&lt;ref name="LamWong2009"&gt;{{Citation | author = E. Lam | author2 = A. Wong | title = Computation lithography: virtual reality and virtual virtuality | journal = Optics Express | volume = 17 | pages = 12259–12268 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-17-15-12259 | doi = 10.1364/OE.17.012259 | pmid = 19654627 | issue = 15 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution enhancement technology ===
[[Resolution enhancement technologies]], first used in the [[90 nanometer]] generation, using the mathematics of [[diffraction optics]] to specify multi-layer [[phase-shift photomask]]s that use interference patterns in the photomask that enhance resolution on the printed wafer surface.

===Optical proximity correction ===
[[Optical proximity correction]] uses computational methods to counteract the effects of diffraction-related blurring and under-exposure by modifying on-mask geometries with means such as:
adjusting linewidths depending on the density of surrounding geometries (a trace surrounded by a large open area will be over-exposed compared with the same trace surrounded by a dense pattern), 
adding "dog-bone" endcaps to the end of lines to prevent line shortening, 
correcting for [[proximity effect (electron beam lithography)|electron beam proximity effects]]

OPC can be broadly divided into rule-based and model-based.&lt;ref name="opc"&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Wong | title=Resolution enhancement techniques in optical lithography | publisher=SPIE Press | year=2001 | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverse lithography technology, which treats the OPC as an inverse imaging problem, is also a useful technique because it can provide unintuitive mask patterns.&lt;ref name="sectioning"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-19-14746 | author=S.

===Complex modeling of the lens system and photoresist===
Beyond the models used for RET and OPC, computational lithographics attempts to improve chip manufacturability and yields such as by using the signature of the scanner to help improve accuracy of the OPC model:&lt;ref name="SynopsysNikon2007"&gt;{{Citation |last         = Hand |first        = Aaron |title        = Nikon and Synopsys Deliver on Advanced OPC Promise |newspaper    = Semiconductor International |year         = 2007 |date         = November 2006 |url          = http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |postscript   = &lt;!--none--&gt; |access-date  = 2010-01-15 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090809002450/http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |archive-date = 2009-08-09 |dead-url     = yes |df           = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
polarization characteristics of the lens pupil,
[[Jones calculus|Jones matrix]] of the stepper lens,
optical parameters of the [[photoresist]] stack,
diffusion through the photoresist,
stepper illumination control variables.

==A CPU-century worth of calculations or more==
The computational effort behind these methods is immense.  According to one estimate, the calculations required to adjust OPC geometries to take into account variations to focus and exposure for a state-of-the-art integrated circuit will take approximately 100 CPU-years of computer time.&lt;ref name="Wiley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wiley | first = Jim | title = Future challenges in computational lithography | newspaper = Solid State Technology

Brion Technologies, a subsidiary of [[ASML Holding|ASML]], the largest manufacturer of photolithography systems, markets a rack-mounted hardware accelerator dedicated for use in making computational lithographic calculations &amp;mdash; a mask-making shop can purchase a large number of their systems to run in parallel. Others have claimed significant acceleration using re-purposed off-the-shelf graphics cards for their high parallel throughput.&lt;ref name="Gauda2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = LaPedus | first = Mark | title = Gauda claims OPC acceleration breakthrough. | newspaper = EE Times | date = 2008-02-28 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206801681 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36261">In [[linguistics]], the '''conduit metaphor''' is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself ([[metalanguage]]). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they "insert" their [[mental content]]s (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into "containers" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then "extracted" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a "conduit" conveying mental content between people.

Defined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this [[conceptual metaphor]] refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. J. (1979). The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought'' (pp. 284–310). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-29626-9}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow linguist [[George Lakoff]] stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The contemporary theory that metaphor is primarily conceptual, conventional, and part of the ordinary system of thought and language can be traced to Michael Reddy’s now classic essay... With a single, thoroughly analyzed example, he allowed 
us to see, albeit in a restricted domain, that ordinary everyday English is largely metaphorical, dispelling once and for all the traditional view that metaphor is primarily in the realm of poetic or 'figurative' language. Reddy showed, for a single, very significant case, that the locus of metaphor is thought, not language, that metaphor is a major and indispensable part of our ordinary, conventional way of conceptualizing the world, and that our everyday behavior reflects our metaphorical understanding of experience. Though other theorists had noticed some of these characteristics of metaphor, Reddy was the first to demonstrate them by rigorous linguistic analysis, stating generalizations over voluminous examples."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff|Lakoff, G.]] (1992). The contemporary theory of metaphor (p. 204). In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought'', 2nd ed. (pp. 203–204). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-40547-5}} hardback; {{ISBN|0-521-40561-0}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
The genesis of Reddy's paper drew inspiration from work done by others in several disciplines, as well as linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 284–286&lt;/ref&gt; Research on information theory had led [[Norbert Wiener]] to publish the seminal book on cybernetics, in which he had stated, "Society can only be understood through a study of the messages and communications facilities which belong to it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Wiener|Wiener, N.]] (1954). ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings|The human use of human beings]]: Cybernetics and society'' (2nd ed.) (p. 16). Garden City, NY: Doubleday Anchor. (Also available from Da Capo Press (1988). {{ISBN|0-306-80320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social-systems theorist [[Donald Schön]] had examined the impacts of metaphorical speech on public-policy problems, putting forth the idea that people's conflicting frames of reference were often to blame for communication breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Schön|Schön, D. A.]] (1979). Generative metaphor: A perspective on problem-setting in social policy. In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought'' (pp. 137–163). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-29626-9}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;  Schön's frame-restructuring solution was similar in some ways to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s groundbreaking views on the shifting of scientific paradigms through what he called the "translation" process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, T.S.]] (1970). ''[[The structure of scientific revolutions]]'' (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-45803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;

Research within linguistics (including the controversial [[linguistic relativity|Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf, B.L.]] (1956). ''Language, thought, and reality''. Edited by J. B. Carroll. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Black]]'s arguments against it),&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Black|Black, M.]] (1962). [[Linguistic relativity]]: The views of [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]. In M. Black, ''Models and metaphors: Studies in language and philosophy''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-0041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with [[Uriel Weinreich]]'s assertion that "Language is its own metalanguage,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Uriel Weinreich|Weinreich, U.]] (1972). ''Explorations in semantic theory''. The Hague–Paris: Mouton. {{ISBN|978-90-279-2048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted Reddy to approach the conduit metaphor's exposition and its possible impact on language and thought with caution.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Reddy's paper==
* The way English speakers discuss communication depends on the semantics of the language itself
* English has a default conceptual framework for communicating (the conduit metaphor)
* The conduit metaphor has a self-reinforcing bias
* A contrasting, more accurate, seldom-used non-metaphorical framework exists (the toolmakers paradigm)
* The resulting frame conflict may negatively impact solutions to social and cultural problems&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research into core expressions===
Reddy collected and studied examples of how English speakers talk about success or failure in communication. The overwhelming majority of what he calls '''core expressions''' involved [[dead metaphor]]s selected from speakers' internal thoughts and feelings. Speakers then "put these thoughts into words" and listeners "take them out of the words." Since words are actually marks or sounds and do not literally have "insides," people talk about language largely in terms of metaphors.

Most English core expressions used in talking about communication assert that actual thoughts and feelings pass back and forth between people through the conduit of words. These core expressions and the few that do not qualify as conduit metaphors are listed in the paper's extensive appendix,&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 311–324&lt;/ref&gt; which itself has been cited by Andrew Ortony as "a major piece of work, providing linguistics with an unusual corpus, as well as substantiating Reddy's claims about the pervasiveness of the root metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;Ortony, A. (1992). Metaphor, language, and thought. In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought'' (2nd ed.) (p. 6). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-40547-5}} hardback; {{ISBN|0-521-40561-0}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major framework===
There are two distinct but similar frameworks in which the conduit metaphor appears. Four types of core expressions constitute the '''major framework'''. (In the following example sentences, the operative core expressions are italicized.)

====Language is a conduit====
These commonplace examples—
#You can't ''get'' your ''concept across'' to the class that way
#His ''feelings came through to'' her only vaguely
#They never ''give'' us any ''idea'' of what they expect
—are understood metaphorically. In 1., people do not actually "get across" concepts by talking; in 2., feelings do not really "come through to" people; and in 3., people do not in fact "give" to others their ideas, which are mental states. Listeners assemble from their own mental states a partial replica of the speakers'. These core expressions assert figuratively that ''language literally transfers people's mental contents to others''.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speakers insert thoughts into words====
These examples—
#''Practice capturing'' your ''feelings in'' complete ''sentences''
#I need to ''put'' each ''idea into phrases'' with care
#''Insert'' that ''thought further down in'' the ''paragraph''
#She ''forced'' her ''meanings into'' the wrong ''lyrics''
#Please ''pack'' more ''sensation into'' fewer ''stanzas''
#He ''loads'' an ''argument with'' more ''viewpoints'' than it can withstand
—show that in 1., the speaker might be inexperienced in ensnaring meaning; in 2., be clumsy when putting it in; in 3., put it in the wrong place; in 4., compel words to accommodate meanings for which there is not enough room; in 5., fail to put in enough; or in 6., put in too much. These core expressions assert that ''speakers "insert" mental content into the "containers" represented by words with varying degrees of success.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt;

====Words contain thoughts====
These examples indicate that sounds and marks can be "containers"  for mental content:
#The ''sense'' of loneliness ''is in'' just about every ''sentence''
#His ''story was pregnant with meaning''
#The entire ''paragraph was full of emotion''
#These ''lines'' indeed rhyme, but they ''are devoid of feeling''
#Your ''words are hollow''—you don't mean them.
These core expressions assert that ''words contain or do not contain mental content, depending on the success or failure of the insertion process.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

====Listeners extract thoughts from words====
These examples—
#I couldn't actually ''extract'' coherent ''ideas from'' that ''prose''.
#You ''found'' some challenging ''concepts in'' the ''essay''
#They wouldn't really ''get'' any ''hatred out of'' those ''statements''
#Her ''remark is'' truly ''impenetrable''
#The author's ''intentions are going to be locked up in'' that dense ''chapter'' forever
#''Hiding'' the ''meaning in'' his ''sentences'' is just his style.
#They're ''reading things into'' the ''poem''
—indicate that speakers and writers are responsible to a large extent for the mental content conveyed by language, and that listeners and readers play a more passive role. However, in 7., a reader can add something to the container that was not originally there. Overall, these core expressions assert that ''listeners must "extract" mental content from words.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp.288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor framework===
Instead of words, an "idea space" between people's heads can be the container for mental content. The conduit is no longer a sealed pipeline between people, but an open pipe allowing mental content to escape into, or enter from, this space. Three types of core expressions constitute the '''minor framework''' of the conduit metaphor.

====Speakers eject thoughts into idea space====
These examples—
#She ''poured out'' the ''sorrow'' she'd been holding back
#He finally ''got'' those ''ideas out there''
—show that ''speakers and writers can eject mental content into an external idea space outside people.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

====Idea space contains thoughts====
These examples—
#That ''theory has been floating around'' for a century
#His  crazy ''notions made their way'' immediately ''into cyberspace''
#Those ''opinions are on'' the ''streets'' of Brooklyn, not in a classroom
—indicate that ''mental content has a material existence in an idea space, existing outside people.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

====Listeners extract thoughts from idea space====
The following examples—
#I had to ''absorb'' Einstein's ''ideas'' gradually
#His deepest ''emotions went right over'' her ''head''
#We couldn't ''get'' all that ''stuff into'' our ''brains'' in one afternoon
—demonstrate that ''mental content from an idea space may or may not re-enter people.''&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 291–292&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical apparatus===
The italicized words in the above examples are interchangeable with a wide array of terms that label mental content, the containers in which the content may be placed, and the ways in which these containers may be transferred in the conduit-metaphor paradigm.

Reddy developed a '''logical apparatus''' for diagramming the conduit metaphor's many permutations in both frameworks. Mental contents (feelings, emotions, ideas, etc.) are represented by '''RM''', which stands for "mental repertoire." Containers (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) are represented by '''S''', which stands for "signal." Thus, "I need to ''put'' each ''idea into phrases'' with care" can be rendered as the core expression '''''put'' RM ''into'' S'''.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy uses this logical apparatus throughout the appendix to his paper to clarify distinctions between metalingual expressions that use the conduit metaphor and the minority that do not.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 311–324&lt;/ref&gt;

===The toolmakers paradigm===
In order to examine the effects of the objectification of mental content in communication using the conduit metaphor, Reddy proposes an alternate, contrasting, "radical subjectivist" conception of communication called the '''toolmakers paradigm'''.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 292–295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:ToolmakersParadigmDiagram.jpg|x200px|right]]

A person's mental content is in fact isolated from others'. This isolation can be represented by a wheel-shaped compound, each wedge-shaped sector of which is an environment (a brain) bounded by two spokes and part of the circumference (''right''). They all contain differing amounts and types of plants, rocks, water, etc. (repertoire members). The wheel's hub has machinery that can deliver sheets of paper between sectors (communication). People use it to exchange crude blueprints (signals) for making tools, shelters, foods, etc., but they have no other contact whatsoever, and know of others' existence by inferences based on these blueprints.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in a forested sector, Alex builds a wooden rake, draws three identical blueprints, and drops them in the slots for Bob, Curt and Don. Bob finds a piece of wood for the handle, but because he lives in a rocky sector, starts making a stone rake head. (Alex had not considered wood to be unavailable or wrong for the rake head, so it was not specified.)

When halfway done, Bob connects his stone head to the handle, realizes it will be heavy, and decides it must be a device for digging up rocks when clearing a field for planting. (He infers that Alex must be either very strong or has only small rocks in his sector.) Bob decides two large prongs will make his tool lighter, thus finishing with a two-bladed pickax. He makes three identical blueprints for his pickax and drops them in the slots for Alex, Curt and Don.

Alex assembles a kind of rock-pick, but must modify the design if a wooden, two-pronged head is to be strong enough. (He cannot see much use for the tool in his largely rock-free sector, sensing that Bob has misunderstood his rake.) Alex draws a second blueprint for the rake head and sends it out as before. Curt crafts a hoe for slicing cleanly through roots to clear out a swamp. Don creates a gaff for fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt;

Blueprint users (language users) in the toolmakers paradigm can converge by inference on accurate replications of others' tools (mental content) after a laborious series of exchanges. Using the same diagram for the conduit-metaphor paradigm instead, the hub is a duplicator that can transfer ''actual'' materials and constructions among sectors, ending the isolation. No guesswork or construction is needed: Alex puts the rake in a special chamber, pushes a button, and precise replicas appear instantly in similar chambers for Bob, Curt and Don.

The subjectivist toolmakers paradigm embodies a language requiring real effort to overcome failures in communication, whereas the objectivist conduit-metaphor paradigm embodies one in which very little effort is needed for success.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core expressions are pervasive and unavoidable===
Although the toolmakers paradigm is available as a more accurate model of  communication, the conduit metaphor is pervasive and difficult to avoid in English syntax and semantics. Thinking in terms of another model of communication is generally brief, isolated and fragmentary because of an entrenched system of opposing attitudes and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pervasive====
Reddy's tally of core expressions is about 140. Examining alternative ways of speaking about communication—either metaphorically opposed or neutral to the conduit-metaphor framework—results in a list of 30 to 40 expressions. Thus, 70% of the metalingual apparatus of the English language is based on the conduit metaphor. The influence of the remaining 30% is weakened by several factors.

* They are usually multisyllabic, Latinate abstractions (e.g. "communicate," "disseminate," "notify," "disclose," etc.), which are neither graphic nor metaphorically coherent
* Most can be used with adjuncts such as "in words," thereby losing their neutrality and lending added support to the conduit metaphor. ("Communicate your feelings using simpler words," for example, avoids the conduit metaphor, whereas, "Communicate your feelings ''in'' simpler words," does not.)
* Many of these expressions have etymological roots arising directly from the conduit-metaphor framework ("express," "disclose," etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unavoidable====
Speaking carefully and attentively, it is possible to avoid conduit-metaphor expressions. For example, "Did you get anything out of that article?" might be replaced by, "Were you able to construct anything of interest on the basis of the assigned text?" Eschewing obvious conduit-metaphor expressions when communication is the topic is difficult. "Try to communicate more effectively" differs in impact from "You've got to learn how to put your thoughts into words." Reddy proceeds to show that even if avoidance were possible, it does not necessarily free people from the framework.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantic pathology via metonymy===
A '''semantic pathology''' arises "whenever two or more incompatible senses capable of figuring meaningfully in the same context develop around the same name."&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. (1957). ''The Principles of Semantics'' (2nd ed.) (p. 122). London: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm sorry" is an example of two contextually relevant meanings in collision. A person may expect an apology when the other wishes only to sympathize, or anticipate sympathy but hear an apology instead.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathology in linguistic theory====
Many other terms are ambiguous between mental content and the words "containing" it. For instance the word "poem" denotes a particular grouping of the sounds or marks (signals) exchanged between people. However, its use in sentences reveals that it can refer to thoughts or feelings (repertoire members). In this example—&lt;br /&gt;
:The poem has four lines and forty words
—"poem" refers to a text. The word-sense&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. J. (1973). Formal referential models of poetic structure. In ''Papers from the Ninth Regional Meeting, Chicago Linguistic Society''. Chicago: University of Chicago, Department of Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt; can be labeled POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. However, in this example—&lt;br /&gt;
:Eliot's poem is so utterly depressing
—"poem" refers to the mental content assembled in its reading. The word-sense in this case can be labeled POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, this example—&lt;br /&gt;
:Her poem is so sloppy!
—can be understood as either POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[polysemy]]).

The ambiguity of "poem" is intimately related to the conduit metaphor. If words contain ideas, then POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When two entities are commonly found together, one of their names—usually the more concrete—will develop a new sense referring to the other (the process of [[metonymy]]). Just as ROSE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (the blossom) developed ROSE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a shade of pinkish red) by metonymy, so POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; gave rise to POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt;

In the toolmakers paradigm, words do not contain ideas, so POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cannot contain POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; therefore, a distinction between them must be preserved. Although there is only one POEM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and the difficult task of assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s as there are people. These internal POEM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content.

If language had been operating historically under the toolmakers paradigm, these two different concepts would not currently be accessed by the same word: talking about mental content and signals as if they were the same would have led to insoluble confusion. The ambiguity of "poem" would thus have been an incurable semantic pathology. However, the conduit metaphor can completely ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;

"Poem" is a paradigm case for the entire class of English words denoting signals ("word," "phrase," "sentence," "essay," "novel," "speech," "text," etc.), demonstrating that semantic structures can be completely normal in one view of reality and pathological in another. This lends support to the theory that language and views about reality develop together.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathology in mathematical information theory====
Evidence of the biasing power of the conduit metaphor can be found in fields outside of linguistics. [[Information theory]], with its concept-free algorithms and computers as models, would seem to be immune from effects arising from semantic pathology, because the framework shares many attributes with the toolmakers paradigm. Nevertheless, there is evidence that use of the conduit metaphor has hampered investigators' attempts to develop the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication is the transfer of information (a selection from a set of alternatives). This set and a language (''code'') relating the alternatives to physical signals are established. A copy of each (an "''a priori'' shared context") is placed with the sender and receiver. A sequence of the alternatives (the ''message'') is selected for communication to the receiver, but the message itself is not sent. The selected alternatives are related by the code to energy patterns (the ''signal'') that travel quickly and unmodified. Mathematics is used to measure quantitatively how much the received signal narrows down the possible selections from stored alternatives.

The similarity between the frameworks of information theory and the toolmakers paradigm is that
* the shared context corresponds to the repertoire members
* the signal does not contain the message
* the signal carries neither the alternatives nor a replica of the message
* the signal in the former is the blueprint in the latter
* the receiver uses the signal to duplicate the sender's selection process and recreate the message
* if a signal is received and the shared context is damaged or missing, the proper selection cannot be made&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This analogy has withstood information theory's utility in simple, technical applications, but in biology, the social sciences, human language and behavior, it has been historically less successful. These attempts foundered by misunderstanding the conceptual framework of the theory rather than its mathematics. Reliance on ordinary language has made the information theory's insights less clear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Cherry|Cherry, C.]] (1980). ''On human communication: A review, a survey, and a criticism'' (3rd ed.). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-53038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative impact of ordinary language on information theory's use in other fields can be traced to terms the founders themselves used to label parts of their paradigm, telegraphy. The set of alternatives (repertoire members) were called the "alphabet." While true for telegraphy, [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] used it as a nomenclature referring to any set of alternative states, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Shannon|Shannon, C.E.]], &amp; [[Warren Weaver|Weaver, W.]] (1949). ''The mathematical theory of information.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet confuses the distinction between signals and repertoire members in human communication. Despite Weaver's particular interest in applying the theory to language, this fact went unrecognized.

Shannon and Weaver were also unaware that the choice of the term "message" to represent the selection of alternatives from the repertoire shared the same semantic pathology as "poem."
#I got your message (MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), but had no time to read it
#Okay, John, I get the message (MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); let’s leave him alone
Because MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''signal'' and MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''repertoire members'' in communication, the reasoning is faulty. The ambiguity is trivial in the conduit-metaphor framework, but fatal for information theory, which is based on the idea that MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be transmitted. Although Shannon and Weaver noted the distinction between "received" and "transmitted" signals based on possible distortion and noise, they wrote the word "message" on the receiving end of their paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver employed many conduit-metaphor expressions; for example, "How precisely do the transmitted symbols ''convey'' the desired meaning?" [italics Reddy's].&lt;ref&gt;Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He also contrasted two "messages, one of which is ''heavily loaded with meaning'' and the other of which is pure nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver wrote as if repertoire members are sent, adding that the sender "changes the ''message'' into the ''signal''" [italics Weaver's].&lt;ref&gt;Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; A code specifies how two systems relate, without changing anything; it preserves in the receiver the organizational pattern of the sender. Marks and sounds do not change into electrons, just as thoughts do not change into words.
 
Shannon correctly wrote, "The ''receiver'' ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref&gt;Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; But conduit metaphorisms continue to appear in the form of "encode" and "decode," defined as putting the repertoire members ''into'' code and taking them ''out,'' respectively. In addition, because the theory conceives of information as the ability to copy an organization via nonrandom selections, the term "information content" is itself a misnomer: signals do something but cannot contain anything. The conduit metaphor has thus influenced the thinking of information theorists in a counterproductive way.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion between the message and the signal persisted for two decades as theorists in other fields of inquiry drew on the insights of information theory. Kenneth K. Sereno and C. David Mortensen wrote that "investigators have yet to establish a completely acceptable definition of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Sereno, K.,  &amp; Mortensen, C. (Eds.). (1970). ''Foundations of communication theory'' (p. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those models based upon a mathematical conception describe communication as analogous to the operations of an information processing machine: an event occurs in which a ''source'' or ''sender transmits a signal'' or ''message'' through a ''channel'' to some ''destination'' or ''receiver''." [italics Sereno &amp; Mortensen's]&lt;ref&gt;Sereno &amp; Mortensen 1970, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Additionally, when they state, "The theory was concerned with the problem of defining the quantity of information contained in a message to be transmitted...,"&lt;ref&gt;Sereno &amp; Mortensen 1970, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; information is contained in a transmitted "message". If it refers to MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it is the conduit metaphor asserting that information is contained in the signals. If it is MESSAGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is the repertoire members that are sent in signals, which contain measurable information. The insights of information theory have been challenged by using the conduit metaphor instead of the more accurate toolmakers paradigm, upon which its premises were initially based.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition of conflicting paradigms===
The conduit-metaphor paradigm states that communication failure needs explanation, because success should be automatic: materials are naturally gathered, but misguided people expend energy scattering them. Conversely, the toolmakers paradigm states that partial miscommunication is inherent and can only be fixed by continuous effort and extensive verbal interaction: materials are gathered using energy or they will be naturally scattered.

Reddy explores some of the potential social and psychological effects of believing that communication is a "success without effort" system, whereas it is an "energy must be expended" system. The conduit metaphor objectifies meaning and influences people to talk and think about mental content as if it possessed an external, inter-subjective reality.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and social implications===
Having discussed the conduit metaphor's impact on theorists within and outside of linguistics, Reddy speculates about its distorting potential in culture and society. He points out that&lt;br /&gt;
:You'll ''find'' better ''ideas'' than that ''in the library''
is a conduit metaphor asserting that ideas are in words, which are on pages, which are in books, which are in libraries—with the result that "ideas are in libraries." The implication of this minor-framework core expression is that libraries full of books, tapes, photographs, videos and electronic media contain culture.

In the toolmakers-paradigm perspective, there are no ideas in the words; therefore, none in libraries. Instead, there are patterns of marks, bumps or magnetized particles capable of creating patterns of noise and light. Using these patterns as instructions, people can reconstruct mental content resembling that of those long gone. Since people in the past experienced a different world and used slightly different language instructions, a person unschooled in the language and lacking a full reservoir of mental content from which to draw, is unlikely to reconstruct a cultural heritage.

Because culture does not exist in books or libraries, it must be continually reconstructed in people's brains. Libraries preserve the opportunity to perform this reconstruction, but if language skills and the habit of reconstruction are not preserved, there will be no culture. Thus, Reddy asserts that the only way to preserve culture is to train people to "regrow" it in others.

He stresses that the difference of viewpoint between the conduit metaphor and the toolmakers paradigm is profound. Humanists—those traditionally charged with reconstructing culture and teaching others to reconstruct it—are increasingly rare. Reddy proposes that, despite a sophisticated system for mass communication, there is actually less communication; and moreover, that people are following a flawed manual. The conduit-metaphor influenced view is that the more signals created and preserved, the more ideas "transferred" and "stored." Society is thus often neglecting the human ability to reconstruct thought patterns based on signals. This ability atrophies when "extraction" is seen as a trivial process not requiring instruction past a rudimentary level.

Reddy concludes that the conduit metaphor may continue to have negative technological and social consequences: mass communications systems that largely ignore the internal, human systems responsible for the majority of the work in communicating. Because the logical framework of the conduit metaphor indicates people think in terms of "capturing ideas in words"—despite there being no ideas "within" the ever-increasing stream of words—a burgeoning public may be less culturally informed than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy 1979, pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-publication research by others==
Since the publication of Reddy's paper in 1979, it has garnered a large number of citations in linguistics, as well as a wide spectrum of other fields of inquiry. In 2007, a search at Web of Science &lt;ref&gt;Conducted by William M. Reddy, Ph.D., chairman, Department of History, Duke University&lt;/ref&gt; revealed 354 citations broken down roughly as follows: 137 in linguistics; 45 in information science; 43 in psychology; 38 in education; 17 in sociology; 15 in anthropology; 10 in law; 9 in business/economics; 8 in neurology; 7 in medicine; 5 in political science; 4 each in the arts, biology, environmental science, and mathematics; and 1 each in architecture, geography, parapsychology and robotics.

{{emotion}}

'''Courage''' (also called '''bravery''' or '''valour''') is the choice and [[willingness]] to confront [[Suffering|agony]], [[pain]], [[Risk|danger]], [[uncertainty]], or [[intimidation]]. '''Physical courage''' is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while '''moral courage''' is the ability to [[ethics|act rightly]] in the face of popular opposition, [[shame]], [[scandal]], discouragement, or personal loss.

The [[Cardinal virtues|classical virtue]] of '''fortitude''' (''andreia, fortitudo'') is also translated "courage", but includes the aspects of [[perseverance (virtue)|perseverance]] and [[patience]].&lt;ref name=Rickaby&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm|last=Rickaby|first=John|section=Fortitude|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|volume=6|location=New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]].

Much earlier, in the Hindu tradition, mythology has given many examples of bravery, valour and courage. Ramayana and Mahabharatha have in them many examples of both physical and moral courage.

In the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. More recently, courage has been explored by the discipline of psychology.

==Characteristics of Courage==
Daniel Putman, a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley, wrote an article titled "The Emotions of Courage". Using a text from Aristotle's ''Nicomanachean Ethics'' as the basis for his article, he discusses the relationship between fear and confidence in the emotion of courage. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1115b17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"First, in feelings of fear and confidence the mean is bravery (andreia).The excessively fearless person is nameless...while the one who is excessively confident is rash; the one who is excessively afraid and deficient in confidence is cowardly."}} -Aristotle &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1115b17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

He states that "courage involves deliberate choice in the face of painful or fearful circumstances for the sake of a worthy goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/0047-2786.00107| title=The Emotion of Courage | volume= Volume 32, Issue 4 | publisher=Blackwell Publishers | accessdate= November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this realization, Putman concludes that "there is a close connection between fear and confidence". {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=464}}

===Fear &amp; Confidence in Relation to Courage===
Fear and confidence in relation to courage can determine the success of a courageous act or goal.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=463}}They can be seen as the independent variables in courage, and their relationship can affect how we respond to fear. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=466}} In addition, the confidence that is being discussed here is self-confidence; Confidence in knowing one's skills and abilities and being able determine when to fight a fear or when to flight it. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}} Putman states that:

{{quote|"The ideal in courage is not just a rigid control of fear, nor is it a denial of the emotion. The ideal is to judge a situation, accept the emotion as part of human nature and, we hope, use well-developed habits to confront the fear and allow reason to guide our behavior toward a worthwhile goal."}}{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}
When trying to understand how fear and confidence play into courage, we need to look back at Aristotle's quote. According to Putman, Aristotle is referring to an appropriate level of fear and confidence in courage.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}} "Fear, although it might vary from person to person, is not completely relative and is only appropriate if it "matches the danger of the situation"."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}The same goes for confidence in that there are two aspects to self-confidence in a dangerous situation.
#{{quote | "a realistic confidence in the worth of a cause that motivates positive action."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}
#{{quote | "knowing our own skills and abilities. A second meaning of appropriate confidence then is a form of self-knowledge."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}}}}}

Without an appropriate balance between fear and confidence when facing a threat, one cannot have the courage to overcome it. Putman states "if the two emotions are distinct, then excesses or deficiencies in either fear or confidence can distort courage."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}

===Possible Distortions of Courage===
As noted above, an "excess or deficiency of either fear or confidence, can distort courage".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} According to Putman, there are four possibilities:
#{{quote | "Higher level of fear than a situation calls for, low level of confidence" {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively low level of fear when real fear is appropriate, excessively high level of confidence." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively high level of fear, yet the confidence is also excessively high." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively low level of fear and low level of confidence." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}}}}}}}}}

Putman explains each of these possibilities accordingly: an individual in the first possibility is perceived as a coward; in the second possibility a rash person. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}. For the remaining two possibilites, he uses analogies to explain them. The third possibility can occur if someone experienced a traumatic experience that brought about great anxiety for much of their life.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}Then the fear that they experience would often be inappropriate and excessive. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} Yet as a defensive mechanism, the person would show excessive levels of confidence as a way to confront their irrational fear and ""prove" something to oneself or other".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} So this distortions could be seen as a coping method for their fear. For the last possibility, it can be seen as hopelessness. Putman says this is similar to "a person on a sinking ship". {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} "This example is of a person who has low confidence and possibly low self-regard who suddenly loses all fear".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} The distortion of low fear and low confidence can occur in a situation where an individual accepts what is going to happen to them. In regards to this example, they lose all fear because they know death is unavoidable and the reason it is unavoidable is because they do not have the ability to handle or overcome the situation.

Thus, Daniel Putman identifies fear and courage as being deeply intertwined and that they rely on distinct perceptions: 
*{{quote | "the danger of the situation{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
*{{quote | "the worthiness of the cause {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
*{{quote | "and the perception of one's ability." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}}}}}}}
==Theories==

=== Ancient Greece ===
The early Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428–348 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/plato-9442588#synopsis |title=Plato Biography Philosopher, Writer (c. 428–348 BCE) |publisher=Biography |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; set the groundwork for how courage would be viewed to future philosophers. Plato's early writings found in ''[[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'' show a discussion on courage, but they fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion on what courage is.{{sfn|Walton|1986|p=5}}

During the debate between three leaders, including Socrates, many definitions of courage are mentioned.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
 
{{quote|"…a man willing to remain at his post and to defend himself against the enemy without running away…"{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
"…a sort of endurance of the soul…"{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
"…knowledge of the grounds of fear and hope..." {{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=675–86}} }}

While many definitions are given in Plato's ''Laches'', all are refuted, giving the reader a sense of Plato's argument style. ''Laches'' is an early writing of Plato's, which may be a reason he does not come to a clear conclusion. In this early writing, Plato is still developing his ideas and shows influence from his teachers like Socrates.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}

In one of his later writings, ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato gives more concrete ideas of what he believes courage to be. Civic courage is described as a sort of perseverance – "preservation of the belief that has been inculcated by the law through education about what things and sorts of things are to be feared".{{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=1061–75}} Ideas of courage being perseverance also are seen in ''Laches''. Plato further explains this perseverance as being able to persevere through all emotions, like suffering, pleasure, and fear.{{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=2061–75}}

As a desirable quality, courage is discussed broadly in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=59–61}} where its vice of shortage is [[cowardice]] and its vice of excess is [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nichomachean Ethics'', 1103b15-20, 1104a15-25, 1104b1-10, 1107a30-1107b5, 1108b15-35, 1109a5-15, 1115a5-1117b25, 1129b20-5, 1137a20-5, 144b5-10, 1167a20, 1177a30-b1, 1178a10-5, 1178a30-5, 1178b10-5,  in ''Aristotle, Translation, Introduction, and Commentary'', Broadie, Sarah, &amp; Rowe, C., [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Rome ===

In the [[Roman Empire]], courage formed part of the universal virtue of ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]''.{{sfn|McDonnell|2006|p=31}} Roman philosopher and statesman [[Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) lists the cardinal virtues does not name them such: {{quote|Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind (''animi'') in harmony with reason and the order of nature.  It has four parts: wisdom (''prudentiam''), justice, courage, temperance.{{sfn|McDonnell|2006|p=129}}&lt;ref&gt;''De Inventione'', II, LIII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Medieval philosophy ===

In medieval [[virtue ethics]], championed by [[Averroes]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and still important to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], courage is referred to as "Fortitude".{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.html|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]]:&lt;ref name="Summa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3123.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Fortitude (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 123) |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=New Advent |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Among the cardinal virtues, prudence ranks first, justice second, fortitude third, temperance fourth, and after these the other virtues.}}

Part of his justification for this hierarchy is that:
{{quote|Fortitude without justice is an occasion of injustice; since the stronger a man is the more ready is he to oppress the weaker.}}

On fortitude's general and special nature, Aquinas says:&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;
{{quote|The term "fortitude" can be taken in two ways. First, as simply denoting a certain firmness of mind, and in this sense it is a general virtue, or rather a condition of every virtue, since as [[Aristotle|the Philosopher]] states,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethic]]. ii&lt;/ref&gt; it is requisite for every virtue to act firmly and immovably. Secondly, fortitude may be taken to denote firmness only in bearing and withstanding those things wherein it is most difficult to be firm, namely in certain grave dangers. Therefore Tully says,&lt;ref&gt;Rhet. ii&lt;/ref&gt; that "fortitude is deliberate facing of dangers and bearing of toils." On this sense fortitude is reckoned a special virtue, because it has a special matter.}}

Aquinas holds fortitude or courage as being primarily about endurance, not attack:&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;
{{quote|As stated above (Article 3), and according to the Philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;Ethic. iii, 9&lt;/ref&gt; "fortitude is more concerned to allay fear, than to moderate daring." For it is more difficult to allay fear than to moderate daring, since the danger which is the object of daring and fear, tends by its very nature to check daring to increase fear. Now to attack belongs to fortitude in so far as the latter moderates daring, whereas to endure follows the repression of fear. Therefore the principal act of fortitude is endurance, that is to stand immovable in the midst of dangers rather than to attack them.}}

=== Western traditions ===

In both Catholicism and [[Anglicanism]], courage is also one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. For [[Thomas Aquinas]], Fortitude is the [[virtue]] to remove any obstacle that keeps the will from following reason.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}} Thomas Aquinas argues that Courage is a virtue which, along with the Christian virtues in the [[Summa Theologica]], can only be exemplified with the presence of the Christian virtues: faith, hope, and mercy. In order to understand true courage in Christianity it takes someone who displays the [[virtues]] of faith, hope, and mercy.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}} Courage is a natural virtue which Saint Augustine did not consider a virtue for Christians. [[Thomas Aquinas]] considers courage a virtue through the Christian [[virtue]] of mercy.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=204}} Only through mercy and charity can we call the natural virtue of courage a Christian virtue. Unlike [[Aristotle]], Aquinas’ courage is about endurance, not bravery in battle.{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=21–22}}

===Eastern traditions===
The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' contends that courage is derived from [[love]] ("[[:wikt:慈|慈]] loving [[:wikt:故|故]] causes [[:wikt:能|能]] ability [[:wikt:勇|勇]] brave"), explaining, ''"One of courage, with audacity, will die.  One of courage, but gentle, spares death.  From these two kinds of courage arise harm and benefit."''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 67 and 73, [http://www.edepot.com/taoc.html Tao Te Ching] (C. Ganson uses the word "courage", but the Mitchell translation does not.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zhongwen.com/|title=Traditional Chinese Characters|publisher=Zhonwen.com}} Tao Te Ching with [[Hanzi]] translations&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu tradition, Courage (shauriya) / Bravery (dhairya), and Patience (taamasa) appear as the first two of ten characteristics (lakshana) of [[dharma]] in the Hindu [[Manusmṛti]], besides forgiveness (kshama), tolerance (dama), honesty (asthaya), physical restraint ([[indriya]] nigraha), cleanliness (shouchya), perceptiveness (dhi), knowledge (vidhya), truthfulness ([[satya]]), and control of anger (akrodh).

Islamic beliefs also present courage and self-control as a key factor in facing the Devil (both within and external); many believe this because of the courage the Prophets of the past displayed (through peace and patience) against people who despised them for their beliefs.

===Recent past===
====Pre-19th century====
[[Thomas Hobbes]] lists virtues into the categories of moral virtues and virtues of men in his work "Man and Citizen."{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=68–70}} Hobbes outlines moral virtues as virtues in citizens, that is virtues that without exception are beneficial to society as a whole.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=17–18}} These moral virtues are justice (i.e. not violating the law) and charity. Courage as well as prudence and temperance are listed as the virtues of men.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=68–70}} By this Hobbes means that these virtues are invested solely in the private good as opposed to the public good of justice and charity. Hobbes describes courage and prudence as a strength of mind as opposed to a goodness of manners. These virtues are always meant to act in the interests of individual while the positive and/or negative effects of society are merely a byproduct. This stems forth from the idea put forth in "Leviathan" that the [[state of nature]] is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." According to Hobbes courage is a virtue of the individual in order to ensure a better chance of survival while the moral virtues address Hobbes's social contract which civilized men display (in varying degrees) in order to avoid the state of nature.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|p=290}} Hobbes also uses the idea of fortitude as an idea of virtue. Fortitude is "to dare" according to Hobbes, but also to "resist stoutly in present dangers."{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=150–52}} This a more in depth elaboration of Hobbes's concept of courage that is addressed earlier in "Man and Citizen." This idea relates back to Hobbes's idea that self-preservation is the most fundamental aspect of behavior.

[[David Hume]] listed virtues into two categories in his work ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' as artificial virtues and natural virtues. Hume noted in the Treatise that courage is a natural virtue. In the Treatise's section ''Of Pride and Humility, Their Objects and Causes'', Hume clearly stated courage is a cause of pride: "Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the cause of pride; and their opposites of humility".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=434}}

Hume also related courage and joy to have positive effects on the [[soul]]: "(...) since the soul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=666}} Along with courage nourishing and employing, Hume also wrote that courage defends humans in the Treatise: "We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=459}}

Hume wrote what excessive courage does to a hero's character in the Treatise's section "Of the Other Virtues and Vices": "Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he would never have been acquainted".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=900}}

Other understandings of courage that Hume offered can be derived from Hume's views on morals, reason, sentiment, and virtue from his work ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]].''

====19th century onward====

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] opposed courage to [[angst]], while [[Paul Tillich]] opposed an existential ''courage to be'' with [[non-being]],{{sfn|Tillich|1952|p=89}} fundamentally equating it with [[religion]]:
{{quote|Courage is the self-affirmation of being in spite of the fact of non-being. It is the act of the individual self in taking the anxiety of non-being upon itself by affirming itself ... in the anxiety of guilt and condemnation. ... every courage to be has openly or covertly a religious root. For religion is the state of being grasped by the power of being itself.{{sfn|Tillich|1952|pp=152–183}} }}

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] identified in his 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]" a "[[Northern Europe|Northern]] 'theory of courage'" – the [[hero]]ic or "[[virtuous pagan]]" insistence to do the right thing even in the face of certain defeat without promise of reward or [[salvation]]:
{{quote|It is the strength of the [[Norse mythology|northern mythological imagination]] that it faced this problem, put the monsters in the centre, gave them victory but no honor, and found a potent and terrible solution in naked will and courage. 'As a working theory absolutely impregnable.' So potent is it, that while the [[Greek mythology|older southern imagination]]  has faded forever into literary ornament, the northern has power, as it were, to revive its spirit even in our own times. It can work, as it did even with the ''[[goðlauss]]'' Viking, without gods: martial heroism as its own end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://completejrrt.tv/tta_open/2$B.+Old+English+Tales+and+Literary+Works%5bSection%5d/8$The+Monsters+And+The+Critics%5bBook%5d/1$Beowulf..+The+Monsters+and+the+Critics%5bChapter%5d/0025.htm|title=Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|last=Tolkien|first=JRR|publisher=The Tolkien Estate|page=25|accessdate=2008-04-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015113632/http://completejrrt.tv/tta_open/2%24B.%2BOld%2BEnglish%2BTales%2Band%2BLiterary%2BWorks%5BSection%5D/8%24The%2BMonsters%2BAnd%2BThe%2BCritics%5BBook%5D/1%24Beowulf..%2BThe%2BMonsters%2Band%2Bthe%2BCritics%5BChapter%5D/0025.htm|archivedate=2007-10-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Virtuous pagan heroism or courage in this sense is "trusting in your own strength," as observed by [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'':

{{quote|Men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''â sik þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|title=Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology)|publisher=Göttingen|location=Dieterich|year=1835|edition=1|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]] famously defined courage as "grace under pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/1999/julyaugust/feature/celebrating-ernest-hemingway%E2%80%99s-century|year=1999|title=Celebrating Ernest Hemingway's Century|last=Carter|first=Richard|work=neh.gov|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] stated, "Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality that guarantees all others."

According to [[Maya Angelou]], "Courage is the most important of the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently.  You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage."

In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes [[master–slave morality]], in which a noble man regards himself as a "determiner of values;" one who does not require approval, but passes judgment. Later, in the same text, he lists man's four virtues as "courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude," and goes on to emphasize the importance of courage: "The great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to re-baptize our evil qualities as our best qualities."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1989|p=65}}

According to the Swiss psychologist Andreas Dick, courage consists of the following components: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andreas|last=Dick|title=Mut – Über sich hinauswachsen|publisher=Hans Huber Verlag|location=Bern|year=2010|isbn=978-3-456-84835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. put at risk, risk or repugnance, or sacrifice safety or convenience, which may result in death, bodily harm, social condemnation or emotional deprivation;

2. a knowledge of wisdom and prudence about what is right and wrong in a given moment;

3. Hope and confidence in a happy, meaningful outcome;

4. a free will;

5. a motive based on love.

===Implicit Theories of Courage===
Researchers who want to study the concept and the emotion of courage have continued to come across a certain problem. While there are "numerous definitions of courage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247520291_Implicit_theories_of_courage | title=Implicit theories of courage | publisher=ResearchGate | volume=2:2 | pp=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they are unable to set "an operational definition of courage on which to base sound explicit theories". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} Rate et al. states that because of a lack of an operational definition, the advancement of research in courage is limited. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} So they conducted studies to try to find "a common structure of courage". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} Their goal from their research of implicit theories was to find "people's form and content on the idea of courage".{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} Many researchers created studies on implicit theories by creating a questionnaire that would ask "What is courage?". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} In addition, in order to "develop a measurement scale of courage, ten experts in the field of psychology came together to define courage. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=84}} They defined it as:
{{quote | "the ability to act for a meaningful (noble, good, or practical) cause, despite experiencing the fear associated with perceived threat exceeding the available resources" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=84}}{{sfn|Woodard|2004|pp=174}}}}

Also, because courage is a "multi-dimensional construct, it can be "better understood as an exceptional response to specific external conditions or circumstances than as an attribute, disposition, or character trait". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} Meaning that rather than being a show of character or an attribute, courage is a response to fear {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}}

From their research, they were able to find the "four necessary components of people's notion of courage".{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}.They are:
#"intentionality/deliberation"{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"personal fear"{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"noble/good act" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"and personal risk" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}

With these four components, they were able to define courage as:
{{quote | "a willful, intentional act, executed after mindful deliberation, involving objective substantial risk to the actor, primarily motivated to bring about a noble good or worthy end, despite, perhaps, the presence of the emotion of fear." {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}}}

To further the discussion of the implicit theories of courage, the researchers stated that future research could consider looking into the concept of courage and fear and how individual's might feel fear, overcome it and act, and act despite of it. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=96}}

== Society and symbolism ==
Its accompanying animal is the [[lion]].{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=101–102}} Often, fortitude is depicted as having tamed the ferocious lion. Cf. e.g. the [[Tarot]] trump called [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]]. It is sometimes seen in the Catholic Church as a depiction of Christ's triumph over sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Revelation|5:5|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is a symbol in some cultures as a savior of the people who live in a community with sin and corruption.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=199–202}}

==Awards==

{{See also|:Category:Courage awards}}
Several awards claim to recognize courageous actions, including:

* The [[Edelstam Prize]] awarded for outstanding contributions and exceptional courage in standing up for one's beliefs in the defense of Human Rights.
* The [[Victoria Cross]] is the highest military award that may be received by members of the British Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of other [[Commonwealth]] countries for valour "in the face of the enemy", the civilian equivalent being the [[George Cross]]. A total of 1,356 VCs have been awarded to individuals, 13 since [[World War II]]. 
* The [[Medal of Honor]] is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on members of the United States armed forces who distinguish themselves "conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States".
* [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)]] is the second highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of the United States Army, awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.
* The [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] – was established to recognize persons who perform extraordinary acts of heroism in civilian life in the United States and Canada, and to provide financial assistance for those disabled and the dependents of those killed saving or attempting to save others.
* The [[Profile in Courage Award]] is a private award given to  displays of courage similar to those John F. Kennedy described in his book Profiles in Courage. It is given to individuals (often elected officials) who, by acting in accord with their conscience, risked their careers or lives by pursuing a larger vision of the national, state or local interest in opposition to popular opinion or pressure from constituents or other local interests.
* The [[Civil Courage Prize]] is a human rights award which is awarded to "steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk – rather than military valor." It is awarded by the Trustees of The Train Foundation annually and may be awarded posthumously.
* [[Courage to Care Award]] is a plaque with miniature bas-reliefs depicting the backdrop for the rescuers' exceptional deeds during the Nazis' persecution, deportation and murder of millions of Jews.
* The [[Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage]] is a prize awarded by [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] to individuals who uphold the legacy of former Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]], whose actions in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and testimony before congress in support of the 1963 Civil Rights Bill legislation set a standard for courage during the turbulent [[Civil rights movement|civil rights era]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bio &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ivan Allen Prize |url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/ivanallenjr_bio |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Param Vir Chakra]] is the highest military award in India given to those who show the highest degree of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy. It can be, and often has been, awarded posthumously.
* The [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]], the highest order of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, awarded for "successful military acts of essential impact to a campaign that were undertaken on [an officer's] own initiative, and might have been omitted by an honorable officer without reproach".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">[[image:"Old Douglas".jpg|thumb|Marker for "Douglas The Camel" in [[Cedar Hill Cemetery (Vicksburg, Mississippi)|Cedar Hill Cemetery]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]]]

'''Douglas The Camel''', or “Old Douglas,” was a [[Domestication|domesticated]] [[camel]] used by Company A of the [[43rd Mississippi Infantry]], part of the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Because of Old Douglas, the 43rd Mississippi Infantry came to be known as the Camel Regiment,&lt;ref name="msgw.org"&gt;http://msgw.org/tishomingo/Camel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas was originally part of a [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] program called the [[U.S. Camel Corps|Texas Camel Experiment]], which aimed to experiment with camels as a possible alternative to [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s, which were dying of [[dehydration]] in  vast numbers. [[Jefferson Davis]], who had ascended to the position of [[United States Secretary of War]] in 1853, was a strong proponent of the program, and used his political influence to make the experiment happen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/vick/forteachers/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=348155|title=NPS.gov|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the details are unknown, Douglas somehow made his way to [[Mississippi]], and eventually died at Davis's hometown of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. He was initially given to Colonel W. H. Moore by 1st Lt. William Hargrove.&lt;ref name="deepsouthmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepsouthmag.com/2011/11/iluminating-corinth/ |title=Deep South Magazine – Southern Food, Travel &amp; Lit » Blog Archive » Iluminating Corinth |publisher=Deepsouthmag.com |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a [[mascot]], Moore assigned Douglas to the [[Military Band|regimental band]], carrying instruments and knapsacks.&lt;ref name="msgw.org"/&gt;

==Active service==
 
Though the men tried to treat Old Douglas like a horse, the camel was known to break free of any [[tether]], and was eventually allowed to graze freely. Despite not being tied up, he never wandered far from the men. The Infantry’s horses feared Old Douglas, and he is recorded to have spooked one horse into starting a [[stampede]], which reportedly injured many, and possibly killed one or two horses.&lt;ref name="msgw.org"/&gt;
 
Old Douglas’s first active service was with General [[Sterling Price]] in the [[Battle of Iuka|Iuka campaign]]. He also participated in the 1862 [[Second Battle of Corinth|Battle of Corinth]].&lt;ref name="deepsouthmag1"/&gt; He remained with the regiment until the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], where he was killed by Union sharpshooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke |first=Angela L |url=http://headboardsofstone.blogspot.com/2010/03/vicksburg-national-cemetery-cedar-hill.html |title=Headboards Of Stone - A Mississippi Graveyard Rabbit Blog: Vicksburg National Cemetery &amp; Cedar Hill |publisher=Headboardsofstone.blogspot.com |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged at his death, the men swore to avenge him. Col. Bevier enlisted six of his best snipers, and successfully shot the culprit. Of Douglas's killer, Bevier reportedly said, “I refused to hear his name, and was rejoiced to learn that he had been severely wounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-sXnU2aBTAC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=douglas+the+camel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fumhT9SXNsT26AGPndXmCA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=douglas%20the%20camel&amp;f=false |title=The Last Camel Charge: The Untold Story of America's Desert Military Experiment - Forrest Bryant Johnson - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
 
Douglas is currently honored with his own [[Headstone|grave marker]] in [[Cedar Hill Cemetery (Vicksburg, Mississippi)|Cedar Hill Cemetery]], in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. He, along with other camels used during the war, is not overlooked by historians, nor by Civil War Reenactors.&lt;ref name="deepsouthmag1"/&gt; There is currently a group called the Texas Camel Corps, whose mission is to promote the stories of camels, like Old Douglas, used during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texascamelcorps.com/ |title=Texas Camel Corps |publisher=Texas Camel Corps |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ella May Wiggins''' (ca. March 1900 &amp;ndash; September 14, 1929) was a union organizer and balladeer who was killed during the [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina|Gastonia]], N.C. 

According to ''Like a Family'', a 1987 account of "the making of a Southern cotton mill world," the Gastonia protest collapsed in the aftermath of Wiggins's death. Her union, the National Textile Workers Union, ultimately was "too weak to challenge the economic and political power of the cotton manufacturers and to organize the labor force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sohp/laf/protest.html#strikes |title=Like a Family &amp;#124; Work and Protest: Introduction |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Union organizing ==
A native of [[Sevierville, Tennessee]], Wiggins by 1926 settled in [[Gaston County, NC]], living in an [[African-American neighborhood]] outside [[Bessemer City, North Carolina|Bessemer City]] known as Stumptown. Her neighbors would look after her children as she worked as a spinner at American Mill No. 2. According to an article published online by the [[North Carolina Museum of History]], "she worked twelve-hour days, six days a week, earning about nine dollars a week."

She became a bookkeeper for the union, which was Communist run, and traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about labor practices in the South. She also told her story: “I’m the mother of nine. Four died with the whooping cough, all at once. I was working nights, I asked the super to put me on days, so’s I could tend ‘em when they had their bad spells. But he wouldn’t. I don’t know why. ... So I had to quit, and then there wasn’t no money for medicine, and they just died.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/workshops/womenshistory/SESSION4.html#wiggins |title=Session 4: Women in Politics and Social Reform |publisher=Ncmuseumofhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also sang her ballads, including her best-known song, “A Mill Mother’s Lament,” which has been recorded by [[Pete Seeger]], among others.

Wiggins believed in organizing African-Americans along with whites, and in a close vote, her local NTWU branch voted to admit African-Americans to the union.

== Death ==
On September 14, 1929, she and other union members drove to a union meeting in Gastonia. They were met by an armed mob, and turned back. They had driven about five miles toward home when they were stopped by a car; armed men jumped out and began shooting. Wiggins was shot in the chest and killed. Her five children were sent to live in orphanages.

Five Loray Mill employees were charged in Wiggins’s murder but were acquitted after less than 30 minutes of deliberation in a trial in Charlotte in March 1930 despite the fact that the crime was committed in daylight and more than 50 people witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZMr3WXviYQC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=ella+mae+wiggins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=utdMLSrt2M&amp;sig=v8L7W0AvMwPfa8WuAPnGcqsSQUs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA286,M1 |title=History of the Labor Movement in the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her life—and death—became the grist for many works of fiction inspired by true events, including ''Strike!'', a 1930 work by [[Mary Heaton Vorse]], where Wiggins is given the name Mamie Lewis.

She was buried in the Bessemer City Cemetery on North 12th St.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=wiggins&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=1551303&amp;GRid=16145322&amp; |title=Listing on Find-a-Grave Web Site |publisher=findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hers is one of the biggest markers there, after being expanded by the A.F.L-C.I.O. in 1979 to include a marker inscribed, "She died carrying the torch of social justice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/04/03/1353052/gastonias-tragic-1929-strike-gets.html |title=Gastonia's Tragic 1929 Strike Gets a Second Look |publisher=The Charlotte Observer |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maiden name is misspelled on the marker at her gravesite.

Three of her children were later buried near her.

'''''Free Will''''' is a 2012 book by American [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and author [[Sam Harris]]. Harris argues that the truth about the human [[mind]] (that [[free will]] is an [[illusion]]) does not undermine [[morality]] or diminish the importance of [[political freedom|political]] and [[Liberty|social]] freedom, and can as well as should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Free Will,’ by Sam Harris|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/free-will-by-sam-harris.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-07-13|access-date = 2015-10-31|issn = 0362-4331|first = Daniel|last = Menaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book Review: Sam Harris’ Free Will|url = http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-03-book-review-sam-harris-free-will|website = American Humanist Association|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will This Post Make Sam Harris Change His Mind About Free Will?|url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/will-this-post-make-sam-harris-change-his-mind-about-free-will/|website = blogs.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How free is the will?

==Overview==
Harris says the idea of free will "cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality" and is incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012). [http://www.philosophynews.com/post/2012/05/15/An-Analysis-of-Sam-Harris-Free-Will.aspx "An Analysis of Sam Harris' Free Will"]. Philosophy News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=Free Will and "Free Will"|url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/free-will-and-free-will|publisher=SamHarris.Org|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harris, science "reveals you to be a biochemical puppet."&lt;ref&gt;Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). [https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will "Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?"] Big Questions Online.&lt;/ref&gt; People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Even without free will, consciousness has an important role to play in the choices we make. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.

==Critique==
The book has undergone some critique.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/will-this-post-make-sam-harris-change-his-mind-about-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012).

The author uses the [[Benjamin_Libet#Implications_of_Libet's_experiments|Libet argument]], which has been challenged by Adrian G.

'''Furioso II''' (1965–1986) is one of the most influential sires in sport horse history. His offspring have performed well in all disciplines of [[show jumping]], including at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]].

==History==
[[Image:FuriosoII.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Furioso's lineage including the horses [[Precipitation (horse)|Precipitation]], [[Son-in-Law]], [[Double Life (horse)|Double Life]] and [[Dark Ronald]]]]
Furioso II was imported in 1968 to Germany by George Vorwerk, a breeder of [[Oldenburg (horse)|Oldenburg]] horses. His dam, Dame de Renville, produced several great horses, including Mexico, Laeken, Jexico de Parc and Heur de Bratand. He stood {{hands|16.1}}.

The stallion was approved for the Oldenburg [[stud book]] in 1967, and won his 100-day test performed in 1968 at [[Westercelle]]. He was incredibly influential to the [[Oldenburg (horse)|Oldenburg]] breed, which used his [[Thoroughbred]] bloodlines through his sire to introduce a more modern type of sport horse without resorting to a pure Thoroughbred. Known as the "Stamp Stallion", because his offspring inherited his 'very good feet and legs, his outstanding neck and shoulder, striking dappled chocolate chestnut coat with [[flaxen gene|flaxen]] tail and white markings', Furioso II was later approved for the [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]], Rhineland, and [[Westphalian (horse)|Westphalian]] studbooks.

Based on money earned by offspring, Furioso II was the top producing stallion in Germany from 1979 to 1989. In 1990 he was the top producer of [[dressage]] horses. During his lifetime, the stallion produced over 200 state premium mares and at least 70 approved sons, including:
* Mexico: sire of 20 approved sons, 20 dams of stallions, and numerous show jumping horses
* FBI: show jumper
* Heisman: finished fourth at the Barcelona Olympic in show jumping, was Horse of the Year in the United States
* [[For Pleasure]]: won show jumping team gold at both the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics, has sired 8 licensed Hanoverian stallions to date,{{When|date=January 2018}} was German Horse of the Year in 1995 and 1996
* [[Voltaire (horse)|Voltaire]]: show jumping sire of 33 approved sons, including Finesse and Altaire
* Cocktail: Grand Prix dressage horse ridden by [[Anky van Grunsven]], sire of Jazz
* He is also seen in the lines, through his grandson Welt As, of Bonfire and STC Diamond

Furioso II died in 1986, due to [[horse colic|colic]].

'''Gareth Jones''' (6 June 1925 &amp;ndash; 30 November 1958) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] actor, born in [[Lampeter]], [[Wales]], chiefly remembered for the circumstances of his death.

During a [[live television]] broadcast of the ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' play ''[[Underground (1958 TV play)|Underground]]'' on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network in the UK on 30 November 1958, Jones suffered a massive heart attack and died while off-camera between two of his scenes. Some contemporary news reports stated that he had suffered the heart attack while on camera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AItfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4202,188958&amp;dq=gareth+jones&amp;hl=en|title=The Miami News - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most references claim that he was stricken while in a make-up chair, between scenes. However, actor [[Peter Bowles]], also in the cast, recalled that "During transmission, a little group of us was talking on camera while awaiting the arrival of Gareth Jones's character, who had some information for us. We could see him coming up towards us, but we saw him fall. We had no idea what had happened, but he certainly wasn't coming our way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/31/television-drama-theatre|title=Live TV drama is resurrected as Sky shrugs off lessons of history|author=Gareth Rubin|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Ted Kotcheff]] and the remaining cast were forced to improvise to carry the play to its conclusion, with producer [[Sydney Newman]] ordering Kotcheff to "shoot it like a football match". Coincidentally, Jones's character was to have suffered a heart attack during the play.

Jones had appeared in three other ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' plays in 1958 - "Noon On Doomsday" (6 July 1958),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1098450/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|title=Armchair Theatre - Noon on Doomsday (TV Episode 1958)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Trial By Candlelight" (22 June 1958),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0793673/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|title=Armchair Theatre - Trial by Candlelight (TV Episode 1958)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Miss Olive" (6 April 1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1098446/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|title=Armchair Theatre Miss Olive (TV Episode 1958)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other TV appearances included the ITV Television Playhouse production of "Thunder On Sycamore Street" (11 October 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908911/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3|title=ITV Television Playhouse - Thunder on Sycamore Street (TV Episode 1957)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[BBC Television]] adaptation of ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' (9 May 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409416/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5|title=Under Milk Wood (TV Movie 1957)|date=9 May 1957|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC series "Onion Boys" (1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632949/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2|title=Onion Boys (TV Series 1957–1958)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "A Tale Of Two Cities" (1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423750/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4|title=A Tale of Two Cities (TV Mini-Series 1957)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghost hunting''' is the process of investigating [[list of reportedly haunted locations|locations]] that are reported to be haunted by [[ghost]]s. Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of [[paranormal]] activity. Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including [[EMF meter]]s, digital [[thermometer]]s, both handheld and static [[digital camera|digital]] [[video camera]]s, including [[thermographic camera|thermographic]] and [[night vision|night vision cameras]], as well as digital [[dictation machine|audio recorders]]. Other more traditional techniques are also used, such as conducting [[interview]]s and [[research]]ing the [[history]] of allegedly haunted sites. Ghost hunters may also refer to themselves as "paranormal investigators."&lt;ref name="MiamiHerald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami_dade/pinecrest/story/1241173.html|title=Ghost hunters say Deering Estate is ground zero for lost spirits|last=Cohen|first=Howard|date=September 19, 2009|publisher=The Miami Herald|accessdate=8 January 2010|archiveurl=http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/10/21/1294115/ghost-hunters-say-deering-estate.html|archivedate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghost hunting has been heavily criticized for its dismissal of the [[scientific method]]. No scientific study has ever been able to confirm the existence of ghosts.&lt;ref name="ShadyScience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/061027_ghost_hunters.html|title= The Shady Science of Ghost Hunting|last=Radford|first=Benjamin | authorlink=Benjamin Radford | date=27 October 2006|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,225640,00.html|title=Study: No Scientific Basis for Vampires, Ghosts|date=October 26, 2006|work=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is considered a [[pseudoscience]] by the vast majority of educators, academics, science writers, and skeptics.&lt;ref name="regal"&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]].

==History==
Paranormal research dates back to the 18th century, with organisations such as the [[Society for Psychical Research]] investigating spiritual matters. Psychic researcher [[Harry Price]] published his ''Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter'' in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Harry|title=Confessions of a ghost-hunter|date=1936|publisher=Putnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpoFAQAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghost hunting was popularised in the 2000s by television series such as ''[[Most Haunted]]'' and ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', combined with the increasing availability of high-tech equipment. [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] reported a doubling in their membership in the late 2000s, attributing this to the television programs. Despite its lack of acceptance in academic circles, the popularity of ghost-hunting reality TV shows has influenced a number of individuals to take up the pursuit.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-05-31-ghost-hunting_N.htm|title=Ghost-hunting groups enjoy surge in popularity|last=Peterson|first=Skip|author2=Associated Press|date=2008-05-31|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small businesses offering ghost-hunting equipment and paranormal investigation services increased in the early 2000s. Many offer [[electromagnetic field]] (EMF) [[EMF meter|meters]], infrared motion sensors and devices billed as "ghost detectors".  The paranormal boom is such that some small ghost-hunting related businesses are enjoying increased profits through podcast and web site advertising, books, DVDs, videos and other commercial enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2005/tc20050512_6388_tc024.htm Scaring Up Paranormal Profits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One ghost-hunting group called "A Midwest Haunting" based in Macomb, Illinois, reported that the number of people taking its tours had tripled, jumping from about 600 in 2006 to 1,800 in 2008. Others, such as Marie Cuff of "Idaho Spirit Seekers" pointed to increased traffic on their websites and message boards as an indication that ghost hunting was becoming more accepted. Participants say that ghost hunting allows them to enjoy the friendship of like-minded people and actively pursue their interest in the paranormal. According to Jim Willis of "Ghosts of Ohio", his group's membership had doubled, growing to 30 members since it was founded in 1999 and includes both true believers and total skeptics. Willis says his group is "looking for answers, one way or another" and that skepticism is a prerequisite for those who desire to be "taken seriously in this field."&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;

Author John Potts says that the present day pursuit of "amateur ghost hunting" can be traced back to the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] era and early organizations founded to investigate paranormal phenomena, like London's [[The Ghost Club]] and the [[Society for Psychical Research]], but that modern investigations are unrelated to academic [[parapsychology]]. Potts writes that modern ghost hunting groups ignore the [[scientific method]] and instead follow a form of "techno-mysticism".&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wxqJDCwS0QUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=ghost+hunting&amp;ots=Ij8qtBrC7j&amp;sig=mr8pp2g_U68fRwRSHwjxpdI4Cjs#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20hunting&amp;f=false|title=Ghost Hunting In The Twenty-First Century (From Shaman to scientist: essays on humanity's search for spirits)|last=Potts|first=John|author2=James Houran|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of ghost hunting has led to some injuries. Unaware that a "spooky home" in [[Worthington, Ohio]] was occupied, a group of teenagers stepped on the edge of the property to explore. The homeowner fired on the teenagers' automobile as they were leaving, seriously injuring one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smyth |first=Julie C |title='Spooky House' case splits Ohio suburb |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-21-2962711948_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A woman hunting for ghosts was killed in a fall from a [[University of Toronto]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/09/10/Ghost-hunting-woman-dies-at-U-of-Toronto/UPI-12001252605435/?pvn=1|title=Ghost-hunting woman dies at U of Toronto|date=September 10, 2009|publisher=United Press International|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An offshoot of ghost hunting is the commercial ghost tour conducted by a local guide or tour operator who is often a member of a local ghost-hunting or paranormal investigation group. Since both the tour operators and owners of the reportedly [[list of reportedly haunted locations|haunted]] properties share profits of such enterprises (admissions typically range between $50 and $100 per person), some believe the claims of hauntings are exaggerated or fabricated in order to increase attendance.&lt;ref name="Confessions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/confessions_of_a_ghost_tour_guide_and_skeptic/|title=Confessions of a Ghost Tour Guide and Skeptic|last=Howard|first=Philip |date=December 18, 2006|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Savannah, Georgia]] is said to be the American city with the most ghost tours, having more than 31 as of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/10/30/sprj.ft03.hauntedsavannah/index.html|title=Walk your scaredy-pants off in Savannah|work=CNN.com Travel|publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2003-10-30 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/entertainment/2008/08/24/rantoul_grads_film_explores_americas_most_haunted_city|title=Rantoul grad's film explores 'America's Most Haunted City'|work=News-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief statistics==

According to a survey conducted in October 2008 by the [[Associated Press]] and [[Ipsos]], 34 percent of Americans say they believe in the existence of ghosts.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; Moreover, a [[Gallup poll]] conducted on June 6–8, 2005 showed that one-third (32%) of Americans believe that ghosts exist, with belief declining with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/17275/OneThird-Americans-Believe-Dearly-May-Departed.aspx|title=One-Third of Americans Believe Dearly May Not Have Departed|last=Lyons|first=Linda|date=July 12, 2005|work=[[Gallup Poll]]|publisher=[[Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/Three-Four-Americans-Believe-Paranormal.aspx|title=Three in Four Americans Believe in Paranormal|last=Moore|first=David W.|date=June 16, 2005|work=[[Gallup Poll]]|publisher=[[Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having surveyed three countries (the United States, Canada, and Great Britain), the poll also mentioned that more people believe in [[haunted house]]s than any of the other paranormal items tested, with 37% of Americans, 28% of Canadians, and 40% of Britons believing.&lt;ref name="gallup" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/19558/Paranormal-Beliefs-Come-SuperNaturally-Some.aspx|title=Paranormal Beliefs Come (Super)Naturally to Some|last=Lyons|first=Linda|date=November 1, 2005|work=[[Gallup Poll]]|publisher=[[Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the National Science Foundation identified haunted houses, ghosts, and communication with the dead among pseudoscientific beliefs.&lt;ref name=NSF&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationships Between Science and Pseudoscience|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm|website=Science and Engineering Indicators, 2002|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==
Critics question ghost hunting's methodology, particularly its use of instrumentation, as there is no scientifically proven link between the existence of ghosts and cold spots or [[electromagnetic field]]s. According to skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]], the typical ghost hunter is practicing [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Times-Union"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=732861|title=Skeptic: Ghost hunters practice 'pseudoscience' |last=Ettkin|first=Brian |date=October 27, 2008 |publisher=Albany Times-Union|accessdate=14 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.bigorb.com/orb/forum/view.php?id=132&amp;forum_id=1354|archivedate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell says that ghost hunters often arm themselves with [[EMF meter]]s, thermometers that can identify cold spots, and wireless microphones that eliminate background noise, pointing out the equipment being used to try to detect ghosts is not designed for the job. "The least likely explanation for any given reading is it is a ghost," maintains Nickell. [[Orb (paranormal)|Orbs]] of light that show up on photos, he says, are often particles of dust or moisture. "[[electronic voice phenomenon|Voices]]" picked up by tape recorders can be radio signals or noise from the recorder, EMF detectors can be set off by faulty wiring, microwave towers,&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; iron, recording equipment, or cell phones, and heat sensors can pick up reflections off of mirrors or other metal surfaces. Nickell has also criticized the practice of searching only in the dark, saying that since some ghosts are described as "shadows or dark entities," he conducts searches in lighted rather than darkened conditions.&lt;ref name="rcs_pomeroy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomeroy|first1=Ross|title=How to Actually Hunt a Ghost|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2018/01/04/how_to_actually_hunt_a_ghost.html|website=Real Clear Science|publisher=Real Clear Science|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to investigator [[Benjamin Radford]], most ghost-hunting groups including [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] make many methodological mistakes. "After watching episodes of ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'' and other similar programs, it quickly becomes clear to anyone with a background in science that the methods used are both illogical and unscientific". Anyone can be a ghost investigator, "failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena", considering emotions and feelings as "evidence of ghostly encounters". "Improper and unscientific investigation methods" for example "using unproven tools and equipment", "sampling errors", "ineffectively using recording devices" and "focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena". In his article for [[Skeptical Inquirer]] Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation "I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Most of the efforts to investigate ghosts so far have been badly flawed and unscientific – and, not surprisingly, fruitless."&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Benjamin|title=Ghost-hunting mistakes: science and pseudoscience in ghost investigations|url=http://business.highbeam.com/5799/article-1G1-239813706/ghosthunting-mistakes-science-and-pseudoscience-ghost|website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some ghost hunters believe [[Orb (paranormal)|orbs]] are of supernatural origin, skeptic [[Brian Dunning (skeptic)|Brian Dunning]] says that they are usually particles of dust that are reflected by light when a picture is taken, sometimes it may be bugs or water droplets. He contends that "there are no plausible hypotheses that describe the mechanism by which a person who dies will become a hovering ball of light that appears on film but is invisible to the eye." He does not believe there is any science behind these beliefs; if there were then there would be some kind of discussion of who, what and why this can happen. In his investigations he can not find any "plausible hypothesis" that orbs are anything paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4029|number=29|title=Orbs: The Ghost in the Camera |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Sharon A. Hill|Sharon Hill]] reviewed over 1,000 "amateur research and investigation groups" (ARIGs), writing that "879 identified with the category of “ghosts”. Hill reports that many groups used the terms “science” or “scientific” when describing themselves; however "they overwhelmingly display neither understanding of nor adherence to scientific norms". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"ARIGs often promote their paranormalist viewpoint as scientifically based, especially in community presentations or lectures at educational facilities. While scientifically minded observers can readily spot the anemic and shoddy scholarship of popular paranormal investigation, the public, unaware of the fundamental errors ARIGs make, can be persuaded by jargon and “sciencey” symbols."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hill sees the supernatural bias of such groups as an indication of how "far removed ARIG participants really are from the established scientific community".&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon| authorlink=Sharon A. Hill | title=Amateur Paranormal Research and Investigation Groups Doing ‘Sciencey’ Things|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/amateur_paranormal_research_and_investigation_groups_doing_sciencey_things|website=Csicop.org|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer – Volume 36.2 March/April 2012|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hill's 2017 book ''Scientifical Americans'' reviewed by historian Brian Regal for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, Regal writes, that this is a timely book as it comes during an era when many question science. Regal wonders why believers think that "untutored amateurs know more (and are more trustworthy) than professional scholars". He asks why there is little discussion on "philosophical and theological aspects of their work" for example he theoretical questions like "What is a ghost?" and "Does one's religion in life determine if they can become a ghost in death?".  Hill gives a historiography of the field of "modern paranormal interest: monsters, UFO's, and ghosts." She does not insult or ridicule the people she writes about, but explains their stories through case studies. Regal feels that this book will not deter believers in the paranormal, but it is an important part of a "growing literature on amateur paranormal research". Regal states that paranormal researchers are not engaging in scientific discovery but are engaging "blithely in confirmation bias, selective evidence compiling, and the backfire effect while all the time complaining that it is the other side doing it. ... They, like all of us, are ultimately not searching for ghosts ... they are looking for themselves."&lt;ref name="Regal review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regal |first1=Brian |title=Strang Songs from the Fringe |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=60-61 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and equipment==
[[File:Irthermo.png|thumb|200px|A handheld infrared thermometer of the type used by some ghost hunters]]

Ghost hunters use a variety of techniques and tools to investigate alleged paranormal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maggwire.com/ghost-hunting-equipment/|title="Ghost Hunting Equipment: Tools To Get Rid Of Demons by Amy Bruni"|publisher=Maggwire|last=Tung|first=Christen|date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghosthuntingblog.theauthorityon.com/ghost-hunting-equipment-a-checklist/|title=Ghosts Hunting Equipment Checklist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While there is no universal acceptance among ghost hunters of the following methodologies, a number of these are commonly used by ghost hunting groups.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/10/31/BUGDCFFS8Q1.DTL|title=Ghost hunters utilize latest in technology|last=Kirby|first=Carrie|date=October 31, 2005|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Digital and [[analog recording|analog]] [[audio recording]]: to capture any unexplained noises and [[electronic voice phenomena]] (EVPs), that may be interpreted as disembodied voices.
* [[Compass]]: some ghost hunters use a compass to determine the location of paranormal spots, similar to [[Electromagnetic field|EMFs]].
* [[Geiger counter]]: to measure fluctuations in radiation.
* [[Infrared]] and/or [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] [[motion sensor]]s: to detect possible anomalous movement within a given area, or to assist in creating a controlled environment where any human movement is detected.
* Air quality monitoring equipment: to assess the levels of gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], which are thought to contribute to reports of [[paranormal]] activity.
* [[Infrasound]] monitoring equipment: to assess the level of sound vibrations.
* [[Dowsing rod]]s: usually constructed of brass and bent into an L-shape.
* [[Psychic]]s, [[mediumship|mediums]], or [[clairvoyant]]s: trance mediums or "[[Sensitive (pseudoscience)|sensitive]]" individuals thought to have the ability to identify and make contact with spiritual entities.
* [[Demonologist]]s, [[exorcist]]s, and [[clergy]]: individuals who may say [[prayer]]s, give [[blessing]]s, or perform [[rituals]] for the purpose of cleansing a location of alleged [[ghost]]s, [[demon]]s, [[poltergeist]]s, or "[[negative energy]]".
* Lights out: according to ghost hunting enthusiast websites, many ghost hunters prefer to conduct their investigations during "peak" evening hours (midnight to 4 a.m.).
* Ghost Box: an electronic device that some ghost hunters claim allows communication with spirits.
* [[Interview]]s: collecting testimony and accounts about alleged hauntings.
* [[Research|Historical research]]: researching the [[history]] behind the site being investigated.
* A [[Ouija]] board to communicate with spirits.

===Cold spots===
According to ghost hunters, a cold spot is an area of localized [[coldness]] or a sudden decrease in [[ambient temperature]]. Many ghost hunters use digital thermometers or heat sensing devices to measure such temperature changes. Believers claim that cold spots are an indicator of paranormal or spirit activity in the area; however there are many natural explanations for rapid temperature variations within structures, and there is no scientifically confirmed evidence that spirit entities exist or can affect air temperatures.&lt;ref name="regal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink = Joe Nickell|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|title=Investigative Files – Ghost Hunters|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=September–October 2006|volume=30.5|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ghost_hunters|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Grave of the Fireflies'''''|火垂るの墓|Hotaru no Haka}} is a 1967 [[autobiography|semi-autobiographical]] [[short story]] by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] author [[Akiyuki Nosaka]]. It is based on his experiences before, during, and after the [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|firebombing of Kobe]] in 1945. One of his sisters died as the result of sickness, his adoptive father died during the firebombing proper, and his younger adoptive sister Keiko died of malnutrition in [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]]. It was written as a personal apology to Keiko, regarding her death.

The story was first published in Japan in オール読物 (Ōru Yomimono) "All For Reading", a monthly literature magazine published by [[Bungei Shunju]], in October 1967. Nosaka won the [[Naoki Prize]] for best popular literature for this story and ''American Hijiki'', which was published a month before.&lt;ref name="jugun"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homepage1.nifty.com/naokiaward/jugun/jugun58NA.htm|title = Nosaka Akiyuki|date = |accessdate = May 13, 2015|website = All of Naoki Award|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both short stories along with four others were bundled as a book in 1968 published by Shinchōsha ({{ISBN|4-10-111203-7}}). The short story was later adapted into the 1988 animated [[film]] ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'', directed by [[Isao Takahata]]. The film was released on April 16, 1988, over twenty years from the publication of the original work.&lt;ref name="Animerica9"&gt;"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation." ''[[Animerica]]''. Volume 2, No. 11. Page 9. Translated by ''Animerica'' from: [[Isao Takahata|Takahata, Isao]]. ''Eiga o Tsukurinagara, Kangaeta Koto'' ("Things I Thought While Making Movies") ''[[Tokuma Shoten]]'', 1991. Originally published in ''[[Animage]]'', June 1987. This is a translation of a 1987 conversation between Takahata and [[Akiyuki Nosaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It was adapted again into a live action television film ''[[Grave of the Fireflies (2005 film)|Grave of the Fireflies]]''.

Nosaka explained that ''Grave of the Fireflies'' is a "double-suicide story."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"&gt;"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation." ''[[Animerica]]''. Volume 2, No. 11. Page 7. Translated by ''Animerica'' from: [[Isao Takahata|Takahata, Isao]]. ''Eiga o Tsukurinagara, Kangaeta Koto'' ("Things I Thought While Making Movies") ''[[Tokuma Shoten]]'', 1991. Originally published in ''[[Animage]]'', June 1987. This is a translation of a 1987 conversation between Takahata and [[Akiyuki Nosaka]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isao Takahata]], the film director, said that he saw similarities to [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]]'s double-suicide plays.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt;

==Development==
[[Akiyuki Nosaka]] wrote the book in 1967, during a period of high economic growth. Nosaka said that the era felt strange to him and that "the real spirit of humanity was different" and so he wished to depict an "idealized humanity" between a brother and sister, or "ultimately, of a man and a woman."&lt;ref name="Animerica9"/&gt; He added that he wished to place Seita, the main character, "in an idealized situation." Nosaka said that he himself had been in such a scenario until fourteen and then had to grow up very quickly, becoming "worse off" than other children.&lt;ref name="Animerica9"/&gt;

==Characters==

===Seita===
[[Akiyuki Nosaka]] explained that Seita and Setsuko survive the wartime environment by "locking themselves up in a world of their own."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Nosaka added that after their mother, their sole guardian, dies, Seita "decides to become the guardian of his little sister, even if it means making an enemy out of the world."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; At one point, Seita has a favorable reception to making himself a source of food for his sister. Nosaka argued "On the one hand, that's very tragic, but it's also a blessed situation. For Seita, it's like he can try to build a heaven for just the two of them."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Nosaka argued that while Seita is "when it comes to reality" not a romanticist for he also becomes hungry, "objectively speaking" Setsuko, at age four, is at the period when "a girl looks the cutest" and Seita is just becoming aware of his masculinity in his adolescent period.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Nosaka said that the two have an "obvious consanguineous relationship" and that Setsuko is the only person Seita can confide in.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Nosaka added that "while there's a strong blood tie, he's shut out from being able to love her as a girl" and that his tension increases to high levels and therefore sublimation takes place.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt;

Nosaka explained that Seita "is rather spoiled for a wartime child" and therefore the children of 1987 would act like he would if they were put in that situation.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; [[Isao Takahata]] said that he was compelled to adapt the story into an animation after seeing how Seita "was a unique wartime ninth grader."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; He previously believed that boys always developed the will to live, but Seita instead chooses not to endure difficult feelings; when his aunt insults him, Seita does not act in a stoic manner and instead withdraws from the situation. Takahata argued that Seita's feelings are better understood by the children in 1987, who often base decisions on whether or not they are pleasant, while during that year his generation had the belief that Seita needed to endure it. Takahata argued that "It's not only the children...I think the times are becoming that way, as well" and therefore he liked the idea of adapting the story as a film.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt;

Nosaka said that in the story, Seita "got increasingly transformed into a better human being" since he was trying to "compensate for everything I couldn't do myself" and that he was never "kind like the main character." Nosaka explained that "I always thought I wanted to perform those generous acts in my head, but I couldn't do so." He believed that he would always give food to his sister, but when he obtained food, he ate. The food tasted very good when it was scarce, but he felt remorse afterwards. Nosaka concluded "I'd think there is no one more hopeless in the world than me. I didn't put anything about this in the novel."&lt;ref name="Animerica10"&gt;"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation." ''[[Animerica]]''. Volume 2, No. 11. Page 10. Translated by ''Animerica'' from: [[Isao Takahata|Takahata, Isao]]. ''Eiga o Tsukurinagara, Kangaeta Koto'' ("Things I Thought While Making Movies") ''[[Tokuma Shoten]]'', 1991. Originally published in ''[[Animage]]'', June 1987. This is a translation of a 1987 conversation between Takahata and [[Akiyuki Nosaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setsuko===

Nosaka said that Setsuko also has to grow up quickly, and she takes the role of Seita's mother, "and at other times, the role of his lover."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Setsuko acts as Seita's spiritual support while Setsuko relies on Seita for nourishment.&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt; Nosaka said that "[i]n the end, it turns out that the days leading up to their death are like the development of a love story."&lt;ref name="Animerica7"/&gt;

Nosaka said that the death of his sister was "an exact match with the novel."&lt;ref name="Animerica9"/&gt;

'''Human nature''' is a bundle of fundamental characteristics—including ways of thinking, [[feeling]], and [[agency (philosophy)|acting]]—which [[Homo sapiens|humans]] tend to have [[nature (philosophy)|naturally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/human+nature|title=Definition of HUMAN NATURE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-nature|title=human nature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/human-nature|title=the definition of human nature|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/human-nature|title=human nature Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions of whether truly fixed characteristics exist, what these natural characteristics are, and what causes them, are among the oldest and most important questions in [[philosophy]] and [[science]]. The science that examines human nature is known as [[psychology]] and more recently also [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V. S.|date=1996|title=What neurological syndromes can tell us about human nature: some lessons from phantom limbs, capgras syndrome, and anosognosia|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|volume=61|pages=115–134|issn=0091-7451|pmid=9246441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blank|first=Robert H.|date=2002|title=Review of Jean-Pierre Changeux and Paul Ricoeur. 2000.

The "[[nature versus nurture]]" debate is a well-known modern discussion about human nature in [[natural science]].

These questions have particularly important implications in [[economics]], [[ethics]], [[politics]], and [[theology]]. This is partly because human nature can be regarded as both a source of [[norm (social)|norm]]s of conduct or ways of life, as well as presenting obstacles or constraints on living a good life. The complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in [[art]] and [[literature]], the question of what it is to be human.

==Overview==
The concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in [[Greek philosophy]], at least as regards the [[Western world|Western]] and [[Middle East]]ern languages and perspectives which are heavily influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Refurn" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teleology|teleological]] approach of [[Aristotle]] came to be dominant by late classical and medieval times. By this account, human nature really causes humans to become what they become, and so it exists somehow independently of individual humans. This in turn has been understood as also showing a special connection between human nature and [[divinity]]. This approach understands human nature in terms of [[final cause|final]] and [[formal cause|formal]] [[Causality|causes]]. In other words, nature itself (or a nature-creating divinity) has intentions and goals, similar somehow to human intentions and goals, and one of those goals is humanity living naturally. Such understandings of human nature see this nature as an "idea", or "[[Theory of Forms|form]]" of a human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D13%3Asection%3D1078b 1078b].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the existence of this invariable and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] human nature is a subject of much historical debate, continuing into modern times. Against this idea of a fixed human nature, the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries—firstly by early modernists such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In Rousseau's ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', Rousseau wrote: "We do not know what our nature permits us to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|year=1995 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |last=Saunders |first=Jason Lewis |url=http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_99_82.html |title=Western Philosophical Schools and Doctrines: Ancient and Medieval Schools: Sophists: Particular Doctrines: Theoretical issues. |date=26 October 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527020558/http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_99_82.html |archivedate=27 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 19th century, thinkers such as [[Hegel]], [[Marx's theory of human nature|Marx]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Sartre]], [[Structuralism|structuralists]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodernists]] have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] has changed the nature of the discussion, supporting the proposition that mankind's ancestors were not like mankind today. Still more recent scientific perspectives—such as [[behaviorism]], [[determinism]], and the chemical model within modern [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]]—claim to be neutral regarding human nature. As in much of modern science, such disciplines seek to explain with little or no recourse to [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TELEOLOGICAL REALISM IN BIOLOGY|url = https://www.academia.edu/6927336/TELEOLOGICAL_REALISM_IN_BIOLOGY|website = www.academia.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be offered to explain human nature's origins and underlying mechanisms, or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature.

==Classical Greek philosophy==
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy#Classical Greek philosophy}}
Philosophy in [[classical Greece]] is the ultimate origin{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} of the [[Western world|Western]] conception of the nature of a thing. According to [[Aristotle]], the philosophical study of human nature itself originated with [[Socrates]], who turned philosophy from study of the heavens to study of the human things.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates is said to have studied the question of how a person should best live, but he left no written works. It is clear from the works of his students [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], and also by what was said about him by Aristotle (Plato's student), that Socrates was a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed that the best life and the life most suited to human nature involved [[reason]]ing. The Socratic school was the dominant surviving influence in philosophical discussion in the [[Middle Ages]], amongst [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], and [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]].

The human [[soul]] in the works of Plato and Aristotle has a divided nature, divided in a specifically human way. One part is specifically human and rational, and divided into a part which is rational on its own, and a spirited part which can understand reason. Other parts of the soul are home to desires or passions similar to those found in animals. In both Aristotle and Plato, spiritedness (''thumos'') is distinguished from the other passions (''epithumiai'').&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' Book I and VI; Plato ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV.&lt;/ref&gt; The proper function of the "rational" was to rule the other parts of the soul, helped by spiritedness. By this account, using one's reason is the best way to live, and philosophers are the highest types of humans.

Aristotle—Plato's most famous student—made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature. In his works, apart from using a similar scheme of a divided human soul, some clear statements about human nature are made:
* Man is a conjugal animal, meaning an animal which is born to couple when an adult, thus building a household (''oikos'') and, in more successful cases, a clan or small village still run upon patriarchal lines.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1162a 1162a]; [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058 1252a].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Man is a political animal, meaning an animal with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a [[division of labor]] and law-making. This type of community is different in kind from a large family, and requires the special use of human reason.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1252b 1252b].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Man is a [[Mimesis|mimetic]] animal. Man loves to use his imagination (and not only to make laws and run town councils). He says "we enjoy looking at accurate likenesses of things which are themselves painful to see, obscene beasts, for instance, and corpses." And the "reason why we enjoy seeing likenesses is that, as we look, we learn and infer what each is, for instance, 'that is so and so.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Poetics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448b 1148b].&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle, reason is not only what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, but it is also what we were meant to achieve at our best. Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today. However, the particular teleological idea that humans are "meant" or intended to be something has become much less popular in [[modern history|modern times]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, The Politics of Aristotle: With an Introduction, Two Prefactory Essays and Notes Critical and Explanatory, Clarendon Press, 1887, Pg. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Socratics, human nature, and all natures, are metaphysical concepts. Aristotle developed the standard presentation of this approach with his theory of [[four causes]]. Every living thing exhibits four aspects or "causes": matter, form, effect, and end. For example, an oak tree is made of plant cells (matter), grew from an acorn (effect), exhibits the nature of oak trees (form), and grows into a fully mature oak tree (end). Human nature is an example of a formal cause, according to Aristotle. Likewise, to become a fully actualized human being (including fully actualizing the mind) is our end. Aristotle (''Nicomachean Ethics,'' Book X) suggests that the human intellect (νούς) is "smallest in bulk" but the most significant part of the human psyche, and should be cultivated above all else. The cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher, which is thereby also the happiest and least painful life.

== In Chinese thought ==
Human nature is a central question in [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul C Tang and N Basafa, Human Nature in Chinese Thought:  A Wittgensteinian Treatment.  Proceedings of the 12th International Wittgenstein Symposium 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Human nature was considered by [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]] to be essentially good.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the Song dynasty the theory of the original goodness of human beings dominated Confucian thought.&lt;ref name="Yen, Hung-Chung 2015"&gt;Yen, Hung-Chung. "Human Nature and Learning in Ancient China." Education as Cultivation in Chinese Culture. Springer Singapore, 2015. 19-43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hsun Tzu]] taught that human nature was essentially evil.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  As suggested by these contrasting views, the question of human nature has generated a long debate among Chinese thinkers.&lt;ref name="Yen, Hung-Chung 2015"/&gt;

== Christian theology ==
{{Main|Christian theology}}
In Christian theology, there are two ways of "conceiving human nature".  The first is "spiritual, Biblical, and theistic", whereas the second is "natural, cosmical, and anti-theistic".&lt;ref name="Sin 1876"&gt;[[John Tulloch]], ''Christian Doctrine of Sin'' (Scribner, Armstrong, 1876), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in this section is on the former. As [[William James]] put it in his study of human nature from a religious perspective, "religion" has a "department of human nature".&lt;ref&gt;William James, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (The Modern Library, 1902), 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various views of human nature have been held by theologians. However, there are some "basic assertions" in all "biblical anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Justo L. González]], ''Essential Theological Terms'' s.v. "Anthropoology" (Westminster John Knox, 2005),  8.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Humankind has its origin in God, its creator."
# "Humans bear the 'image of God'."
# Humans are "to rule the rest of creation".
The [[Bible]] contains no single "doctrine of human nature". Rather, it provides material for more philosophical descriptions of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin J. Vanhoozer]], gen. ed., ''Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible'' (Baker, 2005), s.v. "Human Being, Doctrine of," 310.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Creation as found in the [[Book of Genesis]] provides a theory on human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kenneth |last=Ackerman|title=Anthropology and Human Nature, 13|url=https://www.udel.edu/anthro/ackerman/sylabus08F205.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5F.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in chapter ''"Dignity of the human person"'' has article about man as image of God, vocation to beatitude, freedom, human acts, passions, moral conscience, virtues and sin.

=== Created human nature ===
As originally created, the Bible describes "two elements" in human nature: "the body and the breath or spirit of life breathed into it by God". By this was created a "living soul", that is, a "living person".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Berkhof]], ''Systematic Theology'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 183.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Genesis 1:27, this living person was made in the "image of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;c=1&amp;t=NIV#s=t_bibles_1027|title=Genesis Chapter 1 (NIV)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the biblical perspective, "to be human is to bear the image of God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony A. Hoekema]], ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box
| quote = "Two main modes of conceiving human nature—the one of which is spiritual, Biblical, and theistic," and the other "natural, cosmical, and anti-theistic." [[John Tulloch]]&lt;ref name="Sin 1876"/&gt;

Genesis does not elaborate the meaning of "the image of God", but scholars find suggestions. One is that being created in the image of God distinguishes human nature from that of the beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Vanhoozer, gen. ed., ''Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible'' (Baker, 2005), s. v. "Image of God," 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that as God is "able to make decisions and rule" so humans made in God's image are "able to make decisions and rule". A third is that mankind possesses an inherent ability "to set goals" and move toward them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 5, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; That God denoted creation as "good" suggests that Adam was "created in the image of God, in righteousness."&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, ''A Dictionary of the Holy Bible'' (Griffin and Rudd, 1813), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam was created with ability to make "right choices", but also with the ability to choose sin, by which he fell from righteousness into a state of "sin and depravity".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to the Bible, "humankind is not as God created it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Jeeves]], ''Human Nature: Reflections on the Integration of Psychology and Christianity'' (Templeton ,2006), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fallen human nature ===
{{Main|Fall of man}}
By [[Adam]]'s fall into sin, "human nature" became "corrupt", although it retains the [[image of God]]. Both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] teach that "sin is universal".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 17, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &lt;!-- The text doesn't match the link because the LXX Psalm numbering is used in this quotation. --&gt;[[Psalm 51]]:5 reads: "For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Psalm|51:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus taught that everyone is a "sinner naturally" because it is mankind's "nature and disposition to sin".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tulloch]], ''Christian Doctrine of Sin'' (Scribner, Armstrong, 1876), 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul, in Romans 7:18, speaks of his "sinful nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18.|title=Romans 7:18.  -  - Bible Gateway|website=www.biblegateway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a "recognition that there is something wrong with the moral nature of man is found in all religions".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] coined a term for the assessment that all humans are born sinful: [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Vanhoozer, gen. ed., ''Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible'' (Baker, 2005), 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Original sin is "the tendency to sin innate in all human beings".&lt;ref&gt;"original sin" in ''The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English'' (Oxford University, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of original sin is held by the [[Catholic Church]] and most mainstream [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but rejected by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], which holds the similar doctrine of [[ancestral fault]].

"The corruption of original sin extends to every aspect of human nature": to "reason and will" as well as to "appetites and impulses". This condition is sometimes called "[[total depravity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Total depravity does not mean that humanity is as "thoroughly depraved" as it could become.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Berkhof, ''Systematic Theology'' (Eerdmans, 1996), 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Romans 2:14, [[John Calvin]] writes that all people have "some notions of justice and rectitude ... which are implanted by nature" all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Calvin|title=Commentary on Romans|chapter= 2 |url= http://biblehub.com/commentaries/calvin/romans/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam embodied the "whole of human nature" so when Adam sinned "all of human nature sinned".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Testament does not explicitly link the "corruption of human nature" to Adam's sin. However, the "universality of sin" implies a link to Adam. In the New Testament, Paul concurs with the "universality of sin". He also makes explicit what the Old Testament implied: the link between humanity's "sinful nature" and Adam's sin&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, ed., ''A Dictionary of the Bible: Pleroma-Zuzim'' (C. Scribner's Sons, 1902)  s. v. "Sin," 528, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; In Romans 5:19, Paul writes, "through [Adam's] disobedience humanity became sinful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+5:19&amp;version=GW.|title=Bible Gateway passage: Romans 5:19 - GOD’S WORD Translation|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul also applied humanity's sinful nature to himself: "there is nothing good in my sinful nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/nirv/romans/7-18.html|title=Romans 7:18 - NIRV - I know there is nothing good in my sinful natur...|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/sarx.html|title=Sarx - New Testament Greek Lexicon - New American Standard|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological "doctrine of original sin" as an inherent element of human nature is not based only on the Bible. It is in part a "generalization from obvious facts" open to empirical observation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tulloch]], ''Christian Doctrine of Sin'' (Scribner, Armstrong, 1876), 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Empirical view ====
A number of experts on human nature have described the manifestations of original (i.e., the innate tendency to) sin as empirical facts.
*Biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in his ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' states that "a predominant quality" in a successful surviving gene is "ruthless selfishness". Furthermore, "this gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'' (Oxford University, 1989), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Child psychologist Burton L. White, PhD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/10/17/burton-white-believed-children-should-avoid-day-care/DAH01Lkp5efC8pDKOWlKfI/story.html|title=Dr. Burton White, 84, believed children should avoid day care - The Boston Globe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds a "selfish" trait in children from birth, a trait that expresses itself in actions that are "blatantly selfish."&lt;ref&gt;Burton L. White, ''Raising a Happy, Unspoiled Child'' (Touchstone; Rev ed, 1995), 98, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sociologist [[William Graham Sumner]] finds it a fact that "everywhere one meets "fraud, corruption, ignorance, selfishness, and all the other vices of human nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Graham Sumner|title=The Challenge of Facts and Other Essays|publisher=Yale University |year=1914|page= 233|url=https://archive.org/details/challengeoffacts00sumniala}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enumerates "the vices and passions of human nature" as "cupidity, lust, vindictiveness, ambition, and vanity". Sumner finds such human nature to be universal: in all people, in all places, and in all stations in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Social Classes Owe to Each Other'' |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year= 1883|url=https://archive.org/stream/whatsocialclass02sumngoog#page/n134/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Psychiatrist [[Thomas Anthony Harris]], MD, on the basis of his "data at hand", observes "sin, or badness, or evil, or 'human nature', whatever we call the flaw in our species, is apparent in every person". Harris calls this condition "intrinsic badness" or "original sin".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Harris, ''I'm OK — You're OK'' (HarperCollins, 2004, Quill edition), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical discussion questioning the genetic exclusivity of such an intrinsic badness proposition is presented by researchers [[Elliott Sober]] and [[David Sloan Wilson]]. In their book, ''Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'', they propose a theory of multilevel group selection in support of an inherent genetic "altruism" in opposition to the original sin exclusivity for human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson, Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998, 394 pp., {{ISBN|0-674-93046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Realistic view ====
[[Liberal theologians]] in the early 20th century described human nature as "basically good" needing only "proper training and education". But the above examples document the return to a "more realistic view" of human nature "as basically sinful and [[self-centered]]". Human nature needs "to be regenerated ... to be able to live the unselfish life".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regenerated human nature ===
{{Main|Regeneration (theology)}}
According to the Bible, "Adam's disobedience corrupted human nature" but God mercifully "regenerates".&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ed, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'' (Baker, 2001), 399.&lt;/ref&gt; "Regeneration is a radical change" that involves a "renewal of our [human] nature".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to counter original sin, Christianity purposes "a complete transformation of individuals" by Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Vanhoozer, gen. ed., ''Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible'' (Baker, 2005), 135, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of Christ's coming is that fallen humanity might be "conformed to or transformed into the image of Christ who is the perfect image of God", as in 2 Corinthians 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''Created in God's Image'' (Eerdmans, 1986), 21, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament makes clear the "universal need" for regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, eds, ''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' (Mercer University, 1990), 741.&lt;/ref&gt; A sampling of biblical portrayals of regenerating human nature and the behavioral results follow.

==Early modern philosophy==
One of the defining changes that occurred at the end of the Middle Ages was the end of the dominance of Aristotelian philosophy, and its replacement by a new approach to the study of nature, including human nature.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In this approach, all attempts at conjecture about formal and final causes were rejected as useless speculation.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  Also, the term "law of nature" now applied to any regular and predictable pattern in nature, not literally a law made by a divine lawmaker, and, in the same way, "human nature" became not a special metaphysical cause, but simply whatever can be said to be typical tendencies of humans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Although this new realism applied to the study of human life from the beginning—for example, in [[Machiavelli]]'s works—the definitive argument for the final rejection of Aristotle was associated especially with [[Francis Bacon]]. Bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes ("It is a correct position that "true knowledge is knowledge by causes". And causes again are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final") but he adapted these terms and rejected one of the three: &lt;blockquote&gt;But of these the final cause rather corrupts than advances the sciences, except such as have to do with human action. The discovery of the formal is despaired of. The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and received, that is, as remote causes, without reference to the latent process leading to the form) are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Francis Bacon: Novum Organum (1620)|url = http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm|website = www.constitution.org|access-date = 2016-02-23|pages = Book II, Section II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This line of thinking continued with [[René Descartes]], whose new approach returned philosophy or science to its [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] focus upon non-human things. [[Thomas Hobbes]], then [[Giambattista Vico]], and [[David Hume]] all claimed to be the first to properly use a modern Baconian scientific approach to human things.

Hobbes famously followed Descartes in describing humanity as matter in motion, just like machines. He also very influentially described man's natural state (without science and artifice) as one where life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', XIII.9&lt;/ref&gt; Following him, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[empiricism]] also saw human nature as a ''[[tabula rasa]]''. In this view, the mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules, so data are added, and rules for processing them are formed solely by our sensory experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', Kenneth P. Winkler (ed.), Hackett Publishing Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1996, pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] pushed the approach of Hobbes to an extreme and criticized it at the same time. He was a contemporary and acquaintance of Hume, writing before the [[French Revolution]] and long before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. He shocked [[Western culture|Western civilization]] with his [[Second Discourse]] by proposing that humans had once been solitary animals, without reason or language or communities, and had developed these things due to accidents of pre-history. (This proposal was also less famously made by Giambattista Vico.) In other words, Rousseau argued that human nature was not only not fixed, but not even approximately fixed compared to what had been assumed before him. Humans are political, and rational, and have language now, but originally they had none of these things.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, ''The Social Contract'', Translated by Maurice Cranston, Published by Penguin Classics, 1968, {{ISBN|0-14-044201-4}}, pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn implied that living under the management of human reason might not be a happy way to live at all, and perhaps there is no ideal way to live. Rousseau is also unusual in the extent to which he took the approach of Hobbes, asserting that primitive humans were not even naturally social. A civilized human is therefore not only imbalanced and unhappy because of the mismatch between civilized life and human nature, but unlike Hobbes, Rousseau also became well known for the suggestion that primitive humans had been happier, "[[noble savage]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Velkley |first=Richard |title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question |year=2002 |publisher= University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's conception of human nature has been seen as the origin of many intellectual and political developments of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, James, Rousseau and the Ethics of Virtue, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8264-8724-6}}, pg. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt; He was an important influence upon [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], and [[Marx]], and the development of [[German idealism]], [[historicism]], and [[romanticism]].

What human nature did entail, according to Rousseau and the other modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries, were animal-like passions that led humanity to develop language and reasoning, and more complex communities (or communities of any kind, according to Rousseau).

In contrast to Rousseau, David Hume was a critic of the oversimplifying and systematic approach of Hobbes, Rousseau, and some others whereby, for example, all human nature is assumed to be driven by variations of selfishness. Influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], he argued against oversimplification. On the one hand, he accepted that, for many political and economic subjects, people could be assumed to be driven by such simple selfishness, and he also wrote of some of the more social aspects of "human nature" as something which could be destroyed, for example if people did not associate in just societies. On the other hand, he rejected what he called the "paradox of the sceptics", saying that no politician could have invented words like {{"'}}honourable' and 'shameful,' 'lovely' and 'odious,' 'noble' and 'despicable{{'"}}, unless there was not some natural "original constitution of the mind".&lt;ref name=humeENQ&gt;[http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/humemora.pdf An Enquiry into the Sources of Morals] Section 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume—like Rousseau—was controversial in his own time for his modernist approach, following the example of Bacon and Hobbes, of avoiding consideration of metaphysical explanations for any type of cause and effect. He was accused of being an [[Atheism|atheist]]. He wrote: {{quote|We needn't push our researches so far as to ask "Why do we have humanity, i.e. a fellow-feeling with others?" It's enough that we experience this as a force in human nature. Our examination of causes must stop somewhere.&lt;ref name=humeENQ/&gt;}}

After Rousseau and Hume, the nature of philosophy and science changed, branching into different disciplines and approaches, and the study of human nature changed accordingly. Rousseau's proposal that human nature is malleable became a major influence upon international revolutionary movements of various kinds, while Hume's approach has been more typical in Anglo-Saxon countries, including the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Natural science==
{{expand-section|date=June 2018}}
[[Charles Darwin]] gave a widely accepted scientific argument for what Rousseau had already argued from a different direction, that humans and other animal species have no truly fixed nature, at least in the very long term.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, he also gave modern [[biology]] a new way of understanding how human nature does exist in a normal human time-frame,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and how it is caused.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[sociobiology]] and closely related theory of [[evolutionary psychology]] give scientific arguments{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=what arguments?}} against the "''tabula rasa''" hypotheses of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau.  {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In his book ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'' (1998), Wilson claimed that it was time for a cooperation of all the sciences to explore human nature. He defined human nature as a collection of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules: the genetic patterns of mental development. Cultural phenomena, rituals, etc. are products, not part of human nature. Until now, these phenomena were only part of psychological, sociological, and anthropological studies. Wilson proposes that they can be part of [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary research]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Ida Braiman memorial card.jpg|thumb|Memorial card commemorating the death of Ida Braiman]]
'''Ida Braiman''' (died February 5, 1913) (sometimes spelled Brayman, Breiman, or Braeman) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Sewing|garment worker]] killed while [[Strike action|on strike]] for better working conditions in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester, New York.]] Her death brought statewide attention to the 1913 Rochester Garment Workers' Strike.

Not much is known about Braiman's life before she arrived in [[New York (state)|New York State]] as an immigrant to the [[United States]] from [[Zhytomyr|Zhitomyr, Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmHEm5ohoCUC&amp;pg=PA1318&amp;lpg=PA1318&amp;dq=%22ida+braiman%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mju5T5s7w3&amp;sig=GaGZCHsxWpPATyLe_e2ktdSve3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinz5jlrvPYAhVR11MKHZwmCB44ChDoAQg2MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ida%20braiman%22&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of New York State|last=Eisenstadt|first=Peter R.|date=2005|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815608080|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her age at the time of her arrival is given variously as 17 or 18 years old.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/memmott/2016/02/02/memmott-womans-death-changed-garment-industry-here/79668782/|title=Memmott: Killing of teen changed garment industry here|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rochester strike ==
Ida Braiman and her father were participants in a citywide strike of the [[United Garment Workers of America]] only months after her arrival in the United States. On February 5, 1913, she was part of a group of strikers going to small textile factories encouraging workers their to join the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/january-23-labor-martyr-rochester/|title=February 4 (Corrected date): A Labor Martyr in Rochester|date=2014-01-23|work=Jewish Currents|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strikers, a crowd of some seven hundred people, [[Picketing|picketed]] a tailor shop owned by Valentine Sauter. When picketers began to throw stones, Valentine Sauter used a shotgun to fire into the crowd, killing Braiman and injuring three others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/02/06/100387655.html?pageNumber=3|title=GIRL STRIKER SHOT DEAD.; Manufacturer Fires from Window and Also Wounds Three|last=|first=|date=1913-02-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sauter was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, a grand jury declined to indict him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several strikers from the crowd were also arrested for rioting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:1913 Rochester Garment Workers Strike.jpg|right|thumb|1913 Rochester Garment Workers' strike]]

Braiman's death became a rallying point for the striking workers, and garnered support for the strike from middle- and upper-class [[women's suffrage]] organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0o4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101&amp;lpg=PT101&amp;dq=%22ida+braiman%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UT1PoOJiF5&amp;sig=BYhvgCXXonrPE_QvzvLlodEG-ck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinz5jlrvPYAhVR11MKHZwmCB44ChDoAQgqMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ida%20braiman%22&amp;f=false|title=Women Will Vote: Winning Suffrage in New York State|last=Goodier|first=Susan|last2=Pastorello|first2=Karen|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9781501713194|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five thousand people attended her funeral and processed behind the hearse carrying her body to the graveyard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was buried in the Waad Hakolel Jewish cemetery in Rochester.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In one of the releases in 1998, Imakuni? participated as one of the trio members of a one-time session group dubbed "Suzukisan", in which he sang together with popular [[enka]] singer [[Sachiko Kobayashi]] and Raymond Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/250-3836860-5801009?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%83C%83%7D%83N%83j |title=Amazon search on CD and books crediting Imakuni? |accessdate=2007-04-11 |date=2002-04-11 |work=Amazon.co.jp |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imakuni?  also appears sometimes as an enemy with his own personal [[trading card]] devoted to him in the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' series.

While less "live" exposure is found today, Imakuni? continues his activity through a blog run by [[Creatures Inc.]], a creative and designing company mainly engaged in games, card games, 3D graphics and others.

In 2003 he performed in the non-Pokémon related song {{nihongo3|''Koi no Sube-Sube Manjū Gani''|恋のスベスベマンジュウガニ}}, with animation produced by Creatures for [[NHK]]'s [[Minna no Uta]]. Like most of the Japanese ''Pokémon'' songs up to that point (including anime opening and ending songs), this was composed by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]].

==Costumes==
Over the years, he has had several costumes, all which have round, [[Mickey Mouse]] style ears.
#Round ears, black costume with "イマクニ？" [[embroider]]ed on the front. (1996–early 2000s)
#Curly round ears, black costume with "イマクニ？" on an [[LCD screen]] on the front of his costume. This costume had the LCD screen on the front change to match what Pokémon he was saying in Pokémon ierukaNEO?
#Round curly ears, silver costume with "イマクニ？" on the front of his costume. He looks like he is wearing a shaggy bathroom rug on his chest and back.

==Pokémon Trading Card Game==
Imakuni? appears as an adversary in the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)|Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' for the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as its sequel.  The game also features a [[Trainer Card]] of the same name.

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''James Newman-Newman''' (1767–1811) of the British [[Royal Navy]] was an officer who served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] who served in numerous actions with distinction before his death in the wreck of his [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Hero (1803)|HMS ''Hero'']], which was lost with two other battleships off the Northern European coast during a storm in December 1811. Over 2,000 sailors lost their lives.

==Career==
Newman-Newman was born in 1767, and joined the Royal Navy at a young age, serving as a lieutenant aboard the flagship of [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], [[HMS Royal George (1788)|HMS ''Royal George'']] during the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], when a French fleet was defeated deep in the Atlantic by the British [[Channel Fleet]] under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]. Due to good service in this action, Newman-Newman was promoted to captain and took command of a succession of frigates in the [[Mediterranean]] and home waters, beginning with [[HMS Ceres (1781)|HMS ''Ceres'']] in 1795.&lt;ref name="NMM"&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuExplore/PaintingDetail.cfm?ID=BHC2910 Captain James Newman-Newman], ''[[National Maritime Museum]]'', Retrieved 27 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 1796, the sloop [[HMS Lark (1794)|HMS ''Lark'']], under William Ogilvy, joined the ''Ceres'' and Newman-Newman in providing support to an unsuccessful attack by British troops from Port-au-Prince on the town and fort of Léogane on the island of Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;William James and Frederick Chamier. 1837. ''The Naval History of Great Britain''. (London : R. Bentley), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, Newman-Newman was in command of the [[frigate]] [[HMS Mermaid (1782)|HMS ''Mermaid'']] during the campaign against a French fleet which threatened to invade [[Ireland]]. The French force was destroyed at the [[Battle of Tory Island]], in which ''Mermaid'' was not engaged, but the surviving French ships scattered into the Atlantic and ''Mermaid'' was one of the ships tasked with tracking them. On 15 October, ''Mermaid'', in company with the brig [[HMS Kangaroo (1795)|HMS ''Kangaroo'']] discovered the French frigate [[French frigate Loire (1796)|''Loire'']] and gave chase, catching and engaging the French ship.&lt;ref name="WJ2:137"&gt;James, Vol. 2, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; ''Loire'' was too strong for her opponents, however, and despite suffering heavy damage, managed to escape. The following day ''Loire'' was captured by the large [[razee]] [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']], having suffered heavy casualties. ''Mermaid'' had taken 17 casualties herself and Newman-Newman was praised for his conduct.&lt;ref name="WJ2:138"&gt;James, Vol. 2, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Newman-Newman was again involved in the capture of a French frigate, this time as captain of HMS ''Loire'', the same ship he had captured two years previously. The French [[French ship Pallas|''Pallas'']] had been sighted off [[St Malo]] by two small Royal Navy ships and despite the disparity in size, the small craft engaged the much larger frigate.&lt;ref name="WJ3:30"&gt;James, Vol. 3, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pallas'' was able to hold off her diminutive opponents, but in the afternoon of 5 February 1800 a squadron led by Newman-Newman in ''Loire'' arrived. In the engagement which followed, the five British ships fought a lengthy battle with ''Pallas'' and French shore batteries under which the frigate was sheltering until eventually ''Pallas'' surrendered. ''Loire'' had suffered 22 casualties.&lt;ref name="WJ3:31"&gt;James, Vol. 3, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15231|pages=154–155|date=15 February 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, Newman-Newman was briefly in reserve during the [[Peace of Amiens]], but he soon returned to service as commander of a ship of the line following the resumption of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the following year. In the summer of 1809 he was called as a witness at the [[Court-martial of James, Lord Gambier]] which assessed whether Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]] had failed to support Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] at the [[Battle of Basque Roads]] in April 1809. Gambier was controversially cleared of all charges.&lt;ref name="Gurney"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gurney | first = W.B. | authorlink = | year = 1809 | title = Minutes of a court-martial . . . on the trial of James Lord Gambier | publisher = Mottey, Harrison &amp; Miller | url = https://archive.org/details/minutesacourtma00gurngoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman-Newman's service was in Home Waters and the [[Baltic Sea]], and in 1811 he was tasked with escorting a large convoy from [[Gothenburg]] to [[London]] in his ship [[HMS Hero (1803)|HMS ''Hero'']]. Returning in late 1811 the convoy, which had joined with parts of the British Baltic Fleet, was struck by a huge storm which wrecked over 30 merchant ships and on 24 December claimed the flagship [[HMS St George (1785)|HMS ''St George'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']]. Hundreds of sailors were drowned including Admiral [[Robert Carthew Reynolds]].&lt;ref name="WJ5:349"&gt;James, Vol. 5, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, [[Christmas Day]] 1811, HMS ''Hero'' was also driven ashore, onto the Haak Sands off the [[Texel]]. Weather conditions were so severe that no boats could be launched and no rescue attempted and as a result only 12 men from a crew of several hundred reached safety. Newman-Newman was not among them.&lt;ref name="WJ5:350"&gt;James, Vol. 5, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Paul "Buck" Buchanan''' (30 April 1867 – 22 February 1937) served as [[U.S. Representative]] from the [[United States House of Representatives, Texas District 10|10th district]] of [[Texas]] from 1913 until his death on 22 February 1937.

==Biography==
Buchanan was born in Midway, [[Orangeburg County, South Carolina]] on April 30, 1867; later that year, his family moved to Texas and settled near [[Chapel Hill, Texas|Chapel Hill]] in [[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]]. He attended the local schools of Chapel Hill, and in 1889 he received his law degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]]

Later in 1889, Buchanan began a law practice in Washington County, and almost immediately became involved in politics as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].  He served as a county justice of the peace from 1889 to 1892, and as the county's prosecuting attorney from 1892 to 1899.  From 1899 to 1906, Buchanan was the district attorney for the twenty-first judicial district.

Buchanan was a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1906 to 1913.  In 1913, he was elected to the Sixty-third Congress, filling the vacancy left by the resignation of [[Albert Sidney Burleson]].  Buchanan was elected to a full term in the Sixty-fourth Congress, and won reelection eleven times.  He served in the US House from April 15, 1913 to February 22, 1937, and was the chairman of the [[United States House Appropriations Committee|House Committee on Appropriations]] from 1933 until his death.

During the 1930s, Buchanan was recognized as a member of the Miller Group, conservative Democrats who were opposed to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]], and led by lobbyist [[Henry Pomeroy Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |series=[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]] |title=The Path to Power |year=1982 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0394499735 |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Buchanan died in [[Washington, DC]] on February 22, 1937.  He was buried at Prairie Lea Cemetery in [[Brenham, Texas]].

He was succeeded in Congress by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], then the head of the [[National Youth Administration]] in Texas, who later became the 36th President of the United States.

==Legacy==
[[Buchanan Dam]] and the lake it forms, [[Lake Buchanan (Texas)|Lake Buchanan]], are named in his honor. Both are located about 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Burnet, Texas]].

{{nihongo|'''Junichi Masuda'''|増田 順一|Masuda Jun'ichi|born January 12, 1968}} is a Japanese [[video game composer]], [[Video game developer|director]], [[video game designer|designer]], [[Video game producer|producer]], and [[game programmer|programmer]] best known for his work in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise. He is a member of the [[Game Freak]] [[board of directors]], and has been employed at the company since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketmonsters.net/Miyazaki_Interview_Anime_OST |title=Interview with Shinji Miyazaki and the Game Freak sound team - #pocketmonsters, your source for news about Pokémon and Pocket Monsters |publisher=Pocketmonsters.net |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of new ''Pokémon'' games, Masuda took new roles in future projects. He began to produce and direct games, starting with [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], and became responsible for approving new character models. His style seeks to keep games accessible while still adding increasing levels of complexity. His work sticks to older mainstays of the series, including a focus on [[handheld game consoles]] and [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]]. His music draws inspiration from the work of modern celebrated composers like [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], though he used the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series as a model of good video game composition.

==Life==
Masuda was born on January 12, 1968 in [[Yokohama]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=Profile|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/|work=Hidden Power of Masuda: Director's Column|publisher=[[Game Freak]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, his family often vacationed in [[Kyūshū]], where many of his relatives still live. There he spent his time catching fish and insects, an act that later influenced his video game design. Masuda modeled the ''Pokémon'' series' [[Hoenn#Synopsis|Hoenn Region]] after Kyūshū in an attempt to recapture his memories of summers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=No. 15|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=29|work=Hidden Power of Masuda: Director's Column|publisher=[[Game Freak]]|accessdate=3 June 2010|date=9 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In high school, Masuda played the [[trombone]]; he soon discovered classical music, and was drawn in by works like [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[The Rite of Spring]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 5]].&lt;ref name=onehundredandnine&gt;{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=No. 109|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=154|work=Hidden Power of Masuda: Director's Column|publisher=[[Game Freak]]|accessdate=3 June 2010|date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the company first began releasing ''Pokémon'' titles, Masuda worked mainly as the composer, though he did minor programming work as well, and later began directing and producing them.&lt;ref name=Nutt/&gt; His work on the first games included writing the program to play audio in the games, music, and sound effects.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Masuda has been directly involved in the naming and design of [[List of Pokémon|many Pokémon]].

On September 28, 2018, Masuda revealed that during the early years of developing ''Pokémon'' games that "game data was nearly lost in a computer crash". Masuda described it as "the most nerve-racking moment in development", saying "“We were developing the game on these Unix computer stations called the Sun SPARCstation 1. We’re developing, and they’re these Unix boxes, and they crashed quite a bit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/pokemon-junichi-masuda-computer-crash-lost-all-data-nerve-racking-development-1923694|title=Pokemon Game Veteran Junichi Masuda Recalls 'Most Nerve-Racking Moment'|work=NDTV Gadgets360.com|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November&amp;nbsp;1, 2018, Masuda stated that [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']] would likely be his final time serving as director for the main series Pokémon games. In the announcement interview, he stated that he wished to pass on the development torch to the younger generation of developers at Game Freak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Santangelo|publisher=IGN|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018|title=Pokemon Let's Go is 'Probably' the Last Pokemon Game Junichi Masuda Will Direct|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/01/pokemon-lets-go-is-probably-the-last-pokemon-game-junichi-masuda-will-direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and style==
Masuda approaches each of his games with the mindset that a beginner should be able to easily play it.&lt;ref name=Hoggins&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoggins|first=Tom|title=Pokémania continues with ''Pokémon Platinum''|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/5313944/Pokemonia-continues-with-Pokemon-Platinum.html|accessdate=1 June 2010|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 May 2009|agency=Telegraph Media Group|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, he layers more complicated concepts, introducing them to the player in a simple manner, and building from there.&lt;ref name=Nutt/&gt; He believes that [[Handheld game console|handheld systems]] provide an opportunity for social interaction that cannot be found on [[Video game console|non-handheld console systems]].&lt;ref name=Hoggins/&gt; He has stated that continuing use of [[2D computer graphics]] has been integral to Pokémon's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nutt|first=Christian|title=Pokemon's Masuda: 2D Brings 'Flavor' To Series' Visuals|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23052|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]. Think Services|accessdate=2 June 2010|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masuda's musical style draws from a number of sources, particularly [[classical music]] and the works of [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; His favorite musical genre is [[techno]], and he has looked to the music of the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Super Mario]]'' series as an example of [[video game music]] that works well.&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; Most of his ideas are inspired from simply observing real life and visualizing how he would design or draw outside objects.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|title=Pokemon Creators on Platinum|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/956/956279p2.html|publisher=IGN.

===Journalist===
On September 1, 1859,{{sfn|White|1899|p=153}} at the age of 18,{{sfn|Crawford|1889|pp=95-96}} she married [[Isaac R. Sherwood]], afterwards General, [[Secretary of state]] and [[Congressman]] from Ohio. The general was the editor of the [[Canton, Ohio]] ''Daily News-Democrat'', and attracted to journalism, she learned everything in the line of newspaper work from [[typesetting]] to [[editorial writer|leader-writing]]. While the husband was in Congress, Sherman served as Washington correspondent for Ohio journals.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}} In 1883, General Sherwood became the sole proprietor of the ''[[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] Journal]]''; Kate Sherwood assisted in the editorial management of the paper, until 1886, when Condict C. Packard and E. J. Tippett purchased the establishment.{{sfn|Scribner|1910|p=333}} For 10 years, she edited the woman's department of the soldier organ, the ''[[National Tribune]]'' of Washington D.C. Her career as a journalist and society woman was varied and busy. She was one of the first members of the [[Literary Society of Washington|Washington Literary Club]], and the [[Sorosis]] of [[New York City]]; she also served as vice-president for Ohio in the first call for a national congress of women.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}}

In the spring of 1885, she published "Camp Fire and Memorial Poems," a volume of recitations for Grand Army camp fires, which was widely read, and some of the poems were translated into German;{{sfn|Crawford|1889|pp=95-96}} it passed through several editions.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}} She was the chosen singer for many national celebratioans, including army reunions, and in 1887, was the only northern poet ever invited by ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] to celebrate the heroism of a southern soldier. The broad, liberal and delicate manner in which she responded to that significant honor in her poem at the unveiling of the [[equestrian statue]] of [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], elicited praise.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}} "Mission Ridge" was an account of the bravery and death of a drummer boy. "A Soldier's Retrospect" reminisced after the Civil War. "The Men who Wore the Shield" was a spirited patriotic address.{{sfn|Music Teachers National Association|1901|p=547}} "The Drummer Boy of Mission Ridge" was an account of the bravery and death of a drummer boy.{{sfn|Werner|1899|p=23}} Having studied French and German, Sherwood's translations of [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ]], and [[Friedrich von Bodenstedt]] were widely copied.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}}

===Social reformer===
Sherwood was the organizer of the first auxiliary to the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] outside of [[New England]], and was a founder in 1883 of the national association known as the [[Woman's Relief Corps]], Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic. She served that order as the first National Senior Vice-President and the second National President (1884–85),{{sfn|Woman's Relief Corps (U.S.)|1914|p=229-231}} organized the department of relief and instituted the National Home for Army Nurses, in [[Geneva, Ohio]].

==Personal life==
Sherwood was a lifelong member of the [[Presbyterian Church]]. She made her home in Canton,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=653}} but died at her home in [[Washington, D.C.]] on February 15, 1914, aged 72.{{sfn|Woman's Relief Corps (U.S.)|1914|pp=229-31}} Their son, James Brownlee Sherwood, was associated with the father in the publishing business.{{sfn|White|1899|p=153}} Their daughter was Lenore Sherwood.&lt;ref name="riversidecemeteryjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kate Brownlee Sherwood (1841-1914)|url=http://www.riversidecemeteryjournal.com/People/People/page133.html|publisher=Riverside Cemetery Journal|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Albert Sidney Johnston'' memorial poem==
[[File:MetCemConfederateSteed.jpg|thumb|Albert Sidney Johnston Equestrian Statue]]
''Albert Sidney Johnston'' was a memorial poem, written by Sherwood at the invitation of the Executive Committee for the Unveiling Ceremonies of the General Albert Sidney Johnston Equestrian Statue, held under the auspices of the [[Army of Tennessee|Army of the Tennessee, Louisiana Division (Ex-Confederate)]] at New Orleans, April 6, 1887, 25th Anniversary of the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and of General Johnston's death. Sherwood received the following letter:{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=131-32}} {{quote|text=''At the unveiling of the equestrian statue to General Albert Sidney Johnston, April 6, 1887, in the city of New Orleans, on the memorial day of the association of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, your poem, sent us from your Northern home, a graceful tribute to him and our heroic dead, was read to an appreciative and admiring throng. In grateful response, the Association returns, with its greeting, its accompanying badge. The center bears the [[Southern Cross of Honor|Confederate Cross]], and the Pelican is of metal taken from a rivet of the statue itself. As "Peace hath her victories no less than War", we join heart with hand in reciprocating the cordial and fraternal sentiments set in those sweet and stirring strains, in which a woman's true soul, giving all honor to the knightly men and the gallant deeds on either side, in that "Great war that made ambition virtue", commemorates in charming numbers our day of reunion when veterans of the Blue and the Gray met. "But not as rivals, nor as foes, as brothers reconciled. To twine love's fragrant roses where the thorns of hate grew wild." We greet you in your own fitting words: "Our Country's Future. One heart, one hope, one destiny, one flag from sea to sea."''}}

'''Maurice Fargues''' (April 23, 1913 – September 17, 1947) was a [[Underwater diving|diver]] with the [[French Navy]] and a close associate of commander [[Philippe Tailliez]] and deputy commander [[Jacques Cousteau]].&lt;ref name="Plaque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scuba-museum.com/images/album6/index.html|title=INAUGURATION DE LA SALLE MAURICE FARGUES|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1946, Fargues saved the lives of Cousteau and [[Frédéric Dumas]] during their dive into the [[Fontaine-de-Vaucluse|Fountain of Vaucluse]]. On September 17, 1947, while attempting to set a new depth record, Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an [[Aqua-lung|aqualung]].&lt;ref name="Matsen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matsen, Brad |title=Jacques Cousteau:  The Sea King |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=2009 |pages=73, 76–79, 85 |isbn=978-0-375-42413-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sowUaeKaJSMC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GRS and the Fountain of Vaucluse ==
In late 1945, Petty Officer Maurice Fargues joined the newly formed [[Groupe de Recherches Sous-marines|GRS]] (now called CEPHISMER), commanded by Philippe Tailliez, with Cousteau as its deputy commander and Dumas as civilian adviser and chief diver. Dumas trained Fargues and the GRS' other two new recruits, Petty Officers Jean-Paul Pinard and Guy Morandière, as Aqua-Lung divers.&lt;ref name="Matsen"/&gt; Maurice Fargues became commander of the diving tender ''VP 8'', a 21,6-meter (72-foot) twin-screw launch.&lt;ref name="Cousteau"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Jacques Cousteau|last1=Cousteau|first1=J. Y.|authorlink2=Frédéric Dumas|last2=Dumas|first2=Frédéric|year=1953|title=[[The Silent World (book)|The Silent World]]|location=New York|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers]]|lccn=52-5431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 1946, the GRS dove into the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring in the village of [[Vaucluse]], hoping to discover the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the guide rope which allowed divers to communicate with the surface. Tailliez and Morandière dove together first, but they were rapidly affected by a narcosis that almost compromised their return to the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas dove together, they suffered the same symptoms, and Tailliez and Fargues probably saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface. It was later determined that [[carbon monoxide]] had unexpectedly contaminated the air in their cylinders.&lt;ref name="Matsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cousteau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Robert F.|authorlink=Robert Forrest Burgess|title=The Cave Divers|year=1999|publisher=Aqua Quest Publications|location=[[Locust Valley, New York]]|pages=30–43|isbn=1-881652-11-4|lccn=96-39661|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbwrLGZDMHMC&amp;pg=PA30|chapter=Forty Fathoms to the Great Hall of Night}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In September 1947, just before the "Salon Nautique" in Paris, Cousteau insisted to organize a series of deep diving attempts to determine the maximum depth a [[scuba diving|scuba]] diver could reach. On September 17, Maurice Fargues made the first deep diving attempt near the French Navy base at [[Toulon]].&lt;ref name="Ecott"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ecott, Tim |title=Neutral Buoyancy:  Adventures in a Liquid World |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=124–125 |isbn=0-87113-794-1 |lccn=2001018840 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Dw7htaxwtUC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice Fargues descended an anchor line with marker slates attached at 10 metres intervals, allowing him to sign his name on them to certify the depth he had reached, and periodically tugged on a safety line attached to his weight belt to let his colleague Frédéric Dumas on the surface know that he was alive. After three minutes, at a record-setting depth of {{convert|120|m|ft}}, Maurice Fargues stopped signalling. Philippe Tailliez ordered that he be pulled up, and Jean Pinard dove to meet him at 60 meters depth, only to discover that Fargues was unconscious, his mouthpiece hanging on his chest. Resuscitation attempts were continued for twelve hours, but Fargues was dead. [[Nitrogen narcosis]] or [[oxygen toxicity]] had caused him to lose his mouthpiece and drown.&lt;ref name="Matsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cousteau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecott"/&gt;

Fargues' scrawled signature on the slate at {{convert|120|m|ft}} confirmed his depth record. The GRS concluded that {{convert|90|m|ft}} was the maximum depth a diver using [[compressed air]] could reach.&lt;ref name="Matsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cousteau"/&gt; In the words of Jacques Cousteau: "Dumas and I owed our lives to Maurice Fargues, who had resurrected us from the death cave at Vaucluse. We will not be consoled that we were unable to save him."&lt;ref name="Cousteau"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
On September 17, 2007, the sixtieth anniversary of Fargues' death, a room was dedicated in his honor as the "Salle Maurice Fargues" at the [[Musée Frédéric-Dumas|Musée International de la Plongée Frédéric Dumas]] in [[Sanary-sur-Mer]], [[France]]. Fargues' children, Roselyne and Louis Fargues, were present at the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Plaque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musee"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plongeur.com/magazine/2007/09/19/musee-plongee-sous-marine-frederic-dumas/|title=Nouvelle salle au Musée International de la Plongée Frédéric Dumas|last=Charleux|first=Fabrice|journal=Plongeur.com|date=19 September 2007|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room contains a plaque bearing a photograph of Fargues taken before his final dive and a reproduction of his final scrawled signature.&lt;ref name="Plaque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taillez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippe.tailliez.net/article30.html|title=Naissance du GERS et des premiers plongeurs démineurs|date=1 December 2006|publisher=philippe.tailliez.net|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2012, a conference {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO_FfPdsX3U|title=Hommage à Maurice FARGUES ''La mer est calme, le ciel est clair''}} was given by Bernard Tailliez, son of Commander Philippe Tailliez, as part of a series of lectures entitled ''Les fils de Philippe Tailliez - 10 ans après'', organised by the ''[[Defence Historical Service|Service historique de la Défense]]'' at the ''Escale Castigneau'' ([[Military port of Toulon]]), honoring the memory of Philippe Tailliez, Petty Officer Maurice Fargues and the birth of the GRS. Fargues' children, Roselyne and Louis Fargues, were present at the ceremony.

A moral act is a type of behavior that refers has either a moral or immoral consequence. In many cultures, a moral act refers to an act that entails [[free will]], purity, [[liberty]], [[honesty]], and meaning, whereas an immoral act refers to an act that entails [[corruption]] and fraudulence.

Some psychologists that have worked in the field are: [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Elliot Turiel]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], [[Linda Skitka]], Leland Saunders, [[Marc Hauser]], [[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]], [[Jean Decety]], [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]], A. Peter McGraw, [[Philip Tetlock]], [[Darcia Narvaez]], Tobias Krettenauer, Liane Young, Daniel Hart, Suzanne Fegley, and Fiery Cushman. Philosophers that have worked in the field include [[Stephen Stich]], John Doris, [[Joshua Knobe]], John Mikhail, [[Shaun Nichols]], [[Thomas Nagel]], Robert C. Roberts, [[Jesse Prinz]], [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]], and [[R. Jay Wallace]].

== Background ==

Moral psychology began with early philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Socrates]]. They believed that "to know the good is to do the good". They analyzed the ways in which people make decisions with regards to moral identity. As the field of psychology began to divide away from philosophy, moral psychology expanded to include [[risk perception]] and moralization, [[Medical ethics|morality with regards to medical practices]], concepts of [[self-worth]], and the role of emotions when analyzing one's moral identity. In most introductory psychology courses, students learn about moral psychology by studying the psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research|last=Kohlberg|first=L.|date=1969|publisher=Rand McNally|editor-last=Goslin|editor-first=David|location=Chicago|pages=347–480|chapter=Stage and sequence: The cognitive development approach to socialization}}&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced the [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|moral development theory]] in 1969. This theory was built on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s observation that children develop intuitions about justice that they can later articulate. The increasing sophistication of articulation of reasoning is a sign of development. Moral cognitive development centered around justice and guided moral action increase with development, resulting in a postconventional thinker that can "do no other" than what is reasoned to be the most moral action. But researchers using the Kohlberg model found a gap between what people said was most moral and actions they took. Today, some psychologists and students{{Where|date=February 2018}} alike rely on Augusto Blasi's self-model{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} that link ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment. Those with moral goals central to the self-concept are more likely to take moral action, as they feel a greater obligation to do so. Those who are motivated will attain a unique moral identity.&lt;ref name="Hardy, S. A. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=S. A.|last2=Carlo|first2=G.|date=|year=2011|title=Moral identity: What is it, how does it develop, and is it linked to moral action?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gustavo_Carlo/publication/229948988_Moral_Identity_What_Is_It_How_Does_It_Develop_and_Is_It_Linked_to_Moral_Action/links/59dbf9a9458515e9ab4526fc/Moral-Identity-What-Is-It-How-Does-It-Develop-and-Is-It-Linked-to-Moral-Action.pdf|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=5|issue=3|pages=212–218|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00189.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, early philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato engaged in both [[empirical research]] and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[conceptual analysis]] about the ways in which people make decisions about issues that raise moral concerns. With the development of psychology as a discipline separate from philosophy, it was natural for psychologists to continue pursuing work in moral psychology, and much of the empirical research of the 20th century in this area was completed by academics working in psychology departments.

Today, moral psychology is a thriving area of research in both philosophy and psychology, even at an [[interdisciplinary]] level.&lt;ref&gt;Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg questioned boys and young men about their thought processes when they were faced with a [[moral dilemma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|title=The development of modes of moral thinking and choice in the years 10 to 16.|date=1958|degree=PhD|location=Chicago|oclc=1165315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Measurement of Moral Judgment|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Kohlberg|first2=Lawrence|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-521-32565-3|series=Standard Issue Scoring Manual|volume=2|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing one of many very useful empirical studies in the area of moral psychology. As another example, the philosopher [[Joshua Knobe]] recently{{When|date=February 2018}} completed an [[empirical study]] on how the way in which an ethical problem is phrased dramatically affects an individual's intuitions about the proper moral response to the problem.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} More conceptually focused research has been completed by researchers such as John Doris. Doris discusses the way in which [[Social psychology|social psychological]] experiments—such as the [[Stanford prison experiment]]s involving the idea of [[Situationism (psychology)|situationism]]—call into question a key component in [[virtue ethics]]: the idea that individuals have a single, environment-independent moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior|last=Doris|first=John M.|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1-316-02549-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}} As a further example, [[Shaun Nichols]] (2004) examines how empirical data on psychopathology suggests that [[moral rationalism]] is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sentimental Rules: On the Natural Foundations of Moral Judgment|last=Nichols|first=Shaun|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-988347-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}

== Key Theorists in Moral Psychology ==
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was one of the forerunners in the development of an empirical measure for moral reasoning. He proposed [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|six stages]] broken into 3 categories of moral reasoning that, he believed to be universal to all people in all cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|title=1. Stages of moral development as a basis for moral education|date=1971-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/9781442656758-004|work=Moral Education|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442656758|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Throughout his career, he focused on narrowing his focus deeper and deeper into a bedrock of human moral reasoning. one of his famous accomplishments was the development of a moral dilemma known as ''The [[Heinz dilemma|Heinz Dilemma]]'' in which the reader would follow a character, Heinz, through a dilemma to either steal a drug to possibly save his wife from death by cancer, or not steal the drug. Any participants were asked to respond and provide their reasoning for why or why not Heinz should steal the drug for his wife; in so answering, and given their reasoning about why Heinz should or should not steal it, Kohlberg could reliably come to a rational and empirical conclusion about the moral stage the participant was in. 

==Measures==
Philosophers and psychologists have created structured interviews and surveys as a means to study moral psychology and its development.

===Interview techniques===
Since at least 1894, philosophers and psychologists attempted to empirically evaluate the morality of an individual, especially attempting to distinguish adults from children in terms of their judgment, but the efforts failed because they "attempted to quantify how much morality an individual had—a notably contentious idea—rather than understand the individual's psychological representation of morality".&lt;ref name="Wendorf2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendorf|first=Craig A|date=|year=2001|title=History of American morality research, 1894–1932|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig_Wendorf/publication/247411256_History_of_American_morality_research_1894-1932/links/585d17bc08ae6eb8719ff203/History-of-American-morality-research-1894-1932.pdf|journal=History of Psychology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=272–288|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.4.3.272|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Kohlberg addressed that difficulty in 1963 by modeling evaluative diversity as reflecting a series of developmental stages (à la Jean Piaget). [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] are:&lt;ref name="higheststage"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | year=1973 | pages=630–646 | doi=10.2307/2025030 | issue=18 | jstor=2025030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Obedience and punishment orientation
# Self-interest orientation
# Interpersonal accord and conformity
# Authority and social-order maintaining orientation
# Social contract orientation
# Universal ethical principles

Stages 1 and 2 are combined into a single stage labeled "pre-conventional", and stages 5 and 6 are combined into a single stage labeled "post-conventional" for the same reason; psychologists can consistently categorize subjects into the resulting four stages using the "Moral Judgement Interview" which asks subjects why they endorse the answers they do to a standard set of moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's [[cluster analysis]] of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the "caring" or "communal" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the "deliberative" cluster had sophisticated [[epistemic]] and moral reasoning, and the "brave" or "ordinary" cluster was less distinguished by personality.&lt;ref name="Walker2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Lawrence J. | last2=Frimer | first2=Jeremy A. | last3=Dunlop | first3=William L. | title=Varieties of moral personality: beyond the banality of heroism | journal=Journal of Personality | volume=78 | year=2010 | pages=907–942 | issue=3| pmid=20573130 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00637.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey instruments===
Between 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments.&lt;ref name=Wendorf2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verplaetse2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Verplaetse | first=Jan | title=Measuring the moral sense: morality tests in continental Europe between 1910 and 1930 | journal= Paedagogica Historica | volume=44 | issue=3 | year=2008 | pages=265–286 | doi=10.1080/00309230701722721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes. As early as 1926, catalogs of personality tests included sections specifically for morality tests, though critics persuasively argued that they merely measured awareness of social expectations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Moral Development|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|date=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-064760-5|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=1|location=San Francisco|oclc=7307342}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}

Meanwhile, Kohlberg inspired a new wave of morality tests. The [[Defining Issues Test]] (dubbed "Neo-Kohlbergian" by its constituents) scores relative preference for post-conventional justifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Development in Judging Moral Issues|last=Rest|first=James R.|date=1979|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0891-1|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Moral Judgment Test scores consistency of one's preferred justifications.&lt;ref name="Lind1978"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sozialisation und Moral|last=Lind|first=Georg|publisher=Beltz|year=1978|isbn=9783407511348|editor-last=Portele|editor-first=G.|location=Weinheim|pages=171–201|language=German|trans-title=Socialization and Morality|chapter=Wie misst man moralisches Urteil?

Problems and alternative ways of measuring a complex construct|oclc=715635639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both treat evaluative ability as similar to [[IQ]] (hence the single score), allowing categorization by high score vs. low score.

The [[Jonathan Haidt#Moral Foundations Theory|Moral Foundations Questionnaire]] is based on moral intuitions consistent across cultures: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation (liberty/oppression may be added). The questions ask respondents to rate what they consider morally relevant post-consciously (i.e. this is not a behavioral measure). The purpose of the questionnaire is to measure the degree to which people rely upon different sets of moral intuitions (which may coexist), rather than to categorize decision-makers, but the first two foundations cluster together with liberal political orientation and the latter three cluster with conservative political orientation.&lt;ref name="Graham2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Jesse|last2=Haidt|first2=Jonathan|last3=Nosek|first3=Brian A.|date=|year=2009|title=Liberals and conservatives rely on different sets of moral foundations|url=http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/GHN2009.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=96|issue=5|pages=1029–1046|doi=10.1037/a0015141|pmid=19379034|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Graham | first1=J. | last2=Haidt | first2=J.| last3=Koleva | first3=S.| last4=Motyl | first4=M.| last5=Iyer | first5=R.| last6=Wojcik | first6=S.| last7=Ditto | first7=P.H.| title=Moral Foundations Theory: The pragmatic validity of moral pluralism | journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume=47 | year=2013 | pages=55–130 | url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GHKMIWD.inpress.MFT.AESP.pdf | format=PDF | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-407236-7.00002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moral DNA survey by [[Roger Steare]] asks respondents to rank their virtues, then divides respondents by three virtue clusters: obedience, care, and reason. The survey was developed for use in business settings, especially to raise awareness of ways perceived [[workplace discrimination]] diminishes effective evaluative diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethicability: (n) How to Decide What's Right and Find the Courage to Do It|last1=Steare|first1=Roger|last2=Roger Steare Consulting Limited|date=2006|publisher=Roger Steare Consulting Limited|year=|isbn=978-0-9552369-0-7|location=London|pages=|oclc=70173013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, some of Kohlberg's measures were tested when Anne Colby and William Damon published a study in which the development of extraordinary moral development was examined in the lives of moral exemplars. In order to specifically show how people may develop exceptional moral commitments, the researchers focused on the two stories of women seen as moral exemplars. They came from different backgrounds and yet had similar moral development over the course of their lives. After finding these participants that exhibited high levels of moral commitment in their everyday behavior, the researchers utilized the moral judgement interview (MJI) to compare the 23 exemplars (including the two women) with a more ordinary group of people. The researchers also put the 23 exemplars through two standard dilemmas to assess what level they were on in Kohlberg's stages. The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. It was found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the "moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements. For example, the moral exemplars would feed their own children, but then go farther and fight to end world hunger on a global scale as well. In order to encourage this strong sense of moral development in children and adolescents, it is recommended to encourage a sense of empowerment and to also show a positive and optimistic approach to life.

==Theories==

===Moral identity===
Empirical studies show that reasoning and emotion only moderately predicted moral action. Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|date=1980|title=Bridging moral cognition and moral action: A critical review of the literature.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1–45|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.88.1.1|issn=0033-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality.  According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. 
Studies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Carlo | first2 = G. | year = 2005 | title = Identity as a source of moral motivation | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 232–256 | doi=10.1159/000086859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Colby and William Damon suggest that one's moral identity is formed through that individual's synchronization of their personal and moral [[goal]]s. This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Morality in Everyday Life: Developmental Perspectives|last1=Colby|first1=Anne|last2=Damon|first2=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-66586-5|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&amp;pg=PA362 362]|chapter=The Development of Extraordinary Moral Commitment|editor-last2=Hart|editor-first2=Daniel|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&amp;pg=PA342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&amp;pg=PA361 361–362]}} The research suggests that a "transformation of goals" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event.{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=354}} Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a [[Trauma (psychology)|traumatic life event]], or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision from God]]. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, "extensions in scope, intensity and breadth".{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5gp4S52D5koC&amp;pg=PA364 364]}} Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an "active receptiveness"{{Sfn|Colby|Damon|1999|p=350}} to things exterior to themselves.

Daniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their "ideal self" into their "actual self". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the "actual self". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a "goody-goody" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars.They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a [[semantic space]] analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=D.|last2=Fegley|first2=S.|date=|year=1995|title=Prosocial behavior and caring in adolescence: Relations to self-understanding and social judgment|url=http://www.uca.edu.ar/uca/common/grupo18/files/hartfegley1995CD.pdf|journal=Child Development|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1346–1359|doi=10.2307/1131651|pmid=7555220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Wong (philosopher)|David Wong]] proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of "language" where there is plenty of room for different "dialects", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |pages=79–105 |chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Blasi's theory on [[moral character]], moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices. He theorized [[Volition (psychology)|willpower]], moral desires, and integrity have the capability for a person to act morally by the hierarchical order of virtues. He believed that the "highest" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the "lowest" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues. The end goals of moral development identity are to establish and act upon core goals, as well as and use one's strengths to make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Character Psychology and Character Education|last=Blasi|first=Augusto|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-268-03371-2|editor-last=Lapsley|editor-first=Daniel|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|pages=67–100|chapter=Moral character: A psychological approach|editor-last2=Power|editor-first2=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral self===

A "moral self" is fostered by mutually-responsive [[Parenting styles|parenting]] in childhood. Children with responsive parents develop more empathy, prosociality, a moral self and conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|date=2002|title=Mutually Responsive Orientation Between Mothers and Their Young Children: A Context for the Early Development of Conscience|url=|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=6|pages=191–195|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00198|issn=0963-7214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darcia Narvazes describes the neurobiological and social elements of early experience and their effects on moral capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture, and Wisdom (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|publisher=W.

The moral self results when people integrate moral values into their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krettenauer | first1 = T | year = 2011 | title = The dual moral self: Moral centrality and internal moral motivation | url = | journal = The Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 172 | issue = | pages = 309–328 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.538451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the moral self has mostly focused on adolescence as a critical time period for the integration of self and morality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Regulation and Autonomy|last=Krettenauer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-107-02369-7|editor-last=Sokol|editor-first=Bryan|pages=115–140|chapter=Revisiting the moral self construct: Developmental perspectives on moral selfhood|editor-last2=Grouzet|editor-first2=Frederick|editor-last3=Müller|editor-first3=Ulrich|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVRsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. self and morality are traditionally seen as separate constructs that become integrated in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Self-Understanding in Childhood and Adolescence|last1=Damon|first1=William|last2=Hart|first2=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-521-30791-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the moral self may be established around age 2–3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emde|first1=R.|last2=Biringen|first2=Z.|last3=Clyman|first3=R.|last4=Oppenheim|first4=D.|date=|year=1991|title=The moral self of infancy: Affective core and procedural knowledge|url=http://ericastiftelsen.se/doc/EPU_13.16/Emde_Clyman_1991.pdf|journal=Developmental Review|volume=11|issue=|pages=251–270|doi=10.1016/0273-2297(91)90013-e|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2002 | title = Committed compliance, moral self, and internalization: A mediational model | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 339–351 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.3.339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, children as young as 5 years-old are able to consistently identify themselves as having certain moral behavioral preferences.&lt;ref name="Krettenauer, T. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krettenauer|first1=T.|last2=Campbell|first2=S.|last3=Hertz|first3=S.|date=|year=2013|title=Moral emotions and the development of the moral self in childhood|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tobias_Krettenauer/publication/271672618_Moral_emotions_and_the_development_of_the_moral_self_in_childhood/links/5540fc170cf2718618dc965b/Moral-emotions-and-the-development-of-the-moral-self-in-childhood.pdf|journal=European Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=10|issue=|pages=159–173|doi=10.1080/17405629.2012.762750|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's moral self is also increasingly predictive of moral emotions with age.&lt;ref name="Krettenauer, T. 2013"/&gt;

===Moral values===

Kristiansen and Hotte{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} review many research articles regarding people's values and attitudes and whether they guide behavior. With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.

Another issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to "create" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the "value justification hypothesis".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of "traditional family values" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own "anger at women's rising independence." Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.

Kristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on "other-oriented" biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Kristiansen|first1=Connie M|last2=Hotte|first2=Alan M|date=1996|title=Morality and the self: Implications for the when and how of value-attitude-behavior relations|conference=The Psychology of Values: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology|publisher=Erlbaum Hillsdale, NJ|volume=8|pages=77–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H. Schwartz]] defines individual values as "conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S. H.|date=|year=1999|title=A Theory of Cultural Values and Some Implications for Work|url=http://130.18.86.27/faculty/warkentin/SecurityPapers/Merrill/Schwartz1999_APIR48_1_CulturalValues.pdf|journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23–47|doi=10.1080/026999499377655|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values form the basis for social norms, laws, customs and practices. While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).

===Moral virtues===
Piaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189–212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are "fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape" and that over time, people develop greater "moral expertise".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}} 

===Moral reasoning===

Jean Piaget, in watching children play games, noted how their rationales for cooperation changed with experience and maturation. He identified two stages, [[wikt:heteronomous|heteronomous]] (morality centered outside the self) and autonomous (internalized morality). [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Lawerence Kohlberg]] sought to expand Piaget's work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest. The most widely known moral scenario used in his research is usually referred to as the [[Heinz dilemma]]. He interviewed children and described what he saw in six stages (claiming that "anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Heinz dilemma, Heinz's wife is dying of cancer and the town's druggist has something that can help her, but is charging more than Heinz can afford; Heinz steals the drug to save his wife's life. Children aged 10, 13, and 16 years old were asked if what Heinz did was morally justified. Kohlberg's stages of moral development consisted of six stages and three levels. At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation. The next level, the conventional level, included the interpersonal concordance or "good boy – nice girl" orientation, along with the "law and order" orientation. Lastly, the final Postconventional level consisted of the social-contract, legalistic orientation and the universal-ethical-principle orientation. Children progressed from stage one, where they began to recognize higher authorities and that there are set rules and punishments for breaking those rules; to stage six, where good principles make a good society. They also start to define which of the principles are most agreeable and fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crain|first=W.C.|title=Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development|url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm|work=Theories of Development|publisher=Prentice-Hall|accessdate=October 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kohlberg, an individual is considered more cognitively mature depending on their stage of moral reasoning, which grows as they advance in education and world experience. One of the examples that Kohlberg gives is called "cognitive-moral conflict", wherein an individual who is currently in one stage of moral reasoning has their beliefs challenged by a surrounding peer group. Through this challenge of beliefs, the individual engages in "reflective reorganization", which allows for movement to a new stage to occur.

Previous moral development scales, particularly Kohlberg's, assert that moral reasoning is dominated by one main perspective: [[justice]]. However, in a study done by Carol Gilligan and Jane Attanucci, they argue that there is an additional perspective to moral reasoning, known as the care perspective. The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based. It has a more situational focus that is dependent on the needs of others as opposed to Justice Orientation's objectivity. Gilligan and Attanucci analyzed male and female responses to moral situations thought up by the participant; they found that a majority of participants represent both care and justice in their moral orientations. In addition, they found that men tend to utilize the justice perspective more often than women, and women tend to use the care perspective more often than men.&lt;ref name="Attanucci 1988"&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Development: Caring Voices and Women's Moral Frames|last1=Gilligan|first1=Carol|last2=Attanucci|first2=Jane|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-1553-7|editor-last=Puka|editor-first=Bill|volume=34|location=|pages=123–237|chapter=Two Moral Orientations: Gender Differences and Similarities|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OBjzzmUS2oC&amp;pg=PA123|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reviews by others have found that Gilligan's theory was not supported by empirical studies since orientations are individual dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Moral Development|last1=Walker|first1=Lawrence J.|last2=Smetana|first2=Judith|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-135-61917-6|editor-last=Killen|editor-first=Melanie|pages=93–115|chapter=Gender and Morality|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CV5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffee and Hyde (2001){{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in neo-Kohlbergian studies with the Defining Issues Test, females tend to get slightly higher scores than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach|last1=Rest|first1=James R.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|last3=Thoma|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Bebeau|first4=Muriel J.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-135-70561-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Moral willpower===

Metcalfe and Mischel offered a new theory of willpower that focused on [[delayed gratification]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|date=|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janet_Metcalfe/publication/13101564_A_HotCool-System_Analysis_of_Delay_of_Gratification_Dynamics_of_Willpower/links/54e731fe0cf2cd2e029188e6.pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed a "hot/cool" structure of analysis to deprive the way one controls the way stimulus is interpreted and willpower is exerted. The hot system is referred to as the "go" system whereas the cool system is referred to as the "know" system. The hot system is characterized as being highly emotional, reflexive, and impulsive. This system leads to go response (instant gratification) and therefore undermines efforts in self-control. The cool system is characterized as being cognitive, emotionally neutral/flexible, slow, integrated, contemplative, and strategic. The hot system develops early in life, whereas the cool system develops later, as it relies on particular brain structures, notably the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[hippocampus]], and particular cognitive capacities that develop later. With age, there is a shift of dominance from the hot system to the cool system. The balance between them is determined by stress, developmental levels, and a person's self-regulating dynamics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|first=|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57–72|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated, "[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time. Research has largely supported that willpower works like a "moral muscle" with a limited supply of strength that may be depleted, conserved, or replenished, and that a single act requiring much self-control can significantly deplete the "supply" of willpower.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While exertion reduces the ability to engage in further acts of willpower in the short term, such exertions actually improve a person's ability to exert willpower for extended periods in the long run. Muraven, Baumeister and Tice conducted a study on self-regulation and its relationship to power and [[Endurance|stamina]]. This study demonstrated that the moral muscle, when exercised, is strengthened in stamina but not necessarily in power—meaning the subjects became less susceptible to the depletion of self-regulatory faculties.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muraven|first1=Mark|last2=Baumeister|first2=Roy F.|last3=Tice|first3=Dianne M.|date=August 1, 1999|title=Longitudinal Improvement of Self-Regulation Through Practice: Building Self-Control Strength Through Repeated Exercise|url=https://www.albany.edu/~muraven/publications/promotion%20files/articles/muraven,%20baumeister,%20&amp;%20tice,%201999.pdf|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=139|issue=4|pages=446–457|doi=10.1080/00224549909598404|issn=0022-4545|pmid=10457761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study showed that more complex tasks like regulating one's mood present substantive difficulty and may not be as effective in increasing willpower as other, more straight forward activities like posture correction or maintaining a food journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, over time, the "moral muscle" may be exercised by performing small tasks of self-control, such as attempting to correct slouched posture, resist desserts, or complete challenging self-regulatory tasks. Lastly, Baumeister argues that self-management, or the ability to alter one's responses, is a kind of skill that develops as one grows up.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are many things that can help a person replenish this source of will power, such as [[meditation]], rest, and positive emotion between tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They also showed that there is a conservation effect when it comes to will power: people tend to realize that they are using up their stored-up will and self-control and then use it as needed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Additional studies have been conducted that may cast doubt on the idea of ego-depletion. One experiment that sought to test this ego-depletion theory was that of Hagger.  Hagger challenged the resource depletion explanation that was found by Maruven, Tice, and Baumeister by highlighting there may have been small study bias, as well as, publication bias. Previous literature casting doubt on the ego-depletion analysis included a meta-analysis study in 2014, carried out by Carter et al, which provided significant evidence against the ego-depletion theory and found evidence of small study bias. Hagger carried out a replication of the ego-depletion experiment with a larger more diverse population and stricter experimental protocol to cast doubt on the significance of the resource depletion theory. Twenty-four different labs across the world replicated this study following strict protocols (results of 23 labs were used in the final report). Participants were randomly assigned to control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in the letter "e" depletion version of the task and the control group were administered the letter "e" no- depletion version of the task. Both groups first participated in practice sessions and then continued onto the actual test. Both groups were then asked to self- report items measuring effort, fatigue, difficulty, and frustration on the first task. Participants then continued on to complete the MSIT and results from this task were examined. Reaction time variability (RTV) was the primary variable observed and reaction time (RT) was the second variable. Researchers observed whether RTV was higher for participants assigned to the depletion condition compared to those assigned to the no-depletion condition. Any low accuracy results on either task (less than 80%) were excluded from the results. Twenty of the twenty-three lab replications had a 95% confidence intervals for the small effect size for ego-depletion RTV and RT on the MSIT. Results supported a null effect of the ego-depletion theory. While this one study is not enough to completely debunk the ego-depletion theory, it does cast considerable doubt about the effect size of previous study's findings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/c17hie7wh4yaohd/Hagger%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20A%20Multilab%20Preregistered%20Replication%20of%20the%20Ego-Depletion%20Effect.pdf?dl=0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral behaviour===

James Rest reviewed the literature on moral functioning and identified at least four components necessary for a moral behavior to take place:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rest|first=James R|date=1983|title=Morality|journal=Handbook of Child Psychology|volume=3|pages=556–629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narváez|first1=Darcia|last2=Rest|first2=James|date=1995|title=The four components of acting morally|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/documents/NARVAEZREST.pdf|journal=Moral Behavior and Moral Development: An Introduction|volume=|pages=385–400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sensitivity – noticing and interpreting the situation
* Reasoning and making a judgment regarding the best (most moral) option
* Motivation (in the moment but also habitually, such as moral identity)
* implementation—having the skills and perseverance to carry out the action
Reynolds and Ceranic researched the effects of social consensus on one's moral behavior. Depending on the level of social consensus (high vs. low), moral behaviors will require greater or lesser degrees of moral identity to motivate an individual to make a choice and endorse a behavior. Also, depending on social consensus, particular behaviors may require different levels of moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=Scott J.|last2=Ceranic|first2=Tara L.|date=2007|title=The effects of moral judgment and moral identity on moral behavior: An empirical examination of the moral individual.|url=http://www.pauldavidtuff.com/PDF%20Files/Effects_of_Moral_Judgement.pdf|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1610–1624|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1610|issn=1939-1854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.

===Moral intuitions===
In 2001, Jonathan Haidt introduced his [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist model]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s which claimed that with few exceptions, moral judgments are made based upon socially-derived intuitions. Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]].&lt;ref name="Haidt 814–834"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814–834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model suggests that moral reasoning is largely post-hoc rationalizations that function to justify one's instinctual reactions. He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a dual process system in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument contains evidence from Chaiken that says  social motives cause humans to be biased and to cohere and relate to other's attitudes in order to achieve higher societal goals, which in turn influences one's moral judgment. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on [[psychopaths]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Haidt 814–834" /&gt;

In 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A "[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a "[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35–80|chapter=The secret joke of Kant’s Soul|oclc=750463100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing). Individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a deontological manner, however, generally answer more quickly and show brain activity in the [[amygdala]] (associated with emotional processing).

In regard to moral intuitions, researchers Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham performed a study to research the difference between the moral foundations of political liberals and political conservatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haidt and Graham expanded on previous research done by Shweder and his three ethics theory. Shweder’s theory consisted of three moral ethics: the ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity. Haidt and Graham took this theory and extended it to discuss the five psychological systems that more specifically make up the three moral ethics theory. These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. 
They challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:
* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.
* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. 
* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.
* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.
* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.
The five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that "morality is about protecting individuals" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).{{Sfn|Heidt|Graham|2007|p=99}} Their research found that "justice and related virtues…make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives".{{Sfn|Heidt|Graham|2007|p=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.

Hadit and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye. They suggest that the five foundations can be used as "doorway" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the "wall" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage). If liberals try to consider the latter three foundations in addition to the former two (therefore adopting all five foundations like conservatives for a brief amount of time) they could understand where the conservatives viewpoints stem from and long-lasting political issues could finally be settled.

Augusto Blasi emphasizes the importance of moral responsibility and reflection as one analyzes an intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89507-1 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a2p_Tg8c0N8C&amp;pg=PA423 423]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument is that some, if not most, intuitions tend to be self-centered and self-seeking.{{Sfn|Narvaez|Lapsley|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a2p_Tg8c0N8C&amp;pg=PA397 397]}} Blasi critiques Haidt in describing the average person and questioning if this model (having an intuition, acting on it, and then justifying it) always happens. He came to the conclusion that not everyone follows this model. In more detail, Blasi proposes Haidt's five default positions on intuition.{{Clarify|reason=What is "propose" supposed to mean here?|date=February 2018}}
* Normally moral judgments are caused by intuitions, whether the intuitions are themselves caused by heuristics, or the heuristics are intuitions; whether they are intrinsically based on emotions, or depend on grammar type of rules and externally related to emotions.
* Intuitions occur rapidly and appear as unquestionably evident; either the intuitions themselves or their sources are unconscious.
* Intuitions are responses to minimal information, are not a result of analyses or reasoning; neither do they require reasoning to appear solid and true.
* Reasoning may occur but infrequently; its use is in justifying the judgment after the fact, either to other people or to oneself. Reasons in sum do not have a moral function.
Because such are the empirical facts, the "rationalistic" theories and methods of Piaget and Kohlberg are rejected. Blasi argues that Haidt does not provide adequate evidence to support his position.{{Sfn|Narvaez|Lapsley|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a2p_Tg8c0N8C&amp;pg=PA412 412]}}

===Moral emotions===
Moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle. The emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain, as subservient to the higher, rational, moral reasoning, with scholars like Piaget and Kohlberg touting moral reasoning as the key forefront of morality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, in the last 30–40 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior. This development began with a focus on empathy and guilt, but has since moved on to encompass new emotional scholarship stocks like anger, shame, disgust, awe, and elevation. With the new research, theorists have begun to question whether moral emotions might hold a larger in determining morality, one that might even surpass that of moral reasoning.&lt;ref name="Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855" /&gt;

There have generally been two approaches taken by philosophers to define moral emotion. The first "is to specify the formal conditions that make a moral statement (e.g., that is prescriptive, that it is universalizable, such as expedience)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Oxford University Press, UK| isbn=978-0-19-824659-6| last=Hare| first=R. M.| title=Moral Thinking: Its Levels, Method, and Point| year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} This first approach is more tied to language and the definitions we give to a moral emotions. The second approach "is to specify the material conditions of a moral issue, for example, that moral rules and judgments 'must bear on the interest or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| volume=6| pages=976–998| last=Gewirth| first=A.| title=Ethics| encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Brittanica| location=Chicago| date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition seems to be more action based. It focuses on the outcome of a moral emotion. The second definition is more preferred because it is not tied to language and therefore can be applied to prelinguistic children and animals. Moral emotions are "emotions that are linked to the interests or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent."{{Sfn|Haidt|2003|p=583}}

There is a debate whether there is a set of basic emotions or if there are "scripts or set of components that can be mixed and matched, allowing for a very large number of possible emotions".&lt;ref name="Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidth|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=855|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those arguing for a basic set acknowledge that there are variants of each emotion. Psychology [[Paul Ekman]] calls these variants "families":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul|date=May 1, 1992|title=An argument for basic emotions|url=http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/An-Argument-For-Basic-Emotions.pdf|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=169–200|doi=10.1080/02699939208411068|issn=0269-9931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The principal moral emotions can be divided into two large and two small joint families. The large families are the "other-condemning" family, in which the three brothers are [[contempt]], [[anger]], and [[disgust]] (and their many children, such as [[indignation]] and [[loathing]]), and the "self-conscious" family ([[shame]], [[embarrassment]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]])…[T]he two smaller families the "other-suffering" family ([[compassion]]) and the "other-praising" family ([[gratitude]] and [[elevation (emotion)|elevation]]).&lt;ref name="Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Haidt would suggest that the higher the emotionality of a moral agent, the more likely the agent is to act morally. He uses the term "disinterested elicitor" to describe an event or situation that provokes emotions in us even when these emotions do not have anything to do with our own personal welfare. It is these elicitors that cause people to participate in what he calls "prosocial action tendencies" (actions that benefit society). Haidt explains moral emotions as "emotion families", in which each family contains emotions that may be similar although not exactly the same. These moral emotions are provoked by eliciting events that often lead to prosocial action tendencies. Each person's likelihood of prosocial action is determined by his or her degree of emotionality. 

According to Haidt, there are four different moral emotion families: the "other-condemning emotions" (contempt, anger, disgust), the "self-conscience emotions" (shame, embarrassment, and guilt), the "other suffering emotions" (compassion and sympathy), and the "other-praising family" (gratitude, awe, and elevation). These emotions are moral emotions based on grounds that they can all lead to prosocial action tendencies.&lt;ref name="Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855" /&gt; 

Empathy also plays a large role in altruism. The empathy-altruism hypothesis states that feelings of empathy for another leads to an altruistic motivation to help that person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, there may also be an egoistic motivation to help someone in need. This is the Hullian tension-reduction model in which personal distress caused by another in need leads the person to help in order to alleviate their own discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batson|first1=C.

Batson, Klein, Highberger, and Shaw conducted experiments where they manipulated people through the use of empathy-induced altruism to make decisions that required them to show partiality to one individual over another. The first experiment involved a participant from each group to choose someone to experience a positive or negative task. These groups included a non-communication, communication/low-empathy, and communication/high-empathy. They were asked to make their decisions based on these standards resulting in the communication/high-empathy group showing more partiality in the experiment than the other groups due to being successfully manipulated emotionally. Those individuals who they successfully manipulated reported that despite feeling compelled in the moment to show partiality, they still felt they had made the more "immoral" decision since they followed an empathy-based emotion rather than adhering to a justice perspective of morality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batson | first1 = C.

Batson, Klein, Highberger, &amp; Shaw conducted two experiments on empathy-induced altruism, proposing that this can lead to actions that violate the justice principle. The second experiment operated similarly to the first using low-empathy and high-empathy groups. Participants were faced with the decision to move an ostensibly ill child to an "immediate help" group versus leaving her on a waiting list after listening to her emotionally-driven interview describing her condition and the life it has left her to lead. Those who were in the high-empathy group were more likely than those in the low-empathy group to move the child higher up the list to receive treatment earlier. When these participants were asked what the more moral choice was, they agreed that the more moral choice would have been to not move this child ahead of the list at the expense of the other children. In this case, it is evident that when empathy induced altruism is at odds with what is seen as moral, oftentimes empathy induced altruism has the ability to win out over morality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Recently neuroscientist [[Jean Decety]], drawing on empirical research in [[evolutionary theory]], [[developmental psychology]], [[social neuroscience]], and psychopathy, argued that empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Decety|first=Jean|date=November 1, 2014|title=The Neuroevolution of Empathy and Caring for Others: Why It Matters for Morality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Decety-UC/publication/287290900_The_Neuroevolution_of_Empathy_and_Caring_for_Others_Why_It_Matters_for_Morality/links/5693657208ae0f920dce353b/The-Neuroevolution-of-Empathy-and-Caring-for-Others-Why-It-Matters-for-Morality.pdf|journal=Research and Perspectives in Neurosciences|volume=21|pages=127–151|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02904-7_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Decety|first1=J.|last2=Cowell|first2=J.

Emmons (2009) defines gratitude as a natural emotional reaction and a universal tendency to respond positively to another's benevolence. Gratitude is motivating and leads to what Emmons' describes as "upstream reciprocity". This is the passing on of benefits to third parties instead of returning benefits to one's benefactors (Emmons, 2009).

===Moral conviction===

[[Linda Skitka]] and colleagues have introduced the concept of moral conviction, which refers to a "strong and absolute belief that something is right or wrong, moral or immoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=Linda|date=|year=2002|title=Do the means always justify the ends or do the ends sometimes justify the means? A value protection model of justice|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linda_Skitka/publication/247746696_Do_the_Means_Always_Justify_the_Ends_or_Do_the_Ends_Sometimes_Justify_the_Means_A_Value_Protection_Model_of_Justice_Reasoning/links/53ebc9b00cf202d087cfd0fa.pdf|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=28|pages=452–461|doi=10.1177/0146167202288003|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skitka's integrated theory of moral conviction (ITMC), attitudes held with moral conviction, known as moral mandates, differ from strong but non-moral attitudes in a number of important ways. Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|author2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.

One of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally-mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L. J.|author2=Bauman, C.|author3=Sargis, E.|date=|year=2005|title=Moral conviction: Another contributor to attitude strength or something more?|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e7e/2fb7cf672e00b4ea00b4a75d4eee2fd51f5d.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=88|pages=895–917|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.6.895|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
In ''Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'' (1998), [[Elliott Sober]] and [[David Sloan Wilson]] demonstrated that diverse moralities could evolve through [[group selection]]. In particular, they dismantled the idea that [[natural selection]] will favor a homogeneous population in which all creatures care only about their own personal welfare and/or behave only in ways which advance their own personal reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior|last=Sober|first=Elliott|last2=Wilson|first2=David Sloan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780674930469|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Dean has advanced the more general claim that moral diversity would evolve through [[frequency-dependent selection]] because each moral approach is vulnerable to a different set of situations which threatened our ancestors.&lt;ref name=Dean2012&gt;{{cite journal|title= Evolution and moral diversity |author=Dean, Tim |journal=Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication|year=2012|volume=7|doi=10.4148/biyclc.v7i0.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated theories===
More recent attempts to develop an integrated model of moral motivation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leffel|first=G. M.|date=2008|title=Who cares? Generativity and the moral emotions, part 2: A "social intuitionist model" of moral motivation|url=|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=36|pages=182–201|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified at least six different levels of moral functioning, each of which has been shown to predict some type of moral or prosocial behavior: moral intuitions, moral emotions, moral virtues/vices (behavioral capacities), moral values, moral reasoning, and moral willpower. This [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] model of moral motivation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leffel|2008}}'s model draws heavily on {{harvnb|Haidt|2001}}'s social intuitionist model of moral judgment.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the "hotter" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The "cooler" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.

Psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]]'s [[moral foundations theory]] examines the way morality varies between cultures and identifies five fundamental moral values shared by different societies and individuals:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|author2=Jesse Graham|date=|year=2007|title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions That Liberals May Not Recognize|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-morality-opposes-justice.pdf|deadurl=yes|format=PDF|journal=[[Social Justice Research]]|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98–116|doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035801/http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-morality-opposes-justice.pdf|archivedate=September 16, 2008|accessdate=December 14, 2008|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; care for others, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{TED talk|jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind|The moral roots of liberals and conservatives|Jonathan Haidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non sequitur |date=June 2018 |reason=How Haidt theory may be considered as an integrated theory?}}

== Triune ethics theory ==
The triune ethics theory (TET) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95–119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TET proposes three ethics that are the foundation or motivation for all ethics: security (or safety), engagement, and imagination. They differ not only in the recency of evolutionary development but also in their relative capacity to override one another.&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt; The study looks back to people in the Pleistocene era and the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA), relating to their early-life supports and its relation to moral functioning. The long term breastfeeding, the constant holding or touching, the frequency of caregivers other than mother, multiage playgroups, and the quick responsiveness to cries during that era is the type of caregiving that supports our biological systems. Current caregiving such as hospital births, solo sleeping, and physical isolation are not the types of early life caregiving to which humans are adapted.  The article also mentions "dearth of touch" or faulty serotonin receptors affects society, and how they affect our society. There are higher rates of depression and anxiety, which both affect general and moral functioning.&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt; There are two categories of the effects of childrearing on moral functioning, dispositional and situational effects. There are two hypotheses relating to the dispositional effects of childrearing on moral functioning. First, "a personality may cohere around being more or less oriented to each of the three ethics".&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt; Second, "during critical periods of brain and personality development 'attachment' and 'trust' aspects of personality development are deeply influenced, affecting the structure and wiring of brain systems".&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt; Lastly, there are situational effects. These relate to the idea that "moral personality has a dispositional signature within particular situations: person and situation interact with dispositional regularity".&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt;

===Security===
The security ethic is based in the oldest part of the brain, involving the [[R-complex]] or the [[extrapyramidal system]].&lt;ref name="MacLean, P.D. 1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triune Brain in Evolution: Role in Paleocerebral Functions|last=MacLean|first=P. D.|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=1990|isbn=978-0-306-43168-5}}{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security ethic is triggered stressors that activate primal instincts and [[fight-or-flight response]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These are concerned or centered on safety, survival, and thriving in an environment (or biological system). With these systems present at birth, the security ethic is conditioned during sensitive periods of development (such as infancy), life experience, and trauma.&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=Personality, Identity, and Character: Explorations in Moral Psychology |last1=Narvaez |first1=Darcia |last2=Lapsley |first2=Daniel K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-521-89507-1|pages=136–158|chapter=Triune Ethics Theory and Moral Personality|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2p_Tg8c0N8C&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that a dearth of touch in early years result in an underdevelopment of [[serotonin receptors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalin|first=N.

This ethic is most responsible for [[racism]] and hate towards outside groups.

===Engagement===
The ethic of engagement is centered in the upper [[limbic system]] or the visceral-emotional nervous system.&lt;ref name="MacLean, P.D. 1990"/&gt; The limbic system allows for external and internal emotional signaling and is critical to emotion, identity, memory for ongoing experience, and an individual's sense of reality and truth. The ethic of engagement refers to relational attunement in the moment, which the stress response prevents, focusing on social bonding. It relies significantly on caregiver influence for its development in early childhood.&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt; The engagement ethic is strongly associated with the hormone [[oxytocin]], which has a strong presence during [[breastfeeding]] between a mother and child. Oxytocin is essential for building the trust between mother and child.

===Imagination===
The imagination ethic allows a person to step away from the impetuous emotional responses of the older parts of the brain and consider alternative actions based on logic and reason.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is centered in the [[neocortex]] and related [[thalamus|thalamic]] structures, including the frontal lobes used for reasoning and [[judgement]] skills.&lt;ref name="MacLean, P.D. 1990"/&gt; It is focused on the outside world and allows for the integration and coordination of the other parts of the brain to allow for imaginative thinking and strategic problem solving. The ethic of imagination involves integrating internal information with external information, allowing an adult to acknowledge and possibly reject more emotional responses from the security or engagement ethics. The imagination ethic can build on the self-protective states of the security ethic (vicious or detached imagination) or of the prosocial engagement ethic (communal imagination).&lt;ref name="Narváez, Darcia 2009"/&gt;

[[File:TripletBoys.JPG|thumb|300px|Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.]]
A '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[placental]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.

Each fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).

A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''.

Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

==Terminology==
[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".]]
[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.]]
Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:
*two offspring – twins
*three offspring – triplets
*four offspring – quadruplets
*five offspring – quintuplets
*six offspring – sextuplets
*seven offspring – septuplets
*eight offspring – octuplets
*nine offspring – nonuplets
*ten offspring – decuplets

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:
*Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single [[zygote]]
*Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes:
:*Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes
:*Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes

Multiple pregnancies are also classified by how the fetuses are surrounded by one or more [[placenta]]s and [[amniotic sac]]s; the placentas are referenced as "chorions":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary: Multiple pregnancy: antenatal care for twin and triplet pregnancies |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg129/chapter/appendix-e-definitions-of-key-terms |publisher=NICE |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monochorionic fetuses share one placenta; dichorionic twins, trichorionic triplets, etc. each has a separate placenta.
* Monoamniotic fetuses share one amniotic sac; diamniotic twins each have their own sac, as do triamniotic triplets, etc. 
* There are many combinations possible -- for example with dichorionic triamniotic triplets, one fetus has a separate placenta and two of the fetuses share a placenta, and each has its own amniotic sac.

==Human multiple births==
In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than [[gestation]]) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.

Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218–2225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twins===
{{Main|Twin}}

Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt;

===Triplets===
[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]
[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.

Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence".&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt;

Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-identical-triplets-20151023-story.html|title = Rare identical triplets born to Baltimore couple|last = Cohn|first = Meredith|date = October 23, 2015|work = [[Baltimore Sun|Baltim.

===Quadruplets===
Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the [[Genain quadruplets]], all of whom developed [[schizophrenia]].
Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|quad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- COMMENTING OUT CONFLICTING STATS - CHECK SOURCES Two genetically-different sets of identical twins statistically make up half of all quadruplets. Approximately 95% of quadruplets are all fraternal. --&gt;

===Quintuplets===
[[File:Dionnequints2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Dionne quintuplets|Dionne sisters]], seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.]]
Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.baby2see.com/multiples/multiples.html |title = Multiples in pregnancy - twins triplets quads identical and fraternal |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204054229/http://www.baby2see.com/multiples/multiples.html |archivedate=2015-02-04 |website = Baby2see.com|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian [[Dionne Quintuplets]], born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|quin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "quints" in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|quint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sextuplets===
Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the [[Walton sextuplets]] were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/215904/2004/05/10/day-after-mothers-day-gosselin-sextuplets-arrive |title=The day after Mother's Day, the Gosselin sextuplets arrive |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023233314/http://news.psu.edu/story/215904/2004/05/10/day-after-mothers-day-gosselin-sextuplets-arrive |archivedate=2016-10-23 |df=|date = 10 May 2004|publisher = Penn State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reality television shows called Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 and later [[Kate Plus 8]] have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.

===Very high-order multiple births===
In 1997, the [[McCaughey septuplets]] were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the [[Chukwu octuplets|Chukwu family]] in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the [[Suleman octuplets]], were born in [[Bellflower, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7852623.stm |title= US woman gives birth to octuplets|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127213838/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7852623.stm |archivedate=27 January 2009|date = 27 January 2009|work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/01/a-mother-has-gi.html |title = Octuplets born in Bellflower|deadurl= no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220201234/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/01/a-mother-has-gi.html |archivedate=2014-12-20|date = 26 January 2009|work = [[LA Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, all were still alive shortly before their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/24/8-facts-octomom/4816235/|title= 8 facts about 'Octomom' Nadya Suleman|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128191349/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/24/8-facts-octomom/4816235/ |archivedate=2017-01-28 |work = USA Today|date = 24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a few sets of nonuplets (9) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births.  The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from [[fertility medication]]s and [[assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technology (ART)]]. However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Causes and frequency==
{{globalize/North America|date=December 2010}}
The frequency of ''N'' multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89&lt;sup&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sup&gt; (''[[Hellin's law]]'') and as about 1:80&lt;sup&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=McGraw&gt;{{cite web| first1= Melissa|last1= Bush|first2= Martin L.|last2= Pernoll | title =Multiple Pregnancy | work =Pregnancy Health Center  | url=http://www.health.am/pregnancy/multiple-pregnancy/| date = 15 September 2010| publisher=Health.am | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives:
*1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins
*1:89&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= 1:6400) for triplets
*1:89&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for quadruplets

North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/multiple.htm National Center for Health Statistics - Multiple Births] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020102618/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/multiple.htm |date=2013-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf#table01 National Vital Statistics Reports, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,  Volume 61, Number 1, August 28, 2012, Births: Final Data for 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720102442/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf |date=July 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Twins, 132,562, 3.31%
* Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%
* Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%
* Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%

Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of [[infertility]] treatments such as [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).

For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid16497698"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beemsterboer SN, Homburg R, Gorter NA, Schats R, Hompes PG, Lambalk CB | title = The paradox of declining fertility but increasing twinning rates with advancing maternal age | journal = Hum. Reprod. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 1531–2 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16497698 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as [[in-vitro fertilization]]. Younger patients who undergo treatment with [[fertility medication]] containing artificial [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], followed by intrauterine [[insemination]], are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.

[[File:KoreAm 2008-05 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of ''[[KoreAm]]'', May 2008]]
Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:
*mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Multiple Pregnancy - ACOG|url = http://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Multiple-Pregnancy#are|website = www.acog.org|access-date = 2016-01-13|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160111114120/http://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Multiple-Pregnancy#are|archivedate = 2016-01-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*mother's use of [[fertility drug]]s: approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child

The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally ''Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8'' and (following their divorce) ''[[Kate Plus 8]]'', which became the highest-rated show on the ''[[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'' network.

==Risks==

===Premature birth and low birth weight===
Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in [[premature birth]] than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons.&lt;ref name="AlexanderKoganMartinPapiernik"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander GR, Kogan M, Martin J, Papiernik E | title = What are the fetal growth patterns of singletons, twins, and triplets in the United States? | journal = Clin Obstet Gynecol | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 114–25 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9504230 }} ''Note: This study was done by looking at the 1991–1995 U.S. Natality Files, which were received from the National Center for Health Statistics''&lt;/ref&gt; 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born ''very preterm'', compared to 1.7% in singletons.&lt;ref name="AlexanderKoganMartinPapiernik"/&gt;

At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamasmit|first1=W|last2=Chaithongwongwatthana|first2=S|last3=Tolosa|first3=JE|last4=Limpongsanurak|first4=S|last5=Pereira|first5=L|last6=Lumbiganon|first6=P|title=Prophylactic oral betamimetics for reducing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 December 2015|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD004733|pmid=26645888|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004733.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neilson|first1=JP|last2=West|first2=HM|last3=Dowswell|first3=T|title=Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=5 February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD004352|pmid=24500892|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004352.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a [[Cervical cerclage|cervical suture]]) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rafael|first1=TJ|last2=Berghella|first2=V|last3=Alfirevic|first3=Z|title=Cervical stitch (cerclage) for preventing preterm birth in multiple pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 September 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD009166|pmid=25208049|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009166.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[preterm birth]]s also result in multiples tending to have a [[lower birth weight]] compared to singletons.

Some evidence{{Who|date=July 2009}} indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight.  This study{{Who|date=July 2009}} was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).

Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17&amp;nbsp;lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Le|first=Julia|title=Scale-tipping triplets set world record|url=http://www.mississauga.com/community/community/article/1048642|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=Mississauga News|date=26 July 2011|location=Mississauga ON|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121153800/http://www.mississauga.com/community/community/article/1048642|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}; note that the record wasn't confirmed until July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebral palsy===
[[Cerebral palsy]] is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in [[North West England]].&lt;ref name="pmid8976682"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pharoah PO, Cooke T | title = Cerebral palsy and multiple births | journal = Arch. Dis. Child. Fetal Neonatal Ed. | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = F174–7 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8976682 | pmc = 1061194 | doi = 10.1136/fn.75.3.f174| quote = Note: They conducted a study by looking at the registered births of babies born with cerebral palsy during the periods of 1982-1989 in the counties of Merseyside and Cheshire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.

===Incomplete separation===
{{Further|Twin#Degree of separation}}
Multiples may be [[monochorionic]], sharing the same [[chorion]], with resultant risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Monochorionic multiples may even be [[monoamniotic]], sharing the same [[amniotic sac]], resulting in risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and [[nuchal cord]]. In very rare cases, there may be [[conjoined twins]], possibly impairing function of internal organs.

===Mortality rate (stillbirth)===
Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate.  It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high.  A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets.  By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.&lt;ref name="pmid9620827"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hammond KR | title = Multifetal pregnancy reduction | journal = J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–43 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9620827 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.1998.tb02657.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.

===Prevention in IVF===
Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 [[embryo transfer]]s performed as part of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies.&lt;ref name=elsner1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsner CW, Tucker MJ, Sweitzer CL, Brockman WD, Morton PC, Wright G, Toledo AA | title = Multiple pregnancy rate and embryo number transferred during in vitro fertilization | journal = Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. | volume = 177 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–5; discussion 355–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9290450 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets).&lt;ref name=elsner1997/&gt; Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.

The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table:&lt;ref name=nice2013&gt;[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023043/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 |date=2013-02-23 }}. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Age !! Attempt no. !! Embryos transferred
|-
|rowspan=3| &lt;37 years || 1st || 1
|-

|-

|-

|}

Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available.&lt;ref name=nice2013/&gt;

==Management==
[[Bed rest]] has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective reduction===
[[Selective reduction]] is the practice of reducing the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy; it is also called "multifetal reduction".&lt;ref name=ACOG2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion Number 719: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction |url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Multifetal-Pregnancy-Reduction |publisher=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Ethics. |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to kill, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which [[potassium chloride]] is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging.&lt;ref name=Evans2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=MI |last2=Andriole |first2=S |last3=Britt |first3=DW |title=Fetal reduction: 25 years' experience. |journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy |date=2014 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1159/000357974 |pmid=24525884}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, [[retained placenta]], infection, a miscarriage, and [[prelabor rupture of membranes]]. Each of these appears to be rare.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.02.004 |pmid=23518032 |title=Differences between selective termination of pregnancy and fetal reduction in multiple pregnancy: A narrative review |journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=542–54 |year=2013 |last1=Legendre |first1=Claire-Marie |last2=Moutel |first2=Grégoire |last3=Drouin |first3=Régen |last4=Favre |first4=Romain |last5=Bouffard |first5=Chantal }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.&lt;ref name=WaPO&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mundy |first1=Liza |title=Too Much to Carry? |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |work=Washington Post Magazine |date=May 20, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405010648/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |archivedate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html|publisher=New York Times Magazine|first=Ruth|last=Padawer|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care in pregnancy===
Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications.&lt;ref name =doddclinics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodd|first1=JM|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|last3=Crowther|first3=CA|title=Specialised antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD005300|pmid=26545291|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005300.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care.&lt;ref name = doddclinics/&gt;

===Nutrition===
As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bricker|first1=L|last2=Reed|first2=K|last3=Wood|first3=L|last4=Neilson|first4=JP|title=Nutritional advice for improving outcomes in multiple pregnancies.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=24 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD008867|pmid=26599328|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008867.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cesarean section or vaginal delivery===
A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a [[gestational age]] between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in [[cephalic presentation]], planned [[Cesarean section]] does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of [[Perinatal mortality|fetal or neonatal death]] or serious neonatal [[disability]], as compared with planned vaginal delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett JF, Hannah ME, Hutton EK, Willan AR, Allen AC, Armson BA, Gafni A, Joseph KS, Mason D, Ohlsson A, Ross S, Sanchez JJ, Asztalos EV | title = A Randomized Trial of Planned Cesarean or Vaginal Delivery for Twin Pregnancy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 14 | pages = 1295–1305 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24088091 | pmc =  3954096| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1214939 | author14 = Twin Birth Study Collaborative Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as [[pregnancy complication]]s. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HC, Gould JB, Boscardin WJ, El-Sayed YY, Blumenfeld YJ | title = Trends in Cesarean Delivery for Twin Births in the United States | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22015878 | pmc = 3202294 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182318651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15840743 Women can choose Caesarean birth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819201245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15840743 |date=2012-08-19 }} - BBC article by James Gallagher. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Barrett|first2=JF|last3=Crowther|first3=CA|title=Planned caesarean section for women with a twin pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 December 2015|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD006553|pmid=26684389|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006553.pub3|pmc=4110647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing.&lt;ref name = shub&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shub|first1=A|last2=Walker|first2=SP|title=Planned early delivery versus expectant management for monoamniotic twins.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=23 April 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD008820|pmid=25906204|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008820.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services.&lt;ref name = shub/&gt;

Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.

===Neonatal intensive care===
Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were.  Kaufman&lt;ref name="pmid9491857"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufman GE, Malone FD, Harvey-Wilkes KB, Chelmow D, Penzias AS, D'Alton ME | title = Neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with triplet pregnancy | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9491857 | doi =  10.1016/s0029-7844(97)00686-8| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered.  Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.

===Insurance coverage===
A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Moore JE, Witt WP, Elixhauser A | title = Complicating Conditions Associate With Childbirth, by Delivery Method and Payer, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #173 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142859/https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp | archivedate = 2014-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural aspects===
Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Korea's 'lucky' triplets seized|work=Herald Sun|publisher=Fairfax|date=2003-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ([[Romulus and Remus]]) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive [[dowry]] at about the same time.

[[File:Mother in bed, with seven children in a cradle (British Library Royal 15 E VI f 273r (detail).jpg|thumb|left|Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance ([[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]])]]

In Greek mythology, fraternal twins [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]], and [[Heracles|Heracles and Iphicles]], are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.

In certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p295, 244 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar effect occurs in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before [[Child abandonment#In fiction|exposing]] the children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p239, 243 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazi eugenics''' ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialistische Rassenhygiene}}, "National Socialist racial hygiene") were [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Nazism and race|racially based]] social policies that placed the biological improvement of the [[Aryan race]] or Germanic "''[[Übermensch]]en''" [[master race]] through [[eugenics]] at the center of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Longerich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Longerich|title=Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280436-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term '''racial hygiene'''. Following the [[Second World War]], both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by ''Humangenetik'' ([[human genetics]]).

Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]] (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under [[Adolf Hitler]]'s leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]].&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;

Those humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as "[[life unworthy of life]]" ({{lang-de|Lebensunwertes Leben}}), including prisoners, [[Degeneration|"degenerates"]], [[Gleichschaltung|dissidents]], people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) ({{lang-de| erbkranken}}), [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexual]], idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of [[heredity]]. More than 400,000 people were [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilized against their will]], while more than 70,000 were killed under [[Aktion T4|Action T4]], a [[euthanasia]] program.&lt;ref name="USHMM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalassets.ushmm.org/photoarchives/detail.aspx?id=10049&amp;search=EUTHANASIA+%28PATIENTS%2FVICTIMS%29&amp;index=25 | title=Close-up of Richard Jenne, the last child killed by the head nurse at the Kaufbeuren-Irsee euthanasia facility. | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, S. &amp; D.

Unlike in the United States, where federalism and political heterogeneity encouraged diversity even with a single movement, in Germany one society, the German Society for Race Hygiene (''Deutsche Gesellschaft fue Rassenhygiene''), eventually represented all eugenicists, while one journal, the ''Archiv fur Rassen- und Gsellschafts Biologie'', founded by Ploetz in 1904, remained the primary scientific publication of German Eugenics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Friedlander]] wrote that although the German and American eugenics movements were similar, the German movement was more centralized and did not contain as many diverse ideas as the American movement.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;  Unlike the American movement, one publication and one society, the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]], represented all eugenicists.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;

[[Edwin Black]] wrote that after the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it was spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="black2003"&gt;{{cite web| author=Edwin Black | title=Eugenics and the Nazis -- the California connection | publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' | url= http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Eugenics-and-the-Nazis-the-California-2549771.php | date=November 9, 2003 | access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;Murphy &amp; Lappé, 1994: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1lvbUy441m0C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology (KWIA), an organization which concentrated on physical and social anthropology as well as human genetics, was founded in Berlin with significant financial support from the American philanthropic group, the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen E. Schafft, ''From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2004), pp. 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; German professor of medicine, anthropology and eugenics [[Eugen Fischer]] was the director of this organization, a man whose work helped provide the scientific basis for the Nazis' eugenics policies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Who's Who In Nazi Germany'' (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1933, Adolf Hitler appointed Fischer rector of Frederick William University of Berlin, now [[Humboldt University]]. See: [http://www.historische-kommission-muenchen-editionen.de/rektoratsreden/anzeige/index.php?type=rektor&amp;id=93753244 "Rektoratsreden im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert – Online-Bibliographie"], der ehemalige Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] even funded some of the research conducted by [[Josef Mengele]] before he went to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader [[Charles Goethe|C. M. Goethe]] bragged to a colleague:

{{blockquote|You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought... I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people.&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;}}

Eugenics researcher [[Harry Laughlin|Harry H. Laughlin]] often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been implemented in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jackson, John P. &amp; Weidman, Nadine M.|title=Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3736-8|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-crlAYsZ-MC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at [[Heidelberg University]] in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the "science of racial cleansing". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the "common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court, and "Buck v.

==Hitler's views on eugenics==
[[File:Aktion_brand.jpg|thumb|Hitler's order for Action T4]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] read about [[racial hygiene]] during his imprisonment in [[Landsberg Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jonathan C.|title=The Routledge History of the Holocaust|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77956-2|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5v2U8AAv1EcC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by [[dysgenics]], the infusion of degenerate elements into its bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich in Power|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1-59420-074-8|pages=429|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3j-Aq1hAgJEC&amp;lpg=PT429&amp;pg=PT429|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racialism and idea of competition, termed [[social Darwinism]] in 1944, were discussed by European scientists and also in the Vienna press during the 1920s. Where Hitler picked up the ideas is uncertain. The theory of evolution had been generally accepted in Germany at the time, but this sort of extremism was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Mathúna | first1 = Dónal P | year = 2006 | title = Human dignity in the Nazi era: implications for contemporary bioethics | journal = [[BMC Medical Ethics]] | volume =  7| issue = | pages = E2| pmc=1484488 | pmid=16536874 | doi=10.1186/1472-6939-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Zweites Buch|''Second Book'']], which was unpublished during the Nazi era, Hitler praised Sparta, (using ideas perhaps borrowed from [[Ernst Haeckel]]),&lt;ref&gt;In 1876 Haeckel had discussed the selective [[infanticide]] policy of the Greek city of ancient [[Sparta]].{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |author=Haeckel, Ernst |coauthors= |title=The History of Creation, vol. I |url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/Radical%20Ecology.htm#EUGENICS%20JUSTIFIED%20BY%20NATURE |format= |work= |publisher=New York: D. Appleton |id= |page=170 |year=1876 |accessdate= |quote=Among the Spartans all newly born children were subject to a careful examination or selection. All those that were weak, sickly, or affected with any bodily infirmity, were killed. Only the perfectly healthy and strong children were allowed to live, and they alone afterwards propagated the race.}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he considered Sparta to be the first "[[Völkisch]] State". He endorsed what he perceived to be an early [[eugenics]] treatment of deformed children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sparta must be regarded as the first Völkisch State. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of [[birth control]] or through [[abortion]]s, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hitler, Adolf |title=[[Hitler's Secret Book]] |year=1961 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0-394-62003-8 |oclc=9830111 |pages=17–18 | quote= |authorlink=Adolf Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Mike |title=Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860-1945: nature as model and nature as threat |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-57434-X |oclc=34705047 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SszNCxSKmgkC&amp;pg=PA276 | page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nazi eugenics program==
[[File:EuthanasiePropaganda.jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda for Nazi Germany's [[Aktion T4|T-4 Euthanasia Program]]: "This person suffering from hereditary defects costs the community 60,000 Reichsmark during his lifetime. Fellow German, that is your money, too." from the [[Office of Racial Policy]]'s [[Neues Volk]].]]
[[File:Bus Hartheim Foto Niedernhart Prozess.jpg|thumb|Collection bus for killing patients]]
In organizing their eugenics program the Nazis were inspired by the United States' programs of [[forced sterilization]], especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in [[California]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

The [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]], enacted on July 14, 1933, allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who according to the opinion of a "Genetic Health Court" suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders and required [[physician]]s to register every case of hereditary illness known to them, except in women over 45 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A facinghistorycampus.org – The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207110601/http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A |date=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians could be fined for failing to comply.

In 1934, the first year of the Law's operation, nearly 4,000 persons appealed against the decisions of sterilization authorities. A total of 3,559 of the appeals failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 [[Hereditary Health Court]]s ({{lang|de|Erbgesundheitsgerichte}}) were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 persons were sterilized against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics institutions===
[[File:Hadamar 012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gas chamber in Hadamar]]
The [[Hadamar Clinic]] was a [[mental hospital]] in the German town of [[Hadamar]] used by the Nazi-controlled German government as the site of [[Action T4]]. The [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] was founded in 1927. [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]] was also part of the euthanasia programme where the Nazis killed individuals they deemed disabled. The first method used involved transporting patients by buses in which the engine exhaust gases were passed into the interior of the buses, and so killed the passengers. [[Gas chamber]]s were developed later and used pure [[carbon monoxide]] gas to kill the patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
In its early years, and during the Nazi era, the Clinic was strongly associated with theories of eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Eugen Fischer]], and by its director [[Otmar von Verschuer]]. Under Fischer, the sterilization of so-called [[Rhineland Bastard]]s was undertaken. [[Grafeneck Castle]] was one of Nazi Germany's killing centers, and today it is a memorial place dedicated to the victims of the Action T4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorialization_in_Germany_since_1945.html?hl=de&amp;id=1znCPwAACAAJ Knittel, S. "Remembering Euthanasia: Grafeneck in the Past, Present, and Future." B. Niven &amp; C. Paver &amp;#91;eds&amp;#93;.  Memorialization in Germany since 1945].  New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010: 124-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13374, Philipp Bouhler.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Philipp Bouhler]], head of the T4 programme]]
The Law for Simplification of the Health System of July 1934 created Information Centers for Genetic and Racial Hygiene, as well as Health Offices. The law also described procedures for 'denunciation' and 'evaluation' of persons, who were then sent to a [[Genetic Health Court]] where sterilization was decided.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

Information to determine who was considered 'genetically sick' was gathered from routine information supplied by people to doctor's offices and welfare departments. Standardized questionnaires had been designed by Nazi officials with the help of [[Dehomag]] (a subsidiary of [[IBM]] in the 1930s), so that the information could be encoded easily onto [[Hollerith]] punch cards for fast sorting and counting.&lt;ref name="black1"&gt;See [[IBM and the Holocaust]] by [[Edwin Black]], 2001, Crown / Random House, pg 93-96 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamburg, doctors gave information into a Central Health Passport Archive (circa 1934), under something called the 'Health-Related Total Observation of Life'. This file was to contain reports from doctors, but also courts, insurance companies, sports clubs, the Hitler Youth, the military, the labor service, colleges, etc. Any institution that gave information would get information back in return. In 1940, the Reich Interior Ministry tried to impose a Hamburg-style system on the whole Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics policies regarding marriage===
After the Nazis passed the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, it became compulsory for both marriage partners to be tested for [[hereditary diseases]] in order to preserve the perceived racial purity of the Aryan race. Everyone was encouraged to carefully evaluate his or her prospective marriage partner eugenically during courtship. Members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] were cautioned to carefully interview prospective marriage partners to make sure they had no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully so as not to hurt the feelings of the prospective [[fiancee]] and, if it became necessary to reject her for eugenic reasons, to do it tactfully and not cause her any offense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]] ''Himmler'' New York:1990--Henry Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name=wordinfo&gt;[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[Nous|nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy ; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; —"[[Omega point]]".}}
The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book,&lt;ref&gt;Glycerio, M. L. &amp; Paulsen, J. B. (1999). Is Noogenesis Progressing? Richmond, VA. [http://sites.google.com/site/pellegrinodellavvenire/la-noosfera-e-lo-sviluppo-del-pensiero/teilhard-de-chardin-and-the-formation-of-the-noosphere/from-noosphere-to-fheosphere-cyclotrons-cyberspace-and-teilhard-de-chardin-vision-of-cosmic-love/noosfera-oggi/is-noogenesis-progressing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart E.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972816/]&lt;/ref&gt; including "the contemporary period of evolution on Earth, signified by transformation of biosphere onto the sphere of intelligence—noosphere",&lt;ref name=eco&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ecolog/5147/НООГЕНЕЗ Noogenesis // Environmental encyclopedic dictionary. — Chisinau: editorial of the Moldovan Soviet encyclopedia. — 1990. — 408 p.] ({{ISBN|5-88550-006-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; "evolution run by human mind"&lt;ref name=ts&gt;Yatsenko N. E. Explanatory dictionary of social science terms. - Lan. — 1999. — 528 p. ({{ISBN|5-8114-0167-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S. '''World Mind''' // Itogy, 2005. - №26(472), P. 77-79.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, generalizing and summarizing: 
{{quote|"Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter). Noogenesis represents a set of natural, interconnected, characterized by a certain temporal sequence of structural and functional transformations of the entire hierarchy and set of interacting among themselves on the basic structures and processes ranging from the formation and separation of the rational system to the present (the phylogenesis of the nervous systems of organisms; the evolution of humanity as [[autonomy|autonomous]] intelligent systems) or death (in the course of ontogenesis of the human brain)".&lt;ref&gt;Eryomin A.L.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);
* Development of an individual mind (ontogenesis );
* Appearance of the Global Intelligence concept.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Several published works which do not employ the term "noogenesis", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: [[working memory]] capacity  ≥ 7,&lt;ref&gt;Read D.W.

The '''Ocean Worlds Exploration Program''' ('''OWEP''') is an initiative to create a [[NASA]] mission program meant to explore the places in the [[outer Solar System]] that could possess subsurface oceans, to assess their [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] and to seek simple [[extraterrestrial life]].

Prime targets include moons that harbor hidden oceans inside a shell of ice: [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].  A host of other bodies in the outer Solar System are inferred by a single type of observation or by theoretical modeling to have subsurface oceans.  Europa is the first planned target of this program, and will be visited by the planned ''[[Europa Clipper]]'' orbiter mission.&lt;ref name="McEwen presentation 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FY 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/images/stories/NASA%20FY2016%20budget%20request%20may%2027.pdf |format=PDF |title=NASA’s FY2016 Budget Request |work=Space Policy Online |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=2017-09-30 |quote= In fact, the report accompanying the bill directs NASA to create an "Ocean Worlds Exploration Program" of which the Europa mission is part.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief author of NASA's budget proposal is [[John Culberson]], the head of the science subcommittee in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In Spring 2015 he presented a budget request, creating the possibility of an all-new NASA mission program.&lt;ref name="Wenz 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger 2015"/&gt; The House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2016 House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) bill on May 20, 2015.&lt;ref name="FY 2016"/&gt; Therefore, the Committee directed NASA to create an Ocean Worlds Exploration Program whose primary goal is to discover extant life on another world using a mix of [[Discovery program|Discovery]], [[New Frontiers Program|New Frontiers]] and [[Flagship Program|Flagship]] class missions consistent with the recommendations of current and future [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]]s.&lt;ref name="McEwen presentation 2016"/&gt;

In the FY2017 Budget Request, the committee recommended $348 million for "Outer Planets" and "Ocean Worlds," of which not less than $260 million is for the Europa orbiter and lander, with launch of the ''Europa Clipper'' orbiter in 2022 and the [[Europa Lander (NASA)|Europa Lander]] in 2024.&lt;ref name="FY2016 Budget"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/images/stories/NASA%20FY2017%20budget%20request%20may%2023%202016.pdf |format=PDF |title=NASA’s FY2017 Budget Request |work=Space Policy Online |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 technical analysis stated that the technical challenges are enormous, and that "Without a genuinely strategic program plan, the great promise of an OWEP [Ocean Worlds Exploration Program] is highly likely to remain unfulfilled." &lt;ref name='Sherwood 2017'&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/V2050/pdf/8034.pdf FOLLOW THE (OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM) WATER: PROGRAM OPTIONS TO EXPLORE OCEAN WORLDS]. (PDF). B. Sherwood, J. Lunine, C. Sotin, T. Cwik1, F. Naderi. Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that development of OWEP-enabling technologies must currently compete for priority with other Solar System objectives, which is not useful for strategic planning. The report recommends common, multi-mission technical infrastructure and secure funding to develop it.&lt;ref name='Sherwood 2017'/&gt;

On [[Earth]], itself an ocean world, liquid water is essential to [[life]] as we know it. A question is whether the dark, alien oceans of the outer Solar System could be habitable for simple life forms, and if so, what would their [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|biochemistry]] be.&lt;ref name="PS Division"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarsystem.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/oceanworlds |title=Missions to Ocean Worlds: The Quest for Life |last=Dunford |first=Dunford |work=NASA Planetary Science Division |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring these moons could help to answer the question of [[Abiogenesis|how life arose]] on Earth and whether it exists anywhere else in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Creech 2016"/&gt; It may also be possible to find pre-biotic chemistry occurring, which could provide clues to how life started on Earth.&lt;ref name="Scott 2015"/&gt;  Any life detected at the remote ocean worlds in the [[outer Solar System]] would likely have formed and evolved along an independent path from life on Earth, giving us a deeper understanding of the potential for life in the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Phys2017"/&gt;

[[Oceanography|Oceanographers]], [[biology|biologists]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologists]] are part of the team developing the strategy roadmap.&lt;ref name="McEwen presentation 2016"/&gt; The planning also considers implementing [[planetary protection]] measures to avoid contaminating extraterrestrial habitable environments with resilient stowaway bacteria on their landers.&lt;ref name="McEwen presentation 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phys2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-nasa-explore-europa-ocean-worlds.html |title=NASA's plans to explore Europa and other "ocean worlds" |work=Universe Today |publisher=PhysOrg |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three best-documented water oceans beyond Earth are those within Europa, Enceladus and Titan. Of these, Europa's is closest to the surface —less than 10&amp;nbsp;km— and hence potentially best suited for eventual direct exploration. Enceladus' ocean is deeper —5 to 40&amp;nbsp;km below its surface— but fractures beneath the south pole of this moon allow ice and gas from the ocean to escape to space where it has been sampled by [[mass spectrometers]] aboard the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'']] Saturn orbiter. Titan's ocean is the deepest, at 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;km, and no evidence for plumes or ice volcanism exist on the surface. A host of other bodies in the outer Solar System are inferred by a single type of observation or by theoretical modeling to have subsurface oceans and these include: [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Pluto]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]],&lt;ref name="McEwen presentation 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creech 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160011102 |title=Ocean World Exploration and SLS: Enabling the Search for Life |last=Creech |first=Stephen D |last2=Vane |first2=Greg |work=Nasa Technical Reports Server |publisher=NASA |archivedate= 30 July 2016 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Paul Scott |url=http://www.americaspace.com/2015/05/20/ocean-worlds-exploration-program-new-budget-proposal-calls-for-missions-to-europa-enceladus-and-titan/ |title='Ocean Worlds Exploration Program': New Budget Proposal Calls for Missions to Europa, Enceladus, and Titan |work=AmericaSpace |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wenz 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wenz |first=John |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a15632/nasa-ocean-exploration/ |title=NASA Wants to go Underwater Exploring on Ocean Moons |work=Popular Mechanics |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |url=http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2015/05/the-house-budget-for-nasa-plants-the-seeds-of-a-program-to-finally-find-life-in-the-outer-solar-system/ |title=The House budget for NASA plants the seeds of a program to finally find life in the outer solar system |work=Chron |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/infographic.view.php?id=11262 Ocean Worlds].

'''Pavilion Lake''' is a [[lake]] in [[Marble Canyon (Canada)|Marble Canyon]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  It is located between the towns of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] and [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]] (29.44 kilometres WNW, [[as the crow flies]], from Cache Creek) and lies along [[British Columbia Highway 99|BC Highway 99]], 8.85 highway kilometres (northeast then southeast) from [[Pavilion, British Columbia]].  Part of a [[karst]] formation, the lake is most notable for being home to colonies of [[microbialites]], a type of [[stromatolite]], and has become the subject of [[astrobiology]] research by [[NASA]], the [[Canadian Space Agency]], and research institutions from around the world.  The research falls under the umbrella of the [[Pavilion Lake Research Project]]. The lake area and its foreshore were added to [[Marble Canyon Provincial Park]] in order to protect its special scientific and heritage values.

There is a small community of lakeshore residences, some recreational and seasonal only, located on the lake's eastern shore adjacent to the highway.  The lake is overlooked by the cliffs of Marble Canyon, which is the southern buttress of the [[Marble Range]], and the forests of the northernmost [[Clear Range]].  Also overlooking the lake is [[Chimney Rock (Canada)|Chimney Rock]] (''K'lpalekw'' in [[Secwepemc'tsn]], "[[Coyote's Penis]]"), which like the lake and the canyon have spiritual significance to the adjoining native communities, the Tskwaylaxw people of [[Pavilion, British Columbia|Pavilion]] and the Bonaparte band of [[Secwepemc]] at [[Upper Hat Creek, British Columbia|Upper Hat Creek]].  One of the [[rancherie]]s and a rodeo and pow-wow ground of the Pavilion Band is located at Marble Canyon's south entrance.&lt;!--in whose territory the lake is I don't want to get into ;-|--&gt;

'''Peter''' (1941–1952) was a [[collie]] dog who in 1945 was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]], considered to be the [[Victoria Cross]] for animals. During the later stages of the Second World War he served as a search and rescue dog in London. He attended the 1946 Civil Defence Stand–Down parade, where he was presented to the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]], and [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]. His medal was auctioned in 2000 for £4,600 (US$6,964).

==Rescue career==
Peter was born in 1941, and was purchased by Mrs Audrey Stables, of Gregory Avenue, [[Weoley Castle]], for 25 [[shilling]]s. He was noted by his owner as having dual talents; for destruction of his owner's home and for ignoring every command given.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt; He was transferred into war service, serving with Air Ministry dog-handler Archie Knight at the Civil Defence depot in Chelsea. He was known as Rescue Dog No. 2664/9288 Peter.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt;

Active from early 1945 until the end of the Second World War, Peter acted as a search and rescue dog in London. Knight wrote of the dog in a report, "I think one of his finest jobs was on Monday. We were called 20 hours after the incident and after several hours of heavy rain. Three bodies were missing and he very quickly indicated in a most unlikely spot, but he was right, and they uncovered a man and a woman. The next day we were called to another job. There were so many calls for Peter that I worked him 10 hours and he never once refused to give all he had. All his marks revealed casualties. I hated to work him like this&amp;nbsp;– but I also hated to refuse the rescue parties who were asking for him."&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt; Peter's rescue efforts were not limited to saving people; on one occasion he indicated a trapped victim which turned out to be a [[grey parrot]].&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt; On another occasion he saved six people in a single attack.&lt;ref name=briefingglasgow&gt;{{cite news|title=Briefing: The Dickin Medal|page=17|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=6 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Peter and his handler were present at the Civil Defence Stand–Down parade in [[Hyde Park, London]]. It was there that he was presented to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]], and received a kiss on the nose from [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]], the future Elizabeth II.&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Helen|title=Queen's kiss for Peter the hero collie Dickin Medal awarded to wayward wartime rescue dog goes on sale|page=3|newspaper=[[Birmingham Post]]|date=13 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ilfordpdsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Ilford Animal Cemetery|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/pdsa-history/ilford-animal-cemetery/|publisher=PDSA|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later used to demonstrate mountain rescue techniques to other rescue dogs and handlers. He returned home to Mrs Stables, and moved to a [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]] animal sanctuary before he died.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt; Peter was buried at the PDSA's [[Ilford Animal Cemetery]] on 20 November 1952, one of twelve recipients of the Dickin Medal to be buried there.&lt;ref name=ilfordpdsa/&gt;

==Awards==
Peter was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]], considered to be the [[Victoria Cross]] for animals,&lt;ref name=ilfordpdsa/&gt; in November 1945.

'''Peter W. Chiarelli''' (born March 23, 1950)&lt;ref&gt;Marquis Who's Who on the Web&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[United States Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who served as the 32nd [[Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army]] from August 4, 2008 to January 31, 2012. He also served as commander, [[Multi-National Corps – Iraq]] under [[General officer|General]] [[George W. Casey, Jr.]]. He was the Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense from March 2007 to August 2008. He retired from the [[U.S. Army]] on January 31, 2012 after nearly 40 years of service, and was succeeded as Vice Chief of Staff by Gen. [[Lloyd J. Austin III]].

==Early life and education==
Chiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of [[Seattle University]] [[Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army ROTC]]. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from [[platoon]] to [[corps]].

==Career==
His first assignments were with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Lewis]], including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); [[troop]] executive officer; and [[troop]] commander.&lt;ref&gt;
Association of 3rd Armored Division Veterans, [http://www.3ad.org/members-only-section/armor-site/8th-cavalry-regiment/4-8-cavalry/4-8-cav-roster/major-general-chiarelli/ Biography, Peter W. Chiarelli], retrieved June 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  

Chiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.

He commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at [[Fort Lewis]], Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the [[Iraq War]] and during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom II]]; and served as commanding general of [[Multi-National Corps – Iraq]].

He holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[political science]] from [[Seattle University]], a [[Master of Public Administration]] degree from the [[Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Washington]], and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[National Security|national security strategy]] from [[Salve Regina University]]. He is also a graduate of the U.S. [[Naval Command and Staff College]] and the [[National War College]].

Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term '''posttraumatic stress''', dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-name-for-ptsd-could-mean-less-stigma/2012/05/05/gIQAlV8M4T_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness. &lt;ref&gt;One Mind, [http://onemind.org/About-Us/Staff About Us: Staff Biography, Pete Chiarelli], retrieved January 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postpartum thyroiditis''' is a phenomenon observed following [[pregnancy]]&lt;ref name="pmid11588143"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muller AF, Drexhage HA, Berghout A |title=Postpartum thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis in women of childbearing age: recent insights and consequences for antenatal and postnatal care |journal=Endocr. Rev. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=605–30 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11588143 |doi= 10.1210/er.22.5.605|url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may involve [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]] or the two sequentially.  It affects about 5% of all women within a year after giving birth. The first phase is typically [[hyperthyroidism]]. Then, the [[thyroid]] either returns to normal or a woman develops [[hypothyroidism]]. Of those women who experience hypothyroidism associated with postpartum thyroiditis, one in five will develop permanent hypothyroidism requiring lifelong treatment.

Postpartum thyroiditis is believed to result from the modifications to the [[immune system]] necessary in [[pregnancy]], and histologically is a [[subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis]]. The process is normally self-limiting, but when conventional [[antibodies]] are found there is a high chance of this proceeding to permanent hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis is a member of the group of thyroiditis conditions known as [[resolving thyroiditis]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The initial phase of hyperthyroid symptoms occurs transiently about two to six months postpartum.&lt;ref name="Stagnaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stagnaro-Green|first=A.|title=Postpartum thyroiditis|journal=Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|year=2004|volume=18|issue=2|pages=303–316|doi=10.1016/j.beem.2004.03.008|pmid=15157842|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical symptoms include irritability, nervousness, [[palpitations]], and heat intolerance. Hormonal disturbances during this phase tend to occur with lower intensity compared with the hypothyroid phase.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt; As a result, the hyperthyroid phase may pass undetected. The second phase of hypothyroid symptoms is also transient and can occur anytime within the three- to twelve-month period postpartum.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt; Women in this phase experience low energy, poor memory, impaired concentration, carelessness, dry skin, cold intolerance, and general aches and pains. After one year postpartum, [[euthyroid]] function resumes. Any case with hypothyroid symptoms extending beyond one year postpartum is not considered postpartum thyroiditis.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt;

Women who test positive for thyroid antibodies may be at increased risk of developing symptoms associated with [[postpartum depression]] than women without thyroid antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bokhari|first=R.|author2=Bhatara, V.S. |author3=Bandettini, F. |author4=McMillan, J.M. |title=Postpartum psychosis and postpartum thyroiditis|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|year=1998|volume=23|issue=6|pages=643–650|doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
During pregnancy, immunologic suppression occurs which induces tolerance to the presence of the fetus.&lt;ref name="Premawardhana"&gt;Premawardhana, L.D.K.E., Parkes, A.B., &amp; Lazarus, J.H. (2004). Thyroiditis, postpartum. In Editor-in-Chief:   Luciano Martini (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of endocrine diseases'' (pp. 509-514). New York: Elsevier. {{doi|10.1016/B0-12-475570-4/01299-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without this suppression, the fetus would be rejected causing miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Premawardhana /&gt; As a result, following delivery, the immune system rebounds causing levels of thyroids antibodies to rise in susceptible women.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro2&gt;Stagnaro-Green, A. (2000). Recognizing, understanding, and treating postpartum thyroiditis. ''Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism Clinics of North America'', 29(2), 417-430. {{doi|10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the immunohistological features of susceptible women are indicated by:&lt;ref name=Premawardhana /&gt;

*antibodies to [[thyroglobulin]] (TgAb)
*antibodies to [[thyroid peroxidase]] (TPOAb)
*increase in TPOAb subclasses IgG&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;-IgG&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;
*lymphocyte infiltration and follicle formation within thyroid gland ([[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]])
*T-cell changes (increased [[CD4]]:[[CD8]] ratio)
* TSH-receptor antibodies (TSH-R Abs)

==Diagnosis==
This condition is commonly undiagnosed by physicians due to either unfamiliarity with the disease, the subtlety of symptoms, or the attribution of the symptoms to the stresses of having a newborn.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro2 /&gt; Usual screening begins with assessing the [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) level. A suppressed TSH could represent the hyperthyroid phase, but warrants further testing to investigate for possible [[Graves' disease]].&lt;ref name=Stagnaro2 /&gt; A normal TSH with persistent symptoms could represent the shift between phases and requires repeat testing 4–6 weeks later; an elevated TSH at this time could indicate the hypothyroid phase.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro2 /&gt;

==Treatment==
For most women, the hyperthyroid phase presents with very mild symptoms or is asypmtomatic; intervention is usually not required. If symptomatic cases require treatment, a short course of [[beta-blockers]] would be effective.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt;

Assessing treatment for the hypothyroid is more complex. Women with symptoms or a very high TSH level, or both, are usually prescribed a course of [[levothyroxine]].&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt; Asymptomatic women with slightly elevated TSH levels who are planning subsequent pregnancies, should consider a course of treatment until completion of the family to avoid possible developmental complications in future children.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt; Otherwise, treatment could be discontinued after 1 year postpartum.

==Prevalence==
On average, 5-7% of pregnant women from most iodine-replete populations develop this condition.&lt;ref name="Premawardhana"/&gt;

Women with [[type I diabetes mellitus]] have a threefold increase in the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis than non-diabetic women in the same region.&lt;ref name=Stagnaro /&gt;

'''Renato López Uhthoff''' was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] television [[Television presenter|host]], actor and musician.

==Origins==
He was born in 1983 in Mexico City, but at an early age his family took him to the United States, where he lived in Miami, Los Angeles and New York. As a result, he spoke both Spanish and English fluently. From the age of 6, he modeled and performed in commercials. Renato was the brother of Swedish singer [[Denise Lopez (Swedish singer)|Denise Lopez]].,&lt;ref name=ab&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article23985268.ab Denise Lopez bror har mördats i Mexiko]&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastian "DjZeb" López, Samantha López, Arturo Everitt (photographer in Los Angeles) and Tiana Del Castillo.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He had been in a seven-year relationship with Alexandra Ivanisevic, a fashion blogger and Swedish transplant to Mexico City.&lt;ref name=universal/&gt;

==Career==
He was a guitarist for the rock band [[The Prom Kings]] and previously hosted music shows on [[Mun2]], such as ''[[El show]]'' and ''[[Vivo (TV series)|Vivo]]''. 
López had an homonymous TV show on [[Telehit]] which started on March 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/telehit/noticias/268905/telehit-con-renato/|title=Telehit|first=|last=Telehit|work=esmas.com|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Telehit, in August 2012, he joined E! Entertainment to host the show ''Zona Trendy''.

In 2012, he appeared in the Mexican film ''El Cielo En Tu Mirada''.

He wrote songs for Mexican pop stars such as "Si pudiera" for [[Paty Cantú]] and ''Fuego con fuego'' for [[Gloria Trevi]]. He also starred in Trevi's music video ''Vestida de azúcar'' &lt;ref name=universal/&gt;&lt;ref name=bb/&gt; and had a small music production company in Los Angeles and a music studio in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=universal&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/espectaculos/farandula/2016/11/25/perfil-renato-lopez "Perfil.

He was hosting the TV shows ''E! Latin News'' on E! Latinoamérica, and ''MxDiseña'' on Canal Sony México,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/canal_sonymx/status/802020022709272576|title=Canal Sony Mexico on Twitter|work=twitter.com|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his death. In 2016, he costarred in [[Juanes]]' video ''Fuego''&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt; as well as the Mexican film ''[[Macho (film)|Macho]]'', which was playing in Mexican cinemas at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3tHffEvVUGE|title=MACHO - Trailer oficial - estreno en noviembre|first=|last=Corazón Films|date=12 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The day before the bodies of López and his publicist (Omar Girón Juárez) were found, they had driven to the affluent suburban area of Zona Esmeralda, [[Atizapán]] in the northwestern part of Greater Mexico City and an area that is teeming with regional drug cartels. A man named Carlos Morales had invited them to either a casting or a meeting about a PR campaign, and arranged to pick them up and drive them to another location where the casting or meeting was supposedly to take place. Morales is now identified as a suspect in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eldiariony.com/2016/11/30/la-policia-ya-tiene-un-sospechoso-del-asesinato-del-actor-renato-lopez/  "La policía ya tiene un sospechoso del asesinato del actor Renato López", ''El Diario'' (New York)'', 30 November 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 5:30 P.M., Girón emailed Morales, stating that the area looked lonely and dangerous. That was the last anyone heard from Girón or López.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=644320&amp;idFC=2016 "Renato López y representante fueron citados para supuesta campaña propagandística. Con Javier Poza" ''Radio Fórmula'', 28 November 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
López's and Girón's bodies were found with gunshot wounds, inside a car, in Santa María Mazatla, a rural village in the [[Jilotzingo]] municipality, about 15&amp;nbsp;km west of Zona Esmeralda.

===Motives===
Authorities have concluded that the assassins were targeting López specifically, as there was no evidence of robbery, nor kidnapping and López was shot 13 times; and believe the assassins may be members of drug gangs from the area.&lt;ref name=pais&gt;[http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/11/30/inenglish/1480504528_881361.html "The thirteen bullets it took to kill Renato", ''[[El País]]'' (English), 30 November 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The local police reported a shootout in the area the previous night; however, the authorities do not have a definitive conclusion as to what happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/espectaculos/cine/2016/11/25/muere-baleado-el-actor-renato-lopez|title=Muere baleado el actor Renato López|work=[[El Universal (México)|El Universal]]|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quien.com/espectaculos/2016/11/24/encuentran-sin-vida-al-actor-y-conductor-renato-lopez/amp|title=Encuentran sin vida al actor y conductor Renato López.|website=www.quien.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2016, newspapers reported that the State of Mexico prosecutor stated that the assassination motive may have been an "emotional revenge", related to an as-yet unknown woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/espectaculos/farandula/2016/12/10/una-mujer-detras-del-asesinato-de-renato-lopez|title=Una mujer, detrás del asesinato de Renato López|date=2016-12-10|work=El Universal|access-date=2017-11-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
Celebrities such as [[LP (singer)|LP]],  [[Juanes]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Bárbara Mori]], Miguel Rodarte, [[Aislinn Derbez]], [[Manolo Cardona]], [[Aracely Arámbula]] and [[Dulce María]] lamented López's death on social media.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7588807/actor-renato-lopez-death-juanes-fuego-video "Juanes on Actor Renato Lopez's Death: 'It Was an Honor to Have You in Our Journey'", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 25 November 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Some friends of López tattooed the word "Taco" on the ring finger of their right hands in his memory, as he had such a tattoo, referring to his love for the [[taco|Mexican food dish]].&lt;ref&gt;TACO-Todo Amor Cero Odio

[[File:Kostnice Sedlec.JPG|thumbnail|Chapel Interior]]
The '''Sedlec Ossuary''' ({{lang-cs|Kostnice v Sedlci}}) is a small [[Roman Catholic]] [[chapel]], located beneath the Cemetery Church of All Saints (Czech: ''Hřbitovní kostel Všech Svatých''), part of the former [[Sedlec Abbey]] in Sedlec, a suburb of [[Kutná Hora]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. The [[ossuary]] is estimated to contain the [[skeletons]] of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. The ossuary is among the most visited [[tourist attraction]]s of the Czech Republic - attracting over 200,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nipos-mk.cz/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Statistika-2009_1dil_100922.pdf NIPOS: Statistika kultury 2009 - I. díl - kulturní dědictví (muzea, galerie a památkové objekty)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Four enormous bell-shaped mounds occupy the corners of the chapel. An enormous [[chandelier]] of bones, which contains at least one of every bone in the human body, hangs from the center of the nave with garlands of [[human skull|skull]]s draping the vault. Other works include piers and [[monstrance]]s flanking the [[altar]], a [[coat of arms]] of the [[House of Schwarzenberg]], and the signature of Rint, also executed in bone, on the wall near the entrance.

==History==
[[Image:Hřbitovní kaple Všech Svatých v Sedlci u Kutné Hory.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel exterior]]
In 1278, Henry, the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]] in Sedlec, was sent to the [[Holy Land]] by King [[Otakar II of Bohemia]]. He returned with a small amount of earth he had removed from [[Golgotha]] and sprinkled it over the abbey [[cemetery]]. The word of this pious act soon spread and the cemetery in Sedlec became a desirable [[burial]] site throughout [[Central Europe]].

In the mid 14th century, during the [[Black Death]], and after the [[Hussite Wars]] in the early 15th century, many thousands were buried in the abbey cemetery, so it had to be greatly enlarged.

Around 1400, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church was built in the center of the cemetery with a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] upper level and a lower chapel to be used as an [[ossuary]] for the mass graves unearthed during construction, or simply slated for demolition to make room for new burials.

After 1511, the task of [[exhumation|exhuming]] skeletons and stacking their bones in the chapel was given to a half-[[blindness|blind]] [[monk]] of the order.

Between 1703 and 1710, a new entrance was constructed to support the front wall, which was leaning outward, and the upper chapel was rebuilt. This work, in the Czech [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, was designed by [[Jan Santini Aichel]].

In 1870, [[František Rint]], a woodcarver, was employed by the [[House of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]] family to put the bone heaps into order, yielding a [[macabre]] result. The signature of Rint, also executed in bone, appears on the wall near the entrance to the chapel.

==In media==
In 1970, the centenary of Rint's contributions, Czech filmmaker [[Jan Švankmajer]] was commissioned to document the ossuary. The result was a 10-minute-long frantic-cut film of skeletal images overdubbed with an actual tour-guide's neutral voice narration. This version was initially banned by the Czech Communist authorities for alleged [[subversion]], and the soundtrack was replaced by a brief spoken introduction and a [[jazz]] arrangement by [[Zdeněk Liška]] of the [[poem]] "Comment dessiner le portrait d'un oiseau" ("How to Draw the Portrait of a Bird") by [[Jacques Prévert]]. Since the [[Velvet Revolution]], the original tour guide soundtrack has been made available.

In the documentary ''[[Long Way Round]]'', [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Charley Boorman]] stop to see this church. [[Dan Cruickshank]] also views the church in his ''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture|Adventures in Architecture]]''.

The ossuary is a major plot device in the [[John Connolly (author)|John Connolly]] novel ''The Black Angel''.

The ossuary is used as a location for the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' movie]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Czech Republic|url=http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech_culture/filming_locations.html|publisher=My Czech Republic|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movie ''[[Blood &amp; Chocolate (film)|Blood &amp; Chocolate]]''.

The ossuary was also featured in ''[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]]'' and is described by [[Cara Seymour]] in the final scene of the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]''

The ossuary was also the influence for Dr. Satan's lair in the [[Rob Zombie]] film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan Strusiewicz|first=Cezary|title=The 6 Creepiest Places on Earth|url=http://www.cracked.com/article/181_the-6-creepiest-places-earth_p2/|publisher=Cracked.com|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-09 alphen geen geweld.JPG|thumb|The [[ladybug street tile]] is a symbol against "senseless violence" in the [[Netherlands]] and is often placed on the sites of deadly crimes.]]
'''Senseless violence''' or '''zinloos geweld''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a term frequently used by among others the media, politicians and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to define the nature of several shocking events in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in recent years. The use of the term is politically charged and may not reflect any unique elements of any particular crime given that label.

The term expresses the perceived senselessness of the occurred acts of [[violence]]; the perpetrator and the victim do not know each other, the violence seems not to be motivated by greed or other common factors. The violence occurs suddenly and often under the influence of alcohol.

==Origin of the term==
The term "senseless violence", in the meaning used in this article, was first used in 1997 by Cees Bangma, district chief of the Dutch police unit Midden-Friesland. Before 1997 the term did not carry the same moral connotation in Belgian and Dutch culture, and typically referred to overseas warzone violence. Bangma used it in a letter written to the [[Leeuwarder Courant]], a [[Frisia]]n newspaper in which he made an appeal to the Dutch population to have a minute of silence for [[Meindert Tjoelker]], who was killed on 13 September 1997. This minute was necessary "to make it clear to everyone that the Frisian society does not accept senseless violence". A wave of reactions followed, which also included [[media hype]]. As a consequence, much more attention was spent to every similar case of violence, which led to the perception that violence was on the increase.

A political group ''Landelijke Stichting Tegen Zinloos Geweld'' (national foundation against senseless violence) was created and people created the lady bug tile as a memorial or reminder against senseless violence. The group send guest teachers to schools and sport associations, but became rather inactive since ca. 2009.

==Criticism==
The term is often criticized. Some people think that violence is never legitimate and consider the term to be a tautology. Others say that the term has never been clearly defined and does not help to understand a peticular phenomenon. Others point out that the term is or can be misused by politicians who strive for more repressive measures against crimes.

In 2016, the national newspaper NRC reported about a recent case of youngsters mistreating a homeless person. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson of the police who said that hardly any violence happens ''out of the blue''. Criminologists have started to use the term ''uitgaansgeweld'' instead, violence occurring ''going out'' in the evening to pubs and bars. Because of the local approach there are no recent national figures about the phenomenon, according to an expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/09/05/dodelijke-klappen-op-de-wallen-4147978-a1519868|title=‘Zinloos geweld’, bestaat dat nog?|work=NRC|access-date=2018-09-11|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ssb golfii.png|300px|thumb|Several views of a Project 629A (Golf II) ballistic missile submarine]]
'''''K-129''''' was a Project 629A ([[NATO reporting name]] [[Golf-class submarine|Golf II]]) diesel-electric powered submarine of the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]], one of six [[Project 629]] strategic ballistic missile submarines attached to the 15th Submarine Squadron based at Rybachiy Naval Base, [[Kamchatka]], commanded by Rear Admiral Rudolf A. Golosov.

In January 1968, the 15th Submarine Squadron was part of the 29th Ballistic Missile Division at Rybachiy, commanded by Admiral Viktor A. Dygalo. ''K-129''{{'}}s commander was Captain First Rank V.I. Kobzar. ''K-129'' carried [[hull number]] 722 on her final deployment during which she sank on 8 March 1968. It was one of four mysterious submarine disappearances in 1968; the others being the Israeli submarine {{Ship|INS|Dakar}}, the {{Ship|French submarine|Minerve|S647|6}} and the U.S. submarine {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}. The Soviet Navy deployed a huge flotilla of ships to search for her but never found her wreck.

The United States attempted to recover the boat in 1974 in a secret [[Cold War]]-era effort named [[Project Azorian]]. The vessel's position {{convert|16000|ft|km|order=flip}} below the surface was the greatest depth from which an attempt had been made to raise a ship. The [[cover up|cover story]] used was that the salvage vessel was engaged in commercial [[manganese nodule]] mining. Only part of the submarine was recovered.
[[File:K-129 Incident Map.tif|alt=Sinking of K-129 detailed on a Map|thumb|448x448px|Map of the sinking of ''K-129'']]

==Sinking==
''K-129'', having completed two 70-day ballistic-missile combat patrols in 1967, was tasked with her third patrol in February 1968, with an expected completion date of 5 May 1968. Upon departure on 24 February, ''K-129'' reached deep water, conducted its test dive, returned to the surface to report by radio that all was well, and proceeded on patrol. No further communication was received from ''K-129'', despite normal radio check-ins expected when the submarine crossed the 180th meridian, and when it arrived at its patrol area.

By mid-March, Soviet naval authorities in [[Kamchatka]] became concerned that ''K-129'' had missed two consecutive radio check-ins. First, ''K-129'' was instructed by normal fleet broadcast to break radio silence and contact headquarters; later and more urgent communications all went unanswered. Soviet naval headquarters declared ''K-129'' "missing" by the third week of March and organized an air, surface, and sub-surface search-and-rescue effort in the North Pacific from Kamchatka and [[Vladivostok]].

This Soviet deployment in the Pacific was analysed by U.S. intelligence as probably in reaction to a submarine loss. U.S. [[SOSUS]] Naval Facilities ([[Naval Facilities Engineering Command|NAVFACs]]) in the North Pacific were alerted and requested to review recent acoustic records to identify any possible associated signal. Several SOSUS arrays recorded a possibly related event on 8 March 1968, and upon examination produced sufficient triangulation by lines-of-bearing to provide the U.S. Navy with a [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] for the probable wreck site. One source characterized the acoustic signal as "an isolated, single sound of an explosion or implosion, 'a good-sized bang'."&lt;ref name="craven"&gt;Craven, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|205}} The acoustic event was reported to have originated near 40 N, 180th longitude.&lt;ref name="craven" /&gt;

Soviet search efforts, lacking the equivalent of the U.S. SOSUS system, were unable to locate ''K-129'', and eventually Soviet naval activity in the North Pacific returned to normal. ''K-129'' was subsequently declared lost with all hands.

American intelligence resources, with the aid of SOSUS triangulation, would later locate the ''K-129'' wreck, photograph it ''[[in situ]]'' at its {{convert|16000|ft|m|-2|adj=on|order=flip}} depth, and partially salvage it several years later.

==Discovery and salvage: Project Azorian==
{{main|Project Azorian}}
The wreck of ''K-129'' was identified by {{USS|Halibut|SSGN-587|6}} northwest of [[Oahu]] at an approximate depth of {{convert|16000|ft|m|-2|order=flip}} on 20 August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;"K-129", in ''Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence'', by Nigel West (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015) p183&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was surveyed in detail over the next three weeks by ''Halibut'' – reportedly with over 20,000 close-up photos – and later also possibly by the [[bathyscaphe]] {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste II||2}}. Given a unique opportunity to recover a Soviet [[R-21 (missile)|SS-N-5 Serb]] nuclear missile without the knowledge of the Soviet Union, the ''K-129'' wreck came to the attention of U.S. national authorities. President Nixon authorized a salvage attempt after consideration by the Secretary of Defense and the White House. To ensure the salvage attempt remained "[[Black operation|black]]" (''i.e.'' clandestine and secret) the [[CIA]], rather than the Navy, was tasked to conduct the operation. ''[[GSF Explorer|Hughes Glomar Explorer]]'' was designed and built under CIA contract solely for the purpose of conducting a clandestine salvage of ''K-129''. The salvage operation, named [[Project Azorian]], would be one of the most expensive and deepest secrets of the Cold War.

===Leak and widespread media attention===
[[Seymour Hersh]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' uncovered some of the details of Project Azorian in 1974, but was kept from publication by the action of the [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[William Colby]]. Months after the salvage operation was completed, in February 1975, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ran a brief story regarding the CIA operation, which led ''The New York Times'' to release Hersh's story. [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] continued the story on national television in March 1975.&lt;ref name=CIA1&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/doc01.pdf Project Azorian: The Story of the Hughes Glomar Explorer], a CIA declassified Secret Noforn document from the mid-1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; The media called the operation Project Jennifer, which in 2010 was revealed to be incorrect, since Jennifer referred only to a security system which compartmentalised Azorian project data.&lt;ref name="CIA1" /&gt;

''Hughes Glomar Explorer'' was publicly believed to be mining [[manganese nodule]]s on the sea floor. Once the real purpose of Azorian was leaked to the media, however, the Soviet Union eventually found out about what happened. According to one account, in July–August 1974 ''Hughes Glomar Explorer'' grappled with and was able to lift the forward half of the wreck of ''K-129'', but as it was raised the claw suffered a critical failure resulting in the forward section breaking into two pieces with the all-important [[Submarine sail|sail]] area and centre section falling back to the ocean floor. Thus the centre sail area and the after portions of ''K-129'' were allegedly not recovered. What exactly was retrieved in the section that was recovered is classified Secret Noforn or [[Top Secret]], but the Soviets assumed that the United States recovered torpedoes with nuclear warheads, operations manuals, code books and coding machines. Another source (unofficial) states that the U.S. recovered the bow area, which contained two nuclear torpedoes,&lt;ref name="polmar"&gt;Polmar, 2004, Cold War Submarines&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} but no cryptographic equipment nor code books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Polmar|author2=Kenneth J. Moore|title=Cold War Submarines: The Design and Construction of U.S. and Soviet Submarines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U86giz-cluoC|year=2004|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57488-594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States announced that in the section they recovered were the bodies of six men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectjennifer.at/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205063115/http://projectjennifer.at/ |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[radioactive contamination]], the bodies were buried at sea in a steel chamber in September 1974, with full military honors about {{convert|90|nmi|km|0}} southwest of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="polmar" /&gt; The videotape of that ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJAJUJ41PBI|title=Burial At Sea of Soviet Submariners from Hughes Glomar Explorer|date=25 August 2014|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; was given to [[Russia]] by U.S. Director of Central Intelligence [[Robert Gates]] when he visited Moscow in October 1992.&lt;ref name="polmar" /&gt;{{rp|359}} The relatives of the crew members were eventually shown the video some years later.

===Continuing secrecy and official objections to full disclosure===
The ''K-129'' recovery has been stated to have been a failure, recovering only a small amount of insignificant parts of the submarine. The CIA argued in a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit, however, that the project had to be kept secret because any "[[Glomar response|official acknowledgment of involvement by U.S. Government agencies would disclose the nature and purpose of the program]]."&lt;ref name="Philippi"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response has entered the lexicon of legal jargon as ''the [[Glomar response]]'' or ''Glomarization''; "neither confirm nor deny".

As of 2018 the files, photographs, videotapes and other documentary evidence remain closed to the public. A few pictures appeared in a 2010 documentary showing the ''K-129'' wreck: the bow and the sail, with the missile compartment heavily damaged showing only one missile tube left attached to the structure.

==Specific location==
[[File:K129 HGE recoverysite.png|thumb|250px|Recovery site of ''K-129'']]
The location of the wreck remains an official secret of the United States intelligence services.  However, [[John P. Craven PhD, JD|Dr. John P. Craven]] points to a location nearly [[40th parallel north|40 degrees North]], and almost exactly on the [[180th meridian]]. CIA documents reveal that it sank "1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii," and that ''Hughes Glomar Explorer'' had to travel 3,008 miles from Long Beach, California, to reach the recovery site. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] states that two nuclear warheads from ''K-129'' were located in the Pacific 1,230 miles from Kamchatka at coordinates 40°6'N and 179°57'E at a depth of {{convert|6000|m}}, and lists them as recovered.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;{{cite web

The CIA gives {{convert|16440|and|16500|ft|order=flip}} for its approximate depth.&lt;ref name="CIA1" /&gt;

==Explaining the disaster==
The official Soviet Navy hypothesis is that ''K-129'', while operating in [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] mode, slipped below its operating depth. Such an event, combined with a mechanical failure or improper crew reaction, can cause flooding sufficient to sink the boat.&lt;ref&gt;Podvig, 2001, Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

This account, however, has not been accepted by many, and four alternative theories have been advanced to explain the loss of ''K-129'':

# A [[hydrogen]] explosion in the batteries while charging;
# A collision with {{USS|Swordfish|SSN-579|6}};
# A missile explosion caused by a leaking missile door seal;
# Intentional or unintentional scuttle by crew due to ''K-129'' violating normal operating procedures and/or departing from authorised operating areas.

Reportedly, as many as 40 of the complement of 98 were new to the submarine for this deployment.&lt;ref name="polmar" /&gt;

''K-129'' was approximately midway through standard shore leave/replenishment and repair when a new mission was tasked.&lt;ref name="sewell-rsnf"&gt;Sewell (2005) ''Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces'', Center for Arms Control Studies, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, edited by Pavel Podvig&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156}}

===Hydrogen explosion===
[[Lead–acid batteries]] vent explosive hydrogen gas while charging. The hydrogen gas, if not properly vented, could have accumulated into an explosive concentration.

Dr. John P. Craven, former chief scientist of the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office and former head of the [[Deep Submergence Systems Project|DSSP]] and [[Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle|DSRV]] programs, commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have never seen or heard of a submarine disaster that was not accompanied by the notion that the battery blew up and started it all. [...] Naive investigators, examining the damage in salvaged battery compartments, invariably blame the sinking on battery explosions until they learn that any fully charged battery suddenly exposed to seawater will explode. It is an inevitable effect of a sinking and almost never a cause.&lt;ref name="craven"/&gt;{{rp|215}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least one American submarine, {{USS|Cochino|SS-345|6}}, on the other hand, was lost off Norway in 1949 due to a hydrogen explosion in the battery compartment. Most of ''Cochino's'' crew was rescued and the cause of her sinking is therefore known.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag and Drew, ''Blind Man's Bluff.'' New York: Public Affairs (1998) pp. 12–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collision with USS ''Swordfish''===
It was standard practice during the [[Cold War]] for [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] attack submarines to trail Soviet missile submarines as they departed their home ports and moved into the North Pacific or the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="LATimes19850617"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-17/news/mn-12570_1/2 |title=Change in Soviets' Sub Tactics Tied to Spy Case: Material Reportedly Available to Walkers May Have Tipped Kremlin to Vessels' Vulnerability |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Robert C. |last=Toth |accessdate=2 January 2011 |date=17 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision hypothesis is the unofficial opinion of many [[Soviet Navy]] officers,&lt;ref name="offley"&gt;Offley, Ed ''Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon'' (Paperback – 24 Mar 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and is officially denied by the U.S. Navy. According to U.S. Navy sources, {{USS|Swordfish|SSN-579|6}} put into [[Yokosuka, Japan]] on 17 March 1968, shortly after the disappearance of ''K-129'', and received emergency repairs to a bent periscope, reportedly caused by ice impacted during surfacing while conducting classified operations in the [[Sea of Japan]].

The {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} seizure by the [[North Korea]]n government occurred in the Sea of Japan on 23 January 1968, and the U.S. Navy response to this incident included the deployment and maintenance of naval assets in the area off the eastern North Korean coast for some time thereafter.

In response to Russian efforts to ascertain whether ''K-129'' had been lost due to damage resulting from a collision with a U.S. submarine, an official U.S. statement by Ambassador [[Malcolm Toon]] to a Russian delegation during a meeting in the Kremlin in August 1993 related:

{{quote|At my request, U.S. naval intelligence searched the logs of all U.S. subs that were active in 1968. As a result, our director of naval intelligence has concluded that no U.S. sub was within {{convert|300|nmi|km|-1}} of your sub when it sank.&lt;ref name="sewellusrjc"&gt;Sewell (2005) ''Minutes of the Sixth Plenary Session'', USRJC, Moscow, 31 August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}}
}}

A news release in 2000 demonstrates that Russian suspicion and sensitivity concerning the collision possibility, and indeed their preference for such an explanation, remains active:

{{quote |As recently as 1999, Russian government officials complained that Washington was covering up its involvement. One accused the Americans of acting like a "criminal that had been caught and now claimed that guilt must be proved," according to the notes of a U.S. participant in a November 1999 meeting on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burns, AP, "Decades later, Russians press suspicion of U.S. role in sinking Soviet sub", 22 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A picture of ''Swordfish'' on 17 March 1968 at its berth in Japan published in a Japanese newspaper showed only a bent periscope and a dented sail. A collision sufficient to breach the pressure hull of another submarine would have significantly damaged the sail.&lt;ref name="Kemble200805"/&gt;

An unconfirmed report states that ''K-129'' was trailed from its home port [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] by {{USS|Barb|SSN-596|6}}, which had been stationed off Petropavlovsk for an intelligence-gathering mission. USS ''Barb'', according to the report, had orders to attack ''K-129'' if the Russian submarine was preparing for a missile launch.

On 3 October 1986 the Soviet {{sclass2-|Yankee|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile submarine]] {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-219||2}}, while on combat patrol in the Atlantic, suffered the explosion of a liquid-fuelled [[SS-N-6]] missile in one of its 16 missile tubes. The cause of the explosion was a leaking missile tube hatch seal. The leak allowed sea water to come into contact with residue of the missile's propellants, which caused a spontaneous fire resulting in an explosion first of the missile booster, then a subsequent explosion of the warhead detonator charge. In the case of the Yankee-class ballistic missile submarine, the missiles were located within the pressure hull and the explosion did not cause damage sufficient to immediately sink the boat. It did, however, cause extensive radioactive contamination throughout, requiring the submarine to surface and the evacuation of the crew to the weather deck, and later to a rescue vessel which had responded to the emergency. Subsequently, ''K-219'' sank into the [[Hatteras Abyss]] with the loss of four crewmen and rests at a depth of about {{convert|18000|ft|m|-2|order=flip}}. The Soviet Navy later claimed that the leak was caused by a collision with {{USS|Augusta|SSN-710|6}}.

There are indicators suggesting ''K-129'' suffered a similar explosion in 1968. First, the radioactive contamination of the recovered bow section and the six crewmen of ''K-129'' by weapons grade plutonium indicates the explosion of the warhead detonator charge of one of the missiles, ''before'' the ship reached its [[crush depth]]. The report that the forward section was crushed and that charring in the bow section indicated [[dieseling]] from an implosion (or alternatively from a fire), would indicate that the explosion occurred while ''K-129'' was submerged and at depth. The report found in [[Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage|''Blind Man's Bluff'']] that the wreck revealed ''K-129'' with a {{convert|10|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} hole immediately abaft the [[Conning tower#Submarines|conning tower]] would support the theory of an explosion of one of the three missiles in the sail (possibly missile #3). Since ''K-129''{{'}}s missiles were housed in the sail, much less structural mass (compared to the Yankee-class) was available to contain such an explosion, and loss of depth control of the submarine would be instantaneous.

===''K-129'' off-course or out of area===
According to Dr. John P. Craven, ''K-129'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] at [[40th parallel north|latitude 40 north]], which was far south of her expected position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When K-129 passed [[180th meridian|longitude 180]], it should have been farther north, at a [[45th parallel north|latitude of 45 degrees]], or more than three hundred miles away. If that was a navigational mistake it would be an error of historic proportions. Thus if the sub were not somewhere in the vicinity of where the Soviets supposed it to be, there would be a high probability, if not a certainty, that the submarine was a rogue, off on its own, in grave disobedience of its orders.&lt;ref name="craven"/&gt;{{rp|206}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Craven does not explain why he eliminated the possibilities that ''K-129'' was proceeding to a newly assigned and officially approved patrol area, or using a new track to an established patrol area, nor why he concluded that ''K-129'' was acting in an abnormal or criminal manner for a Soviet strategic missile submarine.

Craven also noted:

{{quote |While the Russian submarine was presumed to be at sea, an oceanographic ship of the University of Hawaii was conducting research in the oceanic waters off [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii's Leeward Islands]]. The researchers discovered a large slick on the surface of the ocean, collected a sample, and found that it was highly radioactive. They reported this to George Woolard, the director of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysical Research.&lt;ref name="craven"/&gt;{{rp|216}}}}

Craven does not reconcile a sinking location at [[40th parallel north|40°N latitude]] with an oil slick hundreds of miles south of that latitude, nor does he reconcile the date and time of the sinking with the date and time of the recovery of radioactive oil by the oceanographic research ship.{{original research inline|date=May 2018}}

Anatoliy Shtyrov (Анатолий Штыров), a former Deputy Chief of the Soviet Pacific Fleet intelligence, states that ''K-129'', whose normal patrol area was off the west coast of the United States, was sent on an unscheduled combat patrol in the eastern Pacific only 1.5 months after returning from its previous patrol.&lt;ref name="Shtyrov"&gt;

==Administrative inconsistencies==
Russian President Boris Yeltsin posthumously awarded the Order of Valor to 98 sailors who died aboard ''K-129''. Some have pointed to this level of manning as anomalous, because the normal complement of a diesel-electric Golf-class Russian submarine was about 83.&lt;ref name="sewell-rsnf"/&gt;{{rp|156}} Boosting total submarine complement by almost 20% might tax the logistical capabilities of the submarine (reducing patrol duration), and could potentially hamper the operations of the boat. No explanation for this level of submarine manning has been provided by the Russian Navy.

==Alternative theories on Project Azorian==
''Red Star Rogue'' by Kenneth Sewell makes the claim that Project Azorian recovered virtually all of ''K-129'' from the ocean floor,&lt;ref name="sewell-rsnf" /&gt;{{rp|243}} and in fact "Despite an elaborate cover-up and the eventual claim the project had been a failure, most of ''K-129'' and the remains of the crew were, in fact, raised from the bottom of the Pacific and brought into the ''Glomar Explorer''".&lt;ref name="sewell-rsnf" /&gt;{{rp|22}}

In August 1993, Ambassador [[Malcolm Toon]] presented to a Russian delegation ''K-129''{{'}}s [[ship's bell]].&lt;ref name="sewellusrjc" /&gt;{{rp|262}} According to ''Red Star Rogue'', this bell had been permanently attached to the middle of the [[conning tower]] of ''K-129'', thus indicating that in addition to the bow of the submarine, the critical and valuable midsection of the submarine was at least partially recovered by Project Azorian. Additionally, Ambassador Toon is quoted from the 6th Plenum of the [[U.S.–Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs]] &lt;ref name="sewellusrjc" /&gt;{{rp|262}} as stating, "Our director of naval intelligence has concluded that no U.S. sub was within 300 nautical miles of your sub when it sank". ''Red Star Rogue'' places K-129 at 24deg north latitude by 163 west longitude, less than 350 miles from Honolulu. This site is consistent with the discovery of radioactive oil&lt;ref name="craven"/&gt;{{rp|216}} reported to the Hawaii Institute of Geophysical Research at the time.

The premise of ''Red Star Rogue'' is that a fail-safe device designed to be activated in the event of an unauthorised fire command of its nuclear missiles caused 2 catastrophic explosions (monitored by U.S. technology at the time) resulting in sinking the submarine. The 11 extra crewmen have never been satisfactorily identified, and K-129's crew manifest was listed as missing by Russian authorities. An ID photograph of a sailor found in the wreck has never been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Red Star Rogue|last=Sewell|first=Kenneth|year=2005|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|pages= |isbn=0-7432-6112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Star Rogue'' claims the changing relations with China and Russia in the early 1970s, forged by Nixon and Kissinger, were enabled by the K-129 incident.

Craven suggests that Project Azorian's real goal was not the nuclear weapons or the coding systems at all; rather, the project sought to determine exactly what ''K-129'' was doing at '''40N/180W''' "where she did not belong". Such information could be (and supposedly was) utilized within [[Henry Kissinger]]'s foreign policy of "[[Deterrence Through Uncertainty]]", in order to "raise an unanswerable question in [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s mind about his command and control of his armed forces".&lt;ref name="craven" /&gt;{{rp|221}}

===Mutual agreement: some connection between ''K-129'' and the loss of USS ''Scorpion''===
Retired United States Navy Captain [[Peter Huchthausen]], former naval attaché in Moscow, had a brief conversation in 1987 with Soviet admirals concerning ''K-129''. Huchthausen states that Admiral Peter Navojtsev told him, "Captain, you are very young and inexperienced, but you will learn that there were some matters that both nations have agreed to not discuss, and one of these is the reasons we lost K-129."&lt;ref name="offley" /&gt;

In 1995, when Huchthausen began work on a book about the Soviet underwater fleet, he interviewed Admiral Victor Dygalo, who stated that the true history of ''K-129'' has not been revealed because of the informal agreement between the two countries' senior naval commands. The purpose of that secrecy, he alleged, is to stop any further research into the losses of USS ''Scorpion'' and ''K-129''. Huchthausen states that Dygalo told him to "overlook this matter, and hope that the time will come when the truth will be told to the families of the victims."

==Gates' visit to Moscow==
In October 1992, [[Robert Gates]], as the [[Director of Central Intelligence]], visited Moscow to meet with President [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia. He said: 

{{quote|As a gesture of intent, a symbol of a new era, I carried with me the [[List of USSR navy flags|Soviet naval flag]] that had shrouded the coffins of the half dozen Soviet sailors whose remains the [[Glomar Explorer]] had recovered when it raised part of a Soviet ballistic missile submarine from deep in the Pacific Ocean in the mid-1970s, I also was taking to Yeltsin a videotape of their burial at sea, complete with prayers for the dead and the [[Soviet national anthem]]&amp;nbsp;– a dignified and respectful service even at the height of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Gates1996"&gt;
{{cite book

|first=Robert
|year=1996
|publisher=Touchstone
|pages=553–54
|isbn=0-684-81081-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gates's decision to bring the videotape of the funeral held for the men on the Golf was ultimately motivated by the fact that the United States wanted to inspire Russia to offer up information on [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|missing American servicemen in Vietnam]]. Before that, "We had never confirmed anything to the Russians except in various vague senses," he said in an interview. 

{{quote|Shortly after [[Fall of the USSR|the USSR collapsed]], the [[George H.W. Bush|Bush]] administration had told the Russians through an intermediary that we couldn't tell them any more about what had happened on Golf/''Glomar''. But then when we started asking the Russians about what had happened to U.S. pilots shot down over Vietnam, and if any U.S. POWs had been transferred to Russia and held there, they came back and said, "What about our guys in the submarine?" At the time, the administration told the Russians only that there were no survivors and that there were only scattered remains.}}

A subsequent FOIA search to find if any POWs were released as a result of this visit produced only negative results.&lt;ref name="Sontag1998"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Huchthausen: 

{{quote |American officers have refuted the Russian charge made early on that American nuclear attack submarine U.S.S. ''Swordfish'' was the U.S. submarine involved&amp;nbsp;– a charge based solely on the latter's reported arrival in the Ship Repair Facility, Yokosuka, Japan, on 17 March 1968, with a badly damaged sail. Retired U.S. Navy Admiral [[William D. Smith]] informed Dygalo by letter following a 31 August 1994, meeting of a Joint U.S./Russia Commission examining questions of Cold War and previous war missing, that the allegation of Swordfish's involvement was not correct and that ''Swordfish'' was nowhere near the Golf on 8 March 1968. The joint commission, headed by General Volkogonov and Ambassador Toon, informed the Russians that no U.S. submarines on 8 March 1968, had been within {{convert|300|nmi|km|-1}} of the site where the K-129 was found.&lt;ref name="Huchthausen"&gt;

Her cousin, Sari Padorr also collaborated on her book.

== Personal life ==
In May 2013, Stephanie Arnold suffered  a rare and often fatal, a condition called. an amniotic fluid embolism after giving birth to her second child and she died on the operating table.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afesupport.org/stephanie-arnold-director/|title=AFE Foundation website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold later covered this, along with the events before and after her clinical death in her 2015 book.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Arnold is married to PhD economist (University of Chicago) Jonathan Arnold, with whom she has three children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chicagoecon.com|title=Chicago Econ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After graduation, Arnold worked for Higher Authority Productions in Miami, producing Jewish educational documentaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then formed her own production company called Fisch Food Productions, Inc., where she held many roles including an executive producer for 14 years. Along with Fisch Food, she co-founded Busby, an  invitation-only social network, where entertainment and media professional showcase, connect, and flourish. Throughout her career Stephanie produced television programs and music videos with the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker &amp; Chris Noth (New York Magazine Award Show), Marc Anthony (Puerto Rican Day Parade) and Julio Iglesias (Baila Morena). In 1995, Arnold was nominated for a [[Lo Nuestro Awards|Premio Lo Nuestro]] for her direction in [[Olga Tañón|Olga Tañón’s]] ''[[Tu Amor o Tu Desprecio|Tu Amor]]'' video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyemmys.org/nominations/44th%20Annual%20New%20York%20Emmy%20Awards.pdf|title=Emmy Award Nominations|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her work with music, she also served as a board member on the Florida chapter of the Grammys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/pdfs/musicares/mc_csr_donor_pages.pdf|title=Grammy Musicares|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold produced other reality television programs including ''Elite Model’s Look of the Year''. She co-created and executive produced a show called ''Latin Access''''',''' the first nationally syndicated entertainment magazine television program focusing on Hispanic content in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/nbc-to-bow-latin-access-1117799474/|title=Variety|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired on the NBC owned and operated stations, along with many affiliates throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/latin-spin-access/97003|title=Latin spin for Access|last=|first=|date=|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her career, she also served as Vice President of Development for the Production Company responsible for Surreal Life, Mindless Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.51minds.com/|title=51 Minds|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Mindless, she was Senior Vice President of Development for Galan Entertainment, a Latin media company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://galanent.com|title=Galan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the fall of 2003 Arnold was hired by the production company [[Endemol]] to launch their US Hispanic division.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During her time there, she ran the show and executive produced ''[[Vas o No Vas (U.S. game show)|Vas or No Vas]]'' for Telemundo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Today, Stephanie Arnold currently serves on the board of directors for the AFE Foundation, and was named one of Today’s Chicago Woman’s 100 Women of Inspiration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paramounteventschicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/TCWJuly14_100WOMEN.pdf|title=100 Women of Inspiration|last=|first=|date=|website=Today's Chicago Women|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks on patient advocacy to organizations like The American Society of Anesthesiologist and featured in their campaign "When Seconds Count".  She talks to clinicians and students at the Association of Women's Health Obstetrics and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN). She has worked with University of Chicago (Divinity and Medical School), groups at the Department of Defense, Chicago Ideas Week, and has raised money for Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Prentice Women's Hospital. She was also the focus of the Mothers of May campaign for LifeSource Blood Donation Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifesource.org/37seconds/|title=37 seconds|last=|first=|date=|website=LifeSource|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

37 Seconds is Stephanie Arnold's first book. It is a book about survival, premonitions, intuition, the past, the present, and the future. A true-life story of survival and how dying revealed Heaven's help. The book has won several awards including The Reader's Favorite Gold Medal and became a National Bestseller.

'''''The Peaceful Pill Handbook''''' is a book setting out information on [[assisted suicide]] and [[voluntary euthanasia]]. It was originally published in the U.S. in 2006 and was written by the Australian doctors [[Philip Nitschke]] and [[Fiona Stewart (author)|Fiona Stewart]]. In 2008 the on-line handbook was launched. Called ''The Peaceful Pill eHandbook'', it contains video clips on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia methods and related issues, but does not provide "how-to" instructions. The eHandbook is updated six times a year. A [[German language|German]] edition of the print book — ''Die Friedliche Pille'' —  was published in 2011. A [[French language|French]] edition — ''La Pilule Paisible'' —  was published in June 2015.

==Content==
The book is primarily intended for [[old age#senior citizen|senior]]s, people who are seriously ill and their families and friends. It is also a resource guide for those working in public health and aged care.  The book rates over 15 approaches to euthanasia according to reliability and peacefulness scales.

Strategies covered by the books include: the use of gases (such as [[nitrogen]]), [[poison]]s such as [[carbon monoxide]], non-prescription drugs such as [[chloroquine]], prescription drugs such as [[insulin]] and the [[opiate]]s and former [[prescription drug]]s such as the [[barbiturate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=Marc|title=In Tijuana, a Market for Death in a Bottle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/world/americas/21tijuana.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=January 14, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details lawful means of obtaining and administering the drugs and other peripheral issues such as drug storage, [[shelf life]] and disposal.  The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] assisted suicide services are also covered in detail, as are issues such as the writing of [[will and testament|will]]s, [[advance health care directive|advance directives]] and issues of determining testamentary and decision making capacity.

One of the more controversial aspects of the book is its coverage of the Internet as a source of drugs. To this end, the authors publish a regular [[neighborhood watch|neighbourhood watch]] that warns about internet [[confidence trick|scammers]] and fake and fraudulent [[website]]s.

==Reception==
Although restricted in New Zealand and Australia, the book is available without restriction on [[Amazon.com]], Amazon.co.uk and from the Peacefulpillstore.com website.

===Australia===
While the book was initially granted an 18+ rating in [[Australia]], this was overturned on appeal from the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Australian Attorney-General]]. In early 2007 the publication was refused classification (RC) by the [[Australian Classification Board|Classification Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200702/s1856344.htm |title=Classification board defends euthanasia book ban. 25 February 2007.

===New Zealand===
In 2008, the [[Society for Promotion of Community Standards]] objected to the book’s publication. This led to its temporary banning in New Zealand on the grounds that it was an objectionable publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censorship.govt.nz/news-archive-current-peacefulpill.html Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification]&amp;nbsp;– "The Peaceful Pill Handbook banned"&lt;/ref&gt;  A short time later the book was republished in redacted form and is available if sealed and an indication of the censorship classification is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/world/ban-on-euthanasia-book-lifted-in-nz-20080511-2cxv.html |title=Ban on euthanasia book lifted in NZ |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2010-06-14 |date=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censorship.govt.nz/pdfword/peaceful%20pill%20s38.pdf Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alanna Spence - queen bee (by).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Worker policing is found in [[honey bee]]s and other [[hymenoptera]]ns including some species of [[bumblebee]]s, [[ants]] and [[wasps]].]]

'''Worker policing''' is a behavior seen in colonies of social [[hymenoptera]]ns ([[ants]], [[bees]], and [[wasps]]) whereby [[worker (bee)|worker females]] eat or remove eggs that have been laid by other workers rather than those laid by a queen.  Worker policing ensures that the offspring of the queen will predominate in the group. In certain species of bees, ants and wasps, workers or the queen may also act aggressively towards fertile workers. Worker policing has been suggested as a form of [[coercion]] to promote the evolution of [[altruism in animals|altruistic]] behavior in [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratnieks |first=Francis L.

Not all forms of policing require the presence of a queen; it also occurs in a few species of ants which establish a [[dominance hierarchy]] of reproductive female workers, where top-ranking individuals reproduce.&lt;ref name=Selfishpolicing &gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroeymeyt|first=Nathalie |author2=Elisabeth Brunner |author3=Jürgen Heinze|title="Selfish worker policing" controls reproduction in a ''Temnothorax'' ant|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=July 2007|volume=61|issue=9|pages=1449–1457|doi=10.1007/s00265-007-0377-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-007-0377-3?LI=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary basis==
{{See also|Haplodiploidy}}

[[File:Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png|thumb|upright|The [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] sex determination system has consequences for worker policing behavior]]
In many [[Eusociality|social insect]] communities, sex is determined through [[haplodiploidy]]. [[Haploid]] male [[Drone (bee)|drone]]s develop from unfertilized eggs while [[diploid]] females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate with one or several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, it is in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee/&gt;

By contrast, the worker shares half of her genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a conflict where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its [[reproductive fitness]].&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratnieks|first=Francis L.W.|author2=P. Kirk Visscher |title=Worker policing in the honeybee|journal=Nature|date=December 1989|volume=342|issue=6251|pages=796–797|doi=10.1038/342796a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v342/n6251/abs/342796a0.html|bibcode=1989Natur.342..796R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.

Worker policing occurs when worker bees in the colony are genetically more [[Coefficient of relationship|closely related]] to the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.&lt;ref name=Resistance&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Adam G. Hart |author3=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=When Resistance Is Useless: Policing and the Evolution of Reproductive Acquiescence in Insect Societies|journal=The American Naturalist|date=December 2004|volume=164|issue=6|pages=E154-E167|doi=10.1086/425223|jstor=10.1086/425223|publisher=The University of Chicago Press for The American Society of Naturalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments confirming the role of [[kin selection]] in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp ''[[Dolichovespula saxonica]]'' mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L.W. Ratnieks |title=Social insects: Facultative worker policing in a wasp|journal=Nature|date=October 2000|volume=407|issue=6805|pages=692–693|doi=10.1038/35037665|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6805/full/407692a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early theories of worker policing focused on the kin selection component, evidence from [[Apis mellifera|honey bees]] suggests that [[altruism]] is sometimes enforced. Fewer workers reproduce as policing effectiveness rises, and policing effectiveness decreases with increasing relatedness except in colonies with no queen.  This suggests that worker policing is a social sanction imposed on [[Gene-centered view of evolution#Selfish-gene theory|selfish individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Enforced altruism in insect societies|journal=Nature|date=November 2006|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=50|doi=10.1038/444050a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444050a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms for kin recognition==

[[File:Fusca feeding.jpg|thumb|''[[Formica fusca]]'' ants can recognize nest-mates]]

Mechanisms suggested for egg discrimination in worker policing include queen hydrocarbons, fertile worker hydrocarbons, and nestmate recognition.

===Queen hydrocarbons===

A study on the [[carpenter ant]] ''Camponotus floridanus'' found a special surface [[hydrocarbon]] on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups that did not have queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.&lt;ref name=Queen.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Fertile worker hydrocarbons===

The study of cuticle hydrocarbons has also been applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant ''[[Platythyrea punctata]]'', the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior from the rest of the colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.&lt;ref name=Worker.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Nestmate recognition===

In contrast to the other ant species, worker policing in the ant ''[[Formica fusca]]''  appears to incorporate nestmate recognition in addition to the queen hydrocarbons. Workers displayed higher levels of aggression toward non-nest mates and also removed some queen-laid eggs. Thus, queen hydrocarbons were not the only contributor to discrimination of the eggs.&lt;ref name=Nestmate.Recognition/&gt;

==Examples from social Hymenoptera==
Worker policing has [[Convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] in several social insect species. The following cases are examples:

=== Bees ===
[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker honeycomb 3.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Apis mellifera]]'' workers remove worker-laid eggs by eating them (oophagy)]]

One of the first examples of worker policing to be discovered was in the honey bee, ''[[Apis mellifera]]''. Worker policing is prevalent in most honey bee colonies, and worker reproduction is minimal (0.12%) in this species.&lt;ref name=Quant.Study.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Visscher|first=P. Kirk|title=A quantitative study of worker reproduction in honey bee colonies|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1989|volume=25|issue=4|pages=247–254|jstor=4600337|doi=10.1007/bf00300050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worker policing occurs via egg-eating ([[oophagy]]) in ''Apis mellifera'' colonies.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt; In many of these hives, the activation of ovaries in fertile females is diminished, suggesting that there are disincentives to laying eggs.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt;

Workers in colonies of the Asian honey bee, ''[[Apis florea]]'', are also reported to engage in oophagy. Using [[microsatellite]] analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.&lt;ref name=wp_a.florea&gt;{{cite journal| last=Halling| first=Luke A|author2=Benjamin P. Oldroyd |author3=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author4=Andrew B. Barron |author5=Piyamas Nanork |author6=Siriwat Wongsiri |title=Worker policing in the bee ''Apis florea''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=49| issue=6| pages=509–513| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100325| doi=10.1007/s002650100325|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A higher percentage of female workers of the bee species ''[[Apis cerana]]'' are reported to activate their ovaries than those of ''Apis mellifera'' or ''Apis florea''. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana&gt;{{cite journal| last=Oldroyd| first=Benjamin P.|author2=Luke A. Halling |author3=Gregory Good |author4=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author5=Andrew B. Barron |author6=Piyamas Nanork |author7=Siriwat Wongsiri |author8=Francis L. Ratnieks | title=Worker policing and worker reproduction in ''Apis cerana''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=50| issue=4| pages=371–377| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100376|doi=10.1007/s002650100376| publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observation that all these [[Apis (genus)|Apis]] species engage in [[polyandry]] has led researchers to conclude that worker policing is [[plesiomorphic]] for the Apis genus.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana/&gt;

Worker policing also occurs in the primitively eusocial [[bumblebee]]s such as ''[[Bombus terrestris]]''.&lt;ref name=Zanette&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zanette |first1=L. R. |last2=Miller |first2=S. D. |last3=Faria |first3=C. M.|last4=Almond |first4=E. J. |last5=Huggins |first5=T. J.|last6=Jordan |first6=W. C. |last7=Bourke |first7=A.

{{further information|Gamergate}}

In colonies of the ponerine ant, ''Pachycondyla inversa,'' workers eat the eggs of fertile female workers, known as [[gamergate]]s, and display aggressive behavior towards egg-laying females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=D'Ettorre| first=Patrizia|author2=Jürgen Heinze |author3=Francis L W Ratnieks | title=Worker policing by egg eating in the ponerine ant ''Pachycondyla inversa''| journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=July 2004| volume=271| issue=1546| pages=1427–1434| doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2742| pmc=1691738| pmid=15306343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonies of the ant ''Gnamptogenys menadensis'', workers will sometimes mate and lay eggs while others remain as virgins to lay [[trophic egg]]s to be used as food. In a display of policing, workers can immobilize female reproductive workers by biting their limbs; it is reported that 50% of the victims die from this treatment. The attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside the colony. Since workers can lay both male and female eggs, worker policing could be favored as the cost to the community is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobin| first=Bruno |author2=J.

The ant species ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' also display evidence of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that did or did not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iwanishi |first=Satoru |author2=Eisuke Hasegawab |author3=Kyohsuke Ohkawaraa| title=Worker oviposition and policing behaviour in the myrmicine ant ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' Forel| journal=Animal Behaviour |date=September 2003| volume=66| issue=3| pages=513–519| doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2222 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203922226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the queenless ant ''Streblognathus peetersi'', policing helps to select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered fertility, enabling high-ranking workers to take over as new gamergates.&lt;ref name="GadauFewell2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadau |first1=Jürgen |last2=Fewell |first2=Jennifer |last3=Wilson |first3=Edward O. |authorlink3=Edward O.

In the ponerine ant ''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'', worker policing prevents the number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many of them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a [[pheromone]] detected by [[olfaction]]. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liebig |first1=J&amp;uuml;rgen |last2=Peeters |first2=Christian |last3=H&amp;ouml;llldobler |first3=Bert |title=Worker policing limits the number of reproductives in a ponerine ant |journal=Proc.

=== Wasps ===
[[File:GemeineWespe2.jpg|thumb|''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' workers can display aggression towards other fertile workers]]
The tree wasp ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' also displays worker policing. Both egg-eating and aggression are reported in these wasp communities, and the queen also engages in the policing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom |author2=A.

In colonies of the paper wasp, ''[[Polistes chinensis|Polistes chinensis antennalis]]'', workers can lay up to a quarter of the male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal compared to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in [[Monogyny|monogynous]] and monandrous colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saigo| first=T.|author2=K. Tsuchida | title=Queen and worker policing in monogynous and monandrous colonies of a primitively eusocial wasp|date=December 2004| volume=271| pages=S509–S512| pmc=1810092| pmid=15801618| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0238| journal=Proc Biol Sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common wasp, ''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'', engages in worker policing, and it is known that a significant number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Convergent evolution of worker policing by egg eating in the honeybee and common wasp|journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=January 2001|volume=268|issue=1463|pages=169–74|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1346|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1463/169.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a test of worker policing, researchers examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in ''[[Vespula rufa]]'', a wasp that has low paternity. Under the testing conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, and some of the drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom|author2=N. S. Badcock |author3=K. Erven |author4=A. Tofilski |author5=F. S. Nascimento |author6=A. G. Hart |author7=T. A. Burke |author8=M. E. Archer |author9=F. L W.

The [[European Hornet]], ''Vespa crabro'', was previously thought to be under reproductive pheromone control by the queen, thus explaining why the other females didn't reproduce, even though they were capable of doing so.  Experiments by Foster showed that the workers were instead regulating sterility in each other, thus instead exhibiting worker policing.  While each worker is capable of reproducing, the colony as a whole is more efficient and organized if the workers allow only the queen to lay larvae.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Foster, K.R., Gulliver, J., Ratnieks, F.L.W.| title=Worker policing in the European hornet Vespa crabro| journal=Insectes Sociaux| year=2002 |  volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=41–44 | doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8277-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Synoeca cyanea]]'' also engage in worker policing during times when queen repopulation is not needed. They will prevent females from laying eggs through aggressive behavior and egg-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Morphological and Physiological Caste Differences in Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptero, Vespidae, Epiponini) According to the Ontogenetic Development of the Colonies|last = Noda|first = Silvia Cristina Mari|date = 2003|journal = Sociobiology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions ==

===Anarchic syndrome===

Very rarely, female worker bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, in a process known as the anarchic syndrome. Female reproductive workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even in the presence of a queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they [[mimicry|mimic]] queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.&lt;ref name=Anarchic.Syndrome /&gt;

===Selfish worker policing===

''[[Temnothorax unifasciatus]]'', a [[Myrmicinae|myrmicinid]] ant, has been shown not to have collective worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]]. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.&lt;ref name=Selfishpolicing /&gt;

This type of policy is common in [[Dolichovespula norwegica]] wasps where despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Co-occurrence of three types of egg policing in the Norwegian wasp Dolichovespsula wasp|last = Bonckaert|first = W.|date = 2001|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/s00265-010-1064-3|pmid = |last2 = Tofilski|first2 = A.|last3 = Nascimento|first3 = F.S.|last4 = Billen|first4 = J.|last5 = Ratnieks|first5 = F.L.W.|last6 = Wenseleers|first6 = T. |volume=65 |pages=633–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worker policing without genetic conflict===

In the [[Thelytoky|thelytokous]] ant ''Platythyrea punctata'', colonies are [[cloning|clonal]]; therefore, workers are all equally related genetically, and worker policing is not expected as there is no genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Anne|author2=J. Wantia |author3=J. A. Torres |author4=J. Heinze | title=Worker policing without genetic conflicts in a clonal ant| journal=PNAS|date=October 2003| volume=100| issue=22| pages=12836–12840| doi=10.1073/pnas.2132993100| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/12836.abstract | pmid=14557542 | pmc=240705}}&lt;/ref&gt;
