'''Amelita Baltar''' (September 24, 1940) is an Argentine singer, one of the leading voices of [[tango]], that appeared in the 60's to be considered, along with [[Susana Rinaldi]], as a modern counterpart of older divas such as [[Libertad Lamarque]] and [[Tita Merello]]. She is mostly known for her collaboration with composer [[Astor Piazzolla]] and writer [[Horacio Ferrer]], specially as first performer of their song “Balada para un loco”. She starred in places such as [[Olympia (Paris)]], [[De Kleine Komedie]] (Amsterdam), [[Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall]] (Istanbul, Turkey), Cocoanut Grove at [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)]] or [[Ginásio do Maracanãzinho]] (Rio de Janeiro) and shared the stage with celebrities such as [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Franck Pourcel]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Gary Burton]] and [[Chick Corea]].
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com.uy/divertite/musica/amelita-baltar-noche-show.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Unlike most tango artists she was born in the upper-class neighbourhood of [[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires]] and was raised at the countryside in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province]].

She studied to become a school teacher and started her musical career as a singer of Argentine folk music with the band “Sombras”.

===The Piazzolla years===
Piazzolla discovered her by chance and offered her to star in his opera [[María de Buenos Aires]].

He also started to write along with Ferrer songs for her to sing, among which “Balada para un loco” is the most famous one. Its first performance at [[Estadio Luna Park]] in 1969 aroused a scandal reminiscent of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s “[[The rite of spring]]” riot in 1913. Immediately released as a single by [[CBS Records International]], it sold 200.000 copies in just a few weeks, thing that could only be achieved at the time in Argentina by foreigner stars such as [[The Beatles]] or local pop singers such as [[Palito Ortega]] and [[Sandro de América]].
International success followed with performances all around the world, including a half-Italian version which was broadcast on [[RAI]] TV.

Back in Argentina, she performed “El gordo triste”, Piazzolla and Ferrer's tribute to [[Aníbal Troilo]], in the presence of the honoree.

===After Piazzolla===
After the split with Piazzolla in 1975 she started singing traditional tangos such as “El día que me quieras”, “Volver” and “Soledad” by [[Carlos Gardel]], “Uno”and “Grisel” by [[Mariano Mores]], “Cambalache” and “Yira yira” by [[Enrique Santos Discépolo]] or “La última copa” by [[Francisco Canaro]].

But, just as Piazzolla kept performing the Ferrer songs with Italian singer [[Milva]], so did Amelita, and in 2002 she returned to the Estadio Luna Park to perform again “Balada para un loco”, this time for international ballet star [[Julio Bocca]] to dance to.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/455877-gran-actuacion-de-bocca&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
In 2010 she appeared in the “Buenos Aires by night: The ultimate electronic tango voyage” DVD with the song “Frío Intenso”.

In 2012 she released the CD “El nuevo rumbo” featuring the famous rock singers [[Fito Páez]], [[Pedro Aznar]], Fernando Ruiz Díaz from [[Catupecu Machu]] and specially [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] in one of his last recordings before passing away.

In her CD “Amelita Baltar canta Vinicius y Piazzolla – Bossa &amp; Tango” released in July 2015 beside the Piazzolla classics she performs [[Bossa nova]] songs by their friend [[Vinicius de Moraes]].

A symphonic tribute to Horacio Ferrer recorded at the [[Solís Theatre]] (Montevideo) in June 2015 is due to be released.

'''Aqil Agha al-Hasi''' ({{lang-ar|عقيل آغا الحاسي}}, given name also spelled ''Aqil'', ''Aqila'', ''Akil'' or ''Akili''; military title sometimes spelled ''Aga'') (died 1870) was the strongman of northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the mid-19th century, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. He was originally a commander of [[Arab]] [[irregular military|irregular soldiers]], known as the Hawwara tribe, in the service of the Ottoman governors of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. His influence in the [[Galilee]] grew as he strengthened his alliances with the powerful [[Beni Sakhr]] and [[Anizzah]] tribes of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], and recruited unemployed [[Bedouin]] irregulars from [[Egypt]] into his own band of irregulars, who thenceforth became known as the Hanadi tribe. He was known by his men and Western travelers to be courageous, cunning and charismatic, all qualities that contributed to his rise as the ''de facto'' ruler of Galilee.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"&gt;Van Der Steen, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=d-_OBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146&amp;dq=Akila+Agha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MNahVdK-KYHWeom7kzA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akila%20Agha&amp;f=false Case Study 1: Akila Agha]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his rule, Aqil remained at least nominally in service to the Ottoman Empire, which paid him for protecting the roads of northern Palestine from Bedouin [[Raid (military)|raid]]s and for maintaining the security of this region. He also exacted his own tolls on the local population in return for ensuring their security. His friendly ties with the European governments were partially due to his protection of the local [[Palestinian Christian|Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish communities in Galilee, including his protection of [[Nazareth]] from the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict|1860 massacres]] that occurred in [[Ottoman Syria]]. Aqil's relationship with the authorities was generally tense and he rebelled directly or indirectly against their local representatives. As a consequence of this frayed relationship, Aqil's employment would frequently be terminated when his activities or influence perturbed the authorities and then reinstated when his services were needed. By the time of his death, his influence had declined significantly. He was buried in his Galilee stronghold of [[I'billin]].

While Palestine had been under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the early 16th century, direct imperial administrative rule was challenged by a series of tribal leaders who exhibited vast influence over local affairs between the 17th and 19th centuries. With the Ottoman Empire embroiled in the [[Crimean War]], the power vacuum created in the area in the wake of [[Zahir al-Umar]]'s rule in the Galilee (1730–1775), [[Jazzar Pasha|Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar]]'s rule (1776–1804), and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s rule (1831–1840), was filled by Aqil.&lt;ref name=Scholchp459&gt;Schölch, 1984, pp. 459–462.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqil's demise represented the end of the last local obstacle to Ottoman centralization in Palestine.

==Early life and family==
Besides anecdotes provided in the writings of European consuls, most of the information on Aqil's life indirectly traces back to a history of the man written by Mikha'il Qa'war, a [[Nazareth]] clergyman.&lt;ref name=Scholchp462/&gt; Aqil was born into a [[Bedouin]] family,&lt;ref name=Scholchp199&gt;Schölch, 1993, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; known later as the Hanadi tribe. The actual Hanadi were an unrelated tribe that came to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from [[Ottoman Egypt|Egypt]] during Egyptian rule in Palestine (1831–1840) and around 1840 joined Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen, who also had migrated from Egypt.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; The name "Hanadi" translates in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as "[[Indian people|Indian]]s" and the Hanadi irregulars were referred to as such by the inhabitants of Palestine because of their dark skin.&lt;ref name="Finn414"&gt;Finn 1878, [https://archive.org/stream/stirringtimesor01finngoog#page/n488/mode/1up p. 414].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen in [[Galilee]] were not related to the well-known Hawwara tribe of [[Upper Egypt]], who were noted for their "bravery, horsemanship, and equipments" according to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].&lt;ref name="PEF222"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/222/mode/1up 222]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawwara of Galilee were actually from the Ainawiyeh tribe of the [[Lower Egypt]]ian desert region who had entered the service of [[Jazzar Pasha|Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar]] while the latter was based in Egypt in the late 18th century. They came with al-Jazzar to northern Palestine when al-Jazzar became the powerful [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]-based [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] governor of [[Sidon Eyalet|Sidon]] after the death of the [[Arab]] strongman of Galilee, [[Zahir al-Umar]], in 1776. Al-Jazzar honored the Ainawiyeh tribesmen by giving them the name "Hawwara" to associate them with the famed Hawwara of Upper Egypt.&lt;ref name="PEF222"/&gt;

Aqil's father, [[Musa Agha al-Hasi]], himself a commander of Hawwara irregulars in the service of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in 1814.&lt;ref name=Scholchp462&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholchp199/&gt; He was not directly related to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige.&lt;ref name="PEF222"/&gt; Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of [[Cyrenaica]] (modern-day eastern [[Libya]]).&lt;ref name="Abujaber35"&gt;Abujaber, 1989, p. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=bqmiVa6fHILveaqam0A&amp;id=cTMfAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Aqila+Agha+1867&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Aqila 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[James Finn]], the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of [[Algeria]]n or [[North African]] origin.&lt;ref name="Finn414"/&gt; Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area.&lt;ref name="Abujaber35"/&gt; According to historian [[Adel Manna]], Aqil was born in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Mattar347"&gt;Mattar, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA347 347].&lt;/ref&gt; Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih.&lt;ref name="PEF223"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/222/mode/1up 222]-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Musa died in Gaza in 1830.&lt;ref name=Scholchp462/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholchp199/&gt;

Aqil's power base consisted of his tribesmen and alliances with other Bedouin tribes, who inhabited both sides of the [[Jordan River]]. Aqil's brother, Salih Agha, held substantial influence in the [[Haifa]] region. Mary Rogers, the sister of the English [[vice consul]], described in detail a banquet in [[Shefa-'Amr]] and a gazelle hunt at the invitation of Salih Agha,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 1865, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KG09qepFmJAC&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.196] ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schölch, 1993, p. 201, note 576&lt;/ref&gt; while another traveler witnessed the lavish wedding between a son of Salih Agha and a daughter of Aqil Agha on "the plains of [[I'billin]]", in circa 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, 1858, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uU5FAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA317#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.317] ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqil married off another of his daughters to a Bedouin [[sheikh]] (chieftain) in Gaza, paying the highest [[dowry]] registered at the time in Gaza: 11,000 [[piaster]]s.&lt;ref name=Scholchp206&gt;Schölch, 1993, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of [[Hebron]] was reported to be a brother-in-law of Aqil.&lt;ref&gt;Saulcy, de 1872, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/voyageenterresa03saulgoog#page/n176/mode/1up p.159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sch1993p201/&gt;

==Strongman of Galilee==

===Consolidation of influence===
Like his father before him, Aqil served various masters, among whom was [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt.&lt;ref name=Scholchp462/&gt; Aqil defected from Ibrahim Pasha's army&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; and joined local rebels in the [[peasants' revolt in Palestine|1834 peasants' revolt]] against Egyptian conscription and disarmament measures, leading his Hawwara irregulars in the Galilee.&lt;ref name="Mattar347"/&gt; At some point during the revolt, Aqil helped save the mostly [[Druze]] village of [[Isfiya]] from being destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's troops after its inhabitants paid Aqil for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Trisdam, 1865, p. [https://archive.org/stream/landisraelajour01trisgoog#page/n160/mode/1up 112].&lt;/ref&gt; As the revolt was suppressed, Aqil and his men left Palestine for [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], where they sought the protection of that region's major Bedouin tribes.&lt;ref name="Mattar347"/&gt; During his time in Transjordan he strengthened relations with these tribes.&lt;ref name="Manna199"&gt;Manna, ed. Mattar, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Aqila+Agha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EtahVeXAEIHqefnSs_gF&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aqila%20Agha&amp;f=false 199].&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ottomans regained control of Palestine in 1840–1841, Aqil returned to the [[Lower Galilee]] and was commissioned as a [[captain (armed forces)|captain]] of ten mounted irregulars.&lt;ref name="PEF287"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/287/mode/1up 287]&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited Egyptian irregulars from the Hanadi tribe and others who were left unemployed following the Egyptian withdrawal. Together with Aqil's Hawwara, they became a formidable local force.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; In 1843, Aqil became the chief of irregulars, known as ''[[bashi-bazouk]]'', in northern Palestine,&lt;ref name=Scholchp462&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; and his command was expanded to fifty horsemen.&lt;ref name="PEF287"/&gt; Aqil's irregulars became known in the area as the Hanadi, although the group's tribal composition was mixed.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;

Aqil angered the ''[[kaimakam]]'' (district governor) of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], Muhammad Kubrisi, for his intervention in a dispute between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PEF287"/&gt; One of the leaders of the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of [[sedition]]. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the [[Beni Sakhr]] tribe.&lt;ref name="PEF287"/&gt;

Aqil secured a durable alliance with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas on both sides of the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's ''kaimakam'' in 1847.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil.&lt;ref name="PEF287"/&gt; He was also given command of 75 ''bashi-bazouk'' in Lower Galilee.&lt;ref name=Scholchp463&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security.&lt;ref name="Mattar347"/&gt; In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial ''[[mutasallim]]'' (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the [[Jezreel Valley]], [[Safad]], [[Tiberias]] and Nazareth.&lt;ref name="Manna199"/&gt; The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (''khuwwa'') to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a [[protection racket]].&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;

===Encounter with William F. Lynch===
[[File:William Francis Lynch wmm.jpg|thumb|right|[[William F. Lynch]] ]]

In 1848, Aqil assisted an expedition headed by [[US Navy]] captain [[William Francis Lynch]] to the [[Dead Sea]], and became known in the [[United States]] and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length in the works of Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the ''[[divan]]'' of [[Said Bey]], the Ottoman ''kaimakam'' of Acre, and is recorded as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth [[pelisse]] richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the [[tarboosh]] upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon the opposite side of the divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the [[hilt]] of his [[yataghan]]. He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.'&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 1849,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/narrativeunited03lyncgoog#page/n157/mode/1up 127]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnp415&gt;Finn 1878, [https://archive.org/stream/stirringtimesor01finngoog#page/n489/mode/1up p.415].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this meeting, Said Bey had attempted to dissuade Lynch of his plans to travel to the Dead Sea, with Aqil remarking that the Bedouin of the Ghor (Jordan Valley) would "eat them up". Lynch's reply was that "they would find us difficult of digestion," but he suggested that as Aqil seemed to hold influence with these tribes, he would be prepared to pay him to make the trip a more peaceable one.&lt;ref name=Finnp416/&gt;

After the meeting ended, Lynch pursued Aqil to speak with him alone. He showed him his sword and revolver, which Aqil examined and declared to be the "Devil's invention". Lynch described the weaponry at the disposal of his men and asked Aqil if he thought it sufficient to make the journey to the Jordan, and Aqil replied that, "You will, if anyone can." Lynch later secured Aqil's accompaniment on the trip to the Dead Sea, through the intervention of an ex-[[Sharif of Mecca]], describing the latter as "our counsellor, sagacious and prudent," and Aqil as, "the bold warrior and the admirable scout."&lt;ref name=Finnp416&gt;Finn 1878, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/stirringtimesor01finngoog#page/n490/mode/1up 416]–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 1850, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LRgPAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Akil&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=Akil&amp;f=false p.130]&lt;/ref&gt; Aqil and his Beni Sakhr allies quashed a party of '[[Adwan]] Bedouin tribesmen when they attempted to rob Lynch's party. Lynch's record of Aqil's feat made him well known in Europe.&lt;ref name="PEF287"/&gt;

===Hauran rebellion, imprisonment and escape===
Aqil's irregulars attracted the membership of local individuals and small clans. Along with his alliance with the two powerful tribes of the region, the Beni Sakhr and the [[Anizzah]], Aqil's autonomy in the Galilee was further strengthened, although he was nominally subordinate to the Ottoman authorities. He based himself in the [[al-Zayadina|Zaydani]] fortress of [[I'billin]], a mixed Muslim-Christian village between Acre and Nazareth that was previously fortified by the family of Zahir al-Umar.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholchp463/&gt; By 1852, Aqil ceased residing in I'billin, preferring the traditional Bedouin lifestyle, dwelling in encampments and among his livestock. At this point, he ruled the area between Shefa-'Amr to [[Baysan]]. He and his Hanadi tribesmen characteristically dressed in brown-striped robes.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;

In 1852, he was commissioned by the Ottoman authorities to prevent the spread of a Druze rebellion from [[Hauran]] to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PEF288"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/288/mode/1up 288].&lt;/ref&gt; Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt;

Despite his successes during the Druze revolt, the authorities, with whom he always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his strength and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; He was sent to [[Istanbul]] by sea and from there he was sent to serve a prison sentence at the [[Vidin|Widin]] fortress on the [[Danube River]]. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an [[Albania]]n inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached [[Salonica]]. From there, Aqil departed to [[Anatolia]] and then [[Aleppo]]. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt;

===Reinstatement and Battle of Hattin===
[[File:Hittin.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Horns of Hattin]] where Aqil and his men decisively defeated a Kurdish force seeking to oust him from [[Galilee]] in 1857]]

At the time of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the [[Crimean War]] with the [[Russian Empire]], which left a domestic security void in its provinces due to the large number of provincial troops deployed to [[Crimea]]. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt; On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the [[Ottoman Army]] in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from [[Al Karak|Karak]].&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;

In Aqil's absence, a garrison of Kurdish irregulars based in Damascus had been left in charge of security in the Galilee.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt; They were commanded by [[Shamdin Agha]],&lt;ref name="Yarmouk"&gt;{{Citation|author=|title=The Third International Conference on Bilad Al-Sham: History of Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvMtAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Aqil+Agha&amp;dq=Aqil+Agha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b8-hVaeWDIvhggT-lIGYDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw|volume=19–20|publisher=University of Jordan, Yarmouk University|year=1984|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAP"&gt;{{Citation|author=|title=Asian and African Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=cNGhVfXgJcXKetjvrpAB&amp;id=sHZtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Shamdin+Agha+Aqil&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=150|volume=19–20|publisher=Jerusalem Academic Press|year=1985|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their employment was terminated by Aqil in 1855.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt; Meanwhile, scores of Bedouin tribesmen from [[Faiyum]] with kinship ties to Aqil's tribal irregulars had migrated to the [[Levant]] as a result of their suppression by [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]] of Egypt. Aqil welcomed their membership into his tribal band and their numbers subsequently swelled. He consecrated his relationship with the new arrivals by marrying a daughter of one of their ''sheikhs''.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt; In May 1856, he defeated the Abd al-Hadi clan of [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]] in a major clash that ended encroachments by the Abd al-Hadis on Aqil's territory.&lt;ref name="Scholch466"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, the Beirut-based governor of [[Sidon Eyalet]] agreed to Shamdin's request to eliminate Aqil, who, to the consternation of the Ottoman authorities, was ruling the Galilee autonomously by that time. Shamdin, who sought vengeance against Aqil for terminating his service in Galilee, had complained to the Sidon governor that Aqil was committing treachery by collaborating with the Bedouin tribes against Ottoman authority. The Ottomans, whose dependence on Aqil had decreased with the end of the Crimean War in 1856, found in Shamdin's request a convenient way to end Aqil's growing autonomy.&lt;ref name="PEF288"/&gt; When Aqil visited [[Beirut]] to pay his respects to the governor of Sidon, he traveled with "the air of a sultan", according to the American missionary [[Henry Harris Jessup|Henry H. Jessup]], bringing with him a large and heavily armed Bedouin entourage.&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, 1910, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/fiftythreeyears00unkngoog#page/n333/mode/1up 273]–274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamdin's forces, amounting to 600–700 Kurdish irregulars, massed in Tiberias.&lt;ref name="PEF289"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/289/mode/1up 289].&lt;/ref&gt; They were commanded by Shamdin's sons Muhammad Sa'id and Hasan Agha.&lt;ref name="Scholch466"/&gt; Curious at this deployment, Aqil had requested an explanation from the ''kaimakam'' of Acre, but received no response. Thus Aqil concluded that the deployment was part of a conspiracy to upend his rule. In response, Aqil assembled his entire force of irregulars, amounting to some 300–400 men, and marched towards Shamdin's troops. Other Arab tribes volunteered their service, but Aqil declined their participation.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt;

On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the [[Horns of Hattin]],&lt;ref name="Yarmouk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAP"/&gt; near the village of [[Hittin|Hattin]]. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern weaponry at the Ottoman military's disposal.&lt;ref name="Scholch470"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt; As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.&lt;ref name="Yarmouk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAP"/&gt;

Aqil's victory entrenched his rule over Galilee and afterward he established stronger relations with the Europeans.&lt;ref name="Yarmouk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAP"/&gt; After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations with a [[grain of salt]].&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt; In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not to intervene and put a stop to tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley.&lt;ref name="Scholch469"/&gt;

===1860 events and protection of Christians===
[[File:Nazareth the holy land 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of [[Nazareth]], 1842. Aqil was honored by various European governments for protecting the Christians of Nazareth from the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict|1860 massacres]] ]]

Aqil had been previously courted by European powers to secure protection for their Christian and Jewish protégés.&lt;ref&gt;Finn 1878, [https://archive.org/stream/stirringtimesor01finngoog#page/n495/mode/1up p. 421].)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war]], anti-Christian animosity spread to [[Damascus]] where Christians were massacred by Druze and Muslim mobs. It appeared that the violence would spread to Acre as well, but Aqil issued direct orders to Acre's Muslim residents not to bring harm to the city's Christians, stating he would "chastise&amp;nbsp;... with his sword" anyone who violated the orders.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt; Aqil also protected the Christian community of Nazareth from harm as their coreligionists elsewhere in Ottoman Syria faced massacres. Part of this protection included warnings to local Bedouin tribes to refrain from assaulting the town and warnings to its Christian and Muslim residents to prepare themselves militarily in case of attack. Aqil maintained a close friendship with Tannous Qawwar, a prominent [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox]] resident of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rukHhGrQfHkC&amp;pg=PA262 262]&lt;/ref&gt;

In gratitude for protecting the [[Christians]] in Nazareth and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Napoleon III]] of [[France]] presented Aqil a gun and the [[Legion of Honor]] medal in April 1861 aboard his French vessel docked at [[Haifa Bay]].&lt;ref name="Scholch468"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] (later King of the [[United Kingdom]]) personally visited Aqil two years later to show his appreciation.&lt;ref name="Manna199"/&gt; Aqil offered Edward four [[Arabian horse]]s, but Edward politely declined. As a token of his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt;

His protection of the local Christians and his reputed Algerian origins drew comparisons with [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abd al-Qader al-Jaza'iri]], the exiled Algerian rebel who saved many Christians from harm during the 1860 riots in Damascus,&lt;ref name="Scholch468"/&gt; and with whom Aqil developed ties.&lt;ref name="Scholch471"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqil realized that European protection would strengthen his position towards the Ottoman rulers. After 1860, he courted the French, once sending a tiger as a present to "his Emperor" through the French consul in Beirut.&lt;ref name=Sch1993p201/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1861, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA444#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.444]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Finn, Aqil was under special "French consideration".&lt;ref name=Sch1993p201&gt;Schölch, 1993, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finn 1878, [https://archive.org/stream/stirringtimesor01finngoog#page/n499/mode/1up p. 425]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of influence===
The Ottoman [[Sublime Porte|imperial government]] adopted its [[Tanzimat]] modernization reforms in 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing the new law of the land in northern Palestine. Part of these measures were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders to prevent them from setting up camps in the cultivated lands of Galilee and forbade the collection of ''khuwwa'' tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed that as part of his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt;

Aqil's closeness with the Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His relations with the ''kaimakam'' of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the ''kaimakam'' on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local [[fellahin|peasantry]]. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name="Scholch469"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanzimat proved unpopular with large segments of the population and a Bedouin revolt broke out,&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside in the summer of 1863.&lt;ref name="Scholch469"/&gt; Aqil was unable to stop the raids,&lt;ref name="Scholch469"/&gt; and may have played a role in the revolt.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would back down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.&lt;ref name="Scholch470"/&gt;

After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for [[Tell el-Hesi]] in the region of Gaza.&lt;ref name="PEF289"/&gt; Around this time, Aqil married off a daughter of his to the leading Bedouin ''sheikh'' of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi.&lt;ref name="PEF290"&gt;Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/291/mode/1up 291]&lt;/ref&gt; Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt;

Kapuli Pasha's successor, Kurshid Pasha, resumed the anti-Bedouin operations in Galilee in 1864 and sought to establish in the eastern Galilee four heavily armed forts as a bulwark against further raiding.&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt; Aqil entered into a conflict with the governor of [[Nablus]] and member of the Abd al-Hadi family, who tried to arrest Aqil.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; Kurshid Pasha dismissed Aqil by the end of the year. Fearing his arrest or death in light of the Ottomans' subsequent deployment of 200 Kurdish irregulars to Tiberias and the presence of military forces from Acre and Beirut in western Galilee,&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt; Aqil fled to [[Salt]] in the [[Balqa]] area of Transjordan.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt;

Aqil later moved to Egypt. Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri and [[Isma'il Pasha]] lobbied the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman government]] on Aqil's behalf and he was given permission to return to Galilee in 1866.&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt; He subsequently inhabited the area of [[Mount Tabor]].&lt;ref name="PEF290"/&gt; Despite his return and the reinstatement of a government salary, he was not able to restore his semi-autonomous authority in the region. In late 1869 he was awarded a medal of honor from the [[Habsburg dynasty]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Ibillin daher wall.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the [[Al-Zayadina|Zaydani]] fortress in [[I'billin]]. Aqil temporarily lived in I'billin, and the village served as his rural headquarters. He was buried there in 1870.]]

Aqil died in 1870, although his death was erroneously recorded by [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]] to have occurred in 1867.&lt;ref name="Scholch471"/&gt; According to Macalister, Aqil died in the vicinity of Shefa-'Amr.&lt;ref name="PEF290"/&gt; He was buried in I'billin, his previous Galilee headquarters.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; As of the early 1980s, descendants of Aqil still inhabited I'billin.&lt;ref name="Scholch464"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqil's son Quwaytin succeeded him as the chief of the Hanadi tribesmen who continued to inhabit the Galilee and its vicinity.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; In the late 19th century, Quwaytin's tribe had some 900 members and was based in the northern Jordan Valley. Quwaytin donned the honor cross medallions given to his father by various European governments.&lt;ref&gt;Shumacher, 1889, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e47VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Akileh+Agha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-dihVaTtM8XReI6RndAO&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akileh%20Agha&amp;f=false 86].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hanadi influence and strength in the region diminished under Quwaytin and was gradually suppressed by various Ottoman actors, eventually reducing the Hanadi to an ineffectual tribe.&lt;ref name="DerSteen"/&gt; Quwaytin's son and successor Rida also entered into Ottoman service and held the title of ''[[agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'' like Aqil.&lt;ref name=Abujaber36&gt;Abujaber, 1989, p. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=bqmiVa6fHILveaqam0A&amp;id=cTMfAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Aqila+Agha+1867&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Aqila 36]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, Rida Agha held the equivalent rank of a [[lieutenant]] and served as commander of police in the [[Balqa|Balqa Sanjak]] in Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;Abujaber, 1989, p. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=bqmiVa6fHILveaqam0A&amp;id=cTMfAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Aqila+Agha+1867&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Quwaytin 268].&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly two decades Aqil had been a major local power in northern Palestine.&lt;ref name="Scholch207-08"&gt;Schölch, 1993, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted to other tribal ''sheikhs'' that the land they roamed in belonged to the [[Arab]]s and that one day they would take it back from the Turkish Ottoman "conquerors".&lt;ref name="Scholch465"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Finn, Aqil may have ultimately envisioned forming an Arab confederation in the southern [[Levant]] independent of the Ottomans and backed by [[France]].&lt;ref name="Scholch465"/&gt; However, despite these perceived intentions, Aqil ruled under the auspices of the Ottoman authorities, was paid by them, and was at least partially dependent upon their support. His ties with France and Europe contributed to his power,&lt;ref name="Scholch465"/&gt; but he lacked the necessary support from these countries to pursue any desire of independence that he had.&lt;ref&gt;Schölch, 1984, pp. 472–473.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqil's death marked the removal of "the last obstacle to the implementation of full centralized Ottoman rule" in northern Palestine, according to historian Mahmoud Yazbak.&lt;ref&gt;Yazbak, 1998, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPseCvbPsKsC&amp;pg=PA3 3]&lt;/ref&gt; When full Ottoman centralization in the Galilee was realized, local powers permanently lost their influence over the region's development.&lt;ref name="Scholch207-08"/&gt; That power was instead passed on to wealthy businessmen from [[Haifa]] and [[Beirut]], ultimately leaving the [[Sursock family]] of Beirut as the new "masters" of the Galilee, according to anthropologist Alexander Schölch.&lt;ref name="Scholch207-08"/&gt;

One of the factors Schölch attributes to Aqil's failure to secure an autonomous rule similar to that of the Arab ''sheikh'' Zahir al-Umar was Aqil's refusal to accept a [[Sedentism|sedentary life]].&lt;ref name="Scholch472"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; While I'billin frequently functioned as a headquarters of sorts for Aqil, he did not take up permanent residence there, or anywhere. Instead it served as a symbol of his authority in the Galilee.&lt;ref name=Scholchp463/&gt; Aqil was adamantly a Bedouin and once remarked to William Lynch that it would be a "disgrace" to "till the ground like a ''[[fellah]]''".&lt;ref name="Scholch464"/&gt; The nomadic, marauding lifestyle of Aqil ran counter to the modernization efforts of the Ottomans, which strongly encouraged settlement of the land and [[Centralisation|centralization]]. These processes were eventually embraced by the peasantry and the urban notables, but resisted by the Bedouin tribes whose traditional livelihoods were at risk.&lt;ref name="Scholch472"/&gt;

Schölch asserts that Aqil contributed little to the socio-economic development of Palestine, and was not a "benefactor of the peasants".&lt;ref name="Scholch473"&gt;Schölch, 1984, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aqil is described in a mostly positive light by modern-day sources and in local tradition.&lt;ref name="Scholch473"/&gt; In the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] political atmosphere that followed the Ottoman Empire's fall in 1917, Aqil's Arab identity and his struggles against the Ottomans contributed to the prevailing positive commemoration of his life. Palestinian Christians in particular remember him fondly for protecting Christians during his rule.&lt;ref name="Scholch473"/&gt;

==Life==

On August 29, 1964 Merhi was ordained priest and became Chaplain of the [[Congregation of the Lebanese Maronite Missionaries|MLM]]. His appointment as first bishop of the [[Maronite Catholic Eparchy of San Charbel in Buenos Aires]] took place on 5 October 1990. [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Maronite Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir]] consecrated him bishop on 2 December 1990. His co-consecrators were Bishop [[Georges Abi-Saber]], [[Lebanese Maronite Order|OLM]], from Canada and [[Roland Aboujaoudé]], [[auxiliary bishop]] of Antioch. Merhi was installed as eparchy on 17 March 1991. As a participant in the Special Assembly of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]] for the [[Middle East]], in October 2010, he stressed the need for peace between Christians and Muslims, because, as he pointed out, they are all children of [[Abraham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://storico.radiovaticana.org/en1/storico/2010-10/430030_intervention_of_mons_charbel_georges_merhi_bishop_of_san_charbel_en_buenos_aires_of_the_maronites_argentina.html storico.radiovaticana.org]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Wesley Powell''' (May 5, 1854 – August 18, 1927) was an American hobbyist turned horticulturist specializing in the study of orchids ([[Orchidaceae]]).&lt;ref name=employee&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Charles W.|title=United States, Panama Canal Sailing lists, 1905-1937|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1961-40627-11784-79?cc=2193241|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with providing scientists the first large-scale collection of orchid specimens found in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Eunice|title=Orchids and orchidology in Central America|journal=Panama Canal Review|date=1974|issue=Special Edition|page=20|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00097366/00172/19j|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lank14&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogarín, Serracín, Samudio, Rincón, Pupulin|title=An updated checklist of the Orchidaceae of Panama|journal=Lankesteriana|date=December 2014|volume=14|issue=3|pages=135–364|url=http://www.epidendra.org/LITERATURE/Bogarin%20et%20al%202014%20Checklist%20Panama/Bogarin%20et%20al.%202014%20A%20Checklist%20Orchids%20of%20Panama%20High.pdf|accessdate=January 5, 2015|doi=10.15517/lank.v14i3.17958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, he became internationally famous for his new discoveries and valuable contributions to orchidology by gathering, ''rediscovering'', cultivating, preserving, documenting, and submitting-for-study a diverse assortment of hundreds of distinct specimens: yielding many new to science [[species]].&lt;ref name=union&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heald|first1=Jean|title=Panama, The home of the orchid|journal=Bulletin of the Pan American Union|date=January 1927|volume=61|pages=671–678|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletinofpaname6127pana|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell's specimen records (also known as herbarium specimens) and his Panama garden were studied by researchers at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens]], the Berlin Botanical Garden, the Orchid Herbarium of Oakes Ames at Harvard University, the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution, and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] (MBG). Dozens of orchid species were named in his honor.&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; In 1922, German botanist Rudolf Schlechter published his 95-page ''Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses'' (Panama orchid collections by C. Powell): principally on the basis of
Powell's efforts.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlechter|first1=Rudolf|title=Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses|date=1922|publisher=Verlag des Repertoriums|location=Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell's work remains relevant not only because his records document valuable scientific data, but they continue to provide material for study &amp;ndash; many of his digitized herbarium specimens are freely available online via [[Virtual herbarium|virtual herbaria]].

In 1926, Powell donated his world-class orchid garden (orchidarium) to the renowned MBG of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name=lank&gt;{{cite journal|title=Orchids and orchidology in Central America|journal=Lankesteriana|date=August 2009|volume=9|issue=1-2|pages=358–378|url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/00/09/87/23/00023/00008-2009.pdf|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=expert&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=C.

For the MBG, a snowball effect occurred in the tropics; orchid collecting began there in earnest and over the next 13 years, orchids from its Tropical Station would appreciably augment the collection of the parent garden in St. Louis. "Today, the Missouri Botanical Garden’s orchid collection represents one of the largest and finest in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchids|url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/our-garden/notable-plant-collections/orchids.aspx|website=Missouri Botanical Garden.org|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Charles Lesslie Pullen July 1854.1.jpg|thumb|Ben K. Pullen, 1854]]
Known to orchid enthusiasts as C. W. Powell, he was born '''Charles Lesslie Pullen''' in Richmond, Virginia, to Benjamin King Pullen Sr. and Minerva "Minnie" Anner ([[née]] Smith) Pullen.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pullin|first1=Chas. L.|title=Virginia, Births and Christenings, 1853-1917|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X5KP-S2V|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first-born of eight children. In a letter to Minnie dated July 29, 1854, from Richmond, Ben Pullen writes about his son: {{cquote|Darling little Lesslie [as called in childhood; as spelled by father]  I am so glad he is well and cries for his pa. Bless his pure little heart. '[[Hush, Little Baby|Hush my baby]] don't you cry Your papa will come by ner bye.'  I would walk a mile to see him this minute. Mrs Anderson + Letitia Rowe were in the store yesterday. They send &lt;u&gt;a heap&lt;/u&gt; of love to you + Lesslie. [...] Affectionately Ben K. Pullen}}

In 1860, 6 year old Lesslie and his family moved, by train, {{convert|800|mile|km}} southwest to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for the opening of his father's china store. Shortly thereafter, Lesslie was uprooted again when his family relocated {{convert|50|mile|km}} south for several years. There they struggled to survive on a cousin’s farm near [[Sardis, Mississippi]], during the [[Union Army]]'s occupation of [[Battle of Memphis|Memphis]] in the [[American Civil War]] and Ben Pullen Sr.'s service as a [[Confederate Army]] officer.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pullen|first1=B K|title=United States Census, 1870|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MD8Q-Z42|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps this experience was Lesslie's introduction to [[agriculture]].

==Family life, bookkeeper, book-lover, genealogist==
;1870s
After the War, the Pullens moved back to Memphis. In 1871, hard times in the South forced Lesslie’s father to advertise his store's closing. By the mid-1870s, Ben Pullen Sr. was a bookkeeper for the State National Bank and Lesslie, now calling himself Charles, was a collector for the bank.

In 1877 he married Adelaide "Addie" Belle Prince (1858-1901), the daughter of a [[Mississippi]] antebellum cotton planter.&lt;ref name="Addie Belle Pullen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Addie Belle Pullen|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/103459437&amp;ref=acom|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the couple's first child, Charles Lesslie was born (living only a few months). Six more children would follow: Bessie, an unnamed infant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=infant Pullen|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Pullen&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=11738&amp;GRid=103459594&amp;|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David (died young),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hadden Pullen|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/103459757|website=findagrave|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelaide "Addie", Minerva "Minnie", and Margaret. Bessie was born in 1880, and the couple's latter three daughters were born in 1887, 1891, and 1898 respectively.

The [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|Yellow Fever]] Epidemic hit Memphis in 1878 claiming, among thousands, the life of Pullen’s mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keating|first1=John McLeod|title=A History of the Yellow Fever: The Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878, in Memphis|date=1879|publisher=Wrightson &amp; CO.|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=194, 240|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQMW-S0MRjkC&amp;q=pullen#v=snippet&amp;q=pullen&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;1880s
In the early 1880s, Pullen was appointed to serve Memphis in several leadership positions. Detail oriented, well-read, and popular, he served as Secretary of the Legislative Council of Memphis; Secretary of the Fire and Police Commissioners Board; and Clerk for the Supervisors of Public Works, earning $100 per month. Documenting the day-to-day business of a struggling city, he proved valuable to the citizens who put him in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pullen|first1=Chas L.|title=Digest of the Acts Repealing the Charters of Certain Municipal Corporations|date=1898|publisher=S.

Its artesian water supply was discovered and turned into one of the purest water supplies in the nation in the 1880s. Its charter was restored. Its sanitation and sewer systems became models for other cities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lollar|first1=Michael|title=Yellow fever left mark on Memphis|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/yellow-fever-left-mark-on-memphis|accessdate=September 14, 2014|publisher=The Commercial Appeal|date=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 he bought part-interest in a weekly paper ''The Sunday Times'' and was its business manager. He was not only a bookkeeper, but also a book-lover; Pullen collected rare books. His interests went beyond the literary world, however. He conducted exhaustive research on his Pullen and Smith [[genealogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pullen|first1=Charles L|title=Dedham Historical Register, Volume 2|date=1891|publisher=Dedham Historical Society|location=Dedham, MA|pages=40, 82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4slAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=chas+l+pullen+memphis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ns4EnpRD05&amp;sig=u88PZu5E_zqv_83WqpQBAcjTt5c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bm0QVOL4DYWHyAT4vIBo&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chas%20l%20pullen%20memphis&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relentless in his pursuit of ancestral names and important dates, he advertised for information throughout [[New England]].

==New life: country, name, career, passion==

===Also known as (aka) Charles Wesley Powell===
Some combination of events prompted a relatively unconnected Charles L. Pullen to move {{convert|1600|mile|km}} south to Panama. Exactly when and why he reinvented himself as Charles Wesley Powell is a mystery. In a 1928 biography of Powell, some elements of his pre-Panama days are not supported by facts: leading one to wonder why and by whom (probably Powell, for reasons best known by himself) the details of his life in the U. S. were altered.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; From 1907–1927 he would support himself by working in various positions in a Canal Zone dispensary (basic medical facility) or hospital. With a salary of $60 per month, he started out dispensing [[quinine]] (antimalarial drug) at a labor camp in old Gatun (now covered by 80 feet of rock and earth under Gatun Dam). It is not surprising he would be hired for a position in which precise record keeping was important. To better communicate with patients, he studied Spanish. Soon he was certified as a nurse.

;"Pescadore Grande"
"In 1908 Powell transferred to [[Portobelo, Colón|Porto Bello]] [on the Caribbean Sea] as a dispensary assistant and took up fishing as a hobby, using a row-boat. Early 1910 finds Powell working in a dispensary in [old] Gorgona (now submerged 80 feet below the surface of [[Gatun Lake]]) and fishing in Panama Bay. The local fishermen called him 'Pescadore Grande' (great fisherman). Switching his fishing from Panama Bay to Gatun Lake soon followed."&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

The immense [[Gatun Lake]], a part of the Panama Canal, was created when the [[U. S. Army Corps of Engineers]] dammed the [[Chagres River|Rio Chagres]] in the early 1900s. About 1912, Powell and his botanist friend [[Abel A.

'We were rewarded by a boat-load of the 'El Spirito Santo' or [[Peristeria elata|Holy Ghost Orchid]].' The orchids were brought back to Gorgona and disseminated over the Canal Zone, the United States, and Europe. Soon, the level of the Lake was encroaching on Gorgona, and necessitated a transferring of the workers to [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] [Pacific side]."&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=A.

===Powell's orchid garden takes root===
"I can remember my first orchid, I was just looking over the country one Sunday, about 18 months after I got down there when I saw it way up near the top of a tall tree. 'You're certainly a beauty,' I said. 'I must have you.' While I was standing there wondering how on earth to climb that tree a bare-footed Indian came along. 'I'll give you 25 cents gold to get that flower,' I said. The Indian used the vines to swing to the tree [like [[Tarzan]]] and cut off the orchid."&lt;ref name=man /&gt; "For about five years, I suppose, I would pull the orchids apart and study them, but never keep the plants."&lt;ref name=man /&gt; "He studied the orchid intelligently: learning, throughout the years about orchids from books, worldwide correspondence, and visitors."&lt;ref name=fish&gt;{{cite news|title=Fish are forgotten in quest for flowers|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/26508983/|accessdate=September 14, 2014|publisher=The Edwardsville Intelligencer|date=June 9, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the books he remarked: "I couldn't read a French or German newspaper, but with a little Latin I could make out the technical works."&lt;ref name=man /&gt; In February 1916, Powell was pondering his many memorable orchid-related experiences: echoing in his mind, no doubt, were those at Gatun Lake.

===Flower Power===
{{See also|Orchidelirium}}
References to the power and allure of the wild orchid are peppered throughout the world's cultural, historical, and contemporary beliefs. As far back as the fifth century BC, the Chinese philosopher Confucius used wild orchids as symbolism to deepen the meaning of his poems; "he compared the virtuous man to an orchid. Echoing this thought, Chinese artists sometimes placed orchids in their work to evoke the Confucian qualities of humility, integrity, refinement—in fact, all the virtues of a perfectly cultured gentleman and scholar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchid Culture Guide|url=http://www.orchidsusa.com/1Introduction.htm|website=Orchidsusa.com|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchids: A View From the East|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/orchids/|website=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancient Greeks associated it with virility, and the Aztecs were said to drink a mixture of the vanilla orchid and chocolate to give them power and strength."{{cn|date=August 2018}} To others, "orchids possess a sensual, quasi-mystical aura: thought of as sexual, wild, rare creatures."&lt;ref name=never /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Ardea|title=The Seductive Orchid|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/11228_Smith.pdf|website=pugetsound.edu|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1939 book ''The Orchid Hunters'', Norman MacDonald wrote: "For when a man falls in love with orchids, he'll do anything to possess the one he wants.

Specifically, the prevailing belief about orchids during Powell's lifetime was described thusly: "There is one plant, which stands so far above all the rest for unique beauty and grandeur that it is universally regarded as the aristocrat of the floral kingdom, namely, the orchid. The Central American orchids, above all others in North or South America, are regarded as furnishing the climax [occupying the highest point] and should be called the 'aristocrat of the aristocrats.'"&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=George, T.|title=Latin America and the queen of flowers|journal=Bulletin of the Pan American Union|date=August 1931|volume=12|pages=1–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUUzAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=powell+orchid+garden+balboa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZbtFVNroE5aqyATNk4KYDQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=powell%20orchid%20garden%20balboa&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powell the orchid hunter===
{{main|Orchid hunting}}
Falling under the wild orchid's powerful spell, Powell fit the profile of a classic [[orchid hunting|orchid hunter]] with one exception&amp;ndash;he was not interested in selling his treasures&amp;ndash;he wanted to collect them.&lt;ref name=Rolfe /&gt; Some biographical sources indicate Powell collected orchids beginning with his arrival in Panama in 1907; however, it seems more likely his collecting began after he settled in Balboa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JSTOR Global Plants: Powell, Charles W.|url=http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000036257|website=plants.JSTOR.org|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first he collected locally; ultimately, his objective was to "assemble a complete collection of Panama species."&lt;ref name=report /&gt; "Powell and Hunter went on collecting trips in the Chiriquí region in 1918, 1920, and 1922; Powell went there without Hunter in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolfe|first1=R.

One day about 6 years ago &amp;ndash; I was 66 then &amp;ndash; I saw a fine plant growing on a half-dead limb that grew out almost horizontally over one of those barrancas. 'I never saw you before,' I thought, and 'I won't let you get away, barranca or no barranca.'  My man shinned out a few feet (roughly a meter) on that dying branch and then scurried back, scared at the prospect of a 500-foot (150 m) fall. That made me mad. I threw off my hat, coat, and shoes and went after that orchid. Just as I reached out for it the branch cracked. My heart stopped. But I never let loose my grip on that plant and scurried back to earth like a scared chipmunk. And that&amp;mdash;that was the first time I ever saw the Odontoglossum Powellia.&lt;ref name=man /&gt;

[[George Harry Pring]] (see below) elaborated on collecting bucket orchids: "Removing a clump of these plants may be compared with disturbing a hornet's nest, but, according to Mr. Powell, who had experienced both adventures, the hornets are easier to combat than the thousands of small stinging ants."&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt; Pring then told of a fourth collection technique used by Powell and Hunter; one Pring himself used. "In many instances, to dislodge the epiphyte [an "air plant", ''growing non-parasitically'', sometimes 40–50 feet from the ground] without climbing the tree, it is necessary to cut a sapling with a forked-top as long as the distance up to where it clings. Its roots in some cases are three to four feet long, and great dexterity is required to dislodge it as to not cause injury. During this operation, clouds of dust, granulated bark and moss which rain down from above almost blind the collector."&lt;ref name=bull1927 /&gt; "These men got many fine specimens through this method."&lt;ref name=fish /&gt;

As his garden expanded over the next few years, Powell's orchid documentation and explorations took a new path. All the while working full-time in the dispensary, the care, documenting, and pursuit of his beloved orchids occupied most of his spare time&amp;mdash;quite an accomplishment. "Although 193 [now 215] of Powell’s [[Biological specimen|specimens]] were recorded without dates; the first dated records of collections began in 1915. In early 1918, realizing that many of his plants were not described in his books, he made contact with [[Robert Allen Rolfe|R. Allen Rolfe]] at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; A package "C. W. P." (Powell) sent Rolfe was acknowledged by the latter via ''The Orchid Review'' (May 1918): "The package duly arrived, but was badly broken and the contents missing. Perhaps further materials can be sent. In practice we find the most successful method is to press small specimens in a fold of blotting paper and enclose in an ordinary letter."&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolfe|first1=R.

;Herbarium specimen preparation
{{See also|Herbarium}}
Transitioning from hobbyist to horticulturist, Powell needed a way to forward his finds to researchers and preserve them for future reference. He studied the standardized method for [[Biological specimen|specimen]] preservation and storage. Specimens were dried by extracting moisture in a device called a plant press; however in one instance he noted: "Live flower mashed flat with finger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimerandra isthmi|url=http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/6043113|website=Harvard University Herbarium|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was initially cautioned against it, he added artificial heat (an electric light bulb or electric iron) which aided in the quality of the results in the tropics.&lt;ref name=report /&gt;&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden bulletin|url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753002461801/mobot31753002461801_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pring|first1=George H.|title=The Private Orchid Collection of Mr. C.

How is it for a Specimen?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specimen image|url=http://apps.kew.org/herbcat/getImage.do?imageBarcode=K000588943|website=Kew.org|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressed plant could then be affixed to a mounting sheet (11 X 17 inch paper). Label data (essential documentary information) was added. Once label data was added to the mounting sheet, it was ready for shipping. The mounting sheet (specimen) became a candidate for long-term storage in a repository (like the [[Harvard University Herbaria]]). Once accepted, the mounting sheet would then be known as a [[herbarium]] specimen. At first he sent just the preserved flowers, but soon he was asked to send preserved plants that included the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Powell painstakingly crafted his mounting sheets; he enhanced them with fieldnotes, illustrations, flower cutouts, and photographs. His original sheets would stand on their own as works of art; over time they have evolved into beautiful, remarkably detailed documents.

In July 1918, Powell began to send Rolfe a series of herbarium specimens.

His fellow researchers began to take notice. Powell was persistent, he infused enthusiasm in his dealings, and he instilled in his fellow researchers the confidence that&amp;mdash;he had something to offer in the confusing world of the [[Orchidaceae]]. "Mr. Powell's enthusiasm for these plants has caused him to be locally termed 'the Orchid Man' ('Parasita Grande'), and his garden is one of the show places in Balboa to both the botanist and tourist."&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killip|first1=Ellsworth P.|title=1922 travel diary|url=https://transcription.si.edu/view/7224/SIA-SIA2013-06126|website=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps while acting as tour guide, the idea sprouted&amp;mdash;to someday donate his garden; little did he know how much joy and peaceful beauty his expanding orchid collection would one day bring to visitors of a botanical garden {{convert|2300|mile|km}} away. The reputation of Powell's Horticultural Garden, Balboa, Canal Zone began to grow on a global scale.

;Powell and Schlechter
Beginning in 1919, thanks to a tip from a correspondent in [[Costa Rica]], German botanist, taxonomist, and author [[Rudolf Schlechter]] (curator of the herbarium at the Berlin Botanical Garden) began corresponding with and receiving numerous duplicate specimens (ones originally sent to Rolfe) from Powell. "Schlechter immediately recognized the importance of the plant collection, and encouraged Mr. Powell in every way to send in further specimens."&lt;ref name=CZreport /&gt; "Schlechter took up the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (classification) of Panamanian orchids in August, 1920."&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; "An astonishing number of plants proved to be entirely new to science (not less than 75)."&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;&lt;ref name=CZreport /&gt; Schlechter added: "Just as important as the new species is the rediscovery of a whole series of species, having originally been discovered by [[Józef Warszewicz|Warszewicz]], but never found again."&lt;ref name=sch /&gt; "Schlechter wrote to Powell: 'Your exploration of the orchid flora of Panama is one of the most important facts in orchidology during the later years.'"&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; Schlechter named dozens of species in Powell's honor (see Schlechter's author abbreviation, Schltr., in "Legacy" below). Waiting until after Rolfe's death (1921), in 1922, Schlechter published his 95-page ''Orchidaceae Powellianae Panamenses'' (collections by C. Powell) part of which transcribes as follows: "It is sure that no one has made such a contribution to our knowledge of these orchids as Mr. Powell through his 'exceedingly mighty collection,' which contains not only species with conspicuous flowers, but also those in which the size of the blooms scarcely exceeds that of a pin-head."&lt;ref name="sch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt; "We cannot thank Mr. Powell enough for this self-sacrificing research that he has undertaken in spite of his age. For the orchidology of Panama he has done more than any of his predecessors."&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt; Sadly, most of Schlechter's specimens were destroyed in 1943, during the bombing of Berlin, in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium|url=http://huh.harvard.edu/pages/oakes-ames-orchid-herbarium-ames|website=Harvard University Herbaria and Library|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ignatz Urban]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Powell, Oakes Ames, and Blanche Ames
In 1922, Powell began relations with Harvard University’s [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]], a botanist, and the most eminent American orchid authority at the time. Due to intense competition with Schlechter, "Ames went so far as to sign with Powell a formal contract in which the latter would collect orchids for him for U.S. $100 per month. From that point forward, Powell only sent Schlechter duplicate specimens. Ames, his wife [[Blanche Ames Ames|Blanche]], and daughter Pauline traveled to Central America in early 1923, partly to meet Powell and see his garden; after this visit, Ames received some of Powell’s specimens. Of these, 29 were new to science.&lt;ref name=lank14 /&gt; Based on an orchid from Powell's garden, Blanche, recognized as an outstanding botanical illustrator, enriched one of her husband's specimens by painting this captivating [http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/5843737 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;watercolor&lt;/span&gt;]. That same year, Ames praised the quality of Powell’s work: 'His indefatigable zeal is one of the joys in my contemplation of Central American orchidology. His specimens are often works of art.'"&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; Ames dedicated several orchid species to Powell and cited Powell's specimens throughout his ''Schedulae Orchidianae'' (1922-1930) publications. Today, the Economic Herbarium of Oakes Ames at Harvard University has a searchable specimen database which includes many of Powell's original works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Econonic Herbarium of Oakes Ames|url=http://huh.harvard.edu/pages/economic-herbarium-oakes-ames-econ|website=Harvard University Herbaria and Libraries|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Powell and Lankester
In September 1922, Powell sent a letter to Ames introducing "my good friend" [[:es:Charles H. Lankester]]. Lankester, a British coffee grower, naturalist, and orchidologist, was living in [[Cartago, Costa Rica]], a country with great potential for new to science orchid species. Powell facilitated what would become a "deep friendship between Lankester and Ames that lasted 25 years."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; Traveling to Costa Rica in 1925, Powell visited Lankester, who in turn traveled to Panama in 1927. "I have just spent a fortnight with my fellow sufferer from orchiditis, CWP, + it was a very delightful time of talk and talk and then talk."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; Lankester's orchid garden transformed over time into the [[Lankester Botanical Garden]]s. Located outside of Cartago, Costa Rica, the garden is now operated by the University of Costa Rica as a research center and is open to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lankester Botanical Garden]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1924 Annual Report to the Board of Regents of [[The Smithsonian Institution]], [[Paul Carpenter Standley|Paul C. Standley]] reported about Powell: "Years of experience, through which the best methods have been discovered, combined with the attention to details such as other collectors rarely attain, have enabled him to make specimens which are unsurpassed. Among the vines that cover the trellises in the Powell garden are various plants of Vanilla, of which there are two common species in Panama, V. ''planifolia'' with narrow leaves (see image above) and V. ''pompona'' with wide leaves."&lt;ref name=report /&gt;

;Powell and Pring
George H. Pring, a horticulturist at the MBG, made many trips to remote locations in Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Henry Pring|url=http://www.kewguild.org.uk/media/pdfs/v6s56p825-3.pdf|website=kewguild.org.uk|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1923 Pring visited the Panama Canal Zone, where he spent six months, weeks of which were at Powell's garden talking orchids from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m."&lt;ref name=man /&gt; "Powell, in turn, was overjoyed to entertain a man who knew orchids from the outside in."&lt;ref name=fish /&gt; Pring presented Powell with rare plants gathered in the [[Andes]] and Powell reciprocated with 300 plants from his garden for the MBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plant gift, by Powell of Balboa|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/1683012/|accessdate=October 15, 2014|publisher=The Neosho Daily News|date=March 25, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association would prove mutually beneficial; back at the MBG, "a great interest arose for Panama’s orchids."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; In 1926, Powell and Pring would be together again: this time in Missouri. "They appeared to take up the conversation where they left off three years ago. Long botanical names crackled in their dialogue."&lt;ref name=man /&gt;

===Donation===
[[File:Annualreportofbo1924smit 0461.jpg|thumb|7,000 plants-500 orchid species]]
Knowing the time would come when he could no longer care for the 7,000 plants (including cacti, palms, ferns, lilies, and roughly 500 orchid species) in his astonishing garden, "On March 1, 1926, Powell, Pring, and George Moore (Director of the MBG-aka Shaw's Garden) met in Panama and finalized the details of a great gift&amp;mdash;Powell generously presented the Missouri Botanical Garden with his world-wide-known collection of orchids."&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref name=bull1927&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thirty-Eighth report of the director|journal=Missouri Botanical Garden Bulletin|date=1927|volume=XV|issue=1|pages=5–6|url=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753003136998#page/n3/mode/2up|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CZreport /&gt; "For the benefit of orchid growers throughout the world," the MBG's 1926 bulletin gives an accounting of some the [https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753002461850#page/103/mode/2up &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;orchids gifted by Powell.&lt;/span&gt;] "At age 72, Powell had one of the greatest private orchid collections in the world; his donation made the Shaw's Garden orchid collection the finest in the world."&lt;ref name=man /&gt;&lt;ref name=bull1927 /&gt;

===Creation of Panama Extension Station===
"The MBG created a ‘tropical station’ at the foot of [[Ancon Hill]] (hill overlooking Panama City, Panama), on lands [{{convert|2.5|acre|ha}}] granted by the Canal Zone Government. Then Secretary of War and former Park Commissioner of St. Louis, Missouri, [[Dwight F. Davis]], approved the MBG's application for this land grant."&lt;ref name=fish /&gt; "Powell's collection became the [nucleus of the] Panama Extension Station of the MBG; he was appointed its first director and a residence was built for him on the grounds."&lt;ref name=CZreport /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Illustrated History of the Missouri Botanical Garden 1920s|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/archives/section.asp?section=34|website=Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Powell’s collection marked the beginning of the Garden’s reputation in orchid horticulture."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; "After Powell’s death there was a good deal of confusion regarding the care of the plants; they were neglected and many died. Pring and Hunter spent two months restocking the grounds. Hunter took over the direction of the Tropical Station and maintained this position until his own death in 1935. In 1939, the Tropical Station was transferred to the Canal Zone Government. During its almost 13 years of existence, the Tropical Station supplied the greenhouses in Saint Louis with a constant flow of living plants."&lt;ref name=lank /&gt; "Today, Ancon Hill is a popular jogging and hiking trek. All manner of vegetation and birds can be seen, including a large number of orchids (which are protected by [[CITES]])."

===Powell visits Missouri Botanical Garden===
On August 30, 1926, Powell travelled from Panama to the United States on the {{SS|Ancon|1901|2}}, a Panama Railway Company steamship and the first ship to officially transit the Panama Canal in 1914. "He met, sometimes for the first time, his 'Brothers in Science.' Visits to [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, DC|Washington]] preceded his arrival in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Everywhere he was greeted as an old friend by scientists and orchid enthusiasts. These knew him through a decade of learned correspondence and others had made pilgrimages to his famous garden for it is a mecca of the orchid world."&lt;ref name=man /&gt; After spending more than 10 years searching any possible habitat for orchids&amp;ndash;from the lakes at sea-level, to the hillsides, and up into the higher elevations of mountainous Panama&amp;ndash;he was lionized as "The Canal Zone's exotic plant specialist."

===Recognition and retirement===
Charles W. Powell was awarded the [[Roosevelt Medal]] with two service bars (second bar awarded on March 1, 1913) for continuous distinguished civilian work as an employee of the Isthmian Canal Commission (or the Panama Railroad Company). Of roughly 50,000 workers, only 1,661 medalists earned the second bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Canal Medal List|journal=Panama Canal Record|date=August 27, 1913|volume=VII|issue=35|page=332|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00097368/00007/356x?search=powell&amp;vo=11|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roosevelt Medal with Two Bars|url=http://www.coins-of-panama.com/canalmedals/cm10-2.html|website=Coins-of-Panama.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Desiderata'': "The answer was orchids"===
[[File:Sobralia decora - Flickr 003.jpg|thumb|right|Sobraila decora.

Life in early 1900s Panama presented a unique opportunity for Powell to find his passion in orchids. The labor requirement for the construction of the Panama Canal provided him with a livelihood; and an outing on the newly created Gatun Lake awakened a desire to "catch" orchids instead of fish.&lt;ref name=fish /&gt; Soon, he would become a man on a mission: a man with direction and purpose. Powell searched high and low for beautiful, diverse, rare and new-to-science orchids with great vigor. He risked life and limb to acquire his specimens. The worldwide correspondence, camaraderie, conversation and competition among like-minded orchid lovers suited his nature. Through his later life's love, Powell caught the world by surprise; he may have caught himself by surprise.  Charles Wesley Powell's donation was the manifestation of his calling to serve mankind by contributing to the greater common good: a permanent legacy of his work. As a late bloomer, he made his mark with orchids.

''Desiderata'' (Latin: "desired things"):
{{cquote|'''I wanted flowers. Naturally I wanted the best;'''

Peterson shuffled his cabinet on August 1, 1989 and Hošek was not included. Hošek did not receive funds from Starr but several key members of the Housing Ministry were implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cut for political reasons, dumped minister contends |first=Derek |last=Ferguson |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=August 6, 1989 |page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hošek had also made an unpopular decision to not reappoint former [[Mayor of Toronto|Toronto mayor]] [[John Sewell]] to the board of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority.&lt;ref name="maclaren"&gt;{{cite book |title=Invisible power: the women who run Canada |author=Sherrill MacLaren |date=1991 |publisher=Seal Books |location=Toronto, Ontario |pages=298–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudio Suarez Tayag''' (born 7 August 1956), more popularly known as '''Claude Tayag''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] artist, restaurateur and [[food writer]].  He is best known for depicting scenes of impressionistic landscapes and scenes of Philippine folk festivals and religious imagery in his art. In recent years, he has written and been involved with Philippine gastronomy both as renowned chef and as food writer with his weekly column, ''Turo-Turo'' (Filipino for pinpoint) on ''[[The Philippine Star]]''. A scion of the Tayag family of [[Pampanga]], he is the son of author and journalist, Renato D. Tayag.&lt;ref name="Claude Tayag: About Claude"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.claudetayag.net/About%20Claude%20Tayag.htm|title=Claude Tayag: About Claude|date=2013|work=Bale Dutung|access-date=26 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and career==
Tayag was born in [[Angeles City]] in the province of Pampanga on 7 August 1956 to Renato "Katoks" D. Tayag, a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]''; and Adoracion Suarez. Tayag married Mary Ann Quioc, a former flight attendant and trainer of [[Cathay Pacific]] and have a son Victor Nicolo.&lt;ref name="Claude Tayag: About Claude"/&gt;

Tayag graduated with a bachelors degree in economics at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], but also undertook several courses in architecture at the same time.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pilar |first=Santiago Albano |title=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art|place=Manila |publisher=Cultural Center of the Philippines |year=1994 |edition = First |isbn = 9789718546383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the circle of friends cultivated by his father, Tayag was surrounded by the noted personalities in the Philippine arts and letters including [[Emilio Aguilar Cruz]], [[Sofronio Mendoza]] (SYM), [[Romulo Galicano]], [[Adrian Cristobal Cruz]] and [[Ibarra dela Rosa]] who will later be collectively known as the Dimasalang Group. His encountering with Aguilar Cruz and others, spawned his oeuvre of painting in plein air leading to his first one-man exhibition at ABC Galleries in Manila in 1978 on his acrylic and watercolor landscapes.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

Consequently, in 1979, Tayag encountered the works of French-based Philippine painter [[Macario Vitalis]] while doing his travels on an eleven-month travel around Europe. Tayag and Vitalis became acquainted with each and whom he frequently visited in his residence in [[Plestin-les-Grèves]] in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gelvezon-Tequi |first=Ofelia |title=Vintage Vitalis: Paintings and Drawings (1930–1965)|place=Makati City |publisher=Alliance Française de Manille |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, his paintings revolved on themes ranging from the local festivals in particular the [[Moriones festival|Moriones]] and the [[Ati-atihan]], Philippine folk religious imagery (better known as [[Santo (art)|santos]]), landscapes of the [[Cordillera]] region and a travelogue of sceneries in Europe and Japan from 1979 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Paras-Perez |first=Rod. |title=The Moriones Unmasked|place=Mandaluyong |publisher=Galerie Domenique|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, Tayag delved towards woodwork and sculpture by forming sculptures delving in waves and abstractions by means of wood lamination. His sculptures and his wood furniture are mainly reminiscent of the works of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Alexander Calder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Wood: Sculptures and Furniture in Wood by Claude R. Tayag|place=Mandaluyong City |publisher=[[SM Megamall]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, after receiving a grant from the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP), Tayag made a large-scale black and white [[Ink wash painting|sumi]] painting known as ''Black Mountain'' which was later mounted in the lobby of the Little Theater of the CCP. The painting however was destroyed in a fire in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Claude Tayag: About Claude"/&gt;
 
Tayag has actively participated in several one-man and group exhibitions in the Philippines, China, the United States, and Spain, where he exhibited with both Filipino, Southeast Asian and Spanish artists.&lt;ref name="Claude Tayag: About Claude"/&gt;

In 2003, he held a three-man show with Ben Cabrera and Patis Tesoro in a museum in his hometown, Angeles City. Other Filipino artists who exhibited in group shows with him include [[Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi]], [[Phyllis Zaballero]], [[Soler Santos]], [[Abdulmari Imao]], and [[Sajid Imao]]. Tayag also participated in the 20th Asian International Art Exhibition at the [[Ayala Museum]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Claude Tayag: About Claude"/&gt;

In 2011, alongside with co-curator [[Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi]], Tayag curated the retrospective of the early works of French-based Philippine painter Vitalis at the Total Gallery space of the [[Alliance Française|Alliance Française de Manille]] in [[Makati City]] from 1 to 31 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/starweek-magazine/2011/02/27/660934/rediscovering-macario-vitalis-road-less-taken|title=Rediscovering Macario Vitalis the road less taken

The commanding officer of the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (USAF TPS) is known as its '''Commandant'''. The commandant manages the school which is a military unit that operates in a distinctly academic atmosphere.&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p14&gt;{{cite book |title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog |page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position is usually held by a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] selected by the [[Air Force Materiel Command]] (AFMC) commander although this authority may be delegated to the commander of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] (AFFTC).&lt;ref name=AFI99107_p7&gt;{{cite book |title = Air Force Instruction 99-107, Test Pilot School |page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commandant oversees all flying training, academic instruction, budgeting, and curriculum administration at the school.&lt;ref name=AFI99107_p8&gt;{{cite book |title = Air Force Instruction 99-107, Test Pilot School |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commandant also chairs a board of officers that selects the school's students. The selection board consists of flight test squadron commanders with a majority of the board members being TPS graduates.&lt;ref name=AFI99107_p11&gt;{{cite book |title = Air Force Instruction 99-107, Test Pilot School |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every three years, the commandant conducts a review of the school's curriculum with participation from flight test squadrons, the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|U.S. Naval TPS]], and operational squadrons.&lt;ref name=AFI99107_p8/&gt;

The school's mission is to produce experimental [[test pilot]]s, flight [[Test Engineer|test engineer]]s, and flight test [[Flight officer|navigators]] to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems.&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p9&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was established on September 9, 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] (AFB) in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=TPS_History&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School History | url = http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6586 | accessdate =2017-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231218/http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6586 |archivedate=2016-03-03 | publisher=United States Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951 to its present location at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=TPS_History/&gt; Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.&lt;ref name=EAFB&gt;{{cite web |title = Edwards Air Force Base |url = http://www.edwards.af.mil/ |publisher = United States Air Force |accessdate = 2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School expanded its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots.&lt;ref name=TPS50_p233&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond | page = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era were selected for the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the [[North American X-15|X-15]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], and [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] programs.&lt;ref name=FAP&gt;{{cite book | first = J | last = Young | title = Forging Aerospace Power for America | pages = 3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries.&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p19&gt;{{cite book |title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog |page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School]], the United Kingdom's [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] (ETPS), and France's [[École du personnel navigant d'essais et de réception]] (EPNER).&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p18&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog |page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3622">'''Dirty Dishes''' is a New York City-based American rock band founded by songwriter/singer/guitarist Jenny Tuite.  Dirty Dishes' style is described as heavy-laden hooks blasting headfirst into speaker-shredding fuzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/13/dirty-dishes-guilty|title=Grunge-poppers Dirty Dishes get dreamy on 'Guilty' -- exclusive|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sonically the band has been compared to Smashing Pumpkins, My Bloody Valentine, Radiohead, and Sonic Youth.

== History ==
On January 27, 2015, Dirty Dishes released their debut album “Guilty” on Exploding in Sound Records.  Recording for the album was split between Los Angeles, CA and Chelsea, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dirtydishes.bandcamp.com/|title=Dirty Dishes|date=27 January 2015|work=Dirty Dishes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The album was engineered by Chris Thompson and recorded in Thompson’s garage.&lt;ref name="bdcwire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcwire.com/list/from-los-angeles-with-love-catching-up-with-former-locals-dirty-dishes/|title=From Los Angeles With Love: Catching Up With Dirty Dishes - BDCwire|work=bdcwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The album was well-received and described as "enduring a waking dream — it’s both a harrowing and totally beautiful experience” by Stereogum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1727848/stream-dirty-dishes-guilty/mp3s/|title=Stream Dirty Dishes Guilty (Stereogum Premiere)|work=Stereogum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Dirty Dishes’ composition is refreshing and intense. Guilty is clearly the result of Tuite's significant growth as a songwriter, and is the kind of record that a band can build a following on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://funeralsounds.com/reviews/dirty-dishes-guilty-los-angeles-california/|title=Dirty Dishes - Guilty (Los Angeles, California) - Funeral Sounds|work=Funeral Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The album cover is a photo of a school that expelled Tuite.
 
On January 28, 2015 the band released the music video for “Thank You Come Again”  The video premiered on The A.V Club and was directed by Pat Bishop of the comedy group Women.  The video was inspired by Tuite's experience working at grocery store in Silverlake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/watch-dirty-dishes-wreak-havoc-doughnut-shop-214420|title=Watch Dirty Dishes wreak havoc on a doughnut shop|work=avclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2016 the band released the music video for "Guilty." The video premiered on Independent Music News, and was directed by [[The Current Sea]], the creative team of [[Sarah Zucker]] and [[Brian Griffith (director)|Brian Griffith]]. The video features an alien figurine taking a miniature fern out for a walk, eventually liberating the fern on a mountain overlooking Los Angeles, with psychedelic analog visuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://independentmusicnews.com/video-premiere-dirty-dishes-guilty/|title=Video Premiere / Dirty Dishes / Guilty|work=independentmusicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stereogum.com/1856190/dirty-dishes-guilty-video/video/|title=Dirty Dishes – "Guilty" Video|work=stereogum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''Eleanor Ambrose''' (1718–1816) was a celebrated beauty and Catholic heiress. Her father, Michael, was well-educated but disbarred from several professions by his religion. He became a [[brewer]] and made his fortune. He resided at Mount Ambrose, [[Swords, County Dublin]].

Eleanor was described as "beautiful, witty, intellectual and a fevent [[patriotism|patriot]]" who "managed to penetrate Dublin society, despite the fact that she was a Catholic. Indeed, she became a darling of the Viceregal Court, and during the Viceroyalty of [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], she and her sister Clara were the prominent socialites of the Castle set. Chesterfield was attracted to her, and she soon accompanied him to all official ceremonies. Influenced by her opinions, Chesterfield is reported to have told [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] that ''poverty not Popery was to be feared in Ireland'', he had found ''only one dangerous papist, the brightness of whose eyes and charms, and whose conversation were indeed dangerous'', and her name was Eleanor Ambrose".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/big-houses-of-ireland/kenure-house/roger-palmer/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eleanor ensured the relationship stayed [[platonic love|platonic]].

{{quote|"At one of the Castle balls, given on the anniversary of the battle of the Boyne, she appeared with an orange lily in her breast, upon which Chesterfield improvised the following lines:

:"''Say, lovely [[Tory (British political party)|tory]], where's the jest''
:''Of wearing orange on thy breast,''
:''When that same breast uncovered shows''
:''The whiteness of the rebel rose?''"&lt;ref name=libraryireland&gt;http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/MissAmbrose.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1752 she married Roger Palmer of Castle Lackin, [[County Mayo]] (created [[baronet]] 1777) and had issue. She died at her house on [[Henry Street, Dublin]], in 1816, "retaining to the last a vehement hatred of the wrongs under which her Catholic fellow-countrymen laboured."&lt;ref name=libraryireland/&gt;

A song written about her story by Aido Lawlor - from Rush North Co Dublin - was recorded by the singer Aoife Scott on her 2016 album Carry the Day.

{{expand language|topic=|langcode=fr|otherarticle=Affaire Estelle Mouzin|date=February 2018}}

The '''Estelle Mouzin affair''' is a French criminal case which began on 9 January 2003 with the disappearance of Estelle Mouzin in the city of [[Guermantes]] in [[France]]. Estelle Mouzin was a nine-year-old girl who was returning from school when she disappeared.

==Disappearance==
On Thursday 9 January 2003, Estelle Mouzin, a nine-year-old girl, disappeared on the way back from school in Guermantes. She was seen for the last time in front of a bakery, while she was coming back to her mother's home, Suzanne Mouzin, who was in the process of divorce with the girl's father, Eric Mouzin. Her mother reported the fact she was missing to the local police station shortly after 7 P.M.&lt;ref&gt;[[France Info]], 8 January 2013, [http://www.franceinfo.fr/politique/le-zoom-du-matin/la-disparition-d-estelle-mouzin-10-ans-apres-854393-2013-01-08 La disparition d'Estelle Mouzin, 10 ans après]&lt;/ref&gt; Her disappearance had a huge media coverage all over the country.

==Investigations==

===First suspect===
The first person to be suspected was serial killer [[Michel Fourniret]], who was arrested in June 2003 in [[Belgium]]. However, after consideration, the police discounted Fourniret because he had an alibi: a phonecall was made from his home at the time of Estelle Mouzin's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Figaro]], 6 January 2007, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20070106.WWW000000058_pas_de_lien_entre_fourniret_et_la_disparition_d_estelle_.html Pas de lien entre Fourniret et la disparition d'Estelle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120442/http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20070106.WWW000000058_pas_de_lien_entre_fourniret_et_la_disparition_d_estelle_.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks before Estelle's disappearance, a girl of the same age was almost kidnapped by a man in a white van, from which she was able to make a facial composite. When Fourniret was suspected, investigators showed his photo to the girl, and he says it wasn't him who tried to kidnap her. While taking the police to a place he buried one of his victims, Fourniret described the clothes his victim was wearing, and it was very close to those Estelle wore the day she disappeared.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Despite his alibi and the fact Fourniret denied any involvement in this case, the fact it could be Fourniret was taken into consideration when the police found a television recording and photos of the girl at the suspect's home and on his computer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Figaro]], 17 November 2006, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20061117.WWW000000293_disparition_destelle_mouzin_fourniret_de_nouveau_dans_la_ligne_de_mire.html Disparition d’Estelle Mouzin : l'hypothèse Fourniret relancée] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818181939/http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20061117.WWW000000293_disparition_destelle_mouzin_fourniret_de_nouveau_dans_la_ligne_de_mire.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde]], 17 November 2006, [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0%402-3224,36-835867%4051-916808,0.html Disparition d'Estelle Mouzin : la piste Fourniret ressurgit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[RTL (France)|RTL]], 20 November 2006, [http://www.rtl.fr/info/article.asp?dicid=492475 Affaire Estelle Mouzin, Michel Fourniret serait-il en cause ?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020045/http://www.rtl.fr/info/article.asp?dicid=492475 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis of the implication of Fourniret is abandoned in 2007, for lack of sufficient proofs, and the fact he has an alibi.

The inquiry, led by the commissioner Jean-Marc Bloch, employed unprecedented means in French history; more than 130 persons were interrogated by the police and all the houses of the city were seized.&lt;ref&gt;[[France 2]] (archived by the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|Ina]]), 16 June 2005, [http://www.ina.fr/video/2857019001019/audition-affaire-estelle-mouzin-video.html Audition affaire Estelle Mouzin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, a march is organised in memory of Estelle Mouzin.&lt;ref&gt;[[France 2]] (archived by the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|Ina]]), 6 January 2007, [http://www.ina.fr/video/3254884001008/le-quatrieme-anniversaire-de-la-disparition-d-estelle-mouzin-video.html Le quatrième anniversaire de la disparition d'Estelle Mouzin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 investigations===

[[File:Estelle_Mouzin_Brie.JPG|thumb|[[Brie-Comte-Robert]], 1st février 2008, a lot of medias covered the investigation.]]Several arrests took place on Thursday 31 January 2008 in the cities of [[Brie-Comte-Robert]] and [[Lognes]] ([[Seine-et-Marne]]). A search was conducted at the Royal Wok restaurant in Brie-Comte-Robert, where it was suspected human remains were used.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes, 31 January 2008, [http://www.20minutes.fr/france/209968-20080131-disparition-estelle-mouzin-interpellations-restaurant-seine-et-marne Disparition d'Estelle Mouzin: interpellations dans un restaurant en Seine-et-Marne]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, this track proved to be unsuccessful; only the remains of an animal were found in the place.

'''Franco-Columbians''' ({{lang-fr|Franco-Colombiens}}) are [[French Canadians]] or French-speaking [[Canadians]] ([[Francophones]]) living in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]].

British Columbia is, geographically, the farthest-removed province from Canada's historic [[francophone]] population, thus it is not surprising to find that francophone British Columbians are few in number. The 2001 census placed the number of British Columbians with [[French language|French]] as a mother tongue at 57,280, 1.3% of BC's population, ranking seventh after [[English language|English]] (3,062,430), 'other [[Chinese language|Chinese]]' (357,865), [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] (133,245), [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (94,055), [[German language|German]] (73,625), and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (66,120). A good number of these listed francophones would be European and African immigrants or migrants from eastern Canada making the Franco-Columbian community a diverse one encompassing many places of origin and differing roots in the province. The popularity of French immersion education programmes have also meant that the population of second-language French speakers outnumbers the francophone population.

While Francophones have a significant history in the province due to the founders of the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay]] and [[North West Company|North West companies]], who were mostly [[Metis (Canada)|Metis]], and during the gold rushes of the 1860s, when many from [[France]] and [[Belgium]] became notable in business and society, organized migration from Quebec did not happen until the early 19th century, when the owners of [[Fraser Mills]] imported mill workers from that province, forming the community of [[Maillardville]], a neighbourhood of [[Coquitlam]] in suburban [[Vancouver]]. In 1909 mill workers were brought from [[Quebec]] to Maillardville&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.maillardville.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=31 Societe francophone de Maillardville - À propos de nous / About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and their descendants constitute a small and proud community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.library.coquitlam.bc.ca/Online+Services/Historical+Photographs/default.htm |title=Historical Photographs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215152259/http://www.library.coquitlam.bc.ca/Online+Services/Historical+Photographs/default.htm |archive-date=2008-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today Maillardville describes itself as "a community with a francophone heart" and is home to a number of francophone community organizations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maillardville.com/ Societe francophone de Maillardville - Bienvenue/Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; schools, churches,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notredamedefatima.org/ Notre Dame de Fatima - Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olol-coq.com/ Our Lady of Lourdes Notre Dame de Lourdes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725015327/http://www.olol-coq.com/ |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a retirement home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyermaillard.com/index2.htm Foyer Maillard Welcomes You!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321134434/http://foyermaillard.com/index2.htm |date=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the annual ''[[Festival du Bois]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivaldubois.ca/ Festival du Bois - Société francophone de Maillardville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and an organization of francophone [[Scouting and Guiding in British Columbia|scouts and guides]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoutsfranco.com/#/historiquepage2/4521359167&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizations place the francophone population of the Coquitlam area at 13,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Education==
The province is served by a francophone school board ([[Le Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]) which operates 40 schools offering education from kindergarten through grade 12 in the [[Lower Mainland]], [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]], [[Vancouver Island]], [[Okanagan Valley|Okanagan]], [[Kootenays]], Prince George, [[Fraser Valley]], and other parts of the province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csf.bc.ca/doc_pdf/accueil/2007_CSF_liste_ecoles.pdf liste_ecoles_08.cdr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A large and vibrant French immersion programme, although intended for anglophones, also includes some francophone students.

[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Frederick Dobson Middleton''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCMG|CB}} (4 November 1825 &amp;ndash; 25 January 1898) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] general noted for his service throughout the [[British Empire|Empire]] and particularly in the [[North-West Rebellion]].

==Military career==
Educated at [[Maidstone Grammar School]] and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], Middleton was [[Commissioned Officer|commissioned]] into the [[58th Regiment of Foot]] in 1842.&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Middleton, Frederick Dodson |first=Desmond |last=Morton |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/middleton_frederick_dobson_12E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the [[New Zealand land wars|New Zealand Wars]] and in 1845, he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] for his part in the capture of the stronghold of [[Māori people|Māori]] chief [[Te Ruki Kawiti]].&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

In 1848 he transferred to the [[96th Regiment of Foot]] in [[British Raj|India]] and took part in the suppression of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] in which campaign he was recommended for, but not actually awarded, the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; He went on to be [[List of Governors and Commandants of Sandhurst|Commandant of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in 1879.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

He was appointed [[Commander of the Canadian Army|General Officer Commanding the Militia of Canada]] in 1884.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; In 1885 a group of [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] launched the [[North-West Rebellion]], and Middleton was named commander of the main force sent to put it down.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; After a defeat at the [[Battle of Fish Creek]], his force arrived at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan]] and was victorious in the [[Battle of Batoche]].&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

Middleton left Ottawa and arrived in Winnipeg to evaluate Military District 10 which covered the Prairies as the officer in charge of District 10 had just been dismissed on the account of his alcoholism, the same day as the [[Battle of Duck Lake]], where the [[North-West Mounted Police]] were defeated by the ''Métis''.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=101}} Through Middleton was elderly and cautious, his response to the news of Duck Lake was swift and on the same day, he departed Winnipeg on a train bound for Qu'Apelle with a company of Manitoba militia.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=101}} The major difficulty for Middleton was mobilizing the militia who had to travel from Ontario and Quebec on the partially completed Canadian Pacific Railway, requiring that the militiamen march through the snows and rocks of northern Ontario to reach Winnipeg.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=102}} The Canadian historian Desmond Morton described Middleton as an experienced soldier who "...mixed common sense and pomposity in equal measure", whose plan was to take Batoche, the capital of the Métis ''exovedate'' (council), which he predicated would end the rebellion.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=102}} As the rebellion had shaken international confidence in the credit-worthiness of Canada, Middleton was under immense pressure from the Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, to end the rebellion as soon as possible.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=102}} The militiamen arriving in Winnipeg were mostly untrained, and Middleton had to train them as they marched to Saskatchewan.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=102}}

On 6 April 1885, Middleton set off on a march to Batoche.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=102}} On 23 April 1885, the ''Métis'' and Cree Indians under [[Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] ambushed the Canadians at Fish Creek.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|pages=102-103}} Despite Middeton's orders, Colonel [[William Dillon Otter]] after reaching Battleford, set out to do battle with the Cree, and was defeated by Chief [[Poundmaker]] at the [[Battle of Cut Knife Hill]]; only the latter's unwillingness to have his warriors take advantage of the rout saved the Canadians from being annihilated.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} Poundmaker was a reluctant rebel against Canada, and did not want the Canadian forces annihilated, believing this would save his people from reprisals.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} Middleton planned to advance on Batchoe with river streamers owned by the Hudson's Bay Company bringing up supplies along the South Saskatchewan river, and as streamers were not available at first, Middleton chose to wait.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=103}} Despite their own panic at Fish Creek, many of the militiamen came to curse "Old Fred" as too timid, but Middleton had sound reasons for not wishing to advance without a means of resupply.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} Middleton knew that the ''Métis'' and the Cree were expert horsemen and believed they would ambush any supply wagons, which is why he preferred to bring up supplies and reinforcements via the river.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=103}}

On 5 May 1885, the streamer ''Northcote'' was ready and Middleton set off for Batoche.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} On 9 May 1885, the ''Northcote'' was stopped by a cable that Dumont had laid across the river outside of Batoche, and its American captain turned back when the boat came under fire.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} The ''Northcote'' was a diversion to draw out the ''Métis'' and at the same time, the Field Force under Middleton arrived at Batchoe.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=104}} Seeing his troops beginning to panic again, Middleton ordered his wagons to be drawn into a circle to form a strong defensive position.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|pages=104-105}} On 11 May 1885, Middleton observed that the outnumbered ''Métis'' and Cree had to rush from position to position on the Prairies and on the morning of 12 May 1885, Middleton ordered his artillery would open fire on his opponents to pin them down while his infantry would advance.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=105}} Nothing had happened as infantry claimed not to hear the fire of the artillery; after accusing his men of cowardice, Middleton attacked again on the afternoon and with a battalion commanded by a Conservative MP, Colonel Arthur Williams leading the attack.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=105}} Inspired by the example of Williams's battalion, other battalions began to charge forward. Shouting enthusiastically, the Canadians raced down from the hill, and disheartened ''Métis'' and Cree were soon defeated.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=105}}

Morton described Middleton as cautious, but highly professional officer who was a better tactician than Dumont, who brought the war to a swift conclusion in a manner that was much less bloodier than it could have been.{{sfnp|Morton|1999|page=106}}  For his service in the war, Middleton was [[knight]]ed by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; He also received the thanks of the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the sum of $20,000.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

He resigned as head of the Militia in 1890 when a select committee of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] criticized him for the misappropriation of furs from a Métis prisoner, Charles Bremner, during the rebellion.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;
There were also other criticisms of Middleton's command during the Rebellion, such as his hesitancy to unleash the Canadian militia troops to assault the Metis positions at Batoche, and unfair treatmant and poor maintenance accorded the troops under his command.&lt;ref{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Joseph|editor=Stuart Hughes|title=The Frog Lake "Massacre": Personal Perspectives on Ethnic Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pHdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1976|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-9548-4|chapter=With Hatton's Scouts in Pursuit of Big Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Francis IV''' (Friedrich Franz Michael; 9 April 1882 – 17 November 1945) was the last Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg]]-[[Schwerin]] and [[regent]] of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. He inherited the throne when he was fifteen years old in 1897 and was forced to renounce it in 1918.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in [[Palermo]] the son of [[Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia]]. He succeeded his father as Grand Duke upon his death on 10 April 1897, but due to his minority the grand duchy was governed by his uncle [[Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg|Duke Johann Albrecht]] as [[regent]] until Friedrich Franz came of age on 9 April 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Celebration in Schwerin| publisher =[[New York Times]]| date =10 April 1901| url =https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/10/118463717.pdf| accessdate = 2007-10-23 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and issue===
On 7 June 1904, Frederick Francis married [[Princess Alexandra of Hanover (1882–1963)|Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland]] in [[Gmunden]]. She was the second eldest daughter of [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover]], and his wife [[Princess Thyra of Denmark]], a daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark]].

They had five children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/mecklenburg.html Online Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Friedrich Franz, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz]] (22 April 1910 – 31 July 2001)
*[[Duke Christian Louis of Mecklenburg|Duke Christian Ludwig]] (29 September 1912 – 18 July 1996) married [[Princess Barbara of Prussia]], daughter of [[Prince Sigismund of Prussia (1896-1978)|Prince Sigismund of Prussia]]
*Duchess Olga (1916–1917)
*[[Duchess Thyra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Duchess Thyra]] (18 June 1919 – 27 September 1981)
*[[Duchess Anastasia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Duchess Anastasia]] (11 November 1922 – 25 January 1979) married [[Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]]

===Abdication===
Following the 1918 suicide of [[Adolphus Frederick VI, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Grand Duke Adolphus Frederick VI of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Frederick Francis took up the regency of Strelitz. This happened because the heir presumptive [[Duke Charles Michael of Mecklenburg|Duke Charles Michael]] was serving in the Russian Army at the time and had indicated that he wished to renounce his succession rights. Friedrich Franz abdicated the grand ducal throne on 14 November 1918 following the [[German Empire]]'s defeat in [[World War I]]; the regency ended at the same time.&lt;ref name=heraldica/&gt;

After his abdication, he was initially not allowed to live in Mecklenburg and had to move to Denmark. A year later, he was permitted to return. He recovered some of his former properties and occupied some of his former homes. Frederick Francis died on 17 November 1945 in [[Flensburg]] after being arrested by No6 RAF Security section on 9 November 1945. He was succeeded as head of the grand ducal house by his son [[Friedrich Franz, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz]].&lt;ref name=heraldica&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/HGMecklenburg.htm House laws of Mecklenburg]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his former states became part of [[East Germany]]. His widow and children were forced to move to the West.

He was a candidate for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1986|1986]], but dropped out of the race due to allegations of forging names on his nomination papers, having ties to organized crime, and erratic personal behavior.

==Early life and political involvement==
Hyatt was born and raised in [[Methuen, Massachusetts]]. His father was a local doctor. In 1971 he graduated from [[Central Catholic High School (Lawrence, Massachusetts)|Central Catholic High School]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. He was class valedictorian. Hyatt attended [[Yale University]], where he was a member of the [[Yale Debate Association]] and the floor leader of the [[Party of the Right (Yale)|Party of the Right]] in the [[Yale Political Union]]. In 1979 he graduated from [[Boston College Law School]] and began practicing law.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Frank|title=Greg Hyatt: 3 Years After the Fall in '86|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 25, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Once Somebody" /&gt;

==Proposition 2½==
Hyatt served as executive director of Citizens for Limited Taxation from 1979 to 1980.&lt;ref name="National Review" /&gt; He was one of the architects of [[Proposition 2½]], a ballot measure that limits property tax increases by Massachusetts municipalities and traveled the state to drum up support for the measure.&lt;ref name="National Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brookhiser|first=Richard|title=Can they dump the Duke?|newspaper=National Review|date=July 18, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Newburyport Daily News" /&gt; During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], Hyatt worked in the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Small Business Administration]].&lt;ref name="National Review" /&gt;

==1984 congressional race==
Hyatt's political career began in 1984 when he was a candidate for the [[Massachusetts's 5th congressional district|5th congressional district]]. He defeated [[Thomas P. Tierney]] for the Republican nomination and faced Democratic State Senator [[Chester G. Atkins]] in the general election.&lt;ref name=ElectionStatistics&gt;{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=Election Statistics; The Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1984 |year= |publisher= |quote= | url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettsele1984mass#page/286/mode/2up |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a heavily Democratic district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan's campaign strategy, tactics challenged|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oJwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E-kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4894,1137215|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=November 5, 1984|author=Rowland Evans|author2=Robert Novak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyatt was able to finish a close second to Atkins.&lt;ref name=ElectionStatistics /&gt;

==Anti-seat belt law activism==
In 1985, Hyatt, along with radio host [[Jerry Williams (radio)|Jerry Williams]], led the effort to gather signatures to place a measure to repeal Massachusetts' mandatory seat belt law on the 1986 ballot. The question made it to the ballot and would be passed by the voters.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall" /&gt;

==1986 gubernatorial election==
On March 13, 1986, Hyatt became the first Republican to enter the gubernatorial race.&lt;ref name=Mohl&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Mohl |coauthors= |title=GOP'S Hyatt Announces Candidacy for Governor |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/660025411.html?dids=660025411:660025411&amp;FMT=ABS |quote= |work=Boston Globe |date=March 14, 1986 |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyatt ran on a platform of limiting state taxes, bringing back the death penalty, providing state aid to private schools, and competency testing and merit pay for teachers. He opposed the state law that made wearing a seat belt mandatory, the use of roadblocks to crack down on drunken driving, [[Desegregation busing|busing]], and the use of public funds for abortions.&lt;ref name="National Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohl /&gt;

Shortly before the Republican convention in April 1986, Associated Builders and Contractors, a group of Massachusetts builders and contractors that had hired Hyatt as a consultant on a petition drive, announced that they had fired him for ineffectuality and erratic behavior, including staring off into space, heavy coffee drinking, talking on the phone when no one was on the other end, and twice appearing naked before a secretary in his office.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="political grist mill" /&gt;

At the convention, Hyatt was challenged by former [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Metropolitan District Commissioner]] [[Guy Carbone]], and state representative [[Royall H. Switzler]], who was [[Draft (politics)|drafted]] at the convention by anti-Hyatt Republicans.&lt;ref name="Dabilis"&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew J. Dabilis |coauthors= |title=Switzler Drive Put Together in 4 1/2 Hours  |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659860941.html?dids=659860941:659860941&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS |quote= |work=Boston Globe |date=April 13, 1986 |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a strong showing for Switzler on the first ballot (891 votes for Hyatt,  775 votes for Switzler, 258 votes for Carbone), some of Hyatt's major supporters, including [[Ray Shamie]] and [[Papa Gino's]] founder Michael Valerio, announced that they would not oppose Switzler's nomination.&lt;ref name="Dabilis" /&gt; On the second ballot, Switzler won the nomination with 975 votes to Hyatt's 876 and Carbone's 60. Despite losing the nomination, Hyatt chose to stay in the race and run against Switzler in the Republican primary.&lt;ref name="Mohl Gears"&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Mohl |coauthors= |title=GOP'S Gears Set in Motion; Switzler Plots Strategy, Signals Hyatt Should Quit |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659862791.html?dids=659862791:659862791&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS |quote= |work=Boston Globe |date=April 14, 1986 |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Hyatt and his aides were investigated by the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]]'s office on charges for forging names on his nomination papers. He was also recorded discussing politics and accepting a cash gift from New England mobster George Kattar on a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] wiretap. Charges were not brought against him in either case.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="political grist mill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Frank|title=Suit heads for court, political grist mill|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Switzler dropped out of the race after inaccuracies about his military record were revealed, leaving Hyatt the only Republican candidate for Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Mohl |coauthors= |title=ACCUSATIONS, TURMOIL SWIRL OVER SWITZLER |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/660069841.html?dids=660069841:660069841&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |quote= |work=Boston Globe |date=June 5, 1986 |accessdate=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, Hyatt dropped out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Mohl |coauthors= |title=ADS DEPICT TAX CAP AS A HYATT PROPOSAL |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659733481.html?dids=659733481:659733481&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |quote= |work=Boston Globe |date=October 18, 1986 |accessdate=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hey, gang!

He declined the nomination and write-in candidate [[George Kariotis]] was declared the nominee. Hyatt later stated he declined the nomination because Valerio and former Governor [[John A. Volpe]] promised to retire his campaign debts in exchange for not accepting the party's nomination, which they never followed up on. Ann Kramer, a Republican State Committee member who was at the meeting with Hyatt, Valerio, Volpe, and other party leaders stated that they agreed to help Hyatt raise money to help him repay his debt, but did not promise to retire it entirely.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall" /&gt;

==Later life==
In November 1989, Hyatt gave his first interview after dropping out of the election. Hyatt described himself as still being in a "state of emotional shock" and feeling "gypped and violated". At the time of the interview he had been unable to find work for several months, was living off of a stipend provided to him by his father, going through a divorce, and undergoing psychological counseling. Since the election, Hyatt had gained 35 pounds and grew a mustache.&lt;ref name="3 Years After the Fall" /&gt;

That same year, Hyatt sued Associated Builders and Contractors and its former executive Stephen Tocco for slander. During the suit it was revealed that Hyatt's psychiatrist had described him as having [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and having been in "[[Hypomania|hypomanic stages]]." Most of his defamation suit was dismissed, however the court allowed Hyatt's charge that Associated Builders had defamed him by claiming he had been fired stand (Hyatt contended that he was not fired, but quit). In September 1993, the case was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Frank|title=Hyatt settles suit against Tocco|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Hyatt changed his voter registration to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] so he could vote for [[Paul Tsongas]] in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|Democratic presidential primary]]. He also voted for [[Marty Meehan]] in that year's [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|United States House of Representatives election]]. While he described himself as "still basically a conservative" he also stated that he "believe[d] societies should be judged by how they treat their less fortunate".&lt;ref name="comeback kid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Robert L.|title=In Methuen, a comeback kid is running for mayor|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Hyatt was elected to the Methuen Charter Commission.&lt;ref name="comeback kid" /&gt; In 1993 and 2003, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Methuen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyatt, Gregory S. "Greg"|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=30777|work=Our Campaigns|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyatt ran a website, thebulldogedition.com, where he wrote about politics in Massachusetts and Methuen. The site was described by ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' columnist [[Alex Beam]] as "belligerent" and "off-the-wall". A portion of the website had to be taken down due to a judge's order. As he did not have a computer, Hyatt updated the site from the [[Nevins Memorial Library]] in Methuen. In a 2005 Boston Globe column, Hyatt was described as occasionally working as a political or media consultant, on probation for making hostile threats, not having a car or computer, being in poor health, and described his living situation by stating "I bounce around". Hyatt said that he saw himself as a good candidate to host a talk show. He also stated that he rekindled his religious faith.&lt;ref name="Once Somebody"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beam|first=Alex|title=He was Once Somebody, but who?|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later moved to [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]]. In 2007, he was a leader in the effort to get Proposition 1, a proposed initiative petition that would which would cap increases in property tax levies to 1% a year and eliminate the auto excise tax, on the ballot. On September 26, 2007 he was disbarred by the Board of Bar Overseers for "serious crimes", including intimidation of a witness and violating a protective order. Hyatt maintained his innocence and stated that he had only pleaded guilty because he did not have enough money to fight the charges in court. He had not practiced law since 2000, when he stopped paying his bar association dues.&lt;ref name="The Newburyport Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tait|first=Stephen|title=Hyatt disbarred, still vows to push forward with Prop. 1|url=http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x845826575/Hyatt-disbarred-still-vows-to-push-forward-with-Prop-1|accessdate=April 16, 2014|newspaper=The Newburyport Daily News|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DhabitHaniGulfCup.png|thumb|left|200px|Hani Al-Dhabit, [[Oman]]i footballer]] --&gt;
He played for the [[Oman national football team]] from 1998 to 2008 and was the captain of the team in 2002 and 2003. His most successful season for the national team was during 2001-02 and he was the world's leading goalscorer in international matches in 2001.&lt;ref name="rsssf.com"&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-scor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabian Gulf Cup===
Hani has made appearances in the [[14th Arabian Gulf Cup]], the [[15th Arabian Gulf Cup]], the [[16th Arabian Gulf Cup]] and the [[17th Arabian Gulf Cup]].

In the [[14th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in 1998, despite his young age, he scored a goal  in a 2-2 draw against [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]]. In the tournament, Oman finished at the fourth place with four points from one win and one draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=162&amp;stage=1 | title= Gulf Cup14 - Bahrain 1998 | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first showed his talent during the [[15th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in 2002 scoring five goals, a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over the then powerhouse 9-time competition winners, [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], a goal in a 1-2 loss against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and another in a 1-1 draw against [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]]. At the end of the competition he was awarded with the "Top Goal Scorer" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=160&amp;scorers=true | title= Gulf Cup15 - Saudi 2002 (Goal Scorers) | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tournament, Oman finished at the fifth place with four points from one win and one draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=160 | title= Gulf Cup15 - Saudi 2002 | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not being successful in scoring any goals in both the [[16th Arabian Gulf Cup]] and the [[17th Arabian Gulf Cup]], he still made many appearances, and was handed the captain's band once again in the [[16th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in 2003–04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=29&amp;stage=1&amp;sch=true | title= Gulf Cup16 - Kuwait 2003 | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time Hani led Oman to its most successful position ever yet in the [[Arabian Gulf Cup]] competition, reaching the final four round for the first time  with eight points from two wins and two draws.

During the [[17th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in 2004, he was not assigned captaincy by [[Czechs|Czech]] coach, [[Milan Macala]]. He was featured widely as a substitute, but still received an adequate amount of playing time, and scored a goal in the penalty-kick shootout during the final in which Oman lost to the hosts [[Qatar]] in a penalty shootout after the goalkeeping sensation [[Ali Al-Habsi]] missed a penalty. [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] won the match 6-5 on penalties after the match had ended 1-1 at normal time. [[Amad Al-Hosni]] was awarded the "Top Goal Scorer" award of the competition with a total of four goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=737 | title= 17th Gulf Cup - Qatar 2004 | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.goalzz.com/main.aspx?c=737&amp;scorers=true | title= 17th Gulf Cup - Qatar 2004 (Goal Scorers) | publisher= goalzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Asian Cup Qualification===
He scored five goals in the qualification for the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://int.soccerway.com/international/asia/asian-cup-qualification/2004-china/qualifying/r1761/ | title= ASIAN CUP QUALIFICATION 2004 | publisher= soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in a 7-0 win over [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2003/09/25/asia/asian-cup-qualification/nepal/oman/255515/?ICID=PL_MS_02 | title= NEPAL VS.

VIETNAM 2 - 0 | publisher= soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence helping his team to qualify for the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]]. In the tournament, Oman won four points in a 2-0 win over [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2004/07/28/asia/asian-cup/oman/thailand/255573/?ICID=PL_MS_10 | title= OMAN VS. THAILAND 2 - 0 | publisher= soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2-2 draw against [[Iran national football team|Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2004/07/24/asia/asian-cup/oman/iran/255571/?ICID=PL_MS_01 | title= OMAN VS.

Many of the goals were scored by Hani.

After eventually being knocked out of qualification, Hani had scored a total of 11 goals in 4 matches out of the 12 matches Oman had played. In one match, he was on the brink of a double [[hat-trick (football)|hat-trick]] but unfortunately he couldn't. At the end of the year, he was awarded the 2001 Top Goal Scorer Award with a total of 22 international goals,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iffhs.de/?388d85ff0e003c4f05e91a55685fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb8a710 IFFHS 2001 World's Top Goal Scorer&lt;/ref&gt; beating [[Spain national football team|Spain]]'s [[Raúl González|Raúl]], [[England national football team|England]]'s [[Michael Owen]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Luís Figo]], becoming the first [[Oman]]i and only third [[Arab]], to win the title.

'''Harry Julian Allen''' (1 April 1910 – 29 January 1977), also known as '''Harvey Allen''', was an [[aeronautical engineer]] and a Director of the [[NASA]] [[Ames Research Center]], most noted for his "Blunt Body Theory" of [[atmospheric entry]] which permitted successful recovery of orbiting spacecraft. His technique is still  used to this day.

==Career==
Allen was born in [[Maywood, Illinois]].  He attended [[Stanford University]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in engineering in 1932 and an Aeronautical Engineer professional degree in 1935.  In 1936, he joined the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]]'s [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]].  In 1940, he moved to the Ames Research Laboratory, where he served as Chief of the Ames Theoretical Aerodynamics Branch (starting in 1941), Chief of the High-Speed Research Division (starting in 1945), Assistant Director for Astronautics (starting in 1959), and finally Center Director (1965-1969).

==Research==
Allen was interested in the full range of aerodynamics research, and made contributions to the study of [[Subsonic flight|subsonic]], [[transonic]], [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] flow.  When the [[United States]] became interested in the design of ballistic missiles, Allen began research in the dynamics and thermodynamics of [[atmospheric reentry]], as well as the effects of [[radiation]] and [[meteorite]]s on [[space vehicle]]s.  His most significant contribution in this area was the idea of using a blunt nose for reentry vehicles, otherwise known as his "Blunt Body Theory".  Earlier ballistic missiles, developed by both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], featured long nose cones with very narrow tips, which had relatively low [[drag (physics)|drag]] when entering the atmosphere at high speeds.  However, Allen demonstrated that a blunt body, although it had greater drag, would have a detached [[shock wave]] which would transfer far less heat to the vehicle than the traditional shape with its attached shock wave.  Excessive heating was the greatest concern in the design of ballistic missiles and spacecraft, since it could melt their surface; the blunt body design solved this problem.  Allen's theory led to the design of ablative [[heat shield]]s that protected the astronauts of the [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs as their space capsules re-entered the atmosphere.

==Awards and honors==

'''Heimo Korth''' is an American outdoorsman. He and his wife Edna are among the only permanent residents of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. They live along the [[Coleen River]], just south of the [[Brooks Range]], and move between cabins seasonally. Striving to be self-reliant, they hunt and fish for their own food.

The Korths' lifestyle came to public attention with James Campbell's 2004 book ''[[The Final Frontiersman|The Final Frontiersman: Heimo Korth and His Family, Alone in Alaska's Arctic Wilderness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/07/07/vbs.heimo.alaska&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[VBS.tv]] produced ''Surviving Alone in Alaska'', a documentary film showing Korth's lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq0rZn8HFmQ&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also featured among others on PBS's "Braving Alaska" in 1992.

Reliant on [[bush flying|bush pilot]]s to transport him in and out of his home in [[The Bush (Alaska)|the bush]], he was incidentally featured in ''[[Flying Wild Alaska]]'' 2011 - 2012, as Korth had hired the series' protagonist Jim Tweto to fly him out of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flying Wild Alaska'' season 1, episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Heimo, Edna and their family, alongside 4 other families, make up the Discovery series ''[[The Last Alaskans]]'' which premiered in 2015.

An '''Intelligence Officer''' is a person employed by an organization to collect, compile and/or analyze information (known as [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]) which is of use to that organization. The term of 'Officer' is a working title, and is not to be confused with rank as in the police services, where Sergeants are also 'Police Officers,' or with Non-Commissioned Military ranks that can be Intelligence Officers as well. Organizations which employ intelligence officers include [[armed forces]], [[police]], civilian [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], [[customs]] agencies and [[Competitive intelligence|private corporations]].&lt;ref name="scip"&gt;Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals, Board of Directors, {{cite web |url=http://www.scip.org/about/content.cfm?itemnumber=582&amp;navItemNumber=506 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224105050/http://www.scip.org/about/content.cfm?itemnumber=582&amp;navItemNumber=506 |archivedate=2013-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of intelligence==
Intelligence officers make use of a variety of sources of information, including

; [[Signals intelligence#COMINT|Communications intelligence]] (COMINT): [[Eavesdropping]] and interception of communications (e.g., by [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]]) including [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) and [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] (ELINT).
; [[Financial intelligence]] (FININT): The gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest.
; [[Human intelligence (espionage)|Human intelligence]] (HUMINT): Derived from covert [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] sources (CHIS, ''agents'' or ''moles'') from a variety of agencies and activities.
; [[Imagery intelligence]] (IMINT): Derived from numerous collection assets, such as [[Spy satellite|reconnaissance satellites]] or [[Surveillance aircraft|aircraft]].
; [[Measurement and signature intelligence]] (MASINT): Derived from collection assets that collect and evaluate technical profiles and specific characteristics of certain targeted entities.
; [[Open source intelligence]] (OSINT): Derived from publicly available sources such as the [[Internet]], [[library]] materials, [[newspaper]]s, etc.
; [[Technical intelligence]] (TECHINT): Based on scientific and technical characteristics of weapons systems, technological devices and other entities.

Please note, the difference between MASINT and TECHINT is that TECHINT involves analysis of weapons systems in the custody of the organization which commissions such tests, while MASINT involves analysis, or remote sensing, of trace evidence left behind by the weapons systems (unintended emissive byproducts, or "trails"—the spectral, chemical or RF emissions an object leaves behind which serve as distinctive signatures).

==Role and responsibilities==
The actual role carried out by an intelligence officer varies depending on the remit of his/her parent organization. Officers of foreign intelligence agencies (e.g. the United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the United Kingdom's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) and the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS)) may spend much of their careers abroad. Officers of domestic intelligence agencies (such as the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the UK's [[MI5|Security Service]] (MI5) and the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO)) are responsible for [[counter-terrorism]], [[counter-espionage]], [[counter-proliferation]] and the detection and prevention of serious [[organized crime]] within their own countries (although, in Britain, the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] had been set up to take care of serious organized crime).

Titles and responsibilities common among intelligence officers include:

; Field officer: An officer who manages the [[intelligence collection plan]] for specific missions in foreign countries.
; [[Agent Handling|Case officer]]: An officer who runs intelligence agents in order to collect raw intelligence information.  Case officers spend their time recruiting and exploiting source agents in order to collect [[HUMINT]].
; [[Intelligence collection management|Collections officer (collector)]]: An officer who collects information, not necessarily from human sources but from technical sources such as [[wiretaps]], [[covert listening device|bugs]], [[cyber-collection]], [[MASINT]] devices, [[SIGINT]] devices and other means.
; Operations officer: An officer who plans or enacts the necessary steps to disrupt or prevent activities of hostile individuals or groups.
; [[Intelligence Analyst|Analyst]]: An officer who analyzes collected information and results of operations to determine the identities, intentions, capabilities and activities of hostile individuals or groups and to determine requirements for future operations.  After analysis, analysts are also responsible for the production and dissemination of their final product.&lt;ref name="oia"&gt;U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Intelligence and Analysis Brochure, [http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Terrorism-Fin-Intel/Documents/oia-brochure.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;Department of Homeland Security, Deployed Intelligence Officers and Protective Security Advisors, {{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/deployed-intelligence-officers-and-protective-security-advisors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104225606/http://www.dhs.gov/deployed-intelligence-officers-and-protective-security-advisors |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}, accessed Jan 8 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Counterintelligence]] officer:An officer that works to prevent detection, penetration, manipulation and compromise of the intelligence agency and its operations by foreign, domestic, or hostile agents.&lt;ref name="usajobs"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6DVyiT1wu?url=https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/333266700 USAjobs.gov, Counter-Intelligence Officer Job Duties]&lt;/ref&gt; Often counterintelligence officers are law enforcement officers, this is the case with the Diplomatic Security Service's Counterintelligence Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Counterintelligence Division. This is often done in order to arrest moles and foreign intelligence agents.

===Intelligence agents===
Intelligence agents are individuals that work for or have been recruited by an Intelligence Officer, but who are not employed by the intelligence agency of the intelligence officer.  Sometime around 2000, the [[United States Intelligence Community]] adopted a more "corporate" vocabulary and began referring to agents as assets.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[[Ishmael Jones]], ''The Human Factor: Inside the CIA's Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Intelligence agents can be of several types:

; Source agent: A primary source of intelligence information.  This is the classic HUMINT source.
; Access agent: An agent who identifies and approaches potential sources (eventual source agents) for assessment or recruitment.  In [[counter-proliferation]] (CP) access agents are often scientists.  In [[counter-terrorism]] (CT) access agents are often religious or ideological leaders.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;
; [[Agent provocateur]]: An agent who infiltrates hostile organizations with the intent of spreading [[disinformation]] from within or disrupting their operations through enticement and sabotage.
; Rogue agent: A former intelligence officer, who may be subject to a [[burn notice (document)|burn notice]], who is no longer accepting direction from his/her agency.
; [[Double agent]]: An agent or intelligence officer who accepts direction from two or more intelligence agencies.  Known as triple agents when the number of directing agencies is three.

Contrary to popular belief or what is seen in Hollywood films, professionally trained intelligence officers are never referred to as agents, secret agents or special agents, they are referred to as case officers or operations officers.  Agents are the foreigners who betray their own countries to pass information to the officer; agents are also known as confidential informants or assets.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">'''Isabella Montagu, Duchess of Manchester''' (c.1706 &amp;ndash; 20 December 1786), formerly '''Lady Isabella Montagu''', was the wife of [[William Montagu, 2nd Duke of Manchester]].

She was the daughter of [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]] and his wife, the former [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Lady Mary Churchill]]. Her sister, [[Mary Montagu, Countess of Cardigan|Mary]], became Countess of Cardigan. Their three brothers all died in childhood.

She married the Duke of Manchester on 16 April 1723,&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume II, page 58. &lt;/ref&gt; about two years after he had inherited the dukedom. They were childless, and remained married until the duke's death in 1739.

The duchess remarried, in 1743, the politician [[Edward Hussey-Montagu, 1st Earl Beaulieu|Edward Hussey-Montagu]], who was raised to the peerage in 1762 as Baron Beaulieu and in 1784 was created Earl Beaulieu.

There were two children from this second marriage:

*[[John Hussey-Montagu, Lord Montagu]] (1746-1787), MP for Windsor, who died unmarried and childless
*Isabella Hussey-Montagu (1750-1772)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/beaulieu1784.htm|title=Beaulieu, Earl of (GB, 1784 - 1802)|website=Cracrofts Peerage|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella was one of the twenty-one '[[Signatories to the Ladies' Petition for the Establishment of the Foundling Hospital|ladies of quality and distinction]]' who supported [[Thomas Coram]]'s efforts to establish a [[Foundling Hospital]], who are now credited with making the endeavour a success by lending it respectability and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53361054|title=Thomas Coram, Gent., 1668-1751|last=Gillian.|first=Wagner,|date=2004|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=|isbn=1843830574|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|pages=88|oclc=53361054}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added her name to his petition on 6 January 1730, at the age of only twenty-two, which was later presented to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;''Ladies of Quality and Distinction Exhibition Catalogue'', edited by Kathleen Palmer, Foundling Museum, London, 2018, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The duchess was known as a talented amateur artist, who, according to [[Horace Walpole]], "painted remarkably well in crayons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/Manchester.pdf|title=Dictionary of Pastellists before 1800|author=Neil Jeffares|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In ''Look Me in the Eye'', Robison describes growing up with no diagnosis of his autism, but aware that he was different, and how he was first diagnosed by a therapist friend when he was 40 years old. After writing that book, Robison became active in the planning of autism research and in [[Autism rights movement|autism advocacy]].&lt;ref name="John Elder Robison_2"/&gt;

Robison is also the author of ''Be Different'' (2011), a how-to guide for grown ups with autism; ''Raising Cubby'' (2013), the story of raising his autistic son;&lt;ref name="Michael J. Klingensmith"&gt;{{cite web

==Advocacy==
Robison is active in the [[autism rights movement]]. He volunteered at [[Autism Speaks]] as a member of their treatment and advisory boards, claiming that he was interested in helping remediate the disabling aspects of autism. He resigned in 2013 following an op-ed released by Suzanne Wright, a co-founder of Autism Speaks. Robison and other members of the autism community criticized Wright for proclaiming that families affected by autism lived in "despair" and in "fear of the future".&lt;ref name="John Elder Robison_5"&gt;{{cite web

'''John William Draper''' (May 5, 1811 – January 4, 1882) was an English-born American scientist, philosopher, physician, [[chemist]], historian and photographer. He is credited with producing the first clear photograph of a female face (1839–40) and the first detailed photograph of the moon in 1840. He was also the first president of the [[American Chemical Society]] (1876–77) and a founder of the New York University School of Medicine. One of Draper's books, the ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'', popularised the [[conflict thesis]] proposing intrinsic hostility in the [[relationship between religion and science]]. It was widely read and was translated into several languages.&lt;ref name="Reuben1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuben|first=Julie A.|title=The Making of the Modern University: Intellectual Transformation and the Marginalization of Morality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6hsNJjVnE0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=1996|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-71020-4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Henry Draper]], and his granddaughter, [[Antonia Maury]], were astronomers, her younger sister, [[Carlotta Maury]], was a paleontologist, his eldest son, [[John Christopher Draper]], was a chemist, and son [[:de:Daniel Draper|Daniel Draper]], was a meteorologist.&lt;ref name=nndb&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/733/000167232/ John William Draper]. The Notable Names Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John William Draper was born May 5, 1811, in [[St. Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]], Lancashire, England, to John Christopher Draper, a [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] clergyman and Sarah (Ripley) Draper. He also had three sisters, Dorothy Catherine (August 6, 1807 – December 10, 1901),&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Howard R. McManus, [http://www.historybroker.com/light/web/Famous/famous.htm "The Most Famous Daguerreian Portrait: Exploring the History of the Dorothy Catherine Draper Daguerreotype,"] The Daguerreian Annual 1995, pp. 148–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Johnson, and Sarah Ripley. On June 23, he was baptized by the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] minister [[Jabez Bunting]]. His father often needed to move the family due to serving various congregations throughout England. John Wm. Draper was home tutored until 1822, when he entered [[Woodhouse Grove School]]. He returned to home instruction (1826) prior to entering [[University College London]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[University College London]], Draper studied chemistry under the direction of [[Edward Turner (chemist)]].&lt;ref name=Wickliff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wickliff|first=Gregory A.|title=John William Draper's Experiments in Light, Photography, and Photolithography|journal=Daguerreian Annual 2011|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 1831, John William Draper married Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner (c. 1814–1870), the daughter of Daniel Gardner, a court physician to [[John VI of Portugal]] and [[Charlotte of Spain]]. Antonia was born in Brazil after the royal family fled Portugal with [[Napoleon]]'s invasion. There is dispute as to the identity of Antonia's mother. Around 1830, Antonia was sent with her brother Daniel to live with their aunt in London.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his father's death in July 1831, John William's mother was urged to move with her children to the US state of [[Virginia]]. John William hoped to acquire a teaching position at a local [[Methodist]] college.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia==
[[File:John William Draper4.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of John Draper engraved by [[John Sartain]]]]
In 1832, the family settled in [[Mecklenburg County, Virginia]], {{convert|7|mi|km}} east of Christiansville (now [[Chase City]]). Although he arrived too late to obtain the prospective teaching position, John William established a laboratory in Christiansville. Here he conducted experiments and published eight papers before entering medical school. His sister, Dorothy Catherine Draper provided finances through teaching drawing and painting for his medical education. In March 1836, he graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]. That same year, he began teaching at [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York==
In 1837, Draper accepted an appointment to be head of chemistry in a proposed medical school at [[New York University]], but sufficient funds were not available to go ahead with the project. In 1839, Draper was elected undergraduate professor of chemistry and botany at the university, and moved with his family to New York City .&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=George F.|title=Memoir of John William Draper. 1811-1882|date=April 21, 1886|location=Read before the Natural Academy|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/draper-john.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there he helped to found the [[New York University Medical School]], acting as a professor there from 1840 to 1850, president of the school from 1850 to 1873, and as a professor of chemistry until 1881.

==Work==
Draper did important research in [[photochemistry]], made [[portrait photography]] possible by his improvements (1839) on [[Daguerreotype|Louis Daguerre's process]], and published a textbook on Chemistry (1846), textbook on Natural Philosophy (1847), textbook on Physiology (1866), and Scientific Memoirs (1878) on radiant energy.

In 1839–1840, Draper produced clear photographs, which at that time were regarded as the first life photographs of a human face.&lt;ref name=Lienhard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lienhard|first1=John H.|title=No. 2604 John Draper's Sister|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2604.htm|website=Engines of Our Ingenuity|publisher=[[University of Houston]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For early male photographs, see self-portraits by [[:File:Henry Fitz Jr self-portrait, 1839.jpg|Henry Fitz]] and [[:File:RobertCornelius.jpg|Robert Cornelius]], both taken in 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; Draper took a series of pictures, with a 65-second exposure in sunlight. The first ones, of a female assistant whose face was covered with a thin layer of flour to increase contrast, were not preserved. Draper also photographed his sister, Dorothy Catherine Draper, and one of those pictures (see image) became known to the public via the letter which Draper sent to [[John Herschel]] in 1840. Several copies were made of this picture in the 19th century, and the photograph attached with Draper's letter was also likely a copy made by Draper himself.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;
[[File:John W Draper-The first Moon Photograph 1840.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The earliest surviving daguerreotype of the Moon by Draper (1840)]]
In March 1840 Draper became the second person to produce photographs of an astronomical object, the [[Moon]], considered the first [[astrophotography|astrophotographs]].&lt;ref name=Kalfus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalfus|first1=Skye|title=Across the Spectrum|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/across-the-spectrum|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|date= 2010|volume=28|issue=2|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he made daguerreotypes of the solar spectrum that revealed new infra-red and ultra violet lines.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norman|first=Daniel|title=The Development of Astronomical Photography|journal=Osiris, Vol. 5, 1938|pages=560–594}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 he was making [[photomicrograph]]s and engaged his then teenage son, Henry, into their production.

Draper developed the proposition in 1842 that only light rays that are absorbed can produce chemical change.&lt;ref&gt;On the idiosyncratic interpretation of the action of what Draper called "Tithonic rays" see Hentschel (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  It came to be known as the [[Photoelectrochemical processes#Grotthuss–Draper law|Grotthuss–Draper law]] when his name was teamed with a prior but apparently unknown promulgator [[Theodor Grotthuss]] of the same idea in 1817.

In 1847 he published the observation that all solids glow red at about the same temperature, about 977&amp;nbsp;°F (798 K), which has come to be known as the [[Draper point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On Saturday 30 May the [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] featured Draper's lecture on his paper "On the Intellectual Development of Europe, considered with reference to the views of Mr. Darwin and others, that the progression of organisms is determined by law."  Draper's presentation was an early example of applying a Darwinian metaphor of [[adaptation]] and environment to social and political studies, but was thought to be long and boring. The hall was crowded to hear Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce]]'s views on [[Charles Darwin]]'s recent publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', and the occasion was a historically significant part of the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]] due to reports of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s response to Wilberforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2000/5/huxley-wilberforce-and-the-oxford-museum/2 |title=Huxley, Wilberforce and the Oxford Museum |author=Keith Thomson |date=May–June 2000 |publisher=''[[American Scientist]]'' |page=210 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter 2852"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2852 |title=Letter 2852 — Hooker, J.

Contributions to the discipline of history: Draper is well known also as the author of ''The History of the Intellectual Development of Europe'' (1862), applying the methods of physical science to history, a ''History of the American Civil War'' (3 vols., 1867–1870), and a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874).&lt;ref name=nndb /&gt; The last book listed is among the most influential works on the [[conflict thesis]], which takes its name from Draper's title. His book examined the [[relationship between religion and science]], dismissing ideas of harmony and presenting the history of science as "not a mere record of isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on the one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other." After outlining the origins of science in [[ancient Greek philosophy]], Draper presented the development of Christianity as leading to repression of science. His argument, aimed at his fellow Protestants, employed [[anti-Catholic]] rhetoric, but also said that these "two rival divisions of the Christian church" were "in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered agreeable to the Scriptures", and both were liable to "theological odium". The book went through fifty printings in the United States alone, and was translated into ten languages.&lt;ref name="Reuben1996" /&gt;

Draper served as the first president of the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="ACS President: John W. Draper (1811-1882)"&gt;{{cite web|title=ACS President: John W.

The '''Karen National Liberation Army''' ({{lang-my|ကရင်အမျိုးသား လွတ်မြောက်ရေး တပ်မတော်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''KNLA''') is the military branch of the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), which campaigns for the self-determination of the [[Karen people]] of [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma). The KNLA has been fighting the Burmese government since 1949.

The KNLA was reported to have had a strength of roughly 5,000 soldiers in 2006,&lt;ref name="atimes.com"&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/EJ18Ae03.html&lt;/ref&gt; 6,000 in 2012 and 7,000 in 2014.&lt;ref name=Rotberg&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=A6bjyIcXIKgC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Burma: Prospects for a Democratic Future'', by Robert I. Rotberg]&lt;/ref&gt; The army is divided into seven brigades&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt; and a 'Special Force' reserved for special operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=19765 'Special Force' Joins KNLA on High Alert ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501123228/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=19765 |date=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Pre-1990 ===
At the time of Burmese independence from the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1948, there was considerable tension between the [[Karen people|Karen]] community and the Burmese majority. Some Karens sought independence while others attempted co-existence within Burma. The KNLA was previously called the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO). The KNDO was an armed organisation which was formed by the KNU in 1947 to defend Karen communities and interests. Most KNDO soldiers had previously served in the forces of [[British Burma]].

In early 1949, the Burmese government arrested the Karen leader of the armed forces and replaced him with radical Burmese anti-Karen nationalist [[Ne Win]]. Continued attacks against Karen dominated townships around Rangoon and the arrest of Karen political leaders led the Karen national Union to [[The Karen Conflict|declare armed struggle]], and the world's longest running civil war began.

Early in the fighting, Karen forces overran much of northern Burma including towns such as [[Mandalay]] and established strong positions outside [[Rangoon]] at [[Insein Township]]. But lacking a port from which to receive military supplies, the Karen forces gradually withdrew to the southeast of Burma.

In 1976, the Karen National Union changed its policy on wanting an independent state, and joined a new alliance, the National Democratic Front. This alliance of armed ethnic political parties supported a federal union of Burma.&lt;ref&gt;Karen National Union website www.knuhq.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990–2010 ===
In 1994 a group of Buddhist soldiers in the KNLA, claiming that the KNLA was unfairly dominated by Christians, broke away from the KNLA to form a new force, the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army|DKBA]], which soon organised a cease-fire with the Burmese military government.

In 1995 KNLA lost [[Kawmoora]] and [[Myawaddy]] to the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army|DKBA]]. This considerably reduced the KNLA's border trade taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|87-11-23074-6}} [[Carsten Jensen]]'s source is [[Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group calling itself the KNU/KNLA Peace Council, led by the former KNLA brigade 7 commander Brig-Gen Htay Maung (Htein Maung), broke away from the KNLA in February 2007, and organised a peace talk as well as a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military government without the approval of the KNU central committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=18313 Karen Peace Council Rejects BGF Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125040835/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=18313 |date=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2008, [[Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan]], the KNU secretary-general, was assassinated in [[Thailand]].

On 13 May 2009, a senior [[Myanmar Army]] officer, Brig.-Gen. Kaung Myat, was killed by the KNLA. He had been the commander of the No. 5 Military Operations Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=15630 Senior Burmese Commander killed by KNLA Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, on 19 June, [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army|DKBA]] soldiers began attacking the KNLA Brigade 7 headquarters, which they then captured on 23 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=16245 Mae La Refugees Fear DKBA Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010–present ==
{{See also|2010–12 Myanmar border clashes}}

During 2010, increasing numbers of [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] (DKBA) soldiers defected to the KNLA, or fled to Thailand, following the announcement that the DKBA would be absorbed into the Burmese military government's Border Guard. The DKBA had previously been allied to, but distinct from, government forces.

In November 2010, following the [[Burmese general election, 2010|general election of 2010]], large parts of the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] are alleged to have mutinied and re-aligned themselves with the KNLA, resulting in the [[2010 Burma border clashes|escalating conflict with junta troops]]. The two rebel armies have formed an alliance, in advance of a possible crackdown by the military government.&lt;ref name=Al-Jazeera&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Myanmar rebel armies join forces

The KNLA, along with its parent organisation the KNU, signed the [[Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement]] (NCA) with the government of Myanmar on 15 October 2015, along with several other insurgent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar signs ceasefire with eight armed groups|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/myanmar-signs-ceasefire-with-eight-armed-groups-idUSKCN0S82MR20151015|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, KNLA fighters began clashing with members of the [[Mon National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), the armed wing of the [[New Mon State Party]] (NMSP), in the [[Tanintharyi Region]]. Both the KNU and NMSP were signatories of the [[Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement]] (NCA) at the time of the fighting. A temporary bilateral truce was reached between the two groups on 14 March 2018.&lt;ref name="MMTimes14318"/&gt;

== Foreigners ==
A number of foreigners have gone to Myanmar to fight for the KNLA.

[[Dave Everett (Soldier)|Dave Everett]], a former [[Special Air Service Regiment (Australia)|Australian SAS]] soldier, fought for the KNLA and was later arrested in Australia for trying to steal money to fund the KNLA. [[Des Ball]], Professor at ANU, has advised them on military strategy.

Thomas Bleming, an American, claims to have fought for the Karen and has written a book called ''War in Karen Country''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War in Karen Country: Armed Struggle for a Free and Independent Karen State in Southeast Asia |last=Bleming |first=Thomas James |year=2007 |publisher=iUniverse |location=New York; Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=0-595-69327-X |oclc=609978846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the KNLA's French volunteers were killed in action fighting for the KNLA: Jean-Phillipe Courreges (killed 1985), Olivier Thiriat (killed 1989), and Guillaume Oillic (killed 1990).

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his larger works include ''Mystery Cats of the World'' (1989), ''The Lost Ark: New and Rediscovered Animals of the 20th Century'' (1993; expanded in 2002 as ''The New Zoo''), and ''In Search of Prehistoric Survivors'' (1995), as well as two worldwide bestsellers – ''Dragons: A Natural History'' (1995; reissued in 2006), and ''The Unexplained'' (1996; reissued in 2002).&lt;ref name="Karl Shuker website"/&gt; Shuker also published ''Star Steeds and Other Dreams'', a book of poetry which appeared in 2009.

According to [[Jonathan Downes]], there are a number of little-known cryptids to which Shuker was the first cryptozoologist to bring widespread public attention.&lt;ref name="downes-2007"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Sri Lankan [[Jackal's Horn|horned jackal]] and [[Devil Bird]], [[Gambo]] the Gambian sea serpent, Goodenough Island mystery bird, New Guinea [[ropen]] and devil pig or gazeka, Scottish earth hound, Indonesian veo and horned cat, New Caledonian du, Irish dobhar-chú, Shatt al Arab venomous mystery fish, Zanzibar makalala, Ethiopian death bird, Zululand kondlo, Arctic North American [[waheela]], [[Kellas cat]], [[Mongolian Death Worm]], [[European Jackal|Hungarian reedwolf]], Fujian blue or [[Maltese tiger]] as shown on the cover of ''Mysteries of Planet Earth'' (1999), Welsh cenaprugwirion, [[bigfin squid]], St Helena sirenian, Timor Sea ground shark, and crowing crested cobra.

Shuker pens two cryptozoological columns ("Alien Zoo" and "The Lost Ark") in ''[[Fortean Times]]'', and contributes regularly to ''Strange Magazine'', to ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate Magazine]]'', and to ''[[Paranormal Magazine]]''. In addition, he is the zoological consultant for ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.&lt;ref name="Newton, Michael 2005, p. 425"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman, Loren 1999, p. 221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karl Shuker website"/&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Shuker stated that three of the most important zoological discoveries of the twentieth century were the [[okapi]], the [[coelacanth]] and the [[saola]] (or Vu Quang ox).&lt;ref name="mongabay-2012" /&gt; Shuker's 2012 volume, ''The Encyclopaedia of New and Rediscovered Animals'' provides a detailed discussion of similar discoveries, including discoveries made as recently as 2011.&lt;ref name="mongabay-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As the journal's founding editor-in-chief, Shuker has the stated goal of "providing an outlet for cryptozoological research with a genuinely scientific approach," with the hope of elevating the field's reputation among the scientific community.&lt;ref name="cossins-2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Upon announcing plans to start the new journal, Shuker had expressed "hope that cryptozoological researchers will submit papers to the journal that are totally worthy of publication in mainstream zoological journals but which may not be accepted by them simply because their subject is cryptozoological."&lt;ref name="mongabay-2012" /&gt; Remarking that many newly discovered or rediscovered species begin as cryptids, Shuker believes that the field of cryptozoology is at a disadvantage, noting "as soon as one of its subjects is confirmed to be real, it is no longer cryptozoological but zoological instead."&lt;ref name="mongabay-2012" /&gt;

==Scientific approach==

Shuker engages in what he describes as the scientific investigation of "animals still awaiting formal zoological detection and description in the 21st century."&lt;ref name="beasts-2003"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shuker is critical of investigators who set out to uncritically validate their preconceptions, stating that such activity is not serious cryptozoology.&lt;ref name="ostli-2013" /&gt;

Shuker's approach also sometimes leads to a more reserved position regarding cryptid claims. Having investigated the mystery of the [[chupacabra]], Shuker noted in an interview with [[Benjamin Radford]] that the inconsistencies surrounding descriptions and accounts of the creature made it difficult to separate actual reports from folklore.&lt;ref name="radford-2011"/&gt;

Based on his interpretation of available accounts and evidence of the creature, Shuker hypothesized that the chupacabra itself might be "a nonexistent composite" resulting from accounts of "different entities [...] all being lumped together."&lt;ref name="radford-2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore|date=15 March 2011|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0826350151|pages=5, 8, 17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FuZAo9_ohgIC&amp;q=Karl+Shukar#v=onepage&amp;q=Karl%20Shuker&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In a 1996 review of Shuker's book ''Dragons: A Natural History'' in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', Richard Ellis discussed the "impressive assortment of illustrations," as well as Shuker's coverage of dragon imagery and icons throughout history, but criticized a lack of focus on "the 'real' animals held to be responsible for some of the dragon or sea serpent stories, such as the crocodile, the Komodo dragon, the African rock python, and the oarfish."&lt;ref name="ellis-1996"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis found fault with coverage of "aquatic serpent dragons" such as the Loch Ness monster, lamenting that "despite corroborated evidence that the famous Loch Ness monster's 'surgeon's photograph' was a hoax, [...] 'Nessie' is one of the contemporary 'dragons' in this book."&lt;ref name="ellis-1996" /&gt;

In June 1997 Shuker criticized ''Fortean Times'' publisher Mike Dash, who has described most reports of strange phenomena to be products of the imagination, to which Shuker stated, "there are some intriguing pieces of evidence for the existence of a large underwater mammal in Loch Ness, not least the sonar soundings of 1972 which showed the presence of a 6-ft flipper."&lt;ref name="tredre-1997"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1998 ''Sunday Times'' interview, Shuker suggested that the Loch Ness monster was losing traction, with more attention going toward large cat sightings, stating, "They're more tangible," and that "[a]ny scientist who these days decides to take the Loch Ness monster seriously knows that it will damage his reputation."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Shuker's 2003 book ''The Beasts that Hide from Man'', Mark Bayless described the work as "thought provoking and well researched," contrasting Shuker's work favorably against other cryptozoology texts as providing a "scholarly, reader-friendly format," and addressing a wider range of cryptids that are not covered in comparable sources.&lt;ref name="bayless"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2013 review of the ''Journal of Cryptozoology'' in Brazilian journal ''Revista Piau&amp;iacute;'' was generally positive regarding Shuker's efforts at a scientific approach to documenting cryptozoological findings, noting an article which put forth a [[giant oarfish]] as the most likely candidate to explain a recent sighting, but noted the professional challenges that cryptozoological researchers seeking to document findings may face, suggesting some are met with ridicule from colleagues due to a large portion of the cryptozoological community not being scientifically regarded.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Lehideux and Isorni v. France''''' (case no. 55/1997/839/1045, application no. 24662/94, Publication 1998-VII, no. 92), was a case heard by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on punishing statements praising [[Collaborationism|collaborators]]. In a judgement handed down 23 September 1998, the court has held by fifteen votes against six that the conviction of applicants for their article in favour of [[Philippe Pétain]] was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim, but wasn't necessary in a democratic society and therefore violated Article 10 (freedom of expression).

Besides, the court has ruled that the case "does not belong to the category of clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust – whose negation or revision would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17" (Para. 47). In doing so the court has ruled that the protections in Article 17, the prohibition of abuse of rights, could restrict the right of free speech granted under Article 10.

This ruling has had a direct{{fact|date=October 2015}} influence on International treaty law. The "''[[Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime|Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems]]''" requires participating States to criminalize the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems, as well as of racist and xenophobic-motivated threats and insults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE Frequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime] by the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209153034/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE |date=February 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8, Section 1 of the protocol specifically covers the denial of [[the Holocaust]] and other genocides recognised as such by other international courts set up since 1945 by relevant international legal instruments. The [[Council of Europe]] ''Explanatory Report'' of the protocol states "European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the denial or revision of “clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust – […] would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17” of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|ECHR]] (see in this context the Lehideux and Isorni judgment of 23 September 1998)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800d37ae Explanatory Report on the additional protocol to the convention on cybercrime] para. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licinia''' is the name used by [[ancient Roman women]] of the ''[[Licinia (gens)|gens Licinia]]'', including

*'''Licinia''' (flourished 188 BC–180 BC) was the daughter of Gaius Licinius Varus and the sister of [[Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 171 BC)]] and Gaius Licinius Crassus (consul 168 BC).  She married Publius Mucius Scaevola (consul 175 BC) and bore him at least two sons [[Publius Mucius Scaevola]] and [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus]]. The younger son was adopted by her elder brother as his heir. Both sons were well-educated and both became Pontifex Maximus successively.
*'''Licinia''' (died 153 BC), a woman killed by her relatives in 153 BC for allegedly murdering her husband Claudius Asellus; another woman similarly accused was Publicia, wife of the consul Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 154 BC). Both women assigned real estate as bail to the urban [[praetor]], but were killed (strangled) by their relatives before coming to trial. Sources: Livy: [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae048.html#48 Periochae 48'c-d];  [[Valerius Maximus]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius Maximus/6*.html#3.8 6.3'8]
* Two daughters of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus]] (consul and [[Pontifex Maximus]]) by his wife Claudia, sister of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 143 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]]:
**'''Licinia Major''' (''Major'' Latin for ''the elder'', flourished 2nd century BC), was married to Gaius Sulpicius [[Galba]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070326024635/http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_dynasties/Antiquite/Rome_et_Constantinople/Gentes/L_Gentes.htm]
**'''Licinia Minor''' (''Minor'' Latin for ''the younger'', flourished 2nd century BC), also known as '''Licinia Crassi'''. A younger daughter, she was the wife of [[Gaius Gracchus]]. Her dowry was seized temporarily by the Senate when her husband's property was confiscated, but eventually restored after an appeal to her uncle [[Publius Mucius Scaevola]] the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] is wrong in believing that Licinia lost her dowry permanently; what was confiscated was her husband's property, and she had to sue to reclaim her dowry. The suit also definitely establishes Gracchus's wife's name as Licinia. Radin, Max. "The Wife of Gaius Gracchus and Her Dowry", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CP/8/3/Licinias_Dowry*.html ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul., 1913), pp. 354-356];&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two daughters of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]] and his wife [[Laelia Minor]], herself a daughter of  [[Gaius Laelius Sapiens]], consul in 140 BC).  Both sisters and their mother were known for their pure Latin.
**'''Licinia Major''' (''Major'' Latin for ''the elder'') the elder daughter of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]] and his wife Laelia, she was married to Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, son of the consul of 111 BC and grandson of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio]], consul in 138 BC and [[Pontifex Maximus]].  She had at least two surviving sons, of whom the elder was adopted by her father as his heir Lucius Licinius Crassus Scipio and the younger was adopted by her husband's cousin [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]], a close friend of dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. This son is known to history as Metellus Scipio (see [[Caecilius Metellus]]) - Caesar's ineffectual military and political rival and Pompey's last father-in-law.  His daughter was [[Cornelia Metella]].[http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_dynasties/Antiquite/Rome_et_Constantinople/Gentes/L_Gentes.htm]
**'''Licinia Minor''' the other daughter  of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]] and his wife Laelia. She was married to [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], according to both Plutarch and Cicero.
*'''Licinia''', a [[Vestal Virgin]], condemned in 114 BC or 113 BC by the famous jurist [[Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla]] (consul 127 BC) along with Marcia and Aemilia, for unchastity.
*'''Licinia Crassa''' (flourished 2nd century BC &amp; 1st century BC), noted for her beauty; the wife firstly of [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]], a future consul and [[Pontifex Maximus]], who became notorious for her adultery with another consul [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos]]. Metellus Nepos divorced his wife to marry Licinia a week later, after she had been divorced by her husband and thus disgraced in Roman society.  The couple later had two sons, both of them consuls. By her first husband, she was also mother of [[Mucia Tertia]], triumvir [[Pompey]]'s third wife.
*'''Licinia''' (flourished 1st century BC), a [[Vestal Virgin]] who was courted by her kinsman triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] who wanted her property. This relationship gave rise to rumors. Plutarch says: "And yet when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property." [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html] Licinia became a Vestal Virgin in 85 BC and remained a Vestal until 61 BC.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070607010657/http://www.uni-potsdam.de/u/klassphilol/vest.htm]
*'''Licinia''' (flourished 1st century BC &amp; 1st century) was a daughter of the consul in 14 BC and governor [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 14 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives]] and sister of Roman Senator [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi]]. She married [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul 27)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] who became consul in 27 and was the mother of [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]], the leader of the Pisonian Conspiracy in 65.
*'''Licinia Magna''', daughter of the consul [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi]] and [[Scribonia (daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo consul 16)|Scribonia]] (a descendant of [[Pompey]]).&lt;ref name="Syme, p.578"&gt;Syme, ''The Roman Revolution'', p.578&lt;/ref&gt; She married the Roman Senator [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul 57)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]],&lt;ref name="Syme, p.578"/&gt; who served as one of the consuls in 57.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'', p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Piso was later killed by Roman emperor [[Vespasian]] as an enemy of the emperor. Licinia and Piso had a daughter called Calpurnia who married Calpurnius Piso Galerianus son of [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]] (co-consul in 41 with [[Claudius]]).&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History''.

The [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] (TPS) graduated the following notable alumni who made significant contributions to the aerospace field. The school's mission is to produce experimental [[test pilot]]s, flight [[Test Engineer|test engineer]]s, and flight test [[Flight officer|navigators]] to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems.&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p9&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was established on September 9, 1944, as the Flight Test Training Unit at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] (AFB) in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=TPS_History&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School History |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6586 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231218/http://www.edwards.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6586 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |accessdate=2017-04-17 |publisher=United States Air Force |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951, to its present location at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=TPS_History/&gt; Edwards AFB is the home of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.&lt;ref name=EAFB&gt;{{cite web | title = Edwards Air Force Base | url = http://www.edwards.af.mil/ | publisher = United States Air Force | accessdate = 2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School expanded its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots.&lt;ref name=TPS50_p233&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond | page = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era were selected for the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the [[North American X-15|X-15]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], and [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] programs.&lt;ref name=FAP&gt;{{cite book | first = J. | last = Young | title = Forging Aerospace Power for America | pages = 3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries.&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p19&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog | page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School]], the United Kingdom's [[Empire Test Pilots' School]], and France's [[EPNER]].&lt;ref name=TPSCat_p18&gt;{{cite book | title = USAF TPS Graduate Course Catalog | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Greyeyes Reid'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (November 14, 1920 – March 31, 2011) was a Canadian World War II servicewoman. A [[Cree]] from the [[Muskeg Lake Cree Nation]] in [[Saskatchewan]], she was the first [[First Nations]] woman to enlist in the [[Canadian Armed Forces]]. After joining the [[Canadian Women’s Army Corps]] (CWAC) in 1942, she became the subject of an internationally famous army publicity photograph, and was sent overseas to serve in London, England, where she was introduced to public figures such as [[George VI]] and his daughter [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]]. Greyeyes remained in London until being discharged in 1946, after which she returned to Canada.  

==Early life==
Mary Greyeyes was born November 14, 1920, in the [[Muskeg Lake Cree Nation]] reserve in [[Marcelin, Saskatchewan]]. She had ten siblings: six sisters and four brothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-greyeyes/|title=Mary Greyeyes Reid|author=Conn, Heather|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised by her widowed grandmother, Sarah Greyeyes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obittree.com/obituary/ca/british-columbia/vancouver/kearney-funeral-services/mary-reid/714636/|title=Mary Reid Obituary – Vancouver, BC {{!}} ObitTree|website=obittree.com|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was five years old, Greyeyes was sent to the St. Michael's [[Residential School System|residential school]] in [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan]]. The school only taught students up to grade 8, but Greyeyes managed to obtain additional tutoring in later years from a nun at the school, attending evening lessons while helping with cooking and cleaning during the day.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; She was known for her eagerness for knowledge.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Enlistment ===
[[File:Greyeyes david.jpg|left|thumb|Greyeyes' brother, David. He was decorated for his wartime service, returned home to become Chief of the Muskeg Lake reserve, and later became the first Indigenous regional director for [[Indian Affairs and Northern Development|Indian Affairs]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/those-who-served/aboriginal-veterans/native-soldiers/greyeyes|title=Greyeyes – Native Soldiers – Foreign Battlefields – Aboriginal-Canadian Veterans – Remembering those who served – Remembrance|last=Canada|first=Veterans Affairs|website=www.veterans.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|162x162px]]The Muskeg Lake Cree Nation reserve had been heavily impacted by the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]], and by the early 1940s there was little work for youth on the reserve.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Greyeyes' favourite brother, David Greyeyes, left the reserve in search of work to help support the family,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and in 1940, David enlisted in the [[Canadian Army]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Greyeyes subsequently decided to do the same, seeing enlistment as a valuable chance to expand her own knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271429730|title=Invisible women : WWII Aboriginal servicewomen in Canada|author=Poulin, Grace|year=2007|publisher=D.G.

Whitney|location=Winnipeg|pages=145-147, 151, 156|oclc=181078599|editor-last2=Mantle|editor-first2=Craig Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 1942, Greyeyes travelled to [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] in order to take the test for enlistment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service]] and the women's division of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] both required that new recruits be "a British subject, of white race", but recruitment for the [[Canadian Women's Army Corps]] (CWAC) was open to citizens of "any of the United Nations" and all races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13770625|title=They're still women after all : the Second World War and Canadian womanhood|last=1938-|first=Pierson, Ruth Roach,|date=1986|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|year=|isbn=0771069588|location=Toronto, Ont.|pages=113|oclc=13770625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Greyeyes worried that her grade 8 certification from the residential school would be inadequate, she passed the CWAC test and was accepted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Upon completing the test, Greyeyes became the first First Nations woman to join the Canadian Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/lestweforget/Women-and-war-341784012.html|title=Women and war|author=Rollason, Kevin|date=November 7, 2015|work=Winnipeg Free Press|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

===Photograph===
Shortly after enlisting, Greyeyes became the subject of an army publicity photograph that showed her kneeling in her army uniform to receive a "blessing" from a man dressed in Plains Cree Chief regalia. 

During the war, [[Member of the Legislative Assembly#Canada|Canadian MLA]] and public relations officer [[Louis LeBourdais]] often visited the training bases with photographers to take pictures of new CWAC recruits for newspaper publication.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35945966|title=One gal's army|author=Ward|first=Sue|publisher=Caitlin Press|year=1996|isbn=0920576605|location=Prince George, B.C.|pages=61-63|oclc=35945966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, not long after she had enlisted, Greyeyes was approached and asked to participate in a photo-shoot to encourage more women to join the army. Harry Ball, a Cree man and [[World War I]] veteran from the [[Piapot First Nation]], was convinced to pose for the photo in Plains Chief regalia. He was not an actual Chief himself at the time, though he would become one later, and had never met Greyeyes before.  Ball had to cobble together a costume from borrowed items. In return for the photo-shoot, which was staged on Piapot land, Ball was paid $20, while Greyeyes received a free lunch and a new uniform.&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The photograph appeared in the ''[[Winnipeg Tribune]]''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the [[Regina Leader Post|''Regina Leader-Post'']], and soon spread overseas to England, appearing in multiple British newspapers.&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt;

For decades, the photo would be identified only by a caption reading "Unidentified Indian princess getting blessing from her chief and father to go fight in the war".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This sixteen-word caption contained no fewer than five inaccuracies.  Greyeyes was not a "princess," a title European settlers often bestowed upon young women related to chiefs.  Ball was not "her chief," since they were from different tribes.  Ball was in fact not a "chief" at all.  He was not her father.  And there was no actual blessing being bestowed - only the hasty facsimile of one for the lens.

It was only around 1995 that the record was finally corrected, when Greyeyes's daughter-in-law, Melanie Fahlman Reid, learned that the photo hung in the [[Canadian War Museum]] with the incorrect caption.  Reid, who had discussed the photo personally with Greyeyes, provided a more accurate explanation of the photograph from her mother-in-law's recollection.&lt;ref name="tyee"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2012/08/07/Canadian-War-Photograph/|title=What Does This Photo Say?|author=Reid, Melanie Fahlman|date=August 7, 2012|publisher=The Tyee|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Service and overseas work ===
[[File:CWAC arrival in England (4112917309).jpg|thumb|277x277px|CWAC servicewomen arrive in England during World War II]]
Although officially integrated as part of the Canadian Army, CWAC did not train its members for combat roles, instead training women to support the war efforts through cooking, laundering, and clerical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/learn/dispatches/the-canadian-womens-army-corps-1941-1946/#tabs|title=The Canadian Women’s Army Corps, 1941-1946 {{!}} Dispatches {{!}} Learn {{!}} Canadian War Museum|website=www.warmuseum.ca|language=en-US|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greyeyes was sent overseas to [[Aldershot, England]], to work at the Aldershot Base Laundry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She disliked her position there, and requested a transfer. Her superior tried to sabotage her transfer by writing the false statement "Does not speak English" on Greyeyes' papers, but she was granted her transfer anyway and went to work as a cook in the war centre at London. The Canadian Military Headquarters, in London was at 2–4 [[Cockspur Street]] next to [[Canada House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2–4 Cockspur Street: Canadian Military Headquarters (1939–1947)|url=http://www.canadahousecollection.co.uk/the-stories/24-cockspur-street-canadian-military-headquarters-19391947|website=canadahousecollection.co.uk|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of the "Indian princess" photo, Greyeyes became famous in London as "the Indian" who had joined the army in support of the Empire and its colonies, receiving letters from strangers offering to marry her. She was even introduced to [[King George VI]], [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt; Greyeyes was photographed with a number of public figures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although Greyeyes sometimes encountered racism while in service – once resulting in her boarding outside the barracks – she found her overall army experience a positive one, later commenting that her wartime years had been "the best days of her life". She enjoyed the publicity she gained from being in the famous photo.&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt; Her love of learning was often noticed by others. One of her fellow corps members later recalled that Greyeyes was "a lovely young woman ... who spent much of her spare time reading and studying literature."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Second photo-shoot ===
According to an interview with her daughter-in-law, Mary Greyeyes was approached by government officials for a second publicity photo towards the end of the war. It was an election year, and Indigenous people did not have the right to vote in Canadian elections at the time, but Indigenous veterans from World War II were being offered the choice to give up their treaty rights and Indian status in return for voting rights. Greyeyes was urged to visit a polling station and have her picture taken while voting. Instead of agreeing to the photo-shoot this time, she pointed out the unfairness of the voting laws:&lt;blockquote&gt;So Mary says to them, she says, "Can my mom vote?" And they said, "No, she didn't fight in the war." She said, "Well, what about my cousins over there, can they vote?" And they said no. They said, "C'mon Mary, you gotta come, we've got the photographer." And she said, "All those years, I said nothing. Now I'm saying ''no''."&lt;ref name="tyee" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was only in 1960 that all First Nations people were granted the right to vote in Canadian federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/indigenous-suffrage/|title=Indigenous Suffrage|last=Leslie|first=John F.|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war life==
When the war ended, Greyeyes continued working in London until she was discharged in 1946. Afterwards, she returned to Canada and went back to the Muskeg Lake reserve to spend time with family. She met her future husband, Alexander Reid, in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. They moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and had two children. Greyeyes worked as a restaurant cook in Victoria, later finding employment as an industrial seamstress when the family moved to [[Vancouver]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 1994, Greyeyes attended a reunion of over 400 CWAC members in [[Vermilion, Alberta]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She received a pension from the [[Department of Veterans Affairs (Canada)|Department of Veterans Affairs]] for her wartime service. In 2003, in recognition that post-war benefits had been poorly managed and delivered to Indigenous servicemen and women, the Canadian government paid compensation packages to Greyeyes and other surviving Indigenous veterans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Death==
Greyeyes died on March 31, 2011, in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was 90 years old. Greyeyes was buried on the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation reserve.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Max Simon Nordau''' (born ''Simon Maximilian Südfeld''; July 29, 1849 – January 23, 1923), was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader, [[physician]], [[author]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=EwjPZHlDd60C&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=nordau+political+genius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c2J3uQDpTn&amp;sig=Yz3NQDAc6h5N9hr4KvMxdP2LLoc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtl82_wbHXAhXEJFAKHfsCC_0Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Social Science and the Politics of Modern Jewish Identity, Mitchell Bryan Hart]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-founder of the [[World Zionist Organization]] together with [[Theodor Herzl]], and president or vice president of several Zionist congresses.

As a social critic, he wrote  ''The Conventional Lies of Our Civilisation'' (1883), ''[[Degeneration (Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892), and ''Paradoxes'' (1896). Although not his most popular or successful work whilst alive, ''Degeneration'' is the book most often remembered and cited today.

==Biography==
Simon (Simcha) Maximilian Südfeld (later Max Nordau) was born in [[Pest (city)|Pest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. His father, Gabriel Südfeld, was a rabbi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/u184/baldwin/liberalism_nationalism_and_degeneration.pdf Liberalism, Nationalism and Degeneration: The Case of Max Nordau]&lt;/ref&gt; but earned his livelihood as a Hebrew tutor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271723205_Issues_of_Assimilation_Language_and_Identity_in_the_Lives_of_Young_Max_Nordau_and_Tivadar_Herzl/fulltext/55e6dae908ae3ad5dab2a906/271723205_Issues_of_Assimilation_Language_and_Identity_in_the_Lives_of_Young_Max_Nordau_and_Tivadar_Herzl.pdf?origin=publication_detail Issues of Assimilation, Language and Identity in the Lives of Young Max
Nordau and Tivadar Herzl]&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Orthodox Jew]], Nordau attended a Jewish elementary school and earned a medical degree from the [[University of Budapest]] in 1872. He then traveled for six years, visiting the principal countries of [[Europe]]. He changed his name before going to Berlin in 1873. In 1878, he began the practice of medicine in Budapest. In 1880 he went to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=Nordau, Max Simon|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Paris]] as a correspondent for ''Die [[Neue Freie Presse]]'', and it was in Paris that he spent most of his life.

Before entering the university, he had begun his literary career at Budapest as contributor and dramatic critic for ''Der Zwischenact''. Subsequently, he was an editorial writer and correspondent for several other newspapers. His newspaper writings were collected and furnished the material for his earlier books. He was a disciple of [[Cesare Lombroso]].&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

Nordau was an example of a fully assimilated and acculturated European Jew. Despite being raised religious, Nordau was an agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Triumph of Survival: The Story of the Jews in the Modern Era 1650-1990|year=1990|publisher=Mesorah Publications|isbn=9780899064987|page=238|author=Berel Wein|quote=Like Herzl, Nordau was an agnostic, if not an atheist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married  a [[Christian]] woman of Danish origin. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.4886400 Unrequited love, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his [[Hungary|Hungarian]] background, he felt affiliated to [[Germany|German]] culture, writing in an autobiographical sketch, "When I reached the age of fifteen, I left the Jewish way of life and the study of the [[Torah]]... [[Judaism]] remained a mere memory and since then I have always felt as a German and as a German only." Max Nordau was the father of painter [[Maxa Nordau]] (1897–1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artcult.fr/_Dictionnaire+des+peintres+juifs/Catalogue/art-20-1306696.htm?Groupe=2&amp;Artiste=N%25 | title = Dictionnaire des peintres juifs |trans-title=Dictionary of Jewish painters | publisher = ArtCult | accessdate = 16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordau's conversion to Zionism was eventually triggered by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Many Jews, amongst them [[Theodor Herzl]], saw in the Dreyfus Affair evidence of the universality of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/54845739.pdf Max Nordau and the Making of Racial Zionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordau went on to play a major role in the [[World Zionist Organisation]]; indeed Nordau's relative fame certainly helped bring attention to the Zionist movement. He can be credited with giving the organisation a democratic character.

When [[World War I]] broke out he, a native of Hungary, was accused of German sympathies. He denied the charge and afterward went to reside in [[Madrid]]. An attempt to assassinate him was made in the latter part of 1903.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

== Zionism ==
=== Dreyfus affair ===

Nordau's conversion to Zionism is in many ways typical of the rise of Zionism amongst Western European Jewry.  The [[Dreyfus affair]] was central to [[Theodor Herzl]]'s conviction that Zionism was now necessary.  Herzl's views were formed during his time in France where he recognised the universality of antisemitism; the Dreyfus Affair cemented his belief in the failure of assimilation.  Nordau also witnessed the Paris mob outside the École Militaire crying "à morts les juifs!".

His role of friend and advisor to Herzl, who was working as the correspondent for the Viennese ''Neue Freie Presse'', began here in Paris. This trial went beyond a miscarriage of justice and in Herzl's words "contained the wish of the overwhelming majority in France, to damn a Jew, and in this one Jew, all Jews."  Whether or not the [[antisemitism]] manifested in France during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] was indicative of the majority of the French or simply a very vocal minority is open to debate.  However the very fact that such sentiment had manifested itself in [[France]] was particularly significant.  This was the country often seen as the model of the modern [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] age, that had given Europe the Great Revolution and beginnings of [[Jewish Emancipation]].

=== Failure of emancipation ===

Nordau's work as a critic of European civilisation and where it was heading certainly contributed to his eventual role in Zionism. One of the central tenets of Nordau's beliefs was evolution, in all things, and he concluded that emancipation was not born out of evolution. French rationalism of the 18th century, based on pure logic, demanded that all men be treated equally.  Nordau perceived Jewish Emancipation the result of 'a regular equation: Every man is born with certain rights; the Jews are human beings, consequently the Jews are born to own the rights of man.'  This Emancipation was written in the statute books of Europe, but contrasted with popular social consciousness.  It was this which explained the apparent contradiction of equality before the law.  Yet the existence of antisemitism, and in particular 'racial' antisemitism, was no longer based on old religious bigotry.  Nordau cited England as an exception to this continental antisemitism that proved the rule. "In England, Emancipation is a truth…It had already been completed in the heart before legislation expressly confirmed it." Only if Emancipation came from changes within society, as opposed to abstract ideas imposed upon society, could it be a reality.  This rejection of the accepted idea of Emancipation was not based entirely on the Dreyfus Affair.  It had manifested itself much earlier in ''Die Konventionellen Lügen der Kulturmenschheit'' reviling 'degenerate' and 'lunatic' antisemitism in ''Die Entartung.''

===Muscular Judaism===
Nordau also, at the 1898 Zionist Congress, coined the term "[[muscular Judaism]]" (''muskel-Judenthum'') as a descriptor of a Jewish culture and religion which directed its adherents to reach for certain moral and corporeal ideals which, through discipline, agility and strength, would result in a stronger, more physically assured Jew who would outshine the long-held stereotype of the weak, intellectually sustained Jew. He would further explore the concept of the "muscle Jew" in a 1900 article of the [[Jewish Gymnastics Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NCR5wsB2j8IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22muscular+Judaism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=43PjAVECAk&amp;sig=jUBnOyEUkkjjytZVBT4q051aoj0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3MWqS_aKOYaXtgf_4o2SCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = Muscular Judaism: the Jewish Body and the Politics of Regeneration | first = Todd Samuel | last = Presner | publisher = Routledge | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780415771788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Zionist Congress ==
[[File:JNF KKL Stamp Max Nordau (1916) OeNB 15758264.jpg|thumb|150px|Nordau stamp issued by [[Jewish National Fund]], 1916]]
Nordau was central to the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congresses]] which played such a vital part in shaping what Zionism would become. Herzl had favoured the idea of a Jewish newspaper and an elitist "Society of Jews" to spread the ideas of Zionism. It was Nordau, convinced that Zionism had to at least appear democratic, despite the impossibility of representing all Jewish groups, who persuaded Herzl of the need for an assembly. This appearance of democracy certainly helped counter accusations that the "Zionists represented no one but themselves." There would be eleven such Congresses in all. The first, which Nordau organised, was in Basle, 29–31 August 1897. His fame as an intellectual helped draw attention to the project. Indeed, the fact that Max Nordau, the trenchant essayist and journalist, was a Jew came as a revelation for many. Herzl obviously took centre stage, making the first speech at the Congress; Nordau followed him with an assessment of the Jewish condition in Europe. Nordau used statistics to paint a portrait of the dire straits of Eastern Jewry and also expressed his belief in the destiny of Jewish people as a democratic nation state, free of what he saw as the constraints of Emancipation.

Nordau's speeches to the [[World Zionist Congress]] reexamined the Jewish people, in particular stereotypes of the Jews. He fought against the tradition of seeing the Jews as merchants or business people, arguing that most modern financial innovations such as insurance had been invented by gentiles. He saw the Jewish people as having a unique gift for politics, a calling which they were unable to fulfil without their own nation-state. Whereas Herzl favoured the idea of an elite forming policy, Nordau insisted the Congress have a democratic nature of some sort, calling for votes on key topics. According to a 2004 article in the left-wing newspaper [[Haaretz]], Nordau was at one time a staunch eugenicist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/do-not-have-children-if-they-won-t-be-healthy-1.124913] in ''Future Human Evolution'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordau died in [[Paris, France]] in 1923.

==''Degeneration'' (1892)==
Nordau's major work ''Entartung'' (''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'') is a moralistic attack on what he believed to be [[degenerate art]], as well as a polemic against the effects of a range of the rising social phenomena of the period, such as rapid urbanization and its perceived effects on the human body.

In ''Réflexions sur la question gay'' (translated into English as ''Insult and the Making of the Gay Self'' &lt;ref&gt;''Insult and the Making of the Gay Self'' (originally ''Réflexions sur la question gay'' (1999)). Translated by Michael Lucey. Duke University Press, 440 pages. July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Didier Eribon]] refers to a whole section in Nordau’s book targeting [[Oscar Wilde]] in aggressive terms: "Wilde loves immorality, sin, and crime". 
According to Eribon, the two volumes of ''Degeneration'' are centred around a description of the artistic and literary currents of an "end-of-century" that was leading society to "ruin". 
Nordau attacks [[symbolism (arts)|symbolists]], [[mysticism|mystics]], [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[Wagner]]ism, [[Aestheticism]], [[Decadentism]]. 
[[Joris-Karl Huysmans|Huysmans]] and [[Émile Zola|Zola]] are also targeted by him as "[[neurosis|neurotics]]" and "the worst kind of enemies of society", against whom the latter had "a duty to defend itself". He sustained that society was "at the highest of a serious intellectual epidemic, some kind of Black Death of degeneration and hysteria, such that it is only natural to hear a generalized, anguished questioning: ‘What is going to happen?’" 
Therefore, he called upon [[judge]]s, [[teacher]]s, [[politician]]s, all those who wished to protect [[civilization]], to organize repression and censorship. 
As for [[psychiatrist]]s, their role would be predominant in such academia of "honest people" in charge of condemning "works that speculate on [[immorality]]". Any artist whom this small cluster of "the most qualified men of the people" might dislike would be doomed, because in such case "both the man and his work would be annihilated».&lt;ref name="Réflexions sur la question gay"&gt;{{cite book| url = | title = Réflexions sur la question gay | first = Didier | last = Eribon | year = 1999 | publisher = Fayard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordau’s ''Degeneration'' is cited by [[William James]] in his lecture on Neurology and Religion at the beginning of ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''. James mocks the author for his "bulky book" on the grounds that he exemplifies the then-current school of medical materialism, stating that Nordau "has striven to [[wikt:impugn|impugn]] the value of works of genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art, namely, as he himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical arguments".&lt;ref name="The Varieties of Religious Experience"&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/621/pg621.txt | title = The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature | first = William | last = James | year = 1902 | publisher = Longmans, Green &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration==

'''Mel Clarke''' (born on 2 September 1982) is an [[England|English]] [[Target archery|competitive archer]].

==Personal life==
Clarke was born on 2 September 1982 in [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]], England.&lt;ref name=bpa&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Clarke|url=http://www.paralympics.org.uk/gb/athletes/mel-clarke|publisher=British Paralympic Association|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the age of 11 she has used a wheelchair because of an arthritic condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudd|first=Melissa|title=Clarke takes aim at Beijing medal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7561768.stm|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=19 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Lyme disease]] caused her to lose sight in one eye.&lt;ref name=Barkham&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkham|first=Patrick|title=Paralympics 2012: Danielle Brown retains title in Great Britain one-two|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/04/paralympics-2012-danielle-brown-great-britain?newsfeed=true|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archery==
Clarke first tried [[archery]] as a member of the [[Girl Guides]] in 1998. She took part in her first international competition in 2002.&lt;ref name=bpa/&gt;

In 2003, she became the first disabled archer from Europe to take part in an able-bodied event at international level, however it was during this event that she contracted Lyme disease. She lost sight in her aiming eye and had to remodel her shooting style to compensate, developing a stance with her head tilted back to make best use of her working eye.&lt;ref name=Barkham/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott-Elliot|first=Robin|title=Archery: Brown holds her nerve to win battle of Britain|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympics/archery-brown-holds-her-nerve-to-win-battle-of-britain-8104947.html|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], held in [[Beijing]], China, she won a bronze medal in the [[Archery at the 2008 Summer Paralympics - Women's individual compound|women's individual compound]] event. Having been defeated by fellow British competitor [[Danielle Brown]] in the semifinal with a score of 113-105, Clarke beat Turkey's [[Gulbin Su]] in the bronze playoff to win the medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archery gold for Brown and Stubbs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7613773.stm|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=13 September 2008|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, she won a gold medal in the team event and a silver in the individual at the World Championships held in the Czech Republic. She was overwhelmed 114-107 by teammate and reigning Paralympic Champion Danielle Brown in the final of the individual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brown retains world archery title|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/8215011.stm|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=22 August 2009|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 2010 European Championships Clarke did not rank highly in the individual event, but won a silver medal with the women's compound team. Teammates Danielle Brown and Pippa Britton won the individual gold and silver respectively. Clarke also failed to make the team for the 2011 World Championships, beaten to the mark by Danielle Brown, Pippa Britton and Sarah Beamish.

Clarke was selected to compete for [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]], United Kingdom.

The first two sets were tied before Brown won the third and Clarke the fourth to force a fifth set. Clarke was left needing to score a ten with her final arrow to take the match to a shoot-off, however she was unable to capitalise on this and scored a seven meaning she won the silver medal.&lt;ref name=Barkham/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/19488361|title=Paralympics 2012: Mel Clarke overjoyed after winning archery silver

'''Mohamed Rabie Meftah''' (born 5 May 1985 in [[Tizi Ouzou]]) is an [[Algeria]]n [[Association football|footballer]]. He currently plays for [[USM Alger]] in the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]].

==Personal==
Meftah comes from a family of footballers. His cousin [[Mahieddine Meftah]] was a former [[Algeria national football team|Algerian international]] and played for [[JS Kabylie]] and [[USM Alger]]. Another cousin, [[Rahim Meftah]], was also a former player who played for the two clubs, as well as [[MO Constantine]]. Two other cousins, [[Chaâbane Meftah]] and [[Jugurtha Meftah]] are also footballers and currently play for [[JS Kabylie]].

==Club career==

===JS Kabylie===
A product of the [[JS Kabylie]] junior ranks, Meftah was promoted to the first team in 2004. After a couple of seasons, he became a regular starter, forcing [[Algeria national football team|Algerian international]] [[Slimane Raho]] to the bench, and eventually out the door. In 2008, he was made captain of the club, replacing midfielder [[Chérif Abdeslam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article15263.html|title=Rabie Meftah capitaine de la JS Kabylie|website=www.algerie-dz.com|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meftah was chosen as the top player in the [[Algerian Championnat National]] for the 2008–09 season in a vote conducted by sports daily newspaper ''Maracana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200905210373.html Les Oscars de Maracana : Mohamed Rabie Meftah (JSK) élu meilleur joueur algérien de l'année]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2009–10 season, and despite the club qualifying for the [[2010 CAF Champions League group stage|group stage]] of the [[2010 CAF Champions League]], Meftah announced that was he leaving the club.

===JSM Béjaïa===
On June 20, 2010, Meftah signed a one-year contract with [[JSM Béjaïa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jsmbejaia.com/3articles/news3.html  Meftah officiellement à la JSMB pour 1 année]&lt;/ref&gt;

===USM Alger===
On July 12, 2010, Meftah signed a two-year contract with [[USM Alger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebuteur.com/ligue-1/actualites/usma-meftah-pour-deux-ans-a-lusma USMA : Meftah pour deux ans à l’USMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On August 15, 2006, Meftah made his debut for the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian National Team]] in a friendly against [[Gabon national football team|Gabon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/joueur.php?joueur_id=1060&amp;saison_id=15 La Fiche de Mohamed Rabie MEFTAH]&lt;/ref&gt; Meftah has made five appearances in total for the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian National Team]] since his debut in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DZ Foot|title=La Fiche de Mohmamed Rabie MEFTAH|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/joueur.php?joueur_id=1060&amp;saison_id=14|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected as a reserve player by [[Rabah Saadane]] for the [[2010 African Cup of Nations]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] but did not make the final squad both times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-5449/-font-color-red-can-les-23-4-de-reserve-pour-l-angola-font/ CAN : Les 23 (+4 de réserve) pour l'Angola ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-6443/-font-color-red-cm-2010-les-noms-des-5-reservistes-reveles-font/ CM 2010 : Les noms des 5 réservistes révélés]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandipeddi Chenchiah''' (1886–1959), spelt also as '''Pandippedi Chenchiah''', a second generation [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] convert to [[Christianity]], was a [[jurist]], [[South Indian]] [[Christian]] [[theologian]], and radical thinker of ''Rethinking Christianity in India'' group for Indianisation of Christianity.

==Biography==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Chenchiah was born into a Hindu Brahmin home in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh (India), in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;V. Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible in the Writings of Pandipeddi Chenchiah" (Doctoral dissertation, Senate of Serampore, 1988), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the oldest of 12 children who grew up together.&lt;ref&gt;Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible," 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, Chenchiah converted to Christianity, along with his family and he was baptized by William Miller, a Scottish Missionary.&lt;ref&gt;Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible," 12, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Chenchiah went on to marry Matilda Raghaviah, and had 1 son and 4 daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible," 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chenchiah got his education from [[Madras Christian College]] that grew enormously under [[William Miller (missionary)|William Miller]] — [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[missionary]], principal. He received a degree in [[philosophy]] in 1906, where he received a Gold medal for "proficiency in Philosophy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible," 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He then did his [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree (BL) in 1908, and a [[Master of Laws]] degree (ML) in 1913, from Madras Law College.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He started his practice as an [[advocate]] of [[High Court]] of [[Madras]], served as [[government]] servant in various offices.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="past"/&gt; One source states that Chenchiah became the [[Judge]] of the district of Pudukottah, in the Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu), in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Devasahayam, "Role of the Bible," 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source provides a later date, saying that Chenchiah became a Judge in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wagner, ''Erstgestalten einer einheimischen Theologie in Sudindien,'' (Munich: Kaiser, 1963), 13. For brief discussion of this difference see Kumar, ''What is Religion?: A Theological Answer,'' (Pickwick Publications, 2013), 118&lt;/ref&gt; According to V. Devasahayam, Chenchiah "retired from that position after refusing to yield to Government pressure to pass a verdict in their favor."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Devasayaham, "Role of the Bible," 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Chenchiah rejoined the Madras High Court, and became the Chief Examiner of the Law exams for the Madras and Andhra Universities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Chenchiah was a "voracious reader," and "it was through this interest in philosophy and ethics that Chenchiah grew in prominence in Christian circles."&lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 119"&gt;Kumar, ''What is Religion?,'' 119.&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued "active friendships with people of others faiths" and was involved in several formal and informal inter-faith discussions.&lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 119"/&gt;

Chenchiah "wrote for two prominent Christian journals, ''Guardian'' and ''The Pilgrim''." &lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 119"/&gt; Chenchiah served as the editor of ''The Pilgrim'' from 1949 to 1952.&lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 119"/&gt; He was also on the editorial committee of the ''Christian Patriot'', an Indian Christian nationalistic organ, between 1916 and 1924. He was a member of Board of Directors of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]](YMCA), [[Madras]](''present'' [[Chennai]]). He also served as a member of Executive committee of the National Missionary Society. He was one of the founders of ''Madras Christo Samaj'' in Madras Presidency, and has been actively associated with the [[Bangalore]] Continuation conference for the discussion association with problems of Indian Christian life.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt; Apart from this, Chenchiah represented the South Indian Union Church at the International Missionary Conference at Jerusalem (1928) and was listed as a "Judge" at the International Missionary Conference at Tambaram (1938).&lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 119"/&gt;

His most significant association was with the "Madras Rethinking Group." Some have pointed out that it was William Miller, who played a major role in encouraging Chenchiah and his brother-in-law [[Vengal Chakkarai|Vengal Chakkarai Chetti]] to rethink Christianity within the Indian context, possibly in an effort to integrate [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcc.edu.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=177 |title= Our focus through Institute for Advanced Christian Studies is to be academic with the commitment to raise Christian leadership in the present context of our society. |quote= Justice Pandippedi Chenchiah, a Judge of Pudukottai and Vengal Chakkarai, the Major of Madras Corporation in 1941 were students of William Miller and became practising Christians. |publisher= mcc.edu.in |accessdate=

Chenchiah died "due to a short illness on April 19, 1959, in Madras."&lt;ref name="Kumar, What is Religion?, 120"/&gt;

==Writings==
Chenchiah was a prolific writer and wrote on several themes, but mainly about rethinking Christianity in the Indian context. His literary contributions are in the form of numerous articles he contributed to the periodicals, "The Guardian," "The Patriot," and two books he co-authored with others, "Rethinking Christianity in India," and "Āsramās Past and Present." Two of his most significant works are long reviews of two books. The first is his review written as an Indian reply to Hendrik Kraemer’s Barthian broadside, "The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World," appeared in 1938 on the eve of the International Missionary Council’s world conference at Tambaram, Madras, South India. This review is included in the book "Rethinking Christianity in India." His other major review of Marcus Ward’s "Our Theological Task" appeared in The Guardian 1947.&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Joseph, ''Indian Interpretation of the Holy Spirit''. Delhi: ISPCK, 2007, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
Chenchiah is one of the Christian theologians featured in [[Robin Boyd (theologian)|Robin Boyd]]'s ''Introduction to Indian Christian Theology.'' In it, Boyd states that Chenchiah was primarily Christological in his thinking and focussed upon the integration of Hinduism and Christianity.

===Rethinking Christianity in India===
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Chenchiah spoke against the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] [[theology]] and Church practice; inspired by the teachings of [[Aurobindo Ghose]], [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Canchupati Venkatrao Venkaswami Rao|Master C.V.V]], and also basing his thoughts on [[New Testament]], he developed a new interpretation of Christian doctrine. He was one of the founders of ''Christo Samaj of Madras'' in 1908 with an aim of coordinating the country, the church, and the mission to the supreme purpose of [[Jesus Christ]]. Its leaders, including V. Chakkarai, S.K. George, P.A. Thangasami, and others met every year in South India to discuss political, economical, and religious issues. The members of this group later came to be known as ''The Rethinking Group''.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt;

He was instrumental in the formation of ''Rethinking Christianity Group in India'', after the publication of ''Rethinking Christianity in India'', in 1938, as [[Christianity in India|Indian Christian]]'s reply to Church-centered [[missiology]] of [[Vedanayagam Samuel Azariah|V.S. Azariah]] and [[Hendrik Kraemer]]'s ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'', a [[Barthianism|Barthian theology]]. He led the group of Indian Christians along with Vengal Chakkarai, and formed ''Rethinking Christianity Group'' in [[Madras]] that argued that Indian Christian community could not ignore the common [[Hindu]] heritage, its culture, and traditions.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edinburgh2010.org/fileadmin/files/edinburgh2010/files/docs/Edinburgh%20to%20Tambaram_1.doc 
|title= Edinburgh to Tambaram:  A Paradigm Shift in  Missions, or the horizon of Missions broadened? |quote= group of Indian theologians, led by Chenchiah and Chakkarai, formed the Rethinking Christianity group in Madras, which inter alia argued that Indian Christian community could not ignore the common Hindu heritage, its culture and traditions - thinkers like Chenchiah argued that the work of the Holy Spirit transcended the boundaries of the Church, and the examples like the Ashram movement are powerful illustrations of how Christianity could relate itself to certain Indian traditions and practices. |publisher= 
edinburgh2010.org |accessdate= 22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article ''Rethinking Christianity in India'', Chenchiah countered Kraemer's understanding of religion. He believed there are two possible realities at the core of every religion; one, a pivotal personality like [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Jesus]], or [[Budha]]; two, the discovery of a truth or principle as the all-inclusive nature of [[Brahman]]. According to Chenchiah, "A religion grows up around one or both of these realities, providing different means to comprehend the principle and follow and emulate the personality."{{sic}} Though Chenchaih agreed Kraemer's belief that religion is a '''''human creation''''', both Chenchaih and Kraemer took different approaches to the study of religion; Kraemer on one hand, advocated [[missionary]]'s approach—the missionary perceives Christianity as the one means to understand God and studies other religions either out of curiosity or to affirm his conviction of Christianity's superiority - Christian revelation is the only means to understand God, an approach pivotal to the Kraemer's missiology; Chenchaiah on the other hand, being a second generation convert, seems to had grown dissatisfied with what the Church had to offer in response to the Indian context in which he lived and through which he was trying to understand the faith. He, like other Indian indigenous converts, studied other religions to rediscover the message of Christianity. In addition, Chenchiah seems to had interest in comparing religions as systems and then showing what they have in common and where they differ.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

===New Creation===
He considered [[Christianity]] to have represented a new stage in the evolution of man; hence, with the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], Christians can become one with Him, and so become a "new creature." He advocated his entire life the policy of "Christian policy"—to live Christ is to preach Christ. According to him, human history has begun a new revolutionary chapter in Jesus—the fact of Christ is the birth of a new order in creation; Christianity is not primarily a doctrine of [[salvation]] but the announcement of the advent of a new creative order in Jesus—The Christian is a new creation - The Holy Spirit is the new cosmic energy - the kingdom of God is the new order - the children of God, the new type that Christ had inaugurated.&lt;ref name="blg"&gt;

He was [[baptized]] along with his father, when he was a boy and raised as a Christian from infancy; however, he believed that the Christian faith must be open to receive new insights from Indian culture. He felt uneasy with Western concept of Church and advocated for a new indigenized '''''Christ-ism''''' from the [[gospel]]s, using his Hindu perspective.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blg"/&gt;

Critics pointed Chenchiah for giving undue weightage to the epic figures like Krishna and Rama; in spite of, being [[mythology|mythic]] figures of [[Hinduism]], yet not the core personalities in their tradition as Jesus in Christian tradition and Buddha in [[Buddhism]] tradition. Both Chenchiah and Kraemer differed the way Christian religion is differentiated with Christian faith. According to Chenchiah:&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;
{{cquote|The Church does not teach us the mystery of a new birth. It detracts our attention from the central fact. It substitutes a new scheme to realize the Kingdom of God by a reformation of this world and of becoming the children of God by repentance and faith....Dr. Kraemer thinks that Hinduism and Buddhism differ from Christianity in that they are anthropo-centric while the latter is theo-centric ... he misses the essential point--in the practice of Christianity the Church depends on human effort as much as any other religion, though in theory the doctrine of grace is stressed.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;}}

==Biography==

Miller was born in [[Flushing, New York]]&lt;ref name="94hearing" /&gt; and attended [[John Glenn High School (Huntington, New York)|John Glenn High School]] in [[Elwood, New York]].&lt;ref name="94hearing" /&gt;  Miller attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was active in the comedy troupe [[Mask and Wig]], received his B.A. ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1983, and subsequently served as a university trustee.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Penn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://www.law.washington.edu/directory/CV/Miller.pdf Curriculum Vitae of Paul Steven Miller] at University of Washington School of Law website (retrieved May 28, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  He went to [[Harvard Law School]] and received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/spotlight/civil-rights/related/miller.html "Paul Steven Miller '86 has made it his job to combat workplace discrimination"], Civil Rights Profiles at Harvard Law School website.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Miller graduated from Harvard Law, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] had not yet been adopted and [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] did not do enough; despite his academic credentials of graduating near the top of his class, Miller encountered considerable resistance in his efforts to find a job.  Initially he had over 40 firms seeking his application, but later said that he received 45 rejection letters without a single callback. He repeatedly found that law firms would show interest in him, based on his resume, and then lose interest when they discovered his height. He said that one firm told him they were afraid clients would consider his employment a "circus freak show".&lt;ref name="94hearing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lives"&gt;Betty M. Adelson, Julie Rotta, ''The Lives of Dwarfs: Their Journey from Public Curiosity Toward Social Liberation'' (Rutgers University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3548-7}}, pp.348ff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym5x3mq2p7EC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=isbn:9780813535487&amp;ei=Hx0fSuaEA4rIlQTx0qXqCA#PPA349,M1 partial excerpt available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  A hiring committee told him, "We're not going to hire you because we think our clients would think we are running a freak circus if they saw you."&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2012 171"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/21/AR2010102100334.html|title=Paul S.

Rees|date=October 21, 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller eventually became a [[litigation]] [[associate attorney|associate]] at the [[Los Angeles]] law firm then known as [[Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips|Manatt, Phelps, Phillips &amp; Kantor]]. (Miller's stint at Manatt Phelps has been identified as an inspiration for the character "Hamilton Schuyler", a dwarf lawyer portrayed by actor [[David Rappaport]] in the television series ''[[L.A. Law]]''.)&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul Steven Miller, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/10/opinion/l-on-being-little-but-not-belittled-363489.html "On Being Little But Not Belittled"], ''[[New York Times]]'', December 10, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Miller became director of litigation for the Western Law Center for Disability Rights at [[Loyola Law School]] in Los Angeles.  After the election of [[Bill Clinton]] as president in 1992, Miller worked for the transition team as a disability outreach and search manager.  He subsequently held posts as deputy director of the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission#Bureau of Consumer Protection|Office of Consumer Affairs]] and White House liaison to the disability community.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;

In 1994 President Clinton appointed Miller to be a Commissioner of the EEOC, Miller served a total of ten years, one of the longest tenures of any commissioner in EEOC history.&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/plan/par/2004/appendixes.html Biographies of the Commissioners and General Counsel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512044845/http://eeoc.gov///abouteeoc/plan/par/2004/appendixes.html |date=2009-05-12 }} at EEOC website (retrieved May 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  At the EEOC, he worked to develop an [[alternative dispute resolution]] program to resolve discrimination claims before litigation.&lt;ref name="Ellison" /&gt;  In August 2004 Miller resigned to become a professor at the University of Washington (UW) Law School; his seat on the EEOC remained empty until January 2006, when it was finally filled by another noted disability activist, [[Christine M. Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/05/AR2006010502104_pf.html "Griffin Sworn In at EEOC"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  UW made Miller the Henry M. Jackson Professor of Law in January 2008.  At the installation ceremony for this position, Miller's law school colleague Anna Mastroianni commented,"Paul Miller may have been born a dwarf, but in reality he is a giant. We are all better for seeing a little further from the perch of his shoulders."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

In his later career, Miller wrote about the interplay of disability rights and genetic science, writing papers with titles such as "Is There a Pink Slip in My Genes?" and "Avoiding Genetic Genocide". Among other issues, Miller discussed the potential for people to lose their jobs because of the disclosure of their future health risks.  Dr. [[Francis S. Collins]], director of the [[National Institutes of Health]] and leader of the [[Human Genome Project]], noted that Miller's "persistence paid off: after more than a decade of frustration, the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] was finally signed into law in 2008. Paul was one of its biggest heroes."&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

In 2007 Miller was recruited to join then Senator Obama's Disability Policy Committee by his long-time friend and protege, [[Rebecca Cokley]]. In February 2009, Miller was appointed as a special assistant to President Barack Obama, with responsibility for managing [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|political appointments]] at the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and other positions in the new administration, as well as for positions relating to disability programs.&lt;ref name="ST090218" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPI090217" /&gt; 

Miller suffered from tumors in his arm during the last decade of his life.  An amputation did not prevent the cancer's recurrence, and he died on October 19, 2010.&lt;ref name="giant"&gt;Maureen O'Hagan, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/obituaries/2013226198_millerobit22m.html "Paul Miller was a giant among peers"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Early in his career Miller had become a leader of the [[Little People of America]].&lt;ref name="Ellison" /&gt; In 2002 this organization presented Miller with its annual Award for Promoting Awareness of Individuals with Dwarfism.&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt;

Miller was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Visiting Scholar, Parsons Visiting Scholar at the [[Sydney Law School|University of Sydney Faculty of Law]], and a Fellow of the [[British-American Project]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; In 2003 Miller was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree by [[City University of New York School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/press/5-23-03.html "EEOC Commissioner Paul Steven Miller Receives Honorary Doctor of Law Degree from CUNY"], EEOC press release, May 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Miller married Jennifer Coletti Mechem, a disability policy coordinator, in 1997;&lt;ref name="wedding"/&gt; They had two  children, Naomi and Delia, who were 10 and 5 when their father died.&lt;ref name="giant"/&gt;

'''Quetzalcoatl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɛ|t|s|ɑː|l|k|oʊ|ˈ|ɑː|t|əl}}; {{IPA-es|ketsalˈkoatɬ|lang|QuetzalcoatlPronunciation-r1.ogg}}; {{lang-nci-IPA|Quetzalcohuātl|ket͡saɬˈkowaːt͡ɬ}}, in honorific form: ''Quetzalcohuātzin'', {{audio|Ketsalkoatl.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) is a [[deity]] in [[Mesoamerican culture]] and [[Mesoamerican literature|literature]] whose name comes from the [[Nahuatl]] language and means "feathered serpent" or "Quetzal-feathered Serpent".&lt;ref&gt;The Nahuatl nouns compounded into the proper name "Quetzalcoatl" are: ''quetzalli'', signifying principally "plumage", but also used to refer to the bird—[[resplendent quetzal]]—renowned for its colourful feathers, and ''cohuātl'' "snake". Some scholars have interpreted the name as having also a metaphorical meaning of "precious twin" since the word for plumage was also used metaphorically about precious things and ''cohuātl'' has an additional meaning of "twin"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[worship]] of a [[Feathered Serpent]] is first documented in [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan]] in the first century BC or first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan: Introduction|publisher=Project Temple of Quetzalcoatl, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Mexico/ ASU |date=2001-08-20|accessdate=2009-05-17|url=http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/intro/intrteo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; That period lies within the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] to [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic period]] (400 BC – 600 AD) of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], and veneration of the figure appears to have spread throughout Mesoamerica by the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period (600–900&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;ref name="Ringle et al. 1998"&gt;Ringle et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (900–1519&amp;nbsp;AD), the worship of the feathered serpent deity was based in the primary Mexican religious center of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. It is in this period that the deity is known to have been named "Quetzalcoatl" by his [[Nahua people|Nahua]] followers. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area, he was approximately equivalent to [[Kukulkan]] and [[Gukumatz]], names that also roughly translate as "feathered serpent" in different [[Mayan languages]].

Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, air, and learning, wears around his neck the "wind breastplate" ''ehecailacocozcatl'', "the spirally voluted wind jewel" made of a conch shell. This talisman was a conch shell cut at the cross-section and was likely worn as a necklace by religious rulers, as they have been discovered in burials in archaeological sites throughout Mesoamerica, and potentially symbolized patterns witnessed in hurricanes, dust devils, seashells, and whirlpools, which were elemental forces that had significance in [[Aztec mythology]]. In codex drawings, Quetzalcoatl and [[Xolotl]] were both pictured as wearing an ''ehecailacocozcatl'' around each of their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/8-4/The+Wind.pdf|title=Page Not Found – 404 – Penn Museum|website=www.penn.museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has additionally been at least one major cache of offerings with knives and idols adorned with the symbols of more than one god, some of which were adorned with wind jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/artefacts/personified-knives|title=Personified knives|website=www.mexicolore.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era following the 16th-century [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], a number of sources were written that conflate Quetzalcoatl with [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]], a ruler of the mythico-historic city of [[Tollan]]. It is a matter of much debate among historians to which degree, or whether at all, these narratives about this legendary [[Toltec]] ruler describe historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson 2001, Carrasco 1992, Gillespie 1989, Florescano 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, early Spanish sources written by clerics tend to identify the god-ruler Quetzalcoatl of these narratives with either [[Hernán Cortés]] or [[Thomas the Apostle]]—an identification which is also a source of a diversity of opinions about the nature of Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;Lafaye 1987, Townsend 2003, Martínez 1980, Phelan 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Aztec]]s, whose beliefs are the best-documented in the historical sources, Quetzalcoatl was related to gods of the wind, of the planet [[Venus]], of the dawn, of merchants and of arts, crafts and knowledge. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2001:213&lt;/ref&gt; Quetzalcoatl was one of several important gods in the Aztec [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], along with the gods [[Tlaloc]], [[Tezcatlipoca]] and [[Huitzilopochtli]]. Two other gods represented by the planet Venus are Quetzalcoatl's ally [[Tlaloc]] who is the god of rain, and Quetzalcoatl's twin and [[psychopomp]], who is named [[Xolotl]].

Animals thought to represent Quetzalcoatl include [[resplendent quetzal]]s, rattlesnakes (''coatl'' meaning serpent in Nahuatl), crows, and [[macaw]]s. In his form as [[Ehecatl]] he is the wind, and is represented by [[spider monkeys]], ducks, and the wind itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/gods/study-the-wind-god|title=Study the...

==Feathered serpent deity in Mesoamerica==
{{main article|Feathered Serpent (deity)}}
A feathered serpent deity has been worshiped by many different ethnopolitical groups in Mesoamerican history. The existence of such worship can be seen through studies of the iconography of different Mesoamerican cultures, in which serpent motifs are frequent. On the basis of the different symbolic systems used in portrayals of the feathered serpent deity in different cultures and periods, scholars have interpreted the religious and symbolic meaning of the feathered serpent deity in Mesoamerican cultures.

===Iconographic depictions===
[[File:Teotihuacan Feathered Serpent (Jami Dwyer).jpg|right|thumb|[[feathered serpent deity|Feathered Serpent]] head at the Ciudadela complex in Teotihuacan]]
The earliest iconographic depiction of the deity is believed to be found on [[Stela]] 19 at the [[Olmec]] site of [[La Venta]], depicting a serpent rising up behind a person probably engaged in a shamanic ritual. This depiction is believed to have been made around 900 BC.  Although probably not exactly a depiction of the same feathered serpent deity worshipped in classic and post-classic periods, it shows the continuity of symbolism of feathered snakes in Mesoamerica from the formative period and on, for example in comparison to the Mayan Vision Serpent shown below.

[[File:Yaxchilan Lintel 15.jpg|right|thumb|Vision Serpent depicted on lintel 15 from [[Yaxchilan]].]]
The first culture to use the symbol of a feathered serpent as an important religious and political symbol was [[Teotihuacan]]. At temples such as the aptly named "Quetzalcoatl temple" in the Ciudadela complex, feathered serpents figure prominently and alternate with a different kind of serpent head. The earliest depictions of the feathered serpent deity were fully zoomorphic, depicting the serpent as an actual snake, but already among the Classic Maya, the deity began acquiring human features.

In the iconography of the classic period, Maya serpent imagery is also prevalent: a snake is often seen as the embodiment of the sky itself, and a vision serpent is a shamanic helper presenting Maya kings with visions of the [[underworld]].

The archaeological record shows that after the fall of Teotihuacan that marked the beginning of the epi-classic period in [[Mesoamerican chronology]] around 600 AD, the cult of the feathered serpent spread to the new religious and political centers in central Mexico, centers such as [[Xochicalco]], [[Cacaxtla]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]].&lt;ref name=" Ringle et al. 1998"/&gt; Feathered serpent iconography is prominent at all of these sites. Cholula is known to have remained the most important center of worship to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec/Nahua version of the feathered serpent deity, in the post-classic period.

During the epi-classic period, a dramatic spread of feathered serpent iconography is evidenced throughout Mesoamerica, and during this period begins to figure prominently at sites such as [[Chichén Itzá]], [[El Tajín]], and throughout the Maya area. Colonial documentary sources from the Maya area frequently speak of the arrival of foreigners from the central Mexican plateau, often led by a man whose name translates as "Feathered Serpent." It has been suggested that these stories recall the spread of the feathered serpent cult in the epi-classic and early post-classic periods.&lt;ref name="Ringle et al. 1998"/&gt;

Represented as the plumed serpent, Quetzalcoatl was also manifest in the wind, one of the most powerful forces of nature, and this relationship was captured in a text in the Nahuatl language:

Quetzalcoatl; yn ehecatl ynteiacancauh yntlachpancauh in tlaloque, yn aoaque, yn qujqujiauhti. Auh yn jquac molhuja eheca, mjtoa: teuhtli quaqualaca, ycoioca, tetecujca, tlatlaiooa, tlatlapitza, tlatlatzinj, motlatlaueltia.

Quetzalcoatl—he was the wind, the guide and road sweeper of the rain gods, of the masters of the water, of those who brought rain. And when the wind rose, when the dust rumbled, and it crack and there was a great din, became it became dark and the wind blew in many directions, and it thundered; then it was said: "[Quetzalcoatl] is wrathful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain|last=Sahagún|first=Bernardino de|publisher=|year=1950|isbn=|location=Santa Fe, New Mexico|pages=Book 1, Ch. 5, p. 2|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quetzalcoatl was also linked to rulership and priestly office; additionally, among the [[Toltec]], it was used as a military title and emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aztecs|last=Townsend|first=Richard F.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2009|isbn=978-0-500-28791-0|location=|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-classic [[Aztec|Nahua civilization]] of central Mexico (Aztec), the worship of Quetzalcoatl was ubiquitous. Cult worship may have involved the ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybes), considered sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|title=New Taxonomical and Ethnomycological Observations on Psilocybe S.S. (Fungi, Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetidae, Agaricales, Strophariaceae) From Mexico, Africa, and Spain|journal=Acta Botanica Mexicana|date=2012|volume=100|page=88-90|url=http://scielo.unam.mx/pdf/abm/n100/n100a4.pdf#page=10|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important center was [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] where the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula|world's largest pyramid]] was dedicated to his worship. In Aztec culture, depictions of Quetzalcoatl were fully anthropomorphic. Quetzalcoatl was associated with the wind god [[Ehecatl]] and is often depicted with his insignia: a beak-like mask.

===Interpretations===
[[File:Xochicalco Serpiente Emplumada GR.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Temple of the Feathered Serpent at [[Xochicalco]], adorned with a fully zoomorphic feathered Serpent.]]
On the basis of the Teotihuacan iconographical depictions of the feathered serpent, archaeologist [[Karl Taube]] has argued that the feathered serpent was a symbol of fertility and internal political structures contrasting with the War Serpent symbolizing the outwards military expansion of the Teotihuacan empire.&lt;ref&gt;Florescano 2002:8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Enrique Florescano also analyzing Teotihuacan iconography argues that the Feathered Serpent was part of a triad of agricultural deities: the Goddess of the Cave symbolizing motherhood, reproduction and life, Tlaloc, god of rain, lightning and thunder and the feathered serpent, god of vegetational renewal. The feathered serpent was furthermore connected to the planet [[Venus]] because of this planet's importance as a sign of the beginning of the rainy season. To both Teotihuacan and [[Mayan culture]]s, Venus was in turn also symbolically connected with warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Florescano 2002:821&lt;/ref&gt;

While not usually feathered, classic Maya serpent iconography seems related to the belief in a sky-, Venus-, creator-, war- and fertility-related serpent deity. In the example from Yaxchilan, the Vision Serpent has the human face of the young maize god, further suggesting a connection to fertility and vegetational renewal; the Mayan Young Maize god was also connected to Venus.

In Xochicalco, depictions of the feathered serpent are accompanied by the image of a seated, armed ruler and the hieroglyph for the [[Mesoamerican calendars|day sign 9 Wind]]. The date 9 Wind is known to be associated with fertility, Venus and war among the Maya and frequently occurs in relation to Quetzalcoatl in other Mesoamerican cultures.

On the basis of the iconography of the feathered serpent deity at sites such as Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Chichén Itzá, Tula and Tenochtitlan combined with certain ethnohistorical sources, historian David Carrasco has argued that the preeminent function of the feathered serpent deity throughout Mesoamerican history was the patron deity of the Urban center, a god of culture and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Aztec culture==
[[File:Quetzalcoatl 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the [[Codex Borbonicus]].]]
To the Aztecs, Quetzalcoatl was, as his name indicates, a feathered serpent, a flying reptile (much like a [[dragon]]), who was a boundary-maker (and transgressor) between earth and sky. He was a creator deity having contributed essentially to the creation of Mankind. He also had anthropomorphic forms, for example in his aspects as [[Ehecatl]] the wind god. Among the Aztecs, the name Quetzalcoatl was also a priestly title, as the two most important priests of the Aztec [[Templo Mayor]] were called "Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqui". In the Aztec ritual calendar, different deities were associated with the cycle-of-year names: Quetzalcoatl was tied to the year Ce Acatl (One Reed), which correlates to the year 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 2003:668&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==

=== Attributes===
[[File:Quetzalcoatl magliabechiano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]
The exact significance and attributes of Quetzalcoatl varied somewhat between civilizations and through history. There are several stories about the birth of Quetzalcoatl. In a version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named [[Chimalman]], to whom the god Onteol appeared in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Bierlein, ''Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience'', Ballantine Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl swallowing an emerald.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow shot by [[Mixcoatl]] and nine months later she gave birth to a child which was called Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from [[Coatlicue]], who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl is one of the four sons of [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]], the four Tezcatlipocas, each of whom presides over one of the four cardinal directions.  Over the West presides the White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, the god of light, justice, mercy and wind. Over the South presides the Blue Tezcatlipoca, [[Huitzilopochtli]], the god of war. Over the East presides the Red Tezcatlipoca, [[Xipe Totec]], the god of gold, farming and springtime. And over the North presides the Black Tezcatlipoca, known by no other name than [[Tezcatlipoca]], the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth.&lt;ref name="Smi"&gt;Smith,Michael E. The Aztecs 2nd Ed. Blackwell Publishing, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the [[Venus|morning star]], and his twin brother [[Xolotl]] was the evening star ([[Venus]]). As the morning star, he was known by the title ''[[Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli]]'', meaning "lord of the star of the dawn." He was known as the inventor of books and the [[calendar]], the giver of [[maize]] (corn) to mankind, and sometimes as a symbol of death and [[resurrection]]. Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests and the title of the twin Aztec high priests. Some legends describe him as opposed to human sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LaFaye|first=Jacques|title=Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe: The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness, 1531–1813|year=1987|edition=New|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226467887|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others describe him practicing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrasco|first=David|title=Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire: Myths and Prophecies in the Aztec Tradition|year=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226094908|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3Ya5di0rAMC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Quetzalcoatl+%22human+sacrifice%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lJkbUubIOarQ0QXw_oDgCg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quetzalcoatl%20%22human%20sacrifice%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Read|first=Kay Almere|title=Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195149098|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y053PeFmS5UC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=Quetzalcoatl+%22human+sacrifice%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lJkbUubIOarQ0QXw_oDgCg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quetzalcoatl%20%22human%20sacrifice%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mesoamerican beliefs included cycles of suns. Often our current time was considered the fifth sun,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} the previous four having been destroyed by flood, fire and the like. Quetzalcoatl went to [[Mictlan]], the underworld, and created fifth-world mankind from the bones of the previous races (with the help of [[Cihuacoatl]]), using his own blood, from a wound he inflicted on his earlobes, calves, tongue, and penis, to imbue the bones with new life.

It is also suggested that he was a son of [[Xochiquetzal]] and [[Mixcoatl]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the [[Codex Chimalpopoca]], it is said Quetzalcoatl was coerced by [[Tezcatlipoca]] into becoming drunk on [[pulque]], cavorting with his sister, Quetzalpetlatl, a celibate priestess, and neglecting their religious duties. (Many academics conclude this passage implies incest.) The next morning, Quetzalcoatl, feeling shame and regret, had his servants build him a stone chest, adorn him in turquoise, and then, laying in the chest, [[Self-immolation|set himself on fire]]. His ashes rose into the sky and then his heart followed, becoming the morning star (see [[Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingQuetzalcoatl.html|title=Readings in Classical Nahuatl: The Death of Quetzalcoatl|website=pages.ucsd.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief in Cortés as Quetzalcoatl==
[[File:Quetzalcoatl Ehecatl.jpg|thumb|275px|right| Quetzalcoatl in human form, using the symbols of [[Ehecatl]], from the [[Codex Borgia]].]]
Since the sixteenth century, it has been widely held that the [[Aztec]] Emperor [[Moctezuma II]] initially believed the landing of [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1519 to be Quetzalcoatl's return. This view has been questioned by ethno-historians who argue that the Quetzalcoatl-Cortés connection is not found in any document that was created independently of post-Conquest Spanish influence, and that there is little proof of a pre-Hispanic belief in Quetzalcoatl's return.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 2003a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 2003b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall 2003a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall 2003b&lt;/ref&gt; Most documents expounding this theory are of entirely Spanish origin, such as Cortés's letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of [[Spain]], in which Cortés goes to great pains to present the naive gullibility of the Aztecs in general as a great aid in his conquest of [[Mexico]].

Much of the idea of Cortés being seen as a deity can be traced back to the [[Florentine Codex]] written down some 50 years after the conquest. In the Codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which, as described in the codex written by the Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and his Tlatelolcan informants, included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as:

{{quote|''You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you.''}}

and:

{{quote|''You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.''}}

Subtleties in, and an imperfect scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of these comments tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.

Other parties have also promulgated the idea that the Mesoamericans believed the conquistadors, and in particular Cortés, to be awaited gods: most notably the historians of the [[Franciscan]] order such as Fray [[Gerónimo de Mendieta]].&lt;ref&gt;Martinez 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Some Franciscans at this time held [[millennarian]] beliefs&lt;ref&gt;Phelan 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and some of them believed that Cortés' coming to the New World ushered in the final era of evangelization before the coming of the [[Millennialism|millennium]]. Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]] "Motolinia" saw elements of Christianity in the precolumbian religions and therefore believed that Mesoamerica had been evangelized before, possibly by [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] whom legend had it had "gone to preach beyond the Ganges". Franciscans then equated the original Quetzalcoatl with St. Thomas and imagined that the Indians had long-awaited his return to take part once again in God's kingdom. Historian Matthew Restall concludes that:

{{quote|The legend of the returning lords, originated during the Spanish-Mexica war in Cortés' reworking of Moctezuma's welcome speech, had by the 1550's merged with the Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl legend that the Franciscans had started spreading in the 1530s. (Restall 2001:114 )}}

Some scholarship maintains the view that the Aztec Empire's fall may be attributed in part to the belief in Cortés as the returning Quetzalcoatl, notably in works by [[David Carrasco]] (1982), [[H. B. Nicholson]] (2001 (1957)) and John Pohl (2016). However, a majority of Mesoamericanist scholars such as [[Matthew Restall]] (2003), [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] (1994), [[Susan D. Gillespie]] (1989), Camilla Townsend (2003a, 2003b), [[Louise Burkhart]], Michel Graulich and [[Michael E. Smith]] (2001) among others, consider the "Quetzalcoatl/Cortés myth" as one of many myths about the Spanish conquest which have risen in the early post-conquest period.  It should be furthered noted that the idea that Cortes or Spaniards as a group or specific other individuals were a specific god (e.g., Quetzalcoatl) or gods in general is not present among any other Mesoamerican peoples (Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Maya, Quiche, Tzeltal, Tzotzil, etc.).

[[File:Quetzalcoatl, a Major Deity of the Cholula People WDL6756.png|thumbnail|left|Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the post-Conquest [[Tovar Codex]].]]
There is no question that the legend of Quetzalcoatl played a significant role in the colonial period. However, this legend likely has a foundation in events that took place immediately prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. A 2012 exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Dallas Museum of Art, "The Children of the Plumed Serpent: the Legacy of Quetzalcoatl in Ancient Mexico," demonstrated the existence of a powerful confederacy of Eastern Nahuas, Mixtecs and Zapotecs, along with the peoples they dominated throughout southern Mexico between 1200–1600 (Pohl, Fields, and Lyall 2012, Harvey 2012, Pohl 2003).   They maintained a major pilgrimage and commercial center at Cholula, Puebla which the Spaniards compared to both Rome and Mecca because the cult of the god united its constituents through a field of common social, political, and religious values without dominating them militarily.  This confederacy engaged in almost seventy-five years of nearly continuous conflict with the Aztec Empire of the Triple Alliance until the arrival of Cortés. Members of this confederacy from Tlaxcala, Puebla, and Oaxaca provided the Spaniards with the army that first reclaimed the city of Cholula from its pro-Aztec ruling faction, and ultimately defeated the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City).  The Tlaxcalteca, along with other city-states across the Plain of Puebla, then supplied the auxiliary and logistical support for the conquests of Guatemala and West Mexico while Mixtec and Zapotec caciques (Colonial indigenous rulers) gained monopolies in the overland transport of Manila galleon trade through Mexico, and formed highly lucrative relationships with the Dominican order in the new Spanish imperial world economic system that explains so much of the enduring legacy of indigenous life-ways that characterize southern Mexico and explain the popularity of the Quetzalcoatl legends that continued through the colonial period to the present day.

{{see also|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Proposed Book of Mormon geographical setting|Mormon folklore}}

Some [[Mormon]]s believe that Quetzalcoatl was historically [[Jesus Christ]], but believe His name and the details of the event were gradually lost over time. According to the [[Book of Mormon]], the resurrected Christ came down from the clouds and visited the people of the American continent, shortly after his resurrection. Quetzalcoatl is not a religious symbol in the Latter-day Saint faith, and is not taught as such, nor is it in their doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Wirth 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[John Taylor (Latter-day Saint)|John Taylor]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1892:201&lt;/ref&gt;

''The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being. But the history of the former has been handed down to us through an impure Lamanitish source, which has sadly disfigured and perverted the original incidents and teachings of the Savior's life and ministry." (Mediation and Atonement, p. 194.)''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Latter-day Saint author [[Brant Gardner]], after investigating the link between Quetzalcoatl and Jesus, concluded that the association amounts to nothing more than folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Blair 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986 paper for ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'', he noted that during the [[Spanish Conquest]], the Native Americans and the Catholic priests who sympathized with them felt pressure to link Native American beliefs with Christianity, thus making the Native Americans seem more human and less savage. Over time, Quetzalcoatl's appearance, clothing, malevolent nature, and status among the gods were reshaped to fit a more Christian framework.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In media ===
Quetzalcoatl was fictionalized in the 1982 film ''[[Q (film)|Q]]'' as a monster that terrorizes New York City.&lt;ref name="ebert's review of Q the movie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Ebert|title=Q Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1982)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/q-1982|website=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=1 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffington post q film review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carr|first1=Nick|title=The Complete New York City Horror Movie Marathon! {{!}} Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nick-carr/the-complete-new-york-cit_b_775853.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deity has been featured as a character in the manga and anime series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' , ''[[Beyblade]]'' and ''[[Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid]]'' (the latter depicting Quetzalcoatl as a female dragon deity); the [[Persona (series)|Persona]] video game franchise; the video games ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' (as an alternate costume for his Mayan counterpart, Kukulkan), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]''; and in the last of ''[[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' books.

Fritze earned his BA in history at Concordia College in 1974. He obtained a master's degree from [[Louisiana State University]] and a PhD from [[Cambridge University]] in 1981. He has worked at [[Lamar University]] in Beaumont and the [[University of Central Arkansas]] in 2001 as chair of the history department.

Retrieved 2015-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritze is the author of ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science, and Pseudo-religions'' (2009) a book which critically examines the pseudohistoric claims of [[Martin Bernal]]'s ''Black Athena'', [[Erich von Däniken]], [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[Atlantis]], [[Christian Identity]], [[Nation of Islam]], and fringe related [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories]]. According to Fritze pseudohistory is a "charlatan's playground" targeting those too "willing to suspend disbelief" and slip into an "abyss of fantasy". Fritze considers such pseudohistoric ideas to be irrational and misleading the public.&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas.

'''Rory Enrique Conde''' (born June 14, 1965),  [[pseudonym|a.k.a.]] "The Tamiami Trail Strangler", is a [[Colombia]]n [[serial killer]] who killed 6 prostitutes in Florida. He was sentenced to death on March 7, 2000.

==Personal life==
Rory Conde was born on June 14, 1965 in [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]]. His mother died of [[tetanus]] when he was six years old. Conde and his sister Nelly were then raised by their paternal grandmother. When Conde was twelve, they moved to [[Miami]] to live with Conde's father, Gustavo Conde. Conde did not like his father and thought he was [[emotional abuse|emotionally abusive]]. Conde's future wife, Carla Conde, thought that Rory's outbursts were a result of [[sexual abuse]] at the hands of his father.

Rory and Carla were married in 1987, when he was 21 and she was 15, eventually having two kids. Rory was an abusive husband and had a stint in jail in 1992 as a result of a fight with Carla over Rory bringing girls over. They later moved to a condo off the [[Tamiami Trail]]. They stopped having sex and Rory would disappear at night. In July, 1994 Carla moved out to her parents' house with the two kids. Rory threatened to kill her if she dated anyone else.

==Murders==
On September 17, 1994, Conde killed cross dressing male prostitute,  Lazaro Comesana. He later said that he killed Lazaro after finding out he was a man during sex.

Conde then killed two more prostitutes, Elisa Martinez on October 8 and Charity Nava on November 20. On the back and buttocks of Charity he wrote "THIRD! (A happy face dotting the 'i') I will call Dwight Chan 10. (A reference to [[WPLG]] anchor [[Dwight Lauderdale]]) [See] if you can catch me. (Using two eyes instead of the word 'See')"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/conde.html | title=SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH ME | publisher=mayhem.net | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | author=Antonio Mendoza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conde then killed three more prostitutes: Wanda Crawford on November 25, Necole Schneider on December 17, and  Rhonda Dunn on January 12, 1995.

He strangled his victims to death and would have anal sex with the corpses afterward.

==Aftermath==
Conde was arrested on June 19, 1995 when Gloria Maestre, a prostitute he had bound head to toe, made enough noise to attract neighbors while Conde was in court for a shoplifting charge.

He was sentenced to death on March 7, 2000 for the murder of Rhonda Dunn. He later pleaded guilty to the murder of five others and was sentenced to five consecutive life terms without parole on April 5, 2001.

'''Shaima Rezayee''' ({{lang-prs|شیما رضایی}}) (1981 &amp;ndash; May 18, 2005)&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt; was a TV presenter on the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] music television channel, [[Tolo TV]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the first female western-style music presenter to appear on television in Afghanistan's conservative history.

In March 2005, Shaima Rezayee lost her job on the popular show ''Hop'', an Afghan programme with content similar to the global music video channel [[MTV]], after the programme was criticised by local [[Islam]]ic clerics. One of the most outspoken critics of ''Hop'' was Fazl Hadi Shinwari, a chief justice of the [[Afghan Supreme Court]].

He was quoted as saying ''"It [Hop] will corrupt our society, culture and most importantly, it will take our people away from Islam and destroy our country... This will make our people accept another culture, and make our country a laughing stock around the world."''

Rezayee herself was a central focus of the criticism, mainly for her western style of dress. This was believed by the religious authorities to be 'corrupting' the youth of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 May 2005, Rezayee was shot dead at her home in [[Char Qala]], a neighbourhood of [[Kabul]]. She was the first journalist to be killed in Afghanistan since the end of the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Afghan civil war]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Patrick Spencer Cox''' (March 10, 1968 – December 18, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[Activism|HIV/AIDS activist]]. He was involved in [[ACT UP]] [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Treatment Action Group]] during the height of the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS Crisis in New York]]. He helped facilitate the production of [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s, which revolutionized AIDS care in the 1990s.

==Biography==
Cox was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He [[coming out|came out]] as [[gay]] while he was in [[high school]]. He attended [[Bennington College]] for three years, where he studied theater and literature.&lt;ref name="whatreally"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/fashion/what-really-killed-spencer-cox-aids-activist.html?pagewanted=all |title=Surviving AIDS, but not the life that followed |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jacob |last=Bernstein |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in 1989, to pursue acting. He joined the [[ACT UP]] that year and was soon thereafter diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/nyregion/spencer-cox-aids-activist-dies-at-44.html |title=Spencer Cox, AIDS activist, dies at 44 |first=Bruce |last=Weber |authorlink=Bruce Weber (reporter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=B19 |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Cox joined with other ACT UP members to form the [[Treatment Action Group]], which worked to further treatment advances in HIV. He worked with the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s Anti-Viral Advisory Committee to hasten the approval time for new HIV medications, including the new drug class of [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s. Cox designed a [[clinical trial]] to examine the effectiveness of [[ritonavir]], which led to its approval,&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gina |last=Kolata |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/us/fda-debate-on-speedy-access-to-aids-drugs-is-reopening.html |title=F.D.A. debate on speedy access to AIDS drugs is reopening |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 12, 1994 |accessdate=October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a dramatic effect on the treatment of HIV.

Cox founded the Medius Institute for Gay Men's Health in 2006, concerned with issues faced by gay men, including loneliness, depression and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; With a lack of funding, Cox abandoned the effort and began using [[methamphetamine]]. He moved back to Atlanta to recuperate.&lt;ref name="whatreally"/&gt; He returned to New York in 2012, and appeared in the [[documentary film]] ''[[How to Survive a Plague]]''.&lt;ref name="whatreally"/&gt; He also wrote for ''[[POZ (magazine)|POZ]]''.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

Cox died at [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital#The Allen Hospital|The Allen Hospital]] in [[Upper Manhattan]], on December 18, 2012, of AIDS-related causes, after he stopped taking his HIV medications.&lt;ref name="whatreally"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

[[St. Luke's–Roosevelt Hospital Center]] renamed their HIV clinic, formerly the Center for Comprehensive Care, as the Spencer Cox Center for Health, in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/spencer-cox-center-health_n_3430872.html |title=Spencer Cox Center for Health opens in New York |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stefano '''"'''The Undertaker'''"''' Magaddino''' (October 10, 1891 – July 19, 1974) was a Sicilian mafioso who became the boss of the [[Buffalo crime family]] in [[western New York]]. His underworld influence stretched from [[Ohio]] to [[Southern Ontario]] and as far east as Montreal, Quebec. Known as ''Don Stefano'' to his friends and ''The Undertaker'' to others, he was also a charter member of the American Mafia's ruling council, otherwise known as [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]].&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt;

==Early years==
Born in [[Castellammare del Golfo]], [[Sicily]], Magaddino emigrated to the United States in 1909&lt;ref name="Kurt Nickerson"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Origin of Organized Crime in America|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-415-99030-1|pages = 172, 179, 214–222|accessdate = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2eCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last = Critchley|year = 2009|work = |first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlmutter|first=Emanuel|title=Stefano Magaddino Dead at 82|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/07/21/93278092.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 21, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Magadinno's cousins from Sicily was [[Joseph Bonanno]], the future boss of the [[Bonanno crime family]] in New York City.

In 1921, in [[Avon, New Jersey]], Magaddino was arrested for his involvement in the [[murder]] of Camillo Caiozzo, a member of the rival Buccellato clan from Castellammare del Golfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.onewal.com/a014/f_goodkillers.html|title = The Good Killers: 1921's Glimpse of the Mafia|date = 2007|access-date = 2 February 2016|website = The American Mafia|publisher = |last = Hunt|first = Thomas|last2 = Tona|first2 = Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Magaddino became a naturalized U.S. citizen.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;

==Buffalo crime family==
Magaddino eventually moved to [[Niagara Falls, New York]], then in later years further north to [[Lewiston, New York|Lewiston]], another town on the [[Niagara River]] facing the Canada–US border. Although he was a successful mortician operating his legitimate Magaddino Memorial Chapel [[funeral home]] business in Niagara Falls, with [[Prohibition]] in effect in the United States, Maggadino made his real money running a profitable [[rum-running|bootlegging]] business by smuggling wine and spirits across the [[Niagara River]] into [[New York State]], thereby supplying the needs of [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] located in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and the very "[[Honky-tonk]]" Niagara Falls. After Prohibition ended, Magaddino and his crime family made their money by means of [[loan sharking]], [[illegal gambling]], [[extortion]], [[carjacking]] and labor [[racketeering]] as well as other legitimate lucrative businesses such as linen service businesses that served the needs of most of the hotels located throughout the region as well as taxicab companies and other service-oriented businesses.

Magaddino's crime family held power in the underworld territories of Upstate and Western New York, namely, Buffalo, New York, bordering Canada and situated on Lake Erie, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Utica, New York|Utica]], along the [[Mohawk River]] as far east as [[Amsterdam, New York]]; from Eastern Pennsylvania as far west as [[Youngstown, Ohio]], and in Canada from [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] (opposite Buffalo, NY) to [[Toronto]], Ontario and as far east as [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Magaddino led his Buffalo family through its glory years and its most powerful and profitable era in La Cosa Nostra. He was an old-style boss who preferred to stay in the background and not draw any attention to himself or his criminal activities if possible. Due to his territory's remoteness yet the vast amount of it he controlled and being geographically insulated from the inter-family squabbles of the New York City-based families, he was held in high regard and was at times called upon to be an arbiter involving territorial disputes between crime families based there.

==National crime figure==
For fifty years, Magaddino was a dominant presence in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] underworld. He was the longest tenured boss in the history of the American Mafia. Magaddino was also involved in national [[La Cosa Nostra]] affairs. Magaddino was a charter member of [[Charles Luciano|Charles "Lucky" Luciano]]'s [[The Commission (mafia)|Mafia Commission]] and attended important underworld summits such as the 1946 [[Havana Conference]] and the 1957 [[Apalachin Conference]].

It is believed Magaddino, along with Antonio and [[Johnny Papalia]], played a role in notorious [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] bootlegger [[Rocco Perri]]'s disappearance in 1944 in order to gain more Canadian market control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Humphreys |first=Adrian |date=1999 |title=The Enforcer:Johnny Pops Papalia, A Life and Death in the Mafia |location=Toronto |publisher=Harper Collins |page=26 |isbn=0-00-200016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fairly popular, Magaddino had enemies and survived several [[assassination]] attempts. In 1936, rival gangsters attempted to kill Magaddino with a bomb, killing his sister instead. In 1958, an assassin tossed a [[hand grenade]] through his kitchen window, which failed to explode. This second attempt on his life was said to be directed by mobsters who blamed Magaddino for the failed Apalachin Meeting, which was raided by [[New York State Police]].

==Arrest and fall==
Magaddino had never spent any significant time in prison. However, in 1968, he and his son [[Peter Magaddino|Peter]] were arrested and charged with interstate [[bookmaking]]. A raid on his son's home in Niagara Falls led to the discovery of approximately $473,134 in a suitcase. This created great animosity between the Buffalo family members and the Magaddinos and led to a breakdown of their cooperation concerning criminal activities. The Buffalo family split into dissident factions; the leaders met in Rochester at the end of 1968 and by early 1969, ousted Magaddino as boss, leaving him to lead a faction made up of his once powerful in-laws and older crime family members, from 1969 until he died several years later.

Stefano Magaddino died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on July 19, 1974, at age 82 at [[Mount Saint Mary's Hospital]] in [[Lewiston, New York]].&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;  His funeral mass was celebrated at St. Joseph's [[Roman Catholic]] church and he was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery on [[Little Italy, Niagara Falls, New York|Pine Avenue]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].

==Legacy==
''Mob Boss'', written by Mike Hudson, is a book about Magaddino's life as a mob boss. Magaddino is also mentioned in ''Niagara Falls Confidential'', also written by Mike Hudson. He also gets a passing mention in ''The Valachi Papers'' by Peter Maas.

Magaddino is an unseen character in the third season of the hit HBO series, [[Boardwalk Empire]].

''Sugata'' is an epithet for [[Gautama Buddha]].{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Thaplyal|1972|p=74}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+sugata&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary, ''sugata'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Bhikkhu Khantipalo, the term "sugato" can be translated as "auspicious", "fortunate" or more literally "well gone", "one who has gone to goodness", "one whose going was good". This refers to both the fact that his nirvana was good and that his awakening was a good for the world.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence-Khantipalo Mills. Buddha, My Refuge: Contemplation of the Buddha Based on the Pali Suttas, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Summer Wesley was born and raised in rural Southeastern Oklahoma and is a citizen of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]]. She attended school in the small town of [[Rattan, Oklahoma|Rattan]], graduating high school a year early, in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1998 Graduation Edition|newspaper=Antlers American|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley earned four degrees from the University of Oklahoma:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wesley|first=Summer|title=Biography|url=https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=209701964&amp;trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bachelor of Liberal Studies (2005), a master's in Administrative Leadership (2008), during which time she also completed the course requirements for a master's in Interprofessional Health &amp; Human Services. She completed her [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Master of Arts]] in Native American Studies as part of a dual-degree program. Additionally, Wesley received a Certificate in American Indian Law.

== Writing ==
Wesley began writing early, publishing poetry while in her teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tears of Fire|year=1994|publisher=The National Library of Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seasons to Come|year=1994|publisher=The National Library of Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Best Poems of 1995|year=1995|publisher=The National Library of Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During law school, Wesley spent a semester as a writer for the ''Oklahoma Journal of Law &amp; Technology'' (OKJOLT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ou.edu/content/oklahoma-journal-law-and-technology3|title=About the Oklahoma Journal of Law and Technology|work=ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on OKJOLT's 2012–13 board of editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKJOLT|url=https://www.facebook.com/OklahomaJournalOfLawAndTechnology/info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her published Master's thesis, "Trademarking Tradition: Intellectual Property and Native American Tribes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesley|first=Summer|title=Trademarking Tradition: Intellectual Property &amp; Native American Tribes|year=2013|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrP17kgLtu-OEphT09WbTVQZnc/edit?usp=sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt; is deposited in the University of Oklahoma's [[Bizzell Library]].

==Career==
In 2012, Wesley interned at Oklahoma Indian Legal Services,&lt;ref&gt;http://oilsonline.org&lt;/ref&gt; where she developed her skills in Federal Indian Law and the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outstanding Intern|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrP17kgLtu-ZDF0Q0RlX2VuWGc/edit?usp=sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since graduating law school, Wesley has been an advocate for [[Indian Country]] and has represented clients in tribal courts.

== Activism==
Prior to attending law school, Wesley was active as a volunteer, frequently speaking to Scout groups about racism and stereotypical representations of Native Americans in popular culture.

In addition to her professional work representing Native Americans, Wesley has become an activist on several issues affecting her people. She has taken part in campaigns to eliminate race-based mascots for sports teams, as well as advocating for positive representations of Indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notyourmascots.org|title=We Are a People - Not Your Mascots|work=We Are a People - Not Your Mascots}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lucero|first1=Jordann|title=Oklahomans split on Redskins trademark decision|url=http://www.okcfox.com/story/25814255/oklahomans-split-on-redskins-trademark-decision|publisher=Fox 25|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201402032006-0023441|title=Indigenous activists take mascot fight to Super Bowl|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley is often quoted by her social media name of "Chahta Summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickert|first=Levi|title=OK Governor's Daughter Criticized for Performing in Native Regalia and Doing a Fake War Dance|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/ok-governors-daughter-criticized-performing-native-regalia-fake-war-dance/|publisher=Native News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How #NotYourMascot Super Bowl TwitterStorm Happened, Play by Play|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/08/1276179/-How-NotYourMascot-Super-Bowl-TwitterStorm-Happened-Play-by-Play#|publisher=Daily Kos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder|first=Joanna|title=Native Americans Call For The End of Chief Wahoo, By Tweeting #DeChief |url=http://goodmenproject.com/opeds/native-americans-call-on-nike-to-stop-selling-chief-wahoo-gear-hesaid/|publisher=The Good Men Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was featured in the National Congress of American Indian's 2014 #ProudToBe project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#ProudToBe|url=http://www.changethemascot.org/proud-to-be/|publisher=National Congress of American Indians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Wesley criticized the Choctaw Nation's inviting Oklahoma Governor [[Mary Fallin]] to participate in their annual Labor Day Festival, stating: "Mary Fallin has demonstrated to not be an ally to Native tribes, yet has been chosen to not only appear at Choctaw Fest, but to unveil a statue in honor of our women . . .As a Choctaw woman, I am appalled that she is being given a platform for her insincere pandering and her participation in the unveiling causes the statue to lose all honor to me. Further, I think this sends the wrong message to Indian Country regarding the Choctaw Nation's priorities and loyalties. Fallin's participation implies that our Nation condones her anti-Native policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Louis|title=MARY FAILING: Choctaws speak out against Gov. Fallin appearing at this weekend's Labor Day celebration|url=http://www.reddirtreport.com/red-dirt-news/mary-failing-choctaws-speak-out-against-gov-fallin-appearing-weekend%E2%80%99s-labor-day|publisher=Red Dirt Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the social media protests, the tribe pulled its announcement about the Fallin appearance from its website and all mention of the appearance was removed from Fallin's social media accounts. In the end, Fallin made an appearance at the festival to sign a tribal tag compact, and left without participating in the honors she had previously been invited to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#ChoctawFest Fallin Fail|url=https://storify.com/ChahtaSmmr/choctawfest-fallin-fail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days later, Wesley commented on the poor taste of [[Oklahoma State University]] students who made a banner with a flip reference to the [[Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jae|first1=Johnnie|title=Trail of Tears' Sign on ESPN's College Gameday Show Sparks Another Faux-pology|url=http://nativemaxmagazine.com/trail-of-tears-sign-on-espns-college-gameday-show-sparks-another-faux-pology/|publisher=''Native Max Magazine''|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 Wesley was quoted as criticizing Governor Fallin for cancelling a second scheduled meeting with the mother of Mah-Hi-Vist (Redbird) Goodblanket, a young [[Cheyenne Arapaho]] man who had been killed by police. Reporters found that Fallin staged a media event instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Louis|title=FOUL BALL: Mary Fallin ignores grieving Native mother to play basketball with Kevin Durant|url=http://www.reddirtreport.com/red-dirt-politics/foul-ball-mary-fallin-ignores-grieving-native-mother-play-basketball-kevin-durant|publisher=''Red Dirt Report''|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley was among Native American activists who expressed the belief that the Governor was sending "the message that the issue holds no importance to her. Indian Country had long felt that she is no ally, but this is a bigger issue. Police brutality affects all communities..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jae|first1=Johnnie|title=#NativeLivesMatter....But Not to Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin|url=http://nativemaxmagazine.com/nativelivesmatter/|publisher=''Native Max Magazine''|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Wesley used social media to report on the federal trial of [[Jason Merida]], former Executive Director of the Choctaw Nation, who was convicted on all but one charge of counts of [[embezzlement]] of tribal funds and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eaglemanz|title=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma: the verdict is in. Now its our time!|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/eaglemanz/2014/11/23/choctaw-nation-of-oklahoma-the-verdict-is-in-now-its-our-time#.VHKZ5BD2fNI.twitter|publisher=blogtalkradio|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized the media for not covering the trial adequately, leaving tribal citizens unaware of the serious case. She coined the hashtag #ChoctawCorruptionTrial and posted updates to various sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wesley|first1=Summer|title=#ChoctawCorruptionTrial|url=http://chahtasmmr.tumblr.com/post/102335731919/choctawcorruptiontrial-updated|website=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in November 2014, Wesley spoke out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UnSlut Project|title=#OKgirls|url=https://storify.com/UnSlutProject/okgirls|publisher=Storify}}&lt;/ref&gt; in support of three young rape victims from [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They left school after being bullied following reporting the attacks on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merlan|first1=Anna|title=Why Were Three Teenage Rape Victims Bullied Out of School in Oklahoma?|url=http://jezebel.com/why-were-three-teenage-rape-victims-bullied-out-of-scho-1659721302|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley was quite vocal in her support of the Oklahoma City Public School's decisions to end land run reenactments, as well as the board's vote to eliminate the "redskins" mascot used by Capital Hill High School. Wesley live-tweeted meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#OKCPS to #RenameTheHill. Natives are #NotYourMascot|url=https://storify.com/ChahtaSmmr/okcps-to-renamethehill-natives-are-notyourmascot|publisher=Storify}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic and her account of a community educational forum on the topic was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wesley|first1=Summer|title=Non Native Alumni Show Up at Educational Forum Angry About Dropping of Indian Mascot|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/non-native-alumni-show-educational-forum-angry-dropping-indian-mascot/|publisher=Native News Online|date=7 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
