According to the ''Gettysburg Compiler'' and ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', in [[India]], towards the end of the 19th century, the [[Gaekwad]] of [[Baroda]], that is [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Sayajirao III]],&lt;ref name="GoB"&gt;{{cite web |title=His Highness Sayajirao Gaekwad III |publisher=Gaekwadsofbardoa.com |url=http://www.gaekwadsofbaroda.com/node/2 |date= |accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawson |first=Alastair |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168 |title=Indian maharajah's daring act of anti-colonial dissent |publisher=The [[BBC]] |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranged a fight between a [[Barbary lion]] called "'''Atlas'''", from the [[Atlas Mountains]] between [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], and a [[Man-eater|man-eating]] [[Bengal tiger]] from the Indian region of [[Shimla]], before an audience of thousands. It was to determine whether the [[lion]] or the [[tiger]] should be called the "King of the [[Felidae|Cat Family]]", or if the lion deserved the title of "King of the Beasts".&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lion against tiger |journal=Gettysburg Compiler |date=7 February 1899 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A-MyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1QAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641,6045584&amp;dq=tiger+lion+fight+1899&amp;hl=en |accessdate = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite book |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1647483302.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+26,+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&amp;desc=LION+AGAINST+TIGER&amp;pqatl=google |date=26 January 1899 |journal=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |page=3 |title=Lion against tiger |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The venue == 
The fight took place in an [[amphitheatre]]. It had heavy logs, was open to the sky, and its [[arena]] was circular, with a diameter of about {{convert|50.0|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Within the arena was a belt about {{convert|6.0|ft|cm|abbr=off}} wide, lined by sheet iron to prevent the [[animal]]s from escaping. The arena had seats or boxes for [[Spectator sport|spectators]]. The Gaekwad was on a Royal box with other dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

== Appearance of the beasts in the arena ==
The beasts were shifted from their pens into wooden cages, which were then taken to the arena. After [[Rajput]] attendants left the ring, the Gaekwad pulled the ropes, which were attached to the doors of the cages. First the tiger emerged from its cage, then Atlas.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

== Physical description ==
The tiger was more than {{convert|10.0|ft|cm|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=off}} at the shoulder, had long teeth and [[claw]]s, besides strong shoulders, and was agile. People considered it to be the biggest man-eater that they ever saw in India. They chose an [[African lion]] to fight it, rather than an [[Asiatic lion]] in India, because the latter was considered to be too 'small' or 'timorous' to cope with the tiger.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt; In reality, it appears from reports of clashes between [[Indian lion]]s and tigers, besides that they co-existed before the end of the 19th century, that Asiatic lions could [[Coexistence of the lion and tiger in the wilderness|compete]] with tigers.&lt;ref name=minn&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions |author=Packer, C. |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] Lion Research Project |url=http://cbs.umn.edu/research/labs/lionresearch/faq |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SydneyMail1889"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Terrible Struggle |publisher=The Sydney Mail |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&amp;dat=18891221&amp;id=8pJRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VJMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7172,7165143&amp;hl=en |date=1889-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a draw was reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),&lt;ref name="StLandryDemocrat1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=An Awful Fight: A Combat Between a Tiger and a Lion |publisher=St. Landry Democrat |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064537/1887-04-30/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1789&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=After+Bangalore+encampment&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1924&amp;proxtext=after+encamping+bangalore&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |date=1887-04-30 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),&lt;ref name="EatonDeomcrat1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=An Awful Fight: A Combat Between a Tiger and a Lion |publisher=The Eaton Democrat |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88077272/1887-04-14/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1789&amp;index=3&amp;rows=20&amp;words=After+Bangalore+encampment&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1924&amp;proxtext=after+encamping+bangalore&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |date=1887-04-14 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Iola Register'' (1887),&lt;ref name="IolaRegister1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=An Awful Fight: A Combat Between a Tiger and a Lion |publisher=The Iola Register |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83040340/1887-04-22/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1789&amp;index=2&amp;rows=20&amp;words=After+Bangalore+encampment&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1924&amp;proxtext=after+encamping+bangalore&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |date=1887-04-22 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),&lt;ref name="MilanExchange1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=An Awful Fight: A Combat Between a Tiger and a Lion |publisher=The Milan Exchange |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053488/1887-04-23/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1789&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=After+Bangalore+encampment&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1924&amp;proxtext=after+encamping+bangalore&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |date=1887-04-23 |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),&lt;ref name="SydneyMail1889"/&gt; from ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'', and a victory for the lion was reported by Herne (1855).&lt;ref name="CUL1855"&gt;{{cite book |author=Herne, P. |title=Perils and Pleasures of a Hunter's Life; or the Romance of Hunting by Peregrine Herne |publisher=[[Cornell University Library]] |chapter=XXIII: [[Domus]].

Atlas looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs, and [[paw]]s. It was described by ''Gettysburg Compiler'' (1899)&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt; as being "much superior to the [[Cape lion|black-maned lions of South Africa]] (themselves described as being among the largest lions) in bulk and bravery", that it, or its subspecies, was "the largest or most formidable of all [[Africa]]n felidae", and therefore, that it was bigger than the Asiatic lion. However, it is not unanimously held that the Barbary and Cape lions were the largest lions (See ''[[Physical comparison of tigers and lions]]'').&lt;ref name=Haas2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haas, S.K. |author2=Hayssen, V. |author3=Krausman, P.R. |title=''Panthera leo''|year= 2005 |journal=Mammalian Species|volume=762|pages= 1–11|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/762_Panthera_leo.pdf|doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2005)762[0001:PL]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jardine1834&gt;Jardine, W.

(1983), {{ISBN|978-0-85112-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, an [[England|English]] Colonel called 'Maitland', who supported the tiger, described the lion as a 'monster'.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt; 

Both were hungry, as their diets had been reduced from their regular intake of food, beforehand. ''Gettysburg Compiler'' (1899) said "If the tiger was the personification of graceful strength and supple energy, the lion was the embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle."&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

== The fight ==

=== Round One ===
The tiger crawled forward, crouched flat and calculated the distance for a spring at Atlas. Atlas' tail lashed at its sides, as it gave a deep [[Roar (utterance)|roar]] and waited for the tiger to attack. The tiger sprang at Atlas, which then rose up on its hind legs, and crashed with the tiger. The two yelled, snarled and rolled over on the ground. They regained their feet and shook to be free. When they parted from the clinch, Atlas swung his right, clawed, paw on the tiger's head, ripping its ear, and scratching off skin. The tiger rolled off. Atlas went to get it, and swiped its paw, but the tiger managed to twist away from Atlas' paw-swipe, and escaped. Then Atlas advanced, but the tiger retreated.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

=== Round Two ===
The tiger jumped into the air, landing on Atlas' back, though Atlas was about {{convert|20.0|ft|m|abbr=off}} away. At first, Atlas looked disgusted, but then it forced the tiger to the wall of the arena. However, the tiger did not decide to escape again, rather, it ran, with its head nearly at the ground, towards Atlas' legs. Despite a crash, the tiger's head did not shake, and the two cats rose on their hind legs. For at least three minutes, they exchanged right and left paw-swipes. The tiger's paw-swipes were faster than those of Atlas, outnumbering Atlas' paw-swipes three-to-one. Atlas' paw-swipes had been heavier, inflicting deeper gashes on the tiger's hide, than those of the tiger to Atlas' hide.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

Both cats injured, they retreated from each other. Blood flew from their flanks. The tiger retreated to the wall, to hug it, whereas Atlas stood his ground, even though blood was dripping from about twenty wounds, and roared ferociously.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

=== Round Three ===
After resting for a few moments, the tiger tried to circle Atlas, with Atlas looking worried, as his rushes did not stop the tiger at first. Then, sensing an opportunity, Atlas charged, but the tiger avoided the charge, and jumped onto Atlas’ back again. Their bodies, bloodied and dirtied by the dust, rolled halfway across the arena. Atlas shook himself off the tiger, and delivered right swipes. One of the swipes dealt a blow to the tiger, causing it to stagger and retreat.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

After retreating, the tiger sat, studying how effective the previous tussle was. Atlas was mauled, but not yet killed, with two long rips on his back, having deep bites to the shoulder, which bled, and he panted hoarsely, with the wind flowing less evidently than that of the tiger.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

=== Round Four ===
After observing Atlas for a moment, the tiger tried circling Atlas again. Atlas rushed, facing the tiger's claws. After the tussle, the lion, running out of breath, sank to his knees. The tiger, though it looked stronger, had its stripes disappear under fast-flowing blood.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

=== Round Five ===
The tiger sprang onto Atlas, who now staggered. It bit Atlas' nose, then tried to bite Atlas' throat. However, the mane saved Atlas' neck, so the tiger's bite did not suffocate Atlas. Instead, as they [[Wrestling|wrestled]] much, the tiger managed to get hair in its mouth, and the hair interfered with the tiger's respiration, so it had to release its hold on Atlas, allowing Atlas to deliver a massive left [[uppercut]]. The uppercut caused the tiger to stumble to about {{convert|20.0|ft|m|abbr=off}} away.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

=== Round Six ===
The tiger circled Atlas like a snake. Although Atlas looked formidable and brave, he could not follow the tiger's motions. Then the tiger charged at Atlas. Atlas used his claws, but he missed the tiger, and went over with it. The tiger frantically pawed Atlas' body, using both fore and hind paws, for forty seconds. However, Atlas managed to throw the tiger off, but then Atlas tried to roar, before falling down and dying.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, ordered that Atlas' body be buried in Royal fashion, and that the tiger was to be given a "cage of honour" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]]. He accepted that the tiger was the "King of the Cat Family", while speaking to Colonel Maitland, and thought of a match between the tiger and another animal. Colonel Maitland then said that the tiger was not the "King of [[Carnivora]]e", to which the Gaekwad asked "Indeed?" The Colonel replied by saying that he hunted in the [[Rocky Mountains]], and that a [[grizzly bear]] could 'whip' the tiger. Therefore, the Gaekwad decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran grizzly bear weighing over {{convert|1500.0|lb|kg|abbr=in}}. The preparation involved the tiger recovering from its injuries.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

'''''Attack on the Gold Escort''''' is a 1911 Australian silent film.

It was sometimes known as ''Captain Midnight, King of the Bushrangers, or Attack of the Gold Escort'', or ''Captain Starlight's Attack on the Gold Escort''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26347495 |title=ENTERTAINMENTS. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=7 August 1911 |accessdate=2 December 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered a [[lost film]].

The film was called "an Exciting and Thrilling Reproduction of Australian Early Days. A vivid portrayal of bush adventure, acted by Australian artistes, amid Australian scenery" which was filmed "at the exact spot where the incident happened."&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26347496 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=7 August 1911 |accessdate=2 December 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie is often confused with ''[[Captain Midnight, the Bush King]]'' and ''[[Captain Starlight, or Gentleman of the Road]]''. However it seems it was a separate movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/7827486 ''Attack on the Gold Escort''] at [[AustLit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The gold escort from the Bank of Australia is attacked by bushrangers. It is chased down Evandsford Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article149213297 |title=EDISONIA PICTURES. |newspaper=[[Geelong Advertiser]] |date=21 June 1911 |accessdate=2 December 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film made its debut on 19 June 1911 in Geelong.&lt;ref name="geelong"/&gt;

The ''[[Kapunda Herald]]'' said the film "portrayed the terrors of the road, during the time when bushranging was rife, in a vivid and realistic manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108337256 |title=OLYMPIC PICTURES. |newspaper=[[Kapunda Herald]] |location=SA |date=8 September 1911 |accessdate=2 December 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bob and Tom Radio: The Comedy Tour''' is a DVD made as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''[[The Bob &amp; Tom Show]]''. This is a [[Radio syndication|syndicated]] [[United States of America|US]] [[radio]] program established by [[Bob Kevoian]] and [[Tom Griswold]] at radio station [[WFBQ]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], in 1983. The program is among the highest rated in American radio.

The show is hosted by Bob Kevoian and Tom Griswold and its format is that of a [[comedy]] variety show.  Each day, there are usually several guests on the show, including many comedians seeking a national fan base.

Over the past few years, Kevoian and Griswold have organized comedy show tours around the USA, with select groups of 4-5 comedians and usually one of their stalwart show members as an [[emcee]], like [[Kristi Lee]] or [[Chick McGee]].  These are now known collectively as the Bob and Tom Radio Comedy Tours and they play in venues all over the country throughout the year.  The high penetration of their 150-station syndication almost guarantees a full house of folks who are very much in tune with the comedians through their radio presence on the [[Bob and Tom Show]].[http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/b/bob_and_tom.jhtml]

As a way to extend their popular format into the homes of viewers, they have filmed the performances of more than a dozen exceptional standup comedians at the historic [[Paramount Theatre (Anderson, Indiana)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Anderson, Indiana]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20061113175640/http://www.bobandtom.com/gen3/friends.htm]

A "cleaner" and shortened version of the DVD was presented on [[Comedy Central]] shortly before the DVD went on full release to the public.[http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/b/bob_and_tom.jhtml]

==Volume 1 Comedians==
===Greg Hahn===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Greg_Hahn.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Greg Hahn]] --&gt;
While a buyer for Lockheed Corporation, he thought “Why make $200 a day, when I can be a comedian and make that in a week!”
[http://www.greghahn.com/04/media.htm]
His manic presentation on the DVD takes ones breath away as you try to assimilate madcap offering in just a moment of his show.  "High Five, Myself, No Friends" has Greg giving himself a "High Five" and he deserves it.

===Mike Armstrong===
Armstrong was formerly a police officer and brings to the stage a hilarious set of anecdotes about his time as a sworn officer, his wife of many years, ("I've been married so long, I don't look when I cross the street!"), his neighbors, and his kids. [http://www.mikearmstrong.com/presskit.htm] When, during his stage performance, he tells about meeting a burglar in his own home, naked and with an axe, you will not wonder why the burglar called the police on him!

===Roy Wood Jr.===
Roy was born and raised in the South and he provides a hilarious insight into his life as a person of color living there. [https://web.archive.org/web/20061025053700/http://www.roywoodjr.com/index2.htm]
During his performance, Wood brings an exceptional understanding of everything from a late night police stop to multiple births triggered by fertility drugs to the stage.

===Drew Hastings===
A 50-year-old, self-proclaimed [[Metrosexual]], who abandoned the fast-paced life of [[Southern California]] to "get off the grid" and move to [[Ohio]] and become a gentleman farmer, Hastings wit leads you gently down the wrong path with every joke.
[http://drewhastings.com/biography/]
During his performance, he wonders how could his girlfriend have misunderstood his use of the telescopic sights on his rifle rather than the mislaid binoculars to view her across the field ('serpentining").

===Bob Zany===
Zany's decades in the standup comedy world have given him a position, but it is the freshness of his material, much of which is drawn from the daily news, which continues to raise his stature.
[https://web.archive.org/web/20061113104104/http://www.bobzany.com/v3/]
During the DVD performance, he interacts directly with the audience as many stage comics have done over the years, but always to punctuate his bits rather than to belittle the audience member.

[[File:Key West.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Busking|Busker]] on [[Duval Street]], [[Key West, Florida]] with displayed permit on guitar]]
In the United States there have been numerous [[legal cases]] about regulations and laws that have decided the [[rights]] of [[busking|buskers]] to perform in public. Most of these laws and regulations have been found to be [[Constitutional law|unconstitutional]] when challenged. In the US, [[free speech]] is considered a [[fundamental right]] of every individual, guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] constitutional amendments, and in the majority of legal cases it has been concluded that practicing artistic free speech is legal. Busking is legally considered to be artistic free speech and clearly not panhandling or begging.

In the United States, reasons to regulate or ban busking behavior include public safety issues and noise issues in certain areas such as hospital zones and residential zones. In residential zones, a reasonable curfew may be allowed. Such laws must be narrowly tailored to eliminate only the perceived evils by limiting the time, place, and manner that busking may be practiced. They must also leave open reasonable alternative venues. The only exceptions to these free speech rules are [[sedition]], as defined by the [[Smith Act]], public displays of [[pornography]] and [[obscenity]] as defined by the [[Miller test]] for obscenity, criminal behavior such as [[fraud]] or [[defamation]], certain commercial advertising and the common laws talked about above. In the US, laws regulating or banning busking must be applied evenly to all forms of free speech according to the first and fourteenth constitutional amendments and the judicial decisions listed below.

Busking cannot be prohibited in an area where other forms of free speech are not prohibited. For example, if busking is regulated or banned but people are allowed to conduct free speech behavior for pickets, protests, religious, political, educational, sports, commercial or other purposes, then the law is illegal. In the United States any form of regulation on artistic free speech must not be judgmental, and permits must not be so restrictive, complex, difficult or expensive to obtain that they inhibit free speech. It is also unlawful per federal court decision for law officers to seize a performer's instruments.&lt;ref name="TurleyV"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000). [http://www.buskersadvocates.org/saalegalCtTurleyappeal.html Turley v. New York City]. Street Performers and Buskers Advocates. Retrieved 2010-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 Conspiracy Against Rights, it is unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, or because of his/her having exercised the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/statutes.htm |title=FBI – Federal Statutes |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914205918/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/statutes.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under United States law, it is the express duty of all officers of the law or individuals such as security guards, legislators, mayors, Council Persons, judges, Hospitals and Nursing Home Proprietors, etc., to protect and preserve an individual's constitutional rights Under ''Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under [[Color (law)|Color of Law]]''. Most of these individuals take oaths to uphold the US Constitution. It is clearly a violation of federal law for these individuals to violate people's constitutional or civil rights under the color of the law.&lt;ref name="T18"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/statutes.htm#section242 Title 18, U.S.C., Section 242 - Deprivation of Rights under Color of Law.] Federal Civil Rights Statutes.

| 1970
| In the late 1920s and early 1930s, busking had grown to be quite a controversial enterprise in New York. The country was in the midst of a horrible economic depression and many people had turned to busking as a source of income. Buskers were everywhere and fights over pitches were alarmingly common between the buskers themselves and the buskers, merchants, and vendors. Out of frustration over the complaining, fighting, and violence, [[Fiorello H. La Guardia|Mayor Fiorello La Guardia]] had banned busking in New York on the grounds of safety issues regarding the escalating conflicts. Busking went on, but on a much smaller scale. If anybody complained about a busker, at their discretion, the police could order the busker to move on or could even arrest him or her. In 1970 poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] challenged the constitutionality of this ban. The ban was lifted in 1970 after being found to be unconstitutional by Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]].&lt;ref name="KQEDHSH"&gt;[http://www.kqed.org/assets/pdf/arts/programs/spark/412.pdf Episode: Home, Sweet Home.](PDF). p. 4. ''Spark in Education, Educator Guide''; [[KQED (TV)|KQED]].

| In ''Davenport v. City of [[Alexandria, Virginia]],'' a judge ruled that a ban on busking and other business-related activities on the streets of the central city area was unconstitutional.

In the decision, buskers won injunctive relief from the city's enforcement of the ban in some of the contested areas. They also obtained relief from a permit scheme on the use of amplifiers because the scheme was judgmental and at the discretion of the issuers.&lt;ref name="FriedrichV"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000).

After local businesses had complained about the competition from buskers, they got the city to push through an ordinance to ban busking on a very popular area, allegedly for safety reasons. But the buskers prevailed in court by proving the safety concerns were not founded.&lt;ref name="WaikikiV"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/gen/10909prs20011228.html ACLU Wins Artistic Expression Lawsuit On Behalf of Waikiki Street Performers].

| A judge rejected [[Seattle Center]] rules on buskers. "Magic Mike" Berger, a magician and balloon-twisting busker, took the Seattle Center to court and won [[injunction|injunctive relief]] and a court ordered settlement of over US $47,000. Seattle Center had some of the most liberal rules regarding busking but even they could not pass constitutional muster. The Business Improvement District formed to manage Seattle Center claimed that they had the right to manage 62 square blocks in the center of the city like private property. They wanted to limit buskers by giving preference to approved buskers, regulating the times, places, and numbers of buskers performing. The judge rejected the regulations, pointing out that... "while a street performer cannot offer a meek oral request for a donation from passers by, a beggar who does not perform can solicit Seattle Center visitors with relative impunity, subject only to general criminal prohibitions on aggressive panhandling."&lt;ref name="SeattleCtr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002250762_busker23m.html|title=Judge rejects Seattle Center rules on buskers|last=Gilmore| first=Susan| date=April 23, 2005| work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">The '''Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals''' (CAFF) is an international body that promotes and safeguards the ideals and principles of [[fringe theatre]] in North America.

==History==
The 1982 [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]], modelled after the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], was the first successful instance of Fringe theatre in North America.  Based on its success, an informal network of other Canadian and American Fringe festivals arose.  Concerned about the growth of festivals that might claim the "Fringe" title without being aligned with the original spirit of Fringe Theatre, festival directors from this network founded the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals in 1990.  The organization was incorporated as a non-profit in 1994.  In 1998, CAFF successfully trademarked the terms "Fringe" and "Fringe Festival" in Canada to ensure that any theatre festival wishing to refer to itself as a "Fringe" would agree to abide by both CAFF's guiding principles and the CAFF mandate.

==Principles and Mandate==
At the time of its formation, CAFF defined four minimum guiding principles for Fringe Festivals:

# Participants will be selected on a non-juried basis, through a first-come, first served process, a lottery, or other method approved by the Association
# In order to ensure Criteria One (above), the audiences must have the option to pay a ticket price, 100% of which goes directly to the artists.
# Fringe Festival producers have no control over the artistic content of each performance. The artistic freedom of the participants is unrestrained.
# Festivals must provide an easily accessible opportunity for all audiences and all artists to participate in Fringe Festivals.

The mandate of CAFF is as follows:

* To safeguard the integrity of Fringe Festivals as outlined in the four minimum criteria
* To recognize that the health of all member Festivals is important to the Circuit and therefore the artists' health as a whole
* To encourage communication and cooperation between member Festivals thereby fostering the continuity of our guiding principles

==List of member festivals==
As of January 2017, CAFF consisted of 33 festivals from across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Festival Directory|url=http://fringefestivals.com/fringe-festivals/|website=Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touring Lottery==
While individual festivals are mostly programmed independently, CAFF reserves spots in each member festival's lineup for the winners of its annual touring lottery.  Winning artists are permitted to enter any of the festivals instead of going through each individual festival's lottery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2013/09/24/performant-those-who-have-rocked-we-salute-you/|title=The Performant: For Those Who Have Rocked, We Salute You|website=www.sfbg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In 2012, CAFF engaged the Canadian federal government to request a parity negotiation in the treatment of American performers entering Canada and Canadian performers entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/secure/orl/lrrs/do/vwRg?cno=298185&amp;regId=700207|title=Registration - Consultant |website=www.ic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordan''' is a country with strong political support and a variety of locations that have been used by filmmakers from all over the world. Films that have been shot in Jordan include ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' which was filmed in [[Petra]]' in 1988.  ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' directed by [[David Lean]] was filmed in the [[Wadi Rum]] desert in 1961.&lt;ref name="Filmed"&gt;[http://www.tours-fm.com/eng/movieandtv.htm Filmed in Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent films that were shot in Jordan are ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]], ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'' directed by [[Brian De Palma]], some second unit scenes from ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', ''[[Fair Game (2010 film)|Fair Game]]'' starring [[Sean Penn]], and ''[[Battle for Haditha]]'' directed by [[Nick Broomfield]].&lt;ref name="Transform"&gt;[http://www.filminjordan.com/ Film in Jordan web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20058971,00.html "Combat Zoning: Hollywood Conjures the Middle East" Entertainment Weekly, By Youyoung Lee, September 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/145206.html Jordan News, "Jordan's Film Industry Aims for the Stars", January 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMon"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0731/p10s01-wome.html Christian Science Monitor "Hollywood in Baghdad"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jordanian films such as ''[[Captain Abu Raed]]'' were also conceived and filmed in the country. 

In 2003, Jordan developed the [[Royal Film Commission – Jordan]] to encourage filmmaking in the country and to train Jordanian filmmakers in the art of making cinema.  Before the RFC, the Amman Filmmakers Cooperative had been active in promoting digital filmmaking through free workshops in Amman and marginalized communities in Jordan. Films by the [[Amman Filmmakers Cooperative]] have been well received internationally and won numerous awards. 

The commission was created to promote Jordan as a place where people from the Middle East can freely make films in collaboration with the world's most talented filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/145206.html Jordan News, "Jordan's Film Industry Aims for the Stars", January 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Jordan lacks significant support services such as studios, labs and film equipment vendors, the country has recently been used to recreate many areas in the Middle East which might be too unpredictable to film in, such as [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/145206.html Jordan News, "Jordan's Film Industry Aims for the Stars", January 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  Director [[Brian De Palma]] said that choosing Jordan to fill in for Iraq made sense; "The terrain is very similar to Iraq; plus they have close to a million Iraqi refugees there."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20058971,00.html "Combat Zoning: Hollywood Conjures the Middle East" Entertainment Weekly, By Youyoung Lee, September 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 was a big year for the Jordanian filmmaking community, with 10 feature films having been shot on location there, three of the films having been homegrown productions.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/145206.html Jordan News, "Jordan's Film Industry Aims for the Stars", January 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jordan created the [[Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts]], a graduate school offering a Master of Fine Arts in Cinematic Arts.&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/145206.html Jordan News, "Jordan's Film Industry Aims for the Stars", January 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Jordan has received praise for its film called [[Theeb]] directed by [[Naji Abu Nowar]] which talks about the Ottoman province of Hijaz during World War I, when a young Bedouin boy experiences a greatly hastened coming of age as he embarks on a perilous desert journey to guide a British officer to his secret destination. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170902/&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016, for the first time ever for Jordan, the film was nominated in the [[List of submissions to the 88th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|88th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/news/9-foreign-language-films-advance-oscarr-race-1|accessdate=2015-12-17|date=2015-12-17|title=9 FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILMS ADVANCE IN OSCAR RACE|publisher=oscars.org|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Comment c'est loin''''' is a 2015 French quasi-autobiographical [[Comedy (genre)|comedy]] film written by French rapper [[Orelsan]] and directed by Orelsan and Christophe Offenstein. The film stars Orelsan and fellow French rapper [[Gringe]], both of whom form the rap duo [[Casseurs Flowters]], and is based on their debut studio album ''[[Orelsan et Gringe sont les Casseurs Flowters]]'', which was released on 15 November 2013.

The film is set over a 24-hour period in the city of [[Caen]], [[Normandy]], and follows Aurélien, known as Orel (Orelsan, as he was formerly known), and Guillaume, known as Gringe (himself). They seek to finish recording their first song together at the request of their producers [[Skread]] (himself) and [[Ablaye]] (himself), but struggle to do so as they wander around the town with friends looking for quick ways to make money and a good time.

''Comment c'est loin'' was premiered at the Saint-Jean-de-Luz International Film Festival on October 10, 2015, as well as being shown at the Sarlat Film Festival on November 13, 2015, before being released to the French public on December 9, 2015. The film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, and grossed $1,001,196 in the domestic box office within its first three weeks.

==Synopsis==
After half a decade of doing next to nothing, Orelsan and Gringe are in their mid-thirties as they struggle to complete their first [[Rapping|rap]] album. Their songs are mostly stories of sex and alcohol, reflecting their everyday lives in the city of [[Caen]]. They have never really finished a song and when they meet with their producers, they are faced with a new challenge. Their old issues, the fear of failure, their alcoholic friends and annoying girlfriends serve to stand in their way as they set out to finish their first song within the next 24 hours.

[[File:Orelsan promotion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Orelsan]], who made his directing debut with ''Comment c'est loin'', confirmed the beginning of production on [[Instagram]] on 21 March 2015.]]
''Comment c'est loin'' was filmed on location in the city of [[Caen]], [[Lower Normandy]], where Orelsan went to college and met record producer [[Skread]], one of the film's other composers. Orelsan announced the beginning of production on his [[Instagram]] page on 21 March 2015, posting a picture of a copy of the film's script with the working title ''Orel et Gringe'' (''Orel and Gringe'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/0f_h_RxKsv/ |title=Instagram photo by OrelSan • Mar 21, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC |date=21 March 2015 |language=French |publisher=Orelsan / [[Instagram]] |accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted another picture on 4 May, this time of himself next to Gringe, presumably during a certain scene in the film, announcing in the caption that filming was complete and confirming the film's title as ''Comment c'est loin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/2RD32RxKqr/ |title=OrelSan on Instagram: "Tournage terminé!

{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2016}}
Throughout [[history of ESPN|its history]], [[ESPN]] and its sister networks have been the targets of criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hooch.net/here-are-20-behind-the-scene-scandals-that-took-place-at-espn/?view-all|title=Behind the Scene Scandals That Took Place At ESPN|last= |first= |date= |website=Hooch.net|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for programming choices, [[Media bias|biased]] coverage, [[conflict of interest]], and controversies with individual broadcasters and analysts.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Michael |title=ESPN: The Uncensored History |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing  |date=December 11, 2001 |isbn=978-0878332700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ESPN has been criticized for focusing too much on men's college and professional sports, and very little on women's sports. Other criticism has focused on issues of race and ethnicity in ESPN's varying mediated forms, as well as carriage fees and issues regarding the exportation of ESPN content.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;{{cite book |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |editor-last1=McGuire |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=Armfield |editor-first2=Greg |editor-last3=Earnheardt |editor-first3=Adam C. |title=The ESPN Effect: Exploring the Worldwide Leader in Sports |publisher=Peter Lang |date=July 17, 2015 |pages=265–270 |chapter=Chapter 20 Afterword: Challenging the Worldwide Leader in Sports |isbn=978-1433126000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that ESPN's success is their ability to provide other enterprise and investigative sports news while competing with other hard sports-news-producing outlets such as [[Yahoo! Sports]] and [[Fox Sports]]. Some scholars have challenged ESPN's journalistic integrity calling for an expanded standard of professionalism to prevent biased coverage and conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oates |first1=T. P. |last2=Pauly |first2=J. |date=2007 |title=Sports journalism as moral and ethical discourse. |journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics |volume=22 |pages=332–347 |doi=10.1080/08900520701583628}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Freeman (columnist)|Mike Freeman]]'s 2001 book ''ESPN: The Uncensored History'', which alleged sexual harassment, drug use and gambling, was the first critical study of ESPN.

==Cost and finances==
ESPN currently charges the highest [[retransmission consent]] fee of any major cable television network in the United States. In 2011, the main channel alone carried a monthly rate of $4.69 per subscriber (nearly five times the price of the next-costliest channel, TNT), with ESPN's other English language channels costing an additional $1.13 per subscriber; these prices rise on a nearly constant basis. By 2017, ESPN's fees had risen to over $7 for the main channel and roughly $3 for its sister outlets.&lt;ref name=joenocera17&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-28/espn-can-t-afford-to-go-on-like-this|title=ESPN Can't Afford to Go On Like This|work=Bloomberg.com|first=Joe|last=Nocera|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the cause of this high fee is the amount of money that ESPN pays for sports rights, particularly the NFL. In August 2011, ESPN agreed to pay the NFL $1.9 billion annually for the rights to carry ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' through 2021; this despite the fact that the broadcast networks pay approximately half that price for their packages, which include lucrative and highly watched contests such as the [[Super Bowl]], conference championships and [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving games]] while ESPN's package does not (ESPN's package does include the [[NFL Draft]]). Cable and satellite television providers condemned ESPN's most recent contract extension with the NFL and have contemplated moving the network to a higher programming tier to mitigate cost increases.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Claire (September 10, 2011).

Retrieved September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ESPN reportedly paid about $7.3 billion over 12 years for the broadcasting rights to all seven [[bowl game]]s of the [[College Football Playoff]], an average of about $608 million per year. That includes $215 million per year which they previously agreed to air the Rose, Sugar and Orange bowls,&lt;ref name="sbd"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN homes in on 12-year BCS package|author1=John Ourand |author2=Michael Smith |publisher=Sports Business Daily|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2013|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Special-Content/News/2012/BCS-ESPN.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus $470–475 million annually for the rest of the package.&lt;ref name="revenue-cbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN reaches 12-year deal to air college football playoffs|author=Jerry Hinnen|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-football/21083689/espn-reaches-12year-deal-to-air-college-football-playoffs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, ESPN and [[Major League Baseball]] agreed to an eight-year extension, increasing ESPN's average yearly payment from about $360 million to approximately $700 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8453054/major-league-baseball-completes-eight-year-deal-fox-turner-sports|title=MLB agrees to TV deals with Fox, Turner Sports|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in October 2014, ESPN signed a nine-year extension with the [[NBA]], worth three times as much as the previous deal.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/06/media/nba-tv-deal/ NBA renews television deals with ESPN, TNT. ''CNN Money''. Retrieved December 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

These deals were made when new sports channels like [[NBCSN]] and [[Fox Sports 1]] emerged, and so analysts believe that ESPN deliberately drove the prices up as a defensive measure to block these competitors from acquiring live rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/10/26/Media/ESPN.aspx The moves that forced ESPN's cuts]. ''Sports Business Journal''. Retrieved December 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wall Street]] analysts have also raised concerns that the amount ESPN is paying for all of these rights could be a major drain on [[The Walt Disney Company]] as a whole, since the amount of money that can be recuperated from retransmission consent fees and advertising is limited; Disney still profits from the ESPN division but as of 2015 was cutting the network's higher-priced content to ensure long-term profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Rex (June 29, 2015).

Retrieved July 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 employees, citing the rights costs combined with the increasing trend of [[cord-cutting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/10/22/espn-layoffs-will-gut-the-networks-production-staff/ ESPN layoffs will gut the network's production staff].

[[John Skipper]]'s time as President of ESPN was tumultuous. During Skipper's tenure (from January 2012 to December 2017) ESPN lost nearly 15% of its subscribers and laid off more than 500 employees. Additionally, ESPN's TV ratings declined significantly across the board and the network endured criticism from some quarters over the declining quality of its programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/05/30/espn-keeps-hemorrhaging-subscribers/|title=ESPN keeps hemorrhaging subscribers|date=May 30, 2017|website=NYPost.com|access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/espn-president-john-skipper-resigns-capping-a-tumultuous-year-for-network/2017/12/18/01082046-e431-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html|title=ESPN President John Skipper resigns, capping a tumultuous year for network|first=Rick|last=Maese|date=December 18, 2017|publisher=|access-date=December 24, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/espn-new-layoffs-disney-1202611398/|title=New Layoffs Expected at ESPN (Report)|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|date=November 9, 2017|website=Variety.com|access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/27/espn-may-be-nearing-new-round-of-layoffs-source-sa/|title=ESPN may be nearing new round of layoffs; source says 'it's not going to be pretty'|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|website=WashingtonTimes.com|access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiglead.com/2017/05/09/sc6-michael-smith-jemele-hill-ratings-espn-sportscenter/|title=SC6 at 3 Months: Michael Smith and Jemele Hill Haven't Saved ESPN SportsCenter Ratings Yet|date=May 9, 2017|website=TheBigLead.com|access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bias towards certain teams and players==
ESPN has been accused of having a [[media bias|bias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Writer |first=Guest |url=http://laist.com/2009/09/23/espn_throws_la_under_the_bus.php |title=ESPN Throws LA Under the Bus |publisher=Laist.com |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926074824/http://laist.com/2009/09/23/espn_throws_la_under_the_bus.php |archivedate=September 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; towards certain sports teams and a "love affair" with superstar players. ESPN's [[ombudsman]], [[Le Anne Schreiber]], responded to these criticisms by saying that the industry is ratings-driven.&lt;ref name="Le Anne Schreiber"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=schreiber_leanne&amp;id=3534299 |title=Geography lesson: Breaking down the bias in ESPN's coverage |publisher=ESPN |author=Le Anne Schreiber |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013120615/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=schreiber_leanne&amp;id=3534299 |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since [[MLB Network]] launched on January 1, 2009, ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' has been the target of criticism because of its perceived bias in favor of certain teams such as the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[New York Yankees]], in particular. One opinion was expressed by former major-leaguer [[Heath Bell]]:
{{quote
|I truly believe ESPN only cares about promoting the Red Sox and Yankees—and nobody else. That's why I like the MLB Network, because they promote everybody. I'm really turned off by ESPN and ''Baseball Tonight''. When [[Jake Peavy]] threw 8⅓ [[innings]] on Saturday, they showed one pitch in the third inning and that was it. It's all about the Red Sox and Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/apr/13/padres-report-rotation05252/?padres|last=Krasovic|first=Tom|title=Black tinkers with pitching rotation|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite achievements by female athletes, ESPN underrepresents them in its coverage. A longitudinal analysis found that women's sports received less than 2% of the coverage on SportsCenter. When they are covered, critics argue that female athletes have been featured through the lens of femininity, characterized by a display of sociability and passivity.&lt;ref name="30for30"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lavelle |first=Katherine L. |editor-last1=McGuire |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=Armfield |editor-first2=Greg |editor-last3=Earnheardt |editor-first3=Adam C. |title=The ESPN Effect: Exploring the Worldwide Leader in Sports |publisher=Peter Lang |date=July 17, 2015 |pages=127–138 |chapter=Chapter 10 The ESPN Effect Representation of Women in 30 for 30 Films |isbn=978-1433126000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage disputes==
===Dish Network===
On August 4, 2009, [[Dish Network]] sued ESPN for $1 million in a federal [[breach of contract]] lawsuit, alleging that the network violated the "Most Favored Nations" clause by not extending the same carriage terms that it provided to Comcast and DirecTV for [[ESPNU]] and [[ESPN Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/326537-Dish_Sues_ESPN_Over_Classic_ESPNU_Carriage_Terms.php|title=Dish Sues ESPN Over Classic, ESPNU Carriage Terms - Satellite Operator Alleges Programmer Violated `Most-Favored Nations' Contract Clause|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, ESPN announced it would fight the lawsuit and stated in a [[press release]] that "we have repeatedly advised Dish that we are in full compliance with our agreement and have offered them a distribution opportunity with respect to ESPNU and ESPN Classic consistent with the rest of the industry. We will not renegotiate settled contracts and will vigorously defend this legal action, the apparent sole purpose of which is to get a better deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/326582-ESPN_We_ll_Fight_Dish_Lawsuit.php|title=ESPN: We'll Fight Dish Lawsuit - Sports Programmer Maintains It's In `Full Compliance' On Carriage Contract For ESPNU, Classic|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dish Network moved ESPNU from its "America's Top 250" package to its "America's Top 120" package on September 30, 2009. However, the provider claimed that the change had nothing to do with the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/356100-ESPN_Dish_s_Move_Of_ESPNU_Unrelated_To_Lawsuit.php|title=Multichannel News September 30, 2009 ESPN: Dish's Move Of ESPNU Unrelated To Lawsuit - Satellite Operator Claimed ESPN Violated Terms of Contract|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2010, ESPN majority owner [[The Walt Disney Company]] pulled the [[high-definition television|high definition]] feeds of [[ESPNews]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]] and [[ABC Family]] from Dish Network's lineup, although the standard definition feeds of all four channels remained on the provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100622-712323.html|title=Disney, Dish Network Battle Over Fees For High-Def Channels|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626070808/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100622-712323.html|archivedate=June 26, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Disney signed a comprehensive carriage deal with Dish Network for its networks (along with several new networks, such as [[Disney Junior]], [[Longhorn Network]], and [[SEC Network]]), including high definition feeds and [[TV Everywhere]] access for the networks and ABC owned-and-operated stations, and the ability to distribute their networks on a planned [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[Sling TV|internet television service]].

===Verizon FiOS===
In April 2015, ESPN Inc. sued Verizon for offering ESPN and ESPN2 as part of an optional sports theme package under its new "Custom TV" offering for its [[Verizon FiOS|FiOS]] service, breaching a requirement for the two networks to be carried as part of the basic service.&lt;ref name=verge-fiosespn&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN sues Verizon over its plan to create slim bundles of cable channels|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/27/8503427/espn-sues-verizon-cable-bundles-contract|website=The Verge|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of ABC Sports==
{{details|ESPN on ABC#Siphoning}}

In August 2006, ESPN announced that ABC Sports would be fully integrated into ESPN, using the channel's graphics and music for its sports presentations, in addition to handling production responsibilities for the ABC sports telecasts. The last live sporting event televised under the ABC Sports banner was the U.S. Championship Game of the [[2006 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]] on August 26, 2006 (ABC was slated to carry the Little League World Series Championship Game on August 27, but the game was postponed to August 28 due to rain, and subsequently aired on [[ESPN2]]). The changeover took effect the following weekend to coincide with the start of the [[college football]] season, with [[NBA on ABC|NBA]], [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar Series]] and [[NASCAR on ABC|NASCAR]] coverage eventually following suit.

Despite the rebranding, [[George Bodenheimer]]'s official title remained "President, ESPN Inc. and ABC Sports" until his retirement at the end of 2011, upon which the "ABC Sports" portion of the title was retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/disney-promotes-a-new-leader-at-espn/?pagewanted=all|title=Disney Promotes a New Leader at ESPN|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Brian|last2=Stelter|work=Media Decoder|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ABC itself maintains the copyright over many of the ESPN-branded broadcasts, if they are not contractually assigned to the applicable league or organizer. ABC-affiliated stations owned by [[Hearst Television]] (such as [[WTAE-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]; [[WCVB-TV]] in [[Boston]]; [[WMUR-TV]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[New Hampshire]]; [[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]] and [[KMBC-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]) have the [[right of first refusal]] over the local simulcasts of ESPN-televised ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games involving teams within their home market, which are very rarely waived to other local stations in their market areas. Equally, other Hearst-owned stations affiliated with other networks (such as NBC affiliate [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]) have been able to air NFL games from ESPN for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html|title=Ravens Vs. Panthers On WBAL|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315222841/http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html|archivedate=March 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN has been criticized for decreasing the number of sports broadcasts on ABC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2008/11/is-espn-forcing-abc-to-get-out-of-the-sports-business/|title=Is ESPN Forcing ABC To Get Out of the Sports Business?|last=Fang|first=Ken|date=November 12, 2008|website=Fang's Bites|publisher=|access-date=|quote=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727165932/http://fangsbites.com/2008/11/is-espn-forcing-abc-to-get-out-of-the-sports-business/|archivedate=July 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rapak|first=Dan|date= |title=Brought to You By . . .|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dH40Fl8vG2IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Brought+to+You+by+.+.+.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h5dRVeWQLI-sogTs9YG4Aw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ESPN&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page=375|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxbanterblog.com/2011/06/07/bronx-banter-book-review-the-espn-book/|title=Bronx Banter Book Review: The ESPN Book|last=Weiss |first=Will|date=June 7, 2011|website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the summer months. One such example is [[NASCAR]]: from 2007 to 2009, ABC aired all of the Chase for the [[Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Sprint Cup]] races, along with the penultimate race to the chase. From 2010 to 2014, ABC only broadcast three Sprint Cup races with only one Chase race (held in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]]) to the outrage of many NASCAR [[Fan (person)|fans]] and sponsors. Several other events such as the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], the [[Citrus Bowl]] and The Open Championship, have also been moved from ABC to ESPN. This, however, is not entirely the fault of ESPN, as ABC in general has attracted a primarily female viewership in recent years, with sports largely attracting a male-dominated audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/abc-adds-14-new-shows-for-next-season-88787.html|title=ABC adds 14 new shows for next season|author=The Associated Press|publisher=|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under NFL broadcasting rules, game telecasts aired on cable must be simulcast on broadcast television in the local markets of the teams playing, though the game cannot be televised in the market of the home team if it does not sell out tickets 72 hours before the time of kickoff – games that are not sold out must be [[NFL blackout|blacked out in the market of origin]]. Similar rules and rights were previously in place for ESPN-televised [[Major League Baseball]] playoff games.

==Coverage of individual sports==

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
[[Dave O'Brien (sportscaster)|Dave O'Brien]] joined [[Marcelo Balboa]] on the primary broadcast team for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] coverage on ESPN and ABC Sports, despite having no experience calling [[association football|soccer]] matches prior to that year. Because The Walt Disney Company, owner of both [[television]] outlets, retained control over on-air talent, the appointment of O'Brien as the main play-by-play voice was made over the objections of [[Soccer United Marketing]], which wanted [[JP Dellacamera]] to continue in that role. Disney stated that its broadcast strategy was intended, in voice and style, to target the vast majority of Americans who do not follow the sport on a regular basis. [[Mispronunciation]] and incorrect addressing of names, misuse of soccer terminology, and lack of insight into tactics and history plagued the telecasts, resulting in heavy criticism from [[English language|English-speaking]] soccer fans, many of whom ended up watching the games on [[Univision]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB115205934369497935-_njfnkPigZnf0vvT834q7XsCxb8_20070704.html |title=Fatsis, Stefan.

===Arena Football League coverage===
{{see also|Arena Football League on ESPN}}
Some [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] fans complained that ESPN's 2007 and 2008 game broadcast schedule "inequitably favors teams" such as the [[Philadelphia Soul]], [[Chicago Rush]] and [[Colorado Crush]], teams whose ownerships respectively include [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Mike Ditka]] and [[John Elway]]. Fourteen of the seventeen ESPN games featured at least one of the three teams playing in the broadcasts. The Soul (whose part-owner and team president is former ''[[Arena Football League on ESPN]]'' analyst Ron Jaworski) appeared in seven of the 17 regular season games aired on ESPN platforms, more than any other team in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cable360.net/cfax/|title=CableFAX Daily - Cablefax|work=Cablefax|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism was also present when [[AFL on NBC|NBC]] opted to not let certain teams appear on their schedule. In 2008, the Chicago Rush had nine regular season games on ESPN and ABC, while the 2007 Arena Bowl Champion [[San Jose SaberCats]] appeared in just one – a Week 1 game against the Rush; and the [[New York Dragons]] appeared in one broadcast, a 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm game versus the Crush. Other criticism includes the scheduling of games on various days and times, as opposed to a weekly AFL gameday.

===Major League Baseball coverage===
{{see also|ESPN Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio}}

====''Bonds on Bonds''====
In 2006, former [[San Francisco Giants]] outfielder [[Barry Bonds]] starred in ''[[Bonds on Bonds]]'', a 10-part [[reality television|reality series]] that aired on ESPN. At the time, Bonds was mired in allegations of steroid use during his Major League Baseball career. ESPN was criticized &lt;ref name="mckay"&gt;{{cite news |last=McKay |first=Hollie |date=2006-11-20 |title=Sports Divas Have Bats, Balls and Bad Attitudes |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/20/sports-divas-have-bats-balls-and-bad-attitudes.html |newspaper=Fox News |access-date=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for allowing Bonds such a one-sided public pulpit, as it was the most powerful name in American sports journalism; the show was seen by some as ESPN giving up any semblance of journalism in favor of becoming a [[public relations]] front for major sports teams and players. ESPN responded to the criticism by claiming that Bonds would not have creative control and that the episodes would be fair, balanced, and only document the day-to-day activities of Bonds as they occurred, not as Bonds wanted them to occur. ESPN and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions officially pulled the plug on the reality series, citing "creative control" issues with star Barry Bonds and his representatives.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0218953/ |title='Bonds' out for season due to 'control' problems |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other details about the decision were given. ''Bonds on Bonds'' had been absent from the network's schedule since May 30, 2006 and had been generating poor ratings.

===NASCAR coverage===
{{see also|NASCAR on ESPN}}

====Local station pre-emptions====
The [[2007 Subway 500]] from [[Martinsville Speedway]] was not shown on ABC [[owned-and-operated station]] [[KABC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]] (owned by ESPN co-parent The Walt Disney Company) on October 21 due to coverage of a series of [[California wildfires of October 2007|wildfires]] that affected [[Southern California]], specifically the [[Buckweed fire]] in [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and the [[Canyon Fire (2007)|Canyon Fire]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. The race was instead shown on its second [[digital subchannel]] (branded as "ABC7+"), which was not available on satellite providers or on select cable providers in the area.

Several stations chose to pre-empt ''[[NASCAR Countdown]]'' to carry their local newscasts. KABC-TV pre-empted the pre-race program before every Saturday night race, and as well as before the [[2007 Ford 400]], which was held on a Sunday afternoon, to air an episode of the Disney Channel series ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'' from the network's [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] block to fulfill [[E/I]] programming requirements enforced by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. ABC affiliates [[WPLG]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and [[KSAT-TV]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] also pre-empted ''NASCAR Countdown'' at least once during the 2007 NASCAR season.

[[KTKA-TV]] in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], located about {{convert|55|mi|km}} from [[Emporia, Kansas|Emporia]], the hometown of NASCAR Cup driver (and 2007 Chase participant) [[Clint Bowyer]] and about 55 miles from the [[Kansas Speedway]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], broke away from ABC's coverage of the [[2007 Bank of America 500]] early on October 13 to air its nightly 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm newscast and did not resume its broadcast of the race. KSAT also aired a brief news update, which came during a [[racing flags#Red flag|red flag]], but returned in time for the checkered flag.

The 2008 Sharpie MINI 300 was not seen on several ABC stations for various reasons, ranging from weather bulletins (such as those aired on [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WSOC-TV]] in Charlotte) to stations airing coverage of the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]] at the time of the race (such as with [[KLKN]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]; where the race moved to an ESPN2 alternate feed, which is normally used when [[syndication exclusivity]] rules force an ESPN blackout). In addition, ABC's [[New York City]] [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] [[WABC-TV]] carried the race, but pre-empted ''NASCAR Countdown'' and the rain delay to cover a construction accident at a [[high-rise building]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dalyplanet.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-long-days-journey-into-night.html |title=Another Long Day's Journey Into Night for ABC, ESPN |author=John M. Daly |publisher=The Daly Planet |date=March 15, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a red flag during lap 284, the [[2008 Checker Auto Parts 500|2008 Checker O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 Presented by Pennzoil]], viewers in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Central Time Zone]]s were forced to watch the finish of the race on Lap 284 on ESPN2 as ABC ended its broadcast of the race to air ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time, while the network continued the race to its conclusion (ending at 313 laps) in the [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s.

===NBA coverage===

====ABC's NBA coverage====
Some complaints regarding ESPN have concerned the promotion, or perceived lack thereof, of NBA telecasts. The [[2003 NBA Finals]] received very little significant promotion on ABC or corporate partner ESPN; while subsequent Finals were promoted more often on both networks, NBA-related advertisements on ABC were still significantly fewer compared to promotions on NBC.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} NBA promos took up 3 minutes and 55 seconds of airtime on ABC during the week of May 23, [[2003-04 NBA season|2004]], according to the ''Sports Business Daily'', comparable to 2 minutes and 45 seconds for the [[2004 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]]. Promotions for the Indianapolis 500 outnumbered promotions for the NBA Finals fourteen-to-nine from the timeframe between 9:00 and 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time during that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=sbd.main&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;storyid=SBD2004060908 |title=The Daily Monitors ABC's Promotional Push Around NBA Finals |publisher=Sports Business Daily |date= |accessdate= November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] in November 2004, ESPN's studio team came under severe criticism, both by the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/mchat/20041123005/tscript.htm |title=NBA: David DuPree |publisher=USAToday.com |date=November 23, 2004 |accessdate= November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the network itself&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |first=Rudy |last=Marzke |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/martzke/2004-11-23-martzke_x.htm |title=ESPN boss makes right call after announcers blame fans |publisher=USAToday.com |date=November 23, 2004 |accessdate= November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their stance regarding the actions of [[Indiana Pacers]] player [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] (who entered the stands to confront a fan, sparking the melee). [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]] came down hard on Detroit fans, referring to them as "punks",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while [[Greg Anthony]] and [[Tim Legler]] defended Artest.

====WNBA coverage====
{{see also|WNBA on ESPN}}
During the [[2006 WNBA Finals]], [[Detroit Shock]] head coach, and former ESPN NBA analyst, [[Bill Laimbeer]] became irritated by ESPN's coverage. He was quoted by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' as saying:
{{quote|I just hear from our family and friends back home that, 'Boy, ESPN is killing you guys,' ... 'And [[Nancy Lieberman|(Nancy) Lieberman]] and [[Doris Burke]] are just trashing you left and right.' Not only me, but also some of our players on our ballclub. ... We're telling ESPN today to basically stick it.}}

====LeBron James' "Decision"====
On July 8, 2010, basketball player [[LeBron James]] announced on a live, one-hour ESPN special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'' that he would leave the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and join the [[Miami Heat]], beginning with the [[2010–11 NBA season|2010–11 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/2010/news/07/08/lebron.decision/index.html |title=LeBron James makes his pick: He's going to Miami |date=July 9, 2010 |work=NBA.com |publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711003820/http://www.nba.com/2010/news/07/08/lebron.decision/index.html |archivedate=July 11, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for the exclusive rights to air the special, ESPN agreed to hand over its advertising and airtime to James. James arranged for the special to include an interview conducted by [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], who was paid by James' marketing company and had no affiliation with the network. ESPN's reporting leading up to the James special, its decision to air the program, and its decision to relinquish editorial independence were widely cited as gross violations of journalistic ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/13/AR2010071305908.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Coverage of LeBron James's decision brings ESPN's integrity into question yet again | first=Leonard | last=Shapiro | date=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/richard_deitsch/07/14/junemedia.power/index.html | work=CNN | title=Meet the person who designed the LeBron front page of the Plain Dealer | date=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/richard_deitsch/07/09/espn.lebron/index.html | work=CNN | title=ESPN's LeBron circus good for TV ratings, bad for sports media | date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NCAA Basketball coverage===
{{see also|College Basketball on ESPN}}
ESPN is often accused of having a bias towards certain college basketball teams, including those in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), particularly the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] as well as the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]].&lt;ref name="Le Anne Schreiber"/&gt; ESPN maintains a broadcast rights agreement with the ACC that runs through the 2026–2027 season, which provides additional football, men's and women's basketball and Olympic sports coverage on a variety of platforms, suggesting that the bias may have a financial motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACC, ESPN agree to extend deal|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7910112/atlantic-coast-conference-espn-extend-rights-deal-2026-27|accessdate=May 11, 2012|newspaper=ESPN|date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dick Vitale]] is often criticized for being a "homer" for Duke, especially for Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], as well as most teams within the ACC. He is also known for mentioning Duke frequently during broadcasts, even when the Blue Devils are not playing. Former [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple University]] head coach [[John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)|John Chaney]] once said "You can't get Dick Vitale to say 15 words without Duke coming out of his mouth".&lt;ref name="Phil Axelrod"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04020/263393.stm |title=Atlantic Ten Notebook: All-time selections difficult after first 2 |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |author=Phil Axelrod |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL coverage===

====Ben Roethlisberger sexual assault case====
On July 18, 2009, [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was accused of sexual assault in a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea McNulty. ESPN came under fire for being the only major media outlet that refused to report on the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bardeen |first=Knox |url=http://nfl.fanhouse.com/ |title=NFL Fanhouse |publisher=NFL Fanhouse |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Big Ben a No-Fly Zone for ESPN|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/07/21/is-big-ben-a-no-fly-zone-for-espn/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN officials attempted to justify their actions by stating that the case is a private matter. Furthermore, ESPN claimed that since Roethlisberger had not addressed the issue publicly, and since no criminal charges had been filed, there was no reason to report on it. However, many have been quick to point out other instances where ESPN has reported on civil cases as well as statements addressing the matter by Roethlisberger's attorney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadspin.com/5320308/does-espns-do-not-report-policy-make-any-sense Does ESPN's "Do Not Report" Policy Make Any Sense?] Deadspin.com&lt;/ref&gt; The network's actions resulted in some media sources accusing them of [[double standard]]s and poor journalistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=sbd.main&amp;ArticleID=131926 |title=sportsbuinessdaily.com |publisher=Sportsbusinessdaily.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN began reporting on the story on July 23, 2009; one month later on August 18, ESPN released a column on its website explaining the network's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.usatoday.com/thehuddle/2009/07/espn-finally-acknowledges-accusations-against-ben-roethlisberger.html Chargers' Nate Kaeding on missed kicks: 'Sorry for my teammates and coaches'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724094617/http://blogs.usatoday.com/thehuddle/2009/07/espn-finally-acknowledges-accusations-against-ben-roethlisberger.html |date=July 24, 2009 }} The Huddle - USA Today, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=ohlmeyer_don&amp;id=4405442 Serve the audience - ESPN's new ombudsman analyzes the network's handling of the Roethlisberger story] Don Ohlmeyer, ESPN.com, August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fantasy football and advertising influence====
In 2015, ESPN received criticism from [[Deadspin]] for accepting advertising from [[DraftKings]], a daily [[fantasy sports]] site, and integrating DraftKings into the network's football coverage through [[product placement]], breaching the ethical wall between journalism and sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadspin.com/i-tried-daily-fantasy-sports-and-its-evil-1733840276 I tried daily fantasy sports and it is evil]. ''Deadspin''. Retrieved October 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflicts of Interests with NFL: Deflategate, concussions, legal issues====
In 2011, ESPN agreed to a deal with the NFL worth more than $15 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/sports/football/espn-extends-deal-with-nfl-for-15-billion.html|title=ESPN Extends Deal With N.F.L. for $15.2 Billion|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|date=September 8, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact led several media organizations, including ''[[Forbes]]'', to argue whether the financial relationship with the league creates a conflict of interest when ESPN covers the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2015/08/25/espns-uncomfortable-unnerving-relationship-with-the-nfl/#5b6225251ff2|title=ESPN's Uncomfortable, Unnerving Relationship With The NFL|first=Maury|last=Brown|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has also been accused of alleged pro-NFL bias on labor issues with the league and the union and ignoring or downplaying crimes or scandals committed by owners.&lt;ref name="truth-out.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/32958-protecting-the-shield-why-espn-can-t-be-trusted-to-cover-the-nfl|title=Protecting the Shield: Why ESPN Can't Be Trusted to Cover the NFL|first=Michael|last=Corcoran|website=Truthout|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ESPN spiked its partnership with the [[PBS]] series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' on the 2013 documentary "[[League of Denial]]," which chronicles the history of head injuries in the NFL, shortly after a meeting between ESPN executives and league commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] took place in [[New York City]], though ESPN denies pressure from the NFL led to its backing out of the project, claiming a lack of editorial control instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/sports/football/nfl-pressure-said-to-prompt-espn-to-quit-film-project.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=N.F.L.

Boston based journalist Michael Corcoran stated that in the first 7 months after the [[Deflategate]] scandal became national news, ESPN.com used the term "Deflategate" in 844 separate articles or videos, including the [[Chris Mortensen]]'s erroneous report about 11 of the 12 footballs used in the [[2014-15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45, Indianapolis Colts 7|2015 AFC Championship Game]] were 2 pounds per square inch (PSI) under NFL regulation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris Mortensen, [http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game "11 of 12 Pats footballs underinflated"], ''ESPN'', January 21, 2015; retrieved August 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was compared to when [[Jimmy Haslam]], owner of the [[Cleveland Browns]], was accused by the [[FBI]] in a 120-page affidavit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/686921-pilot-flying-j-search-warrant.html#document/p5|title=Pilot Flying J - affidavit in support of search warrant|first=Michael Scott (The Plain|last=Dealer)|website=www.documentcloud.org|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a five-year-long "conspiracy to scheme" and "defraud its customers" out of millions in rebates for his company [[Pilot Flying J]]. In the first 7 months after the FBI raided Haslam's company, ESPN only mentioned the scandal 23 times, less than 3 percent of the coverage of the allegations of football deflation. "ESPN should, at a minimum, disclose the details of its enormous vested interest before reporting any serious story about the league," Corcoran's article concluded.&lt;ref name="truth-out.org"/&gt;

Nonetheless, in July 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that sources within ESPN believed that the NFL gave them a "terrible" 2015 ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' schedule as "payback" for remarks made on air by both ESPN commentators [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Bill Simmons]] that were critical of the league and Goodell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-wants-keith-olbermann-quit-806220 |title=ESPN Wants Keith Olbermann to Quit Doing "Commentary" |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 1, 2015| accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN parted ways with both Olbermann and Simmons during that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/07/09/did-the-nfl-punish-espn-with-bad-monday-night-football-games/ |title=Did the NFL punish ESPN with bad ‘Monday Night Football’ games? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 9, 2015| accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFC and MMA coverage===

====Lack of coverage and negative coverage====
Despite the growth in popularity of [[mixed martial arts]] and its largest promotion – the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] – in particular, many fans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/mma-disputed/2011/11/where-espn-is-going-wrong/ |title=Where ESPN is Going Wrong |author=Gruber, Ted |date=November 3, 2011 |work=MMA Disputed (Chicago Now) |publisher=CTMG |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the sport feel that ESPN still treats MMA fighting as a fringe sport by either not showing highlights of recent drawing matchups or by portraying the sport in a negative light. Commentators such as [[Mike Wilbon]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]] of ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'', along with [[Skip Bayless]] of ''[[ESPN First Take|First Take]]'' have openly criticized the sport as inferior to [[boxing]]. [[Jim Rome]] of the former ESPN program ''[[Jim Rome is Burning]]'' however, often defends the sport and featured fighters as guests.&lt;ref&gt;https://sprawlnbrawlmma.com/2010/10/michael-wilbon-refers-to-mma-as-“barbarism”-on-espn’s-pti/{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some MMA fans feel that the influence of ESPN's corporate parent The Walt Disney Company (both due to not having broadcast rights and due to Disney's traditionally family friendly image), along with the influence of the boxing media have contributed to what they perceive as negative coverage of the sport on the channel. Other complaints include the ESPN show ''[[MMA Live]]'' being aired in a late Friday night (1:00&amp;nbsp;am Eastern Time) timeslot that many MMA fans feel is inadequate, and is often prone to preemptions due to live programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5thround.com/38531/espn2-extends-mma-live-through-august|title=ESPN2 Extends MMA LIVE Through August|work=5thRound.com - MMA, UFC News, Results, Rumors|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the UFC signed a television rights deal with rival [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], UFC president [[Dana White]] lashed out at ESPN following the cancellation of an appearance for an interview promoting the [[UFC 134]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/danawhite/status/104770014271389696|title=Twitter|publisher=|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmamania.com/2011/8/20/2374551/dana-white-espn-has-always-hated-us-and-they-hate-us-even-more-now|title=Dana White: ESPN has always hated us and they hate us even more now that  we're on FOX|author=Geno Mrosko|work=MMAmania.com|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverage of professional wrestling as a legitimate sport===
{{see also|Kayfabe}}
In its early days, ESPN aired various [[professional wrestling]] programs, including ''[[AWA Championship Wrestling]]'' from the [[American Wrestling Association]] as well as [[World Class Championship Wrestling]]. ESPN started distancing itself from professional wrestling after the more athletic-oriented AWA went out of business in 1991, two years after [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] owner [[Vince McMahon]] admitted that professional wrestling was [[Kayfabe|staged]] and was more about entertainment than about legitimate athletic competition. ESPN wouldn't distance itself completely from professional wrestling, as the network commissioned the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] for three years following AWA's failure, and Canadian sister network [[The Sports Network|TSN]] held the Canadian rights to ''[[WWE Raw]]'' from 1996 to 2006, as well as the parent network having aired [[This is SportsCenter]] ads featuring [[The Undertaker]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and [[John Cena]] on occasion.

On March 24, 2015, former UFC Heavyweight Champion and then-current [[WWE World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Brock Lesnar]] appeared on ''SportsCenter'' for a "huge announcement" after it became public knowledge that Lesnar's WWE contract was set to expire after [[WrestleMania 31]] and that he had been training for a return to MMA. However, Lesnar used the air time to announce that he in fact had re-signed with WWE and was retired from MMA, with part of the interview being done by then-''SportsCenter'' anchor [[Jonathan Coachman]], himself a then-former WWE announcer. This would be followed up by a segment on ''SportsCenter'' covering Lesnar's match with [[Roman Reigns]] at WrestleMania 31 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, featuring Lesnar, Reigns, and Lesnar's manager [[Paul Heyman]] in studio for the segment. ([[Seth Rollins]] ultimately won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at the event after he cashed in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract mid-match.) Although ESPN wasn't criticized for covering WWE, it did receive criticism for covering WWE like a legitimate sport as opposed to entertainment; unlike other countries, the United States generally views professional wrestling as entertainment due to it being an [[open secret]] that professional wrestling is staged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150411001715/http://sportsjournalism.org/sports-media-news/lets-hope-media-outlets-remember-what-e-in-wwe-means/ Let's hope media outlets remember what "E" in WWE means] Michael Bradley, [[Indiana University]] (04/07/2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesnar would subsequently return to MMA (while under contract with WWE) for a one-off match at ''[[UFC 200]]'' while WWE and ESPN would gradually increase their collaboration into a regular segment on ''SportsCenter'' hosted by Coachman, as well as a subsection devoted to professional wrestling on [[ESPN.com]].

The association between ESPN and WWE has received criticism outside of mainstream media and within the two organizations themselves. Coachman (who himself would leave ESPN in 2017 and eventually return to WWE a few months afterwards) stated he had wanted a connection between ESPN and WWE for years following his departure from WWE in 2008, but had to wait "until the right person was in charge" before the two sides started forming a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/141448/20160316/interview-jonathan-coachman-talks-espns-top-rope-segment-wwe.htm|title=Interview: Jonathan Coachman Talks ESPN's 'Off The Top Rope' Segment About WWE And Being A 'SportsCenter' Anchor|first=Tech|last=Times|date=March 16, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the wife of WWE wrestler [[Kevin Owens]] would post on [[social media]] their eight-year-old son's reaction following Owens winning the [[WWE Universal Championship]]. While the post would receive positive responses from most reporters, [[Amin Elhassan|Amin Elhassin]] for ESPN [[Twitter|tweeted]] that it was feel-good moment for their son "until he finds out its scripted". Former WWE wrestler [[Cody Rhodes]], who had left WWE on bad terms earlier that year, said that WWE needs to cut ties with ESPN and that having mainstream recognition "ain't always worth it" when one of their reporters tries to ruin it for a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/codyrhodes/status/771102556709715970|title=Cody Rhodes on Twitter|last=Rhodes|first=Cody|date=2016-08-31|website=@codyrhodes|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite ESPN and WWE having somewhat scaled back their relationship since (partially due to other mainstream sports media such as [[Fox Sports]], [[CBS Sports]], [[Yahoo! Sports]], and [[Bleacher Report]] also reporting on WWE), the two still partner on occasion.

===Alternative outlets and third party accountability===
Aside from ESPN's main competitors, such as [[Fox Sports]], [[NBC Sports]], [[CBS Sports]], [[Turner Sports]], and [[Yahoo Sports]], independent and regional sports-focused media firms and blogs, including [[Deadspin]] (now owned by [[Univision Communications]]), [[The Big Lead]], [[Bleacher Report]] (now owned by Turner Sports parent [[Time Warner]]), and 700 Level (now associated with NBC Sports parent [[Comcast]]), have served as alternatives for fans looking for balanced coverage or better local coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Jameson|title=Alternative Sports Websites Changing The Way Readers Get Their Sport Fix|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/65198-alternative-sports-websites-changing-the-way-readers-get-their-sport-fix|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bercovici|first1=Jeff|title=Competition Is Good For ESPN, Or At Least For Its Viewers|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/08/27/competition-is-good-for-espn-or-at-least-for-its-viewers/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accountability attempts by third parties range from news articles, websites, and blogs either in a response to specific events or the ongoing lack of or over coverage by ESPN. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writers Jordan Burchette and [[Michael Weinreb]] each published articles examining the implications of ESPN's perceived SEC bias during the 2014 college football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burchette|first1=Jordan|title=The Worldwide Cheerleader: ESPN and the College Football Playoff|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/espn-chris-fowler-interview-sec-bias-big-ten-jameis-winston-20141113|website=RollingStone.com|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinreb|first1=JMichael|title=Espn Chris Fowler Interview SEC Bias Big Ten Jameis Winston|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-worldwide-cheerleader-espn-and-the-college-football-playoff-20141028|website=RollingStone.com|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, independent blogging group Are You Cereal Box's main tactic is to track mentions of ESPN's alleged [[Criticism of ESPN#Bias towards certain teams and players|favorite]] teams and players via mentions on ESPN.com's front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bias Counter|url=http://rucerealbox.weebly.com/|website=RUcerealbox.weebly.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longhorn Network===
Concerns have been raised by some fans, bloggers and [[journalist]]s that ESPN's financial stake in the [[Longhorn Network]] (which launched in August 2011) creates a potential [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/2011-08-25-open-mikes-michael-hiestand-mccarthy-longhorn-network_n.htm Open Mikes: Is the Longhorn Network a good or bad idea?] USA Today.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer Richard Deitsch wrote: "The network's existence... creates an impossible situation for ESPN's college football producers and reporters (plenty of whom care about reporting).

Additionally, some have questioned the stipulation included in the network's founding agreement that gives Texas the right to dismiss LHN announcers that don't "reflect the quality and reputation of UT."&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebiglead.com/index.php/2011/05/04/espn-talent-on-the-longhorn-network-better-be-nice-or-the-university-of-texas-might-have-you-replaced/ ESPN Talent on the Longhorn Network Better Be Nice – or the University of Texas Might Have You Replaced] The Big Lead.

Through the show's success, ''[[ESPN First Take]]'' has also experienced substantial controversy and faced increasing criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/5989414/bill-simmons-calls-the-bayless+sherman-first-take-meltdown-awful-and-embarrassing |title=Bill Simmons Calls The Bayless-Sherman First Take Meltdown "Awful And Embarrassing" |last1=Koblin |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=March 8, 2013 |work=Deadspin.com |publisher= |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2013/march/bill-simmons-critique-of-first-take-exposes-espn-s-identity-crisis.html |title=BILL SIMMONS' CRITIQUE OF FIRST TAKE EXPOSES ESPN'S IDENTITY CRISIS |last1=Yoder |first1=Matt |last2= |first2= |date=March 8, 2013 |work=Awful Announcing |publisher= |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was criticized for what is perceived by many as its excessive coverage of the career of [[Tim Tebow]]. During his tenure with the [[New York Jets]], in which he did not start in a game, and threw just eight passes the entire season, Tebow was nonetheless often a leading topic.&lt;ref name="deadspin.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5929361/how-espn-ditched-journalism-and-followed-skip-bayless-to-the-bottom-a-tim-tebow-story|title=How ESPN Ditched Journalism And Followed Skip Bayless To The Bottom: A Tim Tebow Story|author=John Koblin|work=Deadspin|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Miami Heat forward [[LeBron James]] began a series of playoff appearances with the Cleveland Cavaliers, host Skip Bayless became well known for his belief that James had been overrated by the media and not received enough criticism for his team's playoff failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8569642/lebron-work-left|title=Skip Bayless: LeBron has work left|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayless has himself been criticized by fans as well as members of the media for exaggerating James' failures and diminishing his successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5916878/here-are-all-of-lebrons-unspectacular-45-points|title=Here Are All Of LeBron's Unspectacular 45 Points|author=Barry Petchesky|work=Deadspin|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an exchange with [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner [[Mark Cuban]], Cuban argued that Bayless had reduced his analysis of the [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]] and [[2012 NBA Finals]] series to subjective assessments of player psyche rather than relying on objective analysis based on the schematic principles used by the teams in each series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/mark-cuban-absolutely-destroys-espn-skip-bayless-air-202818568--nba.html|title=Mark Cuban absolutely destroys ESPN's Skip Bayless on air, Skip Bayless doesn’t seem to care (VIDEO)|date=June 22, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has also received criticism for its treatment of issues of race. During a December 2012 discussion regarding Washington Redskins quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] and his commenting that he did not wish to be perceived solely as a black quarterback, frequent guest Rob Parker asked whether Griffin III was a "brother" or a "cornball brother." When pressed by host Cari Champion on what he meant, he mentioned that Griffin III had a white fiancé and questioned whether he was a Republican. Parker, though, acknowledged that he did not have any information substantiating that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/espn-rob-parker-suspended-just-30-days-offensive-203024255--nfl.html|title=ESPN's Rob Parker suspended just 30 days for offensive comments about Robert Griffin III|date=December 20, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Bayless asked whether Griffin III's braids did anything to assuage his concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/video-espn-rob-parker-says-ridiculous-things-rg3-195448822--nfl.html|title=ESPN's Rob Parker says ridiculous things about RG3, takes ‘First Take’ to new levels of depravity|date=December 13, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To many, this exchange was part of a larger trend of the nature of the treatment of issues of race by the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/espn-stephen-a-smith-n-word-race-racism-skip-bayless-first-take-102612|title=NBA|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, ESPN's announcement of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], formerly Bruce Jenner, as the recipient of that year's [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]], one of its annual [[ESPY Awards]], led to significant criticism among online commenters&lt;ref name=Falzone&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/06/03/anger-over-caitlyn-jenner-being-chosen-over-lauren-hill-for-espy-courage-award/ |title=Anger over Caitlyn Jenner being chosen over Lauren Hill for ESPY courage award |first=Diane |last=Falzone |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=June 3, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some members of the media, with [[Bob Costas]] calling the decision to give Jenner the award a "crass exploitation play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/06/10/bob-costas-slams-espn-over-caitlyn-jenner-espy// |title=Bob Costas slams ESPN over Caitlyn Jenner ESPY courage award |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the critics of the Jenner award considered [[Lauren Hill (basketball)|Lauren Hill]], who [[2014 Hiram vs. Mount St. Joseph women's basketball game|played college basketball]] despite suffering from a [[Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma|brain tumor]] that would claim her life only a few months later, a more worthy recipient. Others cited [[Noah Galloway]], an [[Iraq War]] double amputee who competes in extreme sports and was also a finalist in the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|spring 2015 season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', as a worthy candidate.&lt;ref name=Falzone/&gt;

==Robert Lee controversy==
ESPN made the decision to remove [[Robert Lee (sports announcer)|Robert Lee]] from the broadcast team calling the [[University of Virginia]] home opener against [[William and Mary College]] on September 2, 2017 because he shares the same name as [[Confederate General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]. Robert Lee, who is not related to the confederate general, is of [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] heritage. The decision was made in the aftermath of the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] which protested the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. ESPN was widely criticized for the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/08/23/espn-removes-a-commentator-from-calling-u-vas-home-opener-his-name-robert-lee/ |title=ESPN removes Robert Lee from calling U-Va. game in Charlottesville because of his name |work=The Washington Post |date=August 23, 2017 |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doug Adler lawsuit==
Former tennis player and ESPN commentator Doug Adler was fired after making an allegedly racist comment about [[Venus Williams]] on-air. In January 2017, during the broadcast of the [[Australian Open]] match, Adler commented '"Venus is all over her. And you'll see Venus move in and put the guerrilla effect on, charging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/tennis-commentator-doug-adler-speaks-out-venus-williams-remark-i-t115506 |title=Tennis commentator Doug Adler speaks out on Venus Williams remark: I'm not a racist |publisher=NBC News |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN insisted that Adler used not the word he claimed he said, namely [[guerrilla]], but rather [[gorilla]] to describe Williams, who is [[African-american]]. Adler apologized for the remark after being told by his superiors to apologize on air, so that he could keep his job, but was fired by ESPN the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/10/11/guerrilla-not-gorilla-warfare-fired-tennis-analyst-who-nearly-died-to-have-his-day-in-court/|title=Guerrilla, not gorilla, warfare: Fired tennis analyst who nearly died to have his day in court|work=The Roar|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Adler filed a lawsuit against ESPN for wrongful termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/25/espn-killed-me-for-racial-misunderstanding |title=ESPN ‘killed me’ for racial misunderstanding |publisher=New York Post |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plan nine from outer space.jpg|thumb|alt=Film poster for Plan 9 from Outer Space|''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' is an example of a cult film.&lt;ref name=plan9/&gt;]]

A '''cult film''' or '''cult movie''', also commonly referred to as a '''cult classic''', is a [[film]] that has acquired a [[cult following]]. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate [[fanbase]], an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and [[audience participation]].  Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially [[box office bomb]]s, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, [[transgressive art|transgressive]] films shunned by the [[mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].  The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror [[classificatory disputes about art]].  The term ''cult film'' itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded [[underground film]]s and [[midnight movie]]s, though ''cult'' was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.

Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and [[film censorship|suppressed]] films kept alive by dedicated fans.  In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, occasionally for their [[camp (style)|camp]] value.  Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films.  After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video.  Others have inspired their own [[film festival]]s.  Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures.  Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.

Cult films frequently break cultural taboos, and many feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof.  This can lead to controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent.  Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films.  Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects.  Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed.  Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.

Since the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly popular.  Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture.  Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic.  Films are frequently stated to be an "instant cult classic" now, occasionally before they are released.  Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release.  At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, owing to spreading [[viral marketing|virally]] through [[social media]].  Easy access to cult films via [[video on demand]] and [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.

==Definition==
A cult film is any film that has a [[cult following]], although the term is not easily defined and can be applied to a wide variety of films.&lt;ref name="bbc-cult"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haigh|first=Ian|title=What Makes a Cult Film?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8640334.stm|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-17|date=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets,&lt;ref name="not-cult"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowling|first=Stephen|title=When a Cult Film's Not a Cult Film|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3152596.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2013-04-19|date=2003-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that try specifically to become cult films,&lt;ref name=joebob&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41690732|title=Cult Cinema: A Critical Symposium|last=Briggs|first=Joe Bob|authorlink=Joe Bob Briggs|work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|volume=34|issue=1|date=Winter 2008|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://savannahnow.com/do/2014-04-10/film-scene-lucas-offers-odd-one-two-film-punch|title=Film Scene: Lucas offers an odd one-two film punch|last=Reed|first=Jim|work=[[Savannah Morning News]]|date=2014-04-10|accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aftab|first=Kaleem|title=Scholar Devises Equation for Determining a Cult Film|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/scholar-devises-equation-for-determining-a-cult-film-2155417.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2013-04-20|date=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized [[audience participation]], [[film festival]]s, or [[cosplay]].&lt;ref name="bbc-cult" /&gt; Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views.&lt;ref name=pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Roberta E.|title=Kings of Infinite Space: Cult Television Characters and Narrative Possibilities|journal=Scope|year=2003|issue=Nov 2003|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=nov2003&amp;id=262&amp;section=article|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623041704/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=nov2003&amp;id=262&amp;section=article|archivedate=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as [[cinephile]]s argue that the term has become meaningless&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite web|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=The Last Cult Picture Show|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.25.02/lebowski1-0230.html|work=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=2002-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "elastic, a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Martin|Martin, Adrian]] (2008).

In 2008, ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film.  Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a [[transgressive art|transgressive]] element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films.  Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements.  Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior.  Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria.  Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in [[structuration]], where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized. [[Ernest Mathijs]] focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword.  Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term.  That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident.&lt;ref name=cineaste&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Church |first1=David |last2=Hills |first2=Matt |last3=Hunter |first3=I.

Writing in ''Defining Cult Movies'', Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult films in terms of [[paracinema]], marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography.  However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their "subcultural ideology" and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term.  Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally.  At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it.  This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as [[defamiliarization]].&lt;ref name="cult-intro"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|last1=Jancovich|first1=Mark|last2=Reboll|first2=Antonio Làzaro|last3=Stringer|first3=Julian|last4=Willis|first4=Andy|year=2003|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3|pages=1–3|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream.  This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream.&lt;ref name=alamo&gt;{{cite journal| last=de Ville| first=Donna| title=Cultivating the Cult Experience at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema| journal=Scope| year=2011| issue=20| url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=20&amp;id=1306|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622155957/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=20&amp;id=1306|archivedate=2013-06-22|accessdate=2013-06-04| issn=1465-9166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic [[Xavier Mendik]] also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive.  Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.&lt;ref name=sheep&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sélavy|first=Virginie|title=Interview with Xavier Mendik|journal=Electric Sheep|date=2008-05-01|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2008/05/01/interview-with-xavier-mendik/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General overview==
Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema.  Film critic Harry Allan Potamkin traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of [[Pearl White]], [[William S. Hart]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]], which he described as "a dissent from the popular ritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Potamkin|first=Harry Allen|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|page=26|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|chapter=Film Cults}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''.  Stoker's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy.  All known copies of the film were destroyed, and ''Nosferatu'' become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Phil|title=The Bootleg Files: "Nosferatu"|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/2056/|work=[[Film Threat]]|accessdate=2013-04-29|authorlink=Phil Hall (US writer)|date=2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the [[Marx Brothers]] as making other early cult films.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status. ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Elbert|title=The Greatest One-Off in Movie History|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/11/the_greatest_oneoff_in_movie_history.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, American [[exploitation film]]s and imported European [[art film]]s were marketed similarly. Although critics [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] argued against arbitrary divisions into [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]], American films settled into rigid genres; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions, and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book| last=Betz| first=Mark| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Art, Exploitation, and Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202–205}}  Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.&lt;ref name=alamo /&gt;

Releases from major studios – such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), which was distributed by [[Universal Studios]] – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video.  Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture.  With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues.  The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers.  Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klinger|first=Barbara|title=Becoming Cult: The Big Lebowski, Replay Culture and Male Fans|url=http://library.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/data/guides/english/klinger_lebowski.pdf|work=[[University of Oregon]]|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussing his reputation for making cult films, [[Bollywood]] director [[Anurag Kashyap]] said, "I didn't set out to make cult films.

The early cult horror films of [[Peter Jackson]] were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and [[Cinema of New Zealand|its cinema]].  As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory.  ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wu| first=Harmony H.| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=84–104| chapter=Trading in Horror, Cult, and Matricide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management.  Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time.  They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours.  Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular.  Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day.  These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Time Wasted|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-03-29|volume=11|issue=10|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/03/time-wasted-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor.  These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers.  New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).  These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Television and the Yuletide Cult|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-01-08|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/01/television-and-the-yuletide-cult-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears.  Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween.  Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community.  Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Threat or Treat: Film, Television, and the Ritual of Halloween|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2009-10-30|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://flowtv.org/2009/10/threat-or-treat-film-television-and-the-ritual-of-halloween-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities.

==Transgression and censorship==
[[File:Night of the Living Dead (1968) theatrical poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Theatrical poster of Night of the Living Dead|''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) is an example of a cult film that uses transgressive themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|page=101|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&amp;pg=PA101|chapter=Transgression and Freakery}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s.  Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of [[European art cinema]] and [[experimental film]], the gritty subject matter of [[Italian neorealism]], and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation.  Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time.  In the 1980s, filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] identified this movement as the [[Cinema of Transgression]] and later wrote a manifesto.  Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as "downtown culture".  These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as ''[[The Village Voice]]''.  Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film.&lt;ref name=hawkins&gt;{{cite book| last=Hawkins| first=Joan| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Midnight Sex–Horror Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–230}}  Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill |first=Mary Frances |title=Darkness rules for Batman fans in Vancouver |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314 |accessdate=2016-03-29 |newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=2008-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416172113/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314 |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' (2000), which broke many rules of teenage [[slasher film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsop|first=Samara L.|title=Battle Royale – Challenging Global Stereotypes Within the Constructs of a Contemporary Japanese Slasher Film|journal=The Film Journal|year=2002|issue=7|url=http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|accessdate=2013-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629195623/http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|archivedate=June 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler|first=Jane|title=The Cult of Aeon Flux|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2007-09-29|volume=6|issue=7|url=http://flowtv.org/2007/09/cult-of-%C3%A6on-flux/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.&lt;ref name=spoons&gt;{{cite journal| last=McCulloch| first=Richard| title='Most people bring their own spoons': The Room's Participatory Audiences as Comedy Mediators| journal=Participations| year=2011| volume=8| issue=2| url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%208/Issue%202/2d%20McCulloch.pdf| accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197}}

According to Mathijs, critical reception is important to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy.  Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response.  Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a [[moral panic]], which provides opposition.  Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film.  These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar.  However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important.  While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist.  Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mathijs| first=Ernest| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=109–123| chapter=The Making of a Cult Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's [[Rex Reed#Offensive comments in reviews|comments about Korean culture]] in his review of ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=extreme /&gt;  Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and [[Roger Ebert]] dueled over ''[[I Spit On Your Grave]]'' (1978).

Academic Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses.  Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms.  Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema.

Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films.  Director [[Jean Rollin]] worked within ''[[fantastique#Cinéma Fantastique|cinéma fantastique]]'', an unpopular genre in modern France.  Influenced by American films and early French fantasists, he drifted between art, exploitation, and pornography.

The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy.

Academics have written of how transgressive themes in cult films can be regressive.

==Subcultural appeal and fandom==
Cult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of [[subcultural capital]]; knowledge of cult films proves that one is "authentic" or "non-mainstream".

{{anchor|cult blockbuster}}
Matt Hills' concept of the "cult blockbuster" involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films.  Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings.  The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and [[fan work]]s.  Hills identifies three different cult followings for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Matt|title=The Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context|year=2006|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London New York|isbn=978-1-904764-82-3|pages=160–169|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8mxughWAOEC&amp;pg=PA160|editor-first=Ernest|editor-last=Mathijs|chapter=Realising the Cult Blockbuster: The Lord of the Rings Fandom and Residual/Emergent Cult Status in 'The Mainstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Emma Pett identifies ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) as another example of a cult blockbuster.

For example, in the ''Star Wars'' film series, mainstream [[Jar Jar Binks#Allegations of racial caricature|criticism of Jar Jar Binks]] focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing.&lt;ref name=trivia&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Nathan|chapter=The Importance of Trivia|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|editor1-last=Jancovich|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Reboll|editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro|editor3-last=Stringer|editor3-first=Julian|editor4-last=Willis|editor4-first=Andy|year=2003|publisher=University of Manchester Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190–193}}  Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings.  They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both.&lt;ref name=pearson /&gt;  To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.&lt;ref name=beach /&gt;

Cult films can create their own subculture.  ''Rocky Horror'', originally made to exploit the popularity of [[glam rock|glam subculture]], became what academic Gina Marchetti called a "sub-subculture", a variant that outlived its parent subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Marchetti|first=Gina|page=413|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA412|chapter=Subcultural Studies and the Film Audience|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members.&lt;ref name=spoons /&gt;{{rp|190–191}}  Familiar with the film's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the film's fandom.  If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members.  Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions.  Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community.  Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself.  Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation.&lt;ref name=spoons /&gt;{{rp|200–211}}  Fans of cult films, as in [[media fandom]], are frequently producers instead of mere consumers.  Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property, these fan works are often unsanctioned, transformative, and ignore [[Canon (fiction)|fictional canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Mathijs| first1=Ernest| last2=Sexton| first2=Jamie| title=Cult Cinema| year=2011| publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2| page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&amp;pg=PA57| chapter=Fandom and Subculture: Fan Studies: Early Approaches| location=Chichester, West Sussex Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness.  They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism.  Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital.  Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery.&lt;ref name=hollows /&gt;{{rp|45–47}}  By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded.  Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation.  Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute.  When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed.  Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]", a philosophical construct divergent from [[Norm (social)|social norms]].  Commercial aspects of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of "otherness" and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated.  Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used.&lt;ref name=trivia /&gt;{{rp|192–197}}  In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital.  Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.&lt;ref name=sick /&gt;

{{See also|Z movie}}
The critic [[Michael Medved]] characterized examples of the "so bad it's good" class of low-budget cult film through books such as ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''.

===Nostalgia===
According to academic Brigid Cherry, [[nostalgia]] "is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal."&lt;ref name=borrowings /&gt; When [[Veoh]] added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Termen|first=Amanda|title=It's the Site of the Living Dead, as Cult Films Hit Web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1025_3-6047466.html|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic I.&amp;nbsp;Q. Hunter describes cult films as "New Hollywood ''in extremis''" and a form of nostalgia for that period.  Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  By virtue of the time travel plot, ''Back to the Future'' permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s.  Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period.&lt;ref name=nostalgia /&gt;  Similarly, films directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beale|first=Lewis|title=John Hughes Versus the Vampires: The Dilemma of the Midnight Movie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/movies/19beal.html|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathijs and Sexton describe ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following.  Other cult films, such as ''[[Streets of Fire]]'' (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|title=Cult Cinema|year=2011|publisher=[[Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-9643-0|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT217|accessdate=2013-08-01|chapter=Cult Cinema and Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boudreau|first=Emily|title=The History and Meaning of The Dude's Abiding|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/big-lebowski-retrospective-notebook|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[Michigan Daily]]|date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Lee of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche in films such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Nathan|title=How 'Donnie Darko' Refused to Die|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/how-donnie-darko-refused-to-die/134/|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[New York Sun]]|date=2004-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midnight movies===
Author Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes [[midnight movie]]s as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America,&lt;ref name=midnight /&gt;{{rp|27}} and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic.&lt;ref name=hawkins /&gt;{{rp|223}} These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences.  Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively.&lt;ref name=midnight&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowder-Taraborrelli|first=Tomas F.|title=Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream: How the Fringe Became Mainstream, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-35781-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqd92sX1hAoC&amp;pg=PA27|editor-first=Bob|editor-last=Batchelor|chapter=Midnight Movies and the Phenomenon of the Cult Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–30}}  Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s.  Like the surrealists and dadaists, they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter-cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes.&lt;ref name=hawkins /&gt;{{rp|224–226}}  In the late 1980s and 1990s, midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings; eventually, a desire for community brought a resurgence, and ''The Big Lebowski'' kick-started a new generation.  Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them.  Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001), [[The Warriors (film)]] (1979) and ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=Cult Rapture|journal=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=2003-09-17|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/09.17.03/cult-0338.html|accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight.  Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings.  Although classic midnight movies have dropped off in popularity, they still bring reliable crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Mark|last2=Kaufman|first2=Amy|title=Moviegoing at the Midnight Hour|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/04/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-new-midnight-movies-20130505|accessdate=2013-07-28|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and exploitation===
Although seemingly at odds with each other, [[art film|art]] and [[exploitation film]]s are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response.  The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Joan|title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and the Horrific Avant-garde|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-3413-0|pages=3–4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68whFPvH5VEC&amp;pg=PA3|chapter=Sleaze-Mania, Euro-trash, and High Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This flattening of culture follows the popularity of [[post-structuralism]], which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art.&lt;ref name=betz /&gt;{{rp|202–203}}  Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with [[taboo]] subjects, is well-suited for cult followings.&lt;ref name=exploitation&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ernest|last1=Mathijs|first2=Jamie|last2=Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|year=2012|publisher=[[Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-9643-0|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT180|chapter=Exploitation and B Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are "the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area."&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|title=Soft in the Middle: The Contemporary Softcore Feature in Its Contexts|last=Andrews|first=David|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8142-1022-2|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk-F1B7RUfcC&amp;pg=PT23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexploitation films of [[Russ Meyer]] were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following.

Anime, which is often highly franchised, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity.  The ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' franchise, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies.

[[File:Quentin Tarantino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|alt=Quentin Tarantino sitting down, smiling|Quentin Tarantino is an example of a cult film director who has achieved mainstream success.]]

I. Q. Hunter identifies a prefabricated cult film style which includes "deliberately, insulting bad films", "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over".&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  Writing for [[NPR]], Scott Tobias states that [[Don Coscarelli]], whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm.  Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as trying too hard to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tobias|first=Scott|title=Spoiler Alert: 'John Dies,' But The Rest?

''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans.  Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be.  This reached the point of [[technological convergence#Convergence culture|convergence culture]] when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Kirsten|editor1-last=Cash|editor1-first=Conall|editor2-last=Snow|editor2-first=Samuel Cuff|title=Snakes on a Plane and the Prefabricated Cult Film|journal=Colloquy|year=2009|issue=18|url=http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_eighteen/stevens.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-23|publisher=[[Monash University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chonin|first=Neva|title='Snakes on a Plane' Blog Buzz Forces Hollywood into Overdue Attitude Adjustment|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Snakes-on-a-Plane-blog-buzz-forces-Hollywood-2533141.php|accessdate=2013-05-13|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following.

Cult films are often approached in terms of [[auteur theory]], which states that the director's creative vision drives a film.  This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics.&lt;ref name=hutchings /&gt;{{rp|135}}  Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism.  Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship.  By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans.  Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Greg|title=Artists in the Audience: Cults, Camp, and American Film Criticism|year=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-08955-3|pages=87–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fukKSOOc0dYC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs.  This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director.  Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture.  While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation.  Someone like [[George Romero]], whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Joe|title="They Have the Oscars": Oppositional Telebranding and the Cult of the Horror Auteur|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-07-16|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/07/oppositional-telebranding-and-the-cult-of-the-horror-auteur/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5370">'''Denitrifying bacteria''' are a diverse group of [[bacteria]] that encompass many different phyla. This group of bacteria, together with denitrifying fungi and archaea, is capable of performing [[denitrification]] as part of the [[nitrogen cycle]].&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt;  They [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]]ous [[Chemical compound|compounds]] using various enzymes, turning [[nitrogen oxide]]s back to nitrogen [[gas]] or [[nitrous oxide]].

== Diversity of denitrifying bacteria ==

There is a great diversity in bacteria capable of performing denitrification. Members of this group encompass most bacterial phyla and therefore possess a wide variety of physiological traits.&lt;ref name="Zumft"&gt;Zumft, W. G. (1997). ''Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.'' Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 61(4), 533–616&lt;/ref&gt; Denitrifying bacteria have been identified in over 50 genera with over 125 different species and are estimated to represent 10-15% of bacteria population in water, soil and sediment.&lt;ref name="Eldor"&gt;Eldor, A. (2015). ''Soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry'' (4th ed.). Chapter 14 Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
Denitrifying include for example several species of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Alkaligene]]s'' , ''[[Bacillus]]'' and others. 
The majority of denitrifying bacteria are facultative aerobic heterotrophs that switch from aerobic respiration to denitrification when oxygen as an available terminal electron acceptor (TEA) runs out. This forces the organism to use nitrate to be used as a TEA.&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt; Because the diversity of denitrifying bacteria is so large, this group can thrive in a wide range of habitats including some extreme environments such as environments that are highly saline and high in temperature.&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt; Aerobic denitrifiers can conduct an aerobic respiratory process in which nitrate is converted gradually to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ), using nitrate reductase (Nar or Nao), nitrite reductase (Nir), nitric oxide reductase (Nor), and nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that aerobic denitrifiers mainly belong to α-, β- and γ-''Proteobacteria''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Denitrification mechanism ==

Denitrifying bacteria use denitrification to generate ATP.&lt;ref name="Bothe"&gt;Bothe, H., Ferguson, S., &amp; Newton, W. (2007). ''Biology of the nitrogen cycle.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common denitrification process is outlined below, with the nitrogen oxides being converted back to gaseous nitrogen:

2 NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 10 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 12 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The result is one molecule of nitrogen and six molecules of water. Denitrifying bacteria are a part of the N cycle, and consists of sending the N back into the atmosphere. 
The reaction above is the overall half reaction of the process of denitrification. The reaction can be further divided into different half reactions each requiring a specific enzyme. The transformation from nitrate to nitrite is performed by nitrate reductase (Nar)

NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitrite reductase (Nir) then converts nitrite into nitric oxide

2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 NO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
 
Nitric oxide reductase (Nor) then converts nitric oxide into nitrous oxide

2 NO + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) terminates the reaction by converting nitrous oxide into dinitrogen
 
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

It is important to note that any of the products produced at any step can be exchanged with the soil environment.&lt;ref name="Bothe" /&gt;

== Denitrifying bacteria and the environment ==

The process of denitrification can lower the fertility of soil as nitrogen, a growth-limiting factor, is removed from the soil and lost to the atmosphere. This loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere can eventually be regained via introduced nutrients, as part of the nitrogen cycle.  Some nitrogen may also be [[nitrogen fixation|fixated]] by species of [[nitrifying bacteria]] and the [[cyanobacteria]]. Another important environmental issue concerning denitrification is the fact that the process tends to produce large amounts of by-products. Examples of by-products are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). NO is an ozone depleting species and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is a potent greenhouse gas which can contribute to global warming.&lt;ref name=Eldor /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">A '''drop-out compensator''' is an [[error concealment]] device that was commonly used in the [[analog video]] era to hide brief RF signal "drop-outs" on [[videotape]] playback caused by imperfections in or damage to the tape's magnetic coating. Most compensators worked by repeating earlier video scan-lines over short periods of signal loss; one early such system, "Mincom" was developed in the 1960s by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the company now known as [[3M]]. Because of the high cost of the 3M device at the time, [[BBC R&amp;D]] engineers developed a simpler, less expensive unit based on a [[sample-and-hold]] technique for in-house use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/rdreport_1964_77.shtml|title=R&amp;D Report 1964-77 : Simple drop-out compensator for video tape recorders|author=W.K.E. Geddes|date=14 December 1964|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated drop-out compensators were eventually superseded by the incorporation of drop-out compensation functionality into [[timebase corrector]]s based on analog-to-digital conversion and digital line stores. 

The advent of [[compressed digital video]] systems finally eliminated the need for line-based drop-out compensators. Most low-level media errors, such as those caused by tape damage or imperfections, are now dealt with by [[forward error correction]] techniques, and those which overwhelm the FEC layer are typically too severe to remedy using simple line-based error concealment techniques, because damage to the compressed bitstream will often damage large parts of the video image. However, since occasional signal drop-outs can still occur, either through severe tape damage or because of [[packet loss]] in packetized video transmission, modern [[error concealment]] techniques that are aware of the structure of the compressed video format have been developed to deal with these.

'''Dustin Kelm''' is a professional world champion and world record setting [[unicyclist]], performing the [https://unishow.org/ UniShow] around the world.  He has performed and competed throughout North, South and Central America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.  Dustin is a three time [http://www.uniusa.org Unicycling Society of America] expert freestyle national champion, a [http://www.uniusa.org Unicycling Society of America] mountain unicycling national champion and a [[UNICON]] freestyle World Champion.

He was born January 26, 1972 and was given his first unicycle at the age of 10.  Two years later he joined the Twin Cities Unicycle Club in [[Minneapolis]] and discovered there was much more he could do on a unicycle besides his paper route.  Over the years he has claimed national and world records, titles and medals in age group categories as well as men's expert categories.

Dustin was elected to serve on the board of directors for the Unicycling Society of America for two three year terms from 1989-1991, 1993-1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On One Wheel|date=1989–90|volume=XVI|issue=4|pages=4–5|editor1-first=Carol|editor1-last=Brichford|publisher=Unicycling Society of America, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On One Wheel|date=Summer 1995|volume=21|issue=3|page=11|editor1-first=Constance|editor1-last=Cotter|publisher=Unicycling Society of America, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, it has become a free public event.

Its highlights include the hundreds of cosplayers who visit each year, generous opportunities for cosplay photography, guest performances by Japanese celebrities, music and dance performances by home-grown talents, artwork exhibitions and booths selling anime merchandise and personal artworks.&lt;ref name="EOY Official Website"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theeoy.com | title = EOY Official Website | publisher = TheEOY.com | accessdate = 19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EOY2013 Map Yume.jpg|thumb|right|Map of EOY Cosplay Festival 2013 featuring mascot Kyouyaku Yume]] --&gt;

Kyouyaku Yume is a blue-haired girl with no recollection of her identity and past. With a vaguely written clue and a turquoise pebble which she found on herself when she awoke, she goes on a journey of self-discovery.

Yume is specially created by Daiyaku, a Singapore-based art group, for EOY. She is a representation of how the artists believe that people can discover their identity, talents and purpose in life through meeting people and courage to experience new things.&lt;ref name="EOY Mascot Yume"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theeoy.com/yume | title = About Yume | publisher = TheEOY.com | accessdate = 19 February 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101118081913/http://www.theeoy.com/yume | archivedate = 18 November 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9184">The '''Editta Braun Company''' is an award-winning dance company founded in [[Salzburg, Austria]] in 1989 by the Austrian choreographer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zx_sAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=editta+braun++dance&amp;dq=editta+braun++dance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SUnuUpi4L8Xj2AXWs4HQDA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg World Ballet and Dance] Bent Schonberg, Elizabeth Charman, Sanjoy Roy&lt;/ref&gt; dancer and dance instructor [[Editta Braun]]. Members of the multi-national team include dancers, composers, dramatic advisors and light designers.  The Editta Braun Company’s work pursues political themes, including intercultural communication and feminist questions.  The company is particularly known for the ''body theatre'' performance pieces ''Lufus'',  ''Luvos, vol. 2'', and ''planet LUVOS''.  The Editta Braun Company has toured in Europe, Asia, Africa and performs at both large and specialty festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progvisions.net/reviews_uk/zab_min_uk.htm "album review Zaboitzeff &amp; Crew - Miniaturen: Zoydian suite in three movements - 2000"]. ''Progvisions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Braun was one of a group of students who formed the dance collective Vorgänge 1982. She founded her own company shortly before the group broke up in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1fDaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=editta+braun++dance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SUnuUpi4L8Xj2AXWs4HQDA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=editta%20braun%20%20dance&amp;f=false World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Volume 1: Europe, Volume 1] edited by Peter Nagy, Phillippe Rouyer, Don Rubin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, French composer and musician [[Thierry Zaboitzeff]] began creating sound tracks to accompany the group's productions;  most have been released as albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progvisions.net/reviews_uk/zab_min_uk.htm "album review: Zaboitzeff &amp; Crew - Miniaturen: Zoydian suite in three movements - 2000"]. ''ProgVisions'', José Nafría - October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expose.org/index.php/articles/display/thierry-zaboitzeff-planet-luvos-3.html "José Nafría - October 2000 "Thierry Zaboitzeff — Planet Luvos (Booster BTZ972, 2012, CD)"]. ''Exposé'', by Peter Thelen, 2013-09-21&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hinterberger and Peter Thalhamer have designed the lighting for many pieces.

The company collaborated with Egyptian director Mahmoud Aboudoma and his drama ensemble to create ''Coppercity 2001'', based on one of the tales from 1001 Nights.

In 2002, the company began to incorporate texts into their productions, for example, Manfred Wöhlcke’s sociological essay Soziale Entropie and literary variations of the Arthur myth. In 2004, Austrian author [[Barbara Neuwirth]] wrote the text for ''Zurydike'', a piece which was commissioned for the [[Brucknerfest]] in Linz, and included a chamber orchestra, drama and dance ensemble.   
 
In 2004 the company increased its staff of artistic directors and choreographers to include Arturas Valudskis, Rebecca Murgi, Shlomo Bitton, Teresa Ranieri, Mahmoud Aboudoma, and Robert Pienz.

[[File:1997, Heartbeat, editta braun company.jpg|thumb|1997, Heartbeat, editta braun company]]
Over the years, outstanding artists from various disciplines (besides dance: drama, composition, direction, writing, dramaturgy, video, light design) have contributed their creative potential to the company. In the beginning, the company’s dance style was especially influenced by Céline Guillaume and Georg Blaschke, the work together with dance legend [[Jean Babilée]], for whom [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Roland Petit]] created [[Le jeune homme et la mort]], was particularly sensational, immensely furthering the company’s international acclaim. Composer Peter Valentin contributed his work during this time.

For ten years, dancer Barbara Motschiunik played a main role in each production; in 2006, Anna Maria Müller and Tomaz Simatovic joined the group, joining with Juan Dante and Murillo Bobadilla.

Since 2010, several younger performers have joined the company, including Spela Vodeb, and the many performances have been developed with dramaticist Gerda Poschmann-Reichenau.

'''EventPlan Limited'''  was formed in 2000. It is a modest-sized UK-based historical events company that specializes in staging a limited number of living history and live re-enactment displays each year including for the National Trust,local councils and individual historic properties. It is directed by Eleanore Hill-Bruce since January 2016 with many years of previous event experience previously.

==Events==
EventPlan has been responsible for staging events including [[The Battle of Orgreave]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artangel &amp;#124; The Battle of Orgreave|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2001/the_battle_of_orgreave|website=artangel.org.uk|publisher=Artangel|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Jeremy Deller]], [[Artangel]] and [[Channel 4]] in 2001. Although a live event (with just one brief break) The [[Battle of Orgreave]] was filmed in real time by Hollywood director [[Mike Figgis]] for Channel 4's programme of the same name. With a minimum of direction, Figgis' camera crews recorded the action as it unfolded around them, resulting in footage that is very similar to that taken during the actual clash in 1984.

Other events include The Roman Army and Chariot Experience (RACE) in [[Jerash]], Jordan in 2005, and ancient to modern era and multi-period shows for the [[Army Benevolent Fund]], [[British army]] and others.  During 2014 commemorative projects include Centenary Great War, 70th, and 75th anniversary World War Two displays.

The company has previously assisted with a number of TV and film productions which include the [[BBC]] series [[D-Day to Berlin]], Historyonics presented by [[Nick Knowles]] and [[Brainiac: History Abuse]] and Tetley Beer's spoof "Gladiator" TV advert. They have also arranged post-production ancient Macedonian war chants for the movie [[Alexander]].

'''''Everything's Archie''''' was a [[comic book]] [[publisher|published]] by [[Archie Comics]] from 1969 to 1991. The title served as a vehicle for showcasing the newly created Archie band [[The Archies]], which was featured in the [[The Archie Show|Archie TV cartoon series]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The series follows the exploits of the Archie band, as they meet record execs, play gigs, etc.  Like ''[[Betty and Veronica Summer Fun]]'' and ''[[World of Archie]]'', it was part of the [[Archie Giant Series]]. Everything's Archie was cancelled because the Archies were fading at the character's 50th anniversary. The company was also readying up for series such as Betty, Veronica, Jughead's Time Police, Archie 3000, and the Archie Americana Series.

:''This article is about Filipino women who create art in the Philippines. For women as subject of art in the Philippines, see [[Women in Philippine art]].''
'''Filipino women artists''' started contributing to Philippine art when the [[History of the Philippines|Philippines]] was still a colonial province of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] (1521–1898).&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; They have continued to participate as art creators after [[World War II]] through modern times by either following the traditional way of making art or by departing from such tradition by embracing modernism and other modes of expressing themselves through art.

==Spanish era (1521–1898)==
===Sculpting===
The first Filipino woman to achieve a level of prominence in the art world, while the [[Philippines]] was under the management of [[Spain]], was sculptor Pelagia Mendoza y Gotianquin (1867-1939). The first female student at the ''[[Academia de Dibujo y Pintura]]'' (Academy of Drawing and Painting), Mendoza studied sculpting under the mentorship of Agustin Saez and Lorenzo Rocha. Her bust of [[Christopher Columbus]] won an award during the quattrocentenial celebration of the [[Discovery of the Americas]].&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

===Painting===
In the field of painting in the Philippines, the works of art of [[Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas]] became notable. Zaragoza was the painter of the masterpiece known as Dos Inteligentias (literally “Two Intellectuals”, 1892), a painting that won Zaragoza a prize during the 1892 anniversary of Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas. Two years later, during the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (1895 Regional Exposition in the Philippines), Zaragoza would be awarded a copper medal for creating two landscapes.&lt;ref name=NCCA&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Patrick|title=Birthing Women Artists|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?i=58&amp;subcat=13|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts (May 30, 2003)|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable Filipino women painters during the time of Zaragoza were Concha Paterno, Adele Paterno, Conception de Montilla, Patricia Reyes, Ana Garcia Plana, Josefa Majo, Concepcion Ortiz, Olimpia Teran de Abella, Rafaella Calanta, and Femina David.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Another woman painter who excelled in the field of [[art in the Philippines]] was Paz Paterno. Her important painting known as ''Still Life'' was decorated with native fruits such as [[lanzones]] (''Lansium domesticum''), bananas, [[mabolo]]s (velvet apple, ''Diospyros blancoi''), [[Sugar-apple|atis]] (sugar-apple, the fruit of ''[[Annona squamosa]]''), [[balimbing]]s (carambola or starfruit, fruit of ''[[Averrhoa carambola]]''), [[pili nut]]s, and coconuts.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

==After World War II (1946-present)==
After World War II, new female artists emerged carrying the modernistic themes in their art. Among these artists were painters such as Anita Magsaysay-Ho, the first Filipino woman abstractionist Nena Saguil,&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; and Philippine Art Gallery owner Lyd Arguilla. During the 1970s and the 1980s, women printmakers and graphic artists began contributing their works of imagery to the Philippine art scene, such as Brenda Fajardo, Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, and Imelda Cajipe-Endaya. This period also saw the emergence of women art collectives in the Philippines such as ''[[Kasibulan]],'' for which these artists where members of. Women sculptors like Agnes Arellano, Julie Lluch, Genera Banzon, and Francesca Enriquez also made their noteworthy impressions to the field of sculpting by creating non-traditional statues.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Ofelio Gelvezon-Tequi, a pioneer in the print-making industry, created a notable printed portrait of a widow standing next to the casket of her dead husband. The casket in the image was draped with a [[Philippine flag]], while the widow was standing and holding vigil next to the coffin. Gelvezon-Tequi also produced works made of acrylic-on-paper in 1995. Her masterpieces later focused on portraits of Filipino women such former Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]], the assassins of her husband [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], and about plotters of [[coup d'etat]]s.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

As a mixed-media artist, Brenda Fajardo used art to describe folk magic and [[Philippine mythology|folklore]] of the [[Aeta people|Sulod people]] (part of the Aeta ethnic group) of [[Panay]] province.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; Fajardo is a member of Faculty of Arts at the [[University of the Philippines]] in [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. She was also the curator of the Vargas Museum of Art located inside the Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines. She was a visiting professor at the St. Norbert College in the United States.&lt;ref name=VIA&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyer|first=Robert|title=Two Women Artists: Strong Filipino Women (5)|url=http://www.viatimes.com/_archive/vt_1204/philippines.html|publisher=VIA Times|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Nena Saguil (died in 1994) expressed her artistry through the use of pen and ink to draw abstract images employing dots, bubble, vortices, and rays, including an imagery of an "enlarged [[hymen]]" and "a woman cleaning a toilet bowl splattered with human excrement".&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt; Saguil moved to France to live in Paris.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

Imelda Cajipe-Endaya ventured in making fragmented artistic scenes by recycling materials found in the household to depict the life and responsibilities of the Filipina domestic helper working in the Philippines and abroad, to integrate their unseen roles as the working wife, mother, and daughter while being miles away from their motherland or from their hometowns in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;

[[Paulina Constancia]] is considered one of the most prolific and inspiring female artists in Cebu, Philippines. She is a multifaceted artist best known for her bright colored, whimsical narratives painted on quilts and tiles that are also reflected in her writing. Paulina has exhibited her art in the Philippines, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico &amp; in various cities in the United States &amp; Canada. In 1997, she was presented by the [http://reocities.com/CollegePark/quad/1490/iii1cen1.htm Philippine Centennial Coordinating Council of Northeast USA] in a show called "Here's to Sunny!" at the Philippine Center in New York City. In 2000, her collection of painted quilts called "Kleur en ik in de geheime tuin /Hue &amp; I in a Secret Garden" was  presented by the [http://www.haarlemmermeer.nl/gemeenteraad/Millenniumdoelen/Vereniging_Haarlemmermeer_Cebu VHC-Vereniging Haarlemmermeer-Cebu] (sister cities organization of Haarlemmermeer and Cebu) at the Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur in Hoofddrop and Kunst 2001  Gallery in Badhoevedorp.

Another noteworthy Filipino woman artist was painter&lt;ref name=VIA/&gt; and sculptor Elsie "Inday" Cadapan whose 1997 sculpture was unveiled for display by former Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]] on October 30, 1997 at the front lobby of the [[Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) building.

==Art as rehabilitation tool==
On April 21, 2012, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that Alma Quinto launched the "House of Comfort Art Project", a program of the House of Comfort Art Network (ARTHOC), a non-governmental organization that uses art to help sexually abused Filipino women and girls through their rehabilitation. The project employs the use of scrap materials to teach women how to create miniature houses, as a means of expressing their feelings long after the occurrence of abuse and build positive experiences in their minds and to once again become in control of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rebekah|first=Curtis|title=Sexually abused Filipino women find solace in art|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20120421161400-f1bzu/|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation (21 April 2012)|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">A '''film sculptor''' is employed within the [[art department]] of a [[feature film]].

Their skills are and can be used to create any number of different things from giant rocks in a landscape or oversized stone blocks cladding the facade of a castle to statuary and ornate panelling, to more specialized pieces such as a vehicle hull for a [[fantasy]] film used in [[set construction]].  The material often utilised for large-scale rocks or columns is [[polystyrene]] because it is light and can be carved easily using a hot wire.  Polystyrene can also be used to sculpt mid-sized items that are difficult to build in wood and too large for clay - an item such as a moulded chair can then be cast with [[plaster]] and reproduced in [[fibre-glass]]. [[Clay]] modelling is still preferable for any item needing detail and is always used for smaller and finer work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastap.com/ideasmag/the-knowledge/jonathan-moore-sculptor Film-set sculptor, By Annika Kristensen	20/12/10 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles_and_stories/job_roles/747_sculptor creativeskillset.org, Sculptor]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7300">'''Flexing''', also called '''Bone Breaking''', is a style of [[street dance]] from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]] that is characterized by rhythmic [[contortionist]] movement combined with waving, [[Tutting (dance)|tutting]], floor moves, and gliding. Flex dancers, referred to as ''flexers'', often perform shirtless and incorporate hat tricks in their performance for [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. 

==Origins==
Before flexing gained mainstream exposure it was featured as early as 1992 on a local television show in New York City called 'Flex N Brooklyn’. The dance is primarily performed to a mix of [[dancehall]], [[reggae]], and "...a chopped-up instrumental called the 'Volume' riddim".&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/article/9864-flex-tunes-brooklyns-own-dance-music/|title=Flex Tunes: Brooklyn's Own Dance Music|last=Steyels|first=Mike|date=April 6, 2016|work=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 4, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408124945/http://pitchfork.com/features/article/9864-flex-tunes-brooklyns-own-dance-music/|archivedate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]].com, the producers of this new genre refer to it as FDM (Flex Dance Music).&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; Although flexing looks like a subgenre of [[popping]], it did not come from hip-hop dance, funk music, or [[hip-hop culture]]. It evolved from a [[Jamaica]]n style of street dance called bruk-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Kristy |title=Britney’s Dance Dream Team |url=http://www.danceinforma.com/magazine/?p=1378 |date=December 2, 2009 |work=Dance Informa |quote=Living in Brooklyn and with my family being West Indian, I was into a lot of Dancehall Reggae music.

'''''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter'''''&lt;!-- This film has never been officially called "Part IV". Do not add fan fiction. --&gt; is a 1984 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Joseph Zito]], produced by [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]] and starring [[Corey Feldman]], [[Ted White (stuntman)|Ted White]], [[Kimberly Beck]], and [[Crispin Glover]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]]. Picking up immediately after the events of ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'', the story follows a presumed-dead [[Jason Voorhees]] brought to the morgue, where he spontaneously revives and escapes. He then returns to Crystal Lake to continue his killing spree, targeting a family and a group of neighboring teenagers; it is the first film to feature the character of [[Tommy Jarvis]].

Much like ''Friday the 13th Part III'', the film was originally supposed to be the final installment in the series. Mancuso Jr. wanted to conclude the series as he felt nobody respected him for his assisting work on ''Friday the 13th'' regardless of how much the films earned at the box office, as well as wanting to work on other projects. [[Paramount Pictures]] also supported the decision, as they were aware of the declining popularity of slasher films at the time of its release. As a result, the film was marketed as "The Final Chapter" to ensure it as such. Make-up artist [[Tom Savini]], who worked on the [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|first film]], returned for the sequel as he wanted to help kill off Jason, who he helped create.

The film was originally scheduled to be released in October 1984, but Paramount pushed the date up to April 13, 1984. Upon its theatrical release, the film earned approximately $11 million on its opening weekend and grossed $32 million in the United States on a budget of $2.6 million, making it the fourth most attendance of any film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series with approximately 9,815,700 tickets sold. The film received generally negative reviews. Despite it originally set to be the final film, the success of the film prompted another sequel, ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'', eleven months later.

==Plot==
The night after [[Friday the 13th Part III|the events at Higgins Haven]], police clean up the grounds and [[Jason Voorhees]]'s body, believed to be dead, is taken to the morgue. At the hospital, Jason spontaneously revives and escapes from the cold storage, murdering the coroner Axel with a hacksaw and gutting Nurse Morgan with a scalpel. The following day, a group of teenagers drive to Crystal Lake for the weekend. The group consists of Paul, his girlfriend Sam, virgin Sara, her boyfriend Doug, socially awkward Jimmy, and jokester Ted. On the way, the group comes across [[Pamela Voorhees]]'s tombstone and a hitchhiker, who is soon killed by Jason.

The teens arrive and meet neighbors Trish Jarvis, her twelve-year-old brother [[Tommy Jarvis|Tommy]], their mother, and the family dog Gordon. While going for a walk the next day, the teens meet twin sisters Tina and Terri, and go [[skinny dipping]] with them. Trish and Tommy happen upon the scene, and Trish is invited to a party to take place that night. Afterwards, when their car breaks down, Trish and Tommy are helped out by a young man named Rob. They take him to their house, where Tommy shows Rob several monster masks he made himself before Rob leaves to go camping.

Later that night, the teens begin the party. A jealous Sam sees Tina flirting with Paul and leaves. She goes out to the lake where Jason impales her from under a raft. When Paul goes out to look for her, he is stabbed in the groin with a harpoon gun. Terri tries to leave the party early, but before she can get on her bike Jason stabs her with a spear. After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy goes downstairs to get a bottle of wine. Jason pins his hand with a corkscrew before striking him in the face with a meat cleaver. Tina looks out a window upstairs when she is grabbed by Jason and thrown to her death, crashing on the car. While a [[Substance intoxication|stoned]] Ted watches vintage [[stag film|stag films]] with a film projector, he is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife from the other side of the projector screen. Jason then goes upstairs where Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower. After Sara leaves, Jason kills Doug by crushing his head against the shower tile. When Sara screams upon finding Doug's body, she tries to escape only for Jason to drive a double-bit axe through the front door, killing her.

Trish and Tommy return from town and discover the power outage. While looking for their mother, who had been killed by Jason earlier, Trish goes to find Rob for help. It is revealed that Rob is actually the brother of Jason's victim [[Friday the 13th Part 2|Sandra]]. Rob further explains to her that Jason is still alive and he came to Crystal Lake to get revenge for the murder of his sister. 

Worried for Tommy's safety, Trish and Rob return to the house. They then go next door to investigate and discover the teens' bodies. Gordon flees, and Rob is killed by Jason in the basement as Trish runs home, taking Rob's machete with her. She and Tommy barricade the house, but Jason breaks in and chases them into Tommy's room. Trish lures Jason out of the house and escapes, then returns home and is devastated to learn that Tommy is still there. She senses Jason behind her and tries to fight him off with the machete but is overpowered. Tommy, having disguised himself to look like Jason as a child, distracts him long enough for Trish to hit him with the machete, but she merely whacks off his mask. As Trish stands horrified at Jason's deformed face, Tommy takes the machete and strikes it in the side of his skull, causing him to collapse to the floor and split his head upon impact. When Tommy notices that Jason's fingers are slightly moving, he continues to hack at his body screaming, "Die! Die!" while Trish repeatedly yells out his name.

At the hospital, Trish is visited by Tommy. He rushes in, embraces her, and gives a disturbed look while staring ahead.

==Production==
When ''Friday the 13th Part III'' was released, it was initially supposed to end the series as a trilogy, however there was no moniker to indicate it as such. In 1983, there were rumors that Paramount Pictures billed the fourth film as "The Final Chapter" as a result of them feeling embarrassed by their association with the series. Despite how [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] claimed this in their review of the film on ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', Paramount Pictures was aware that the slasher genre had been declining in interest. However, the idea came from producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. (the son of Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr.) as he began to resent the series due to how he felt nobody respected him for working on ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'' as an production assistant and ''Part III'' as producer, regardless of how much money the films earned. As a result of this and him wanting to work on different projects, he wanted to conclude the series by killing off Jason.&lt;ref name=minor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/02/21/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter/|title=13 Things You May Not Know About Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (#2)|work=We Minored In Film|accessdate=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
The filmmakers wanted Joseph Zito, who had previously worked on ''[[The Prowler (1981 film)|The Prowler]]'', to direct and write the screenplay for the film. He initially claimed that he wasn't a writer, but he later accepted it when the contract offered him double payment for directing and writing. Zito secretly used the extra salary to hire Barney Cohen to write the script. Their process entailed Zito taking one-hour phone calls every night with Phil Scuderi to discuss the film's screenplay and story. He then met Cohen in a New York apartment to use the ideas Scuderi had offered, which then they would turn into script pages sent that day to Scuderi in Boston to be discussed again over the phone. Cohen remained credited for writing the film, but Zito and Cohen eventually got into trouble with the Writer's Guild of America as a result.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

Previous ''Friday the 13th'' films generally favored young women being the [[final girl]]. However, this is the first film in the series to not only have two survivors instead of one, but one of them being a child. The filmmakers believed this aspect has never been done before in a slasher film, as well as them wanting to create characters that the audience don't want to see harmed or killed. By including the Jarvis family (a divorced mother, a teenage daughter, and a pre-teen son) opposite the usual cast of teenagers, they could generate more drama and resonant tragedy such the implication of Mrs. Jarvis killed outside by Jason, and thus remaining debatable how intentional the parallels are between Jason and Tommy. Tommy's interest in make-up effects served as an homage to Tom Savini.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

===Casting===
Camilla More initially auditioned for the Samantha, but when the filmmakers discovered she had a twin sister they were instead offered the roles of Tina and Terri. They were swayed by the twins idea that Carry only needed to read one line.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

[[Amy Steel]], who starred as heroine [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]] in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'', co-starred with Peter Barton on the sitcom ''[[The Powers of Matthew Star]]''. Barton was offered the role of Doug when the sitcom was cancelled, but he was initially reluctant as he wanted no part in any horror film, especially after he disliked working on ''[[Hell Night]]''. However, because Steel was involved in ''Part 2'', she talked him into doing the film.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt; 

Make-up artist [[Tom Savini]], who had not returned for ''Part 2'' and ''Part III'', agreed to work on the film to help kill off Jason, who he helped create in the original film.

===Filming===
Filming commenced in October 1983 to January 1984 in Topanga Canyon and Newhall, California, 6 weeks over-schedule. It was originally set to be released in October 1984, but Frank Mancuso, Sr. pushed the release date to April 13, leaving them 6 weeks to complete post-production. The only time Paramount helped with the film's production, they rented a house in Malibu for the filmmakers to stay and conduct editing sessions, with food brought to them by the studio.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

The film had a troubled production on set. As a result of the director's poor treatment and the film's budget, many of the actors had to perform uncomfortable or dangerous stunts for the movie. Judie Aronson was required to remain submerged in a highly freezing lake, in which she later developed [[hypothermia]] because of it, and Peter Barton was genuinely slammed against the shower wall when Jason attacks him. Ted White, who portrays Jason Voorhees, defended several of the actors by requesting Barton to have a crash pad, and threatening to quit when Zito refused to remove Aronson from the cold lake in-between takes. White and Zito maintained a hostile relationship on set, resulting in White demanding his name to be removed from the credits. According to White, Corey Feldman maintained a bratty attitude on set as a result from Zito's treatment. When filming the scene of Tommy hacking at Jason's body, which were two sandbags he was striking at, Feldman pretended the sandbags were Zito.

According to the book ''Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th'', actress Kimberly Beck stated that she does not like the horror genre. In addition to this, she felt that the film was more of a C-movie rather than a B-movie. During filming, Kimberly Beck experienced strange encounters, including a man watching her while she ran in the park and receiving odd phone calls at all hours. This stopped when production was finished.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

Actress Bonnie Hellman's agents told her about taking the role of the hitchhiker in the film. They told her she would not want to do it as they were no lines said for the character, but she accepted the role anyway.&lt;ref name=minor/&gt;

The release was sold out in less than 24 hours of availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lalalandrecords.com/F13.html|title=La-La Land Records: Friday the 13th|publisher=La-La Land Records|accessdate=2012-01-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115052539/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/F13.html|archivedate=2012-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song "Love Is a Lie" by [[Lion (band)|Lion]] is featured in the film, but not on the soundtrack.

==Release==
''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter'' opened on Friday, April 13, 1984, on 1,594 screens to weekend box office gross of $11,183,148; this was the sixth-highest of the year. The film would ultimately take in a total of $32,980,880 at the U.S. box office.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 25% of 24 film critics have given the film a positive review; the rating average is 4.2 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter/|title=Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter Movie Reviews, Pictures|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film received what ''[[The Week]]'' characterized as "scathing reviews", especially from film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]], with the latter considering the film "an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash".  Scott Meslow summarized [[Roger Ebert]]'s criticism as calling it "a cynical retread" of the earlier films. Meslow instead says that the film attempts to kill off the series while focusing more on characterization than gore.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/588260/brilliance-lies-friday-13th-final-chapter|title=The brilliance and lies of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter|last=Meslow|first=Scott|work=[[The Week]]|date=2015-11-13|accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a series retrospective, Kyle Anderson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked it the best ''Friday the 13th'' film, complimenting both its narrative and kills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2014/04/25/friday-the-13th-tv-show-movie-rankings/|title='Friday the 13th': We rank the movies to prep for the TV show|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2014-04-25|accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="850">The '''gambler's palm''' is a [[card magic]] technique used to "palm" a card (to temporarily hide it during a [[magic trick]]).

In the gambler's palm the playing card is placed in the hand lengthwise as in the magician's palm, but is retained by pressure between the little finger and the right side of the thumb, which lies flat against the left side of the hand.  The advantages of this palm is that the card is not bent while palming, and the hand may be laid flat on the card table.&lt;ref name=erdnase&gt;

'''''Heat''''' is a entertainment magazine published by [[Bauer Media Group]]. {{As of|2006}} it is one of the biggest selling magazines in the UK, with a regular circulation over half a million.  Its mix of celebrity news, gossip, beauty advice and fashion is primarily aimed at women, although not as directly as in other women's magazines. It also features movie and music reviews, TV listings and major celebrity interviews. 

==History==
''Heat'' was launched in February 1999&lt;ref name=taf&gt;{{cite book|title=The Europa World Year: Kazakhstan - Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&amp;pg=PA4378|accessdate=3 August 2015|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-85743-255-8|page=4378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Bullen|title=Media Representations of Footballers' Wives: A Wag's Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CVvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=7 August 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-33569-2|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a general interest entertainment magazine, at a cost of more than £4m. However, unlike other Emap (now Bauer) magazine launches before and after, it was not an immediate success, with a circulation below 100,000. A series of revamps quickly repositioned the magazine as a less serious, more gossip-oriented magazine aimed at women, and circulation quickly grew. A series of high-profile celebrity relationships, such as [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Brad Pitt]] provided ample material, while reality shows such as ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Pop Idol]]'' grew popular at just the right time to help fill pages. Heat achieved record sale figures when [[Jade Goody]] had a make-over and was first on the front cover after her stint in ''[[Big Brother 2002 (UK)|Big Brother 3]]'' (2002) and later when [[Nikki Grahame]] and [[Pete Bennett]] from ''[[Big Brother 2006 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]'' split and Grahame was interviewed for  ''Heat'' in 2006.

In 2009–10 ''Heat'' spearheaded a campaign alongside [[Girls Aloud]]'s [[Nicola Roberts]] advocating the banning of sunbed use in the UK for under-18s. The campaign was a success and a bill was passed by Parliament shortly before the 2010 General Election.

The site crashed after the magazine was mentioned on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Million Pound Drop]]''; it took up to eight days to restore the site.

==Heatworld.com==
[[File:HeatworldLogo.png|right|thumb|Heatworld logo]]
Heatworld.com launched on 22 May 2007 and was edited by Julian Linley, who had been deputy editor of ''Heat'' magazine for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/16/bauer.pressandpublishing "Heat: Julian Linley appointed as editor"], ''The Guardian'', 16 June 2008, Retrieved 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The site is an online interpretation of the magazine, emulating the mix of [[celebrity]] news, gossip and fashion. However, heatworld.com does not replicate magazine content and bases itself more on [[video]] and [[sound recording|audio]] content and breaking news. The site is [[advertising]] funded.

==Heat Radio==
On 25 September 2007, [[Heat Radio]] launched. The station is owned by Bauer Radio, a division of the company, Bauer, which owns ''Heat'' magazine. The station can be listened to through [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on channel number 716, across the UK on DAB Digital Radio, on their app or at heatradio.com.

==Television channel==
On 3 July 2012, Heat launched, featuring celebrity news and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/23/heat-tv-launch-3-july |title=Heat TV to launch on 3 July |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 May 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel comes from [[Box Television]], a joint venture between Bauer and [[Channel Four Television Corporation|Channel Four]]. It replaced [[Q TV|Q]] on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Smallworld Cable]] and [[Virgin Media]] in the UK, in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on Sky and [[UPC Ireland]] and in [[Iceland]] on [[Síminn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/television/article/1133462/bauer-axes-q-tv-nearly-12-years-heat-tv/ |title=Bauer axes Q TV after nearly 12 years to make way for Heat TV |work=Brand Republic |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729202241/http://www.brandrepublic.com/television/article/1133462/bauer-axes-q-tv-nearly-12-years-heat-tv/ |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the channel was rebranded as [[Box Upfront]].

==Heat merchandise==
As ''Heat'' magazine grew in popularity, spin off merchandise was released to cash in on its success. Current items carrying the ''Heat'' brand name are an exercise DVD titled ''Heat: Get That Celeb Look'' which was released in 2003, an [[DVD TV game|interactive DVD game]] featuring celebrity questions, an [[Annual publication|annual]] for the year 2007 and in 2003 a set of mini books titled ''Say What'' were released containing quotes from celebrities such as [[Gareth Gates]].

==Controversy==
In an issue which was released on 27 November 2007, ''Heat'' used a photograph of [[Jordan (Katie Price)|Katie Price]]'s disabled son, who suffers from [[septo-optic dysplasia]], a rare condition which means he is visually impaired and suffers from hormonal deficiencies, causing him to easily gain weight and means he is partially blind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/newsbeat/071129_harvey.shtml "Harvey sticker: Your views"]. BBC Radio 1, 29 November 2007, Retrieved 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; on a sticker which was included with the magazine, with the slogan "Harvey wants to eat me!" The magazine's editor [[Mark Frith]] made an apology for the offence caused by the sticker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7118727.stm "Heat sorry for Joran son sticker"]. [[BBC News]], 29 November 2007, Retrieved 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and an apology was also posted on the magazine's website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.heatworld.com/Article.aspx?articleid=3326&amp;title=Harvey+%E2%80%93+Sorry "Harvey - Sorry"]. Heatworld.com, 29 November 2007, Retrieved 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Press Complaints Commission]] confirmed that Katie Price was planning to make a complaint about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a80880/jordan-to-complain-to-pcc-over-magazine.html "Jordan to complain to PCC over magazine"]. Digital Spy, 30 November 2007, Retrieved 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was also criticized in the press over the incident, with one editorial describing it as "the lowest point in British journalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/janice_turner/article2980262.ece "The lowest point in British journalism"]. ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 1 December 2007, Retrieved 1 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another issue released on 6–12 September 2014, ''Heat'' published a photograph of Justin Timberlake, husband to Jessica Biel, at a nightclub in Paris on the night after his performance. The star was photographed partying with women at the club as the title named it "Justin Timberlake gets flirty with another woman, "It is not his wife!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/21/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-heat-lawsuit Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel settle Heat lawsuit] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'', Retrieved 18 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Once the article, as well as the pictures surfaced it caused his marriage with Jessica to be manipulated. The singer and actor lodged a defamation claim in the courts in Ireland against the publishers of the celebrity title over an article, photographs and quotes attributed to Total Recall actor Biel. In the agreed statement read in the high court, a lawyer for the Heat publisher-Bauer group admitted the article – headlined and "The flirty photos that rocked Justin and Jessica’s marriage" – was based on an unfounded report. The article also included purported statements improperly attributed to Biel which the publishers said Heat now understands the actor never made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/news/590631/jessica-biel-and-justin-timberlake-satisfied-after-tabloid-apologizes-for-false-report-about-j-t-flirting-in-paris Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake "Satisfied" After Tabloid Apologizes for False Report About J.T. Flirting in Paris] ''[[E! News]]'', Retrieved 18 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were eventually fixed as Bauer media group apologized on Heat Magazine's behalf, and a settlement was made in a hearing before the president of the High Court, Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29708558 Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel settle Heat magazine legal action].

It is a subgenre of [[tokusatsu]] entertainment. This word originated from the Chinese ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E6%80%AA%E7%8D%A3|title=Introduction to Kaiju [in Japanese]|publisher=dic-pixiv|date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110007480367|title=A Study of Chinese monster culture - Mysterious animals that proliferates in present age media [in Japanese]|publisher=Hokkai-Gakuen University|date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Kaiju originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient Japanese legends.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/le-grand-bain/le-grand-bain-10-mai-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Kaiju" first appears in ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]''. After ''[[Sakoku]]'', opening Japan to foreign relations, Japanese came to use the term kaiju to express concepts from [[paleontology]] and [[legendary creature]]s from around the world. For example, in 1908, during the [[Meiji period]], it was suggested that the extinct ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' was [[Partridge Creek monster|alive]] in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref name="Glanzman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Glanzman | first=Sam | url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=TE4rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT110#v=onepage | title=Red Range: A Wild Western Adventure | work=Joe R.

==Terminology==

===Kaiju===

The term Kaiju translates to "strange beast". It is a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] giant creature that often takes the role of either [[antagonist]], [[protagonist]], or [[natural phenomenon|force of nature]]. [[Godzilla]] is an example of a kaiju; others include [[Mothra]], [[King Ghidorah]], [[Mechagodzilla]], [[King Kong]], [[Rodan]], [[Gamera]], [[Gyaos]], [[Daimajin]] and [[Gappa: The Triphibian Monster|Gappa]]. The term ''ultra-kaiju'' is longhand for kaiju in the [[Ultra Series]].

===Daikaiju===

{{nihongo|''Daikaiju''|大怪獣|daikaijū|large kaiju}} roughly translates as large strange beast, and refers to the larger monsters. The literal translation is about a size difference between a kaiju and a daikaiju, with the implication that the daikaiju is the greater of the two types. The exact definition of what determines a kaiju from a daikaiju is debated. This term is used for the most powerful kaiju, the prefix dai- emphasizing great power or status. The first appearance of Daikaiju is in the Japanese title ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'', {{nihongo|'''''Sora no Daikaijū Radon'''''|空の大怪獣 ラドン|| "Radon, Giant Monster of the Sky"}}. Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra are the san daikaiju, the three great kaiju.&lt;ref name="Weinstock, Jeffery 2014"&gt;Weinstock, Jeffery (2014) The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters. Farnham. Ashgate Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the term exists in a 1908 book.&lt;ref name=ndl/&gt;

===Kaijin===

''Kaijin''(怪人) refers to humanoid kaiju found in tokusatsu, and is literally translated as "monster man" or "mystery man". The [[Villain of the week]] from the ''[[Kamen Rider Series]]'' are examples of ''kaijin''.

===Seijin===

''Seijin''(星人, star beings) is a Japanese suffixal term for extraterrestrial aliens, such as "Kaseijin(火星人)" which means "[[Martian]]". Aliens can also be called "Uchujin" (宇宙人) which means "space beings".

===Kaijū Eiga===

{{nihongo|''Kaijū Eiga''|怪獣映画|kaijū eiga|[[monster movie]]}}, 
A [[film]] featuring giant monsters or a single giant monster.

[[Toho]] has produced a variety of kaiju films over the years (many of which featured Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra) but other Japanese studios contributed to expanding the genre in Japan by producing films and shows of their own, including [[Daiei Film]], [[Kadokawa Pictures]], [[Tsuburaya Productions]], and [[Shochiku]] and [[Nikkatsu]] Studios.

===Suitmation===
A technique that was developed to portray the kaiju. An actor plays the part of the kaiju while in an articulated costume.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Monster techniques==

Eiji Tsubaraya, who was in charge of the special effects for ''Gojira'', developed a technique to animate the kaiju that became known colloquially as suitmation.&lt;ref name="Weinstock, Jeffery 2014"/&gt; Where Western monster movies often utilized a technique known as [[stop motion]] to animate the monsters, Tsubaraya decided to attempt to create suits, referred to as a [[creature suit]], for a human ([[suit actor]]) to wear and act in.&lt;ref name="Ed suit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSARjZ0OXc|title=Making of the Godzilla Suit|last=Godziszewski|first=Ed|work=Classic Media 2006 DVD Special Features|date=September 5, 2006|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was combined with the use of miniature models and scaled down city sets to create the illusion of a giant creature in a city.&lt;ref name="Allison, Anne 2006"&gt;Allison, Anne (2006) Snake Person Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination. Oakland. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the extreme stiffness of the latex or rubber suits often filming would be done at double speed, so that when the film was shown the monster was smoother and slower than the original shot.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Kaiju films also utilized a form of [[puppetry]] interwoven between suitmation scenes which served to have shots that were physically impossible for the actor to perform in the suit. Later [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was used for certain special sequences and monsters, but overall, the suitmation technique has been present in an overwhelming majority of kaiju films produced in Japan of all eras. American produced kaiju films strayed from this however, and began to focus on CGI in recent releases such as the 2014 release of ''Godzilla''. These suitmation techniques were adapted by almost all kaiju films, and continue even in modern Japanese kaiju films and tokusatsu although more stop motion and CGI are utilized.&lt;ref name="Allison, Anne 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Failes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/22234-special-effects-in-godzilla-movies-history|title=The History of Godzilla Is the History of Special Effects|last=Failes|first=Ian|work=Inverse|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the second season of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', there is a story arc composed of two episodes entitled "The Zillo Beast" and "The Zillo Beast Strikes Back", mostly influenced by ''Godzilla'' films, in which a huge reptilian beast is transported from its homeworld Malastare to the city-covered planet Coruscant, where it breaks loose and goes on a rampage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Zillo Beast" Episode Guide |url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-zillo-beast |accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" Episode Guide |url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-zillo-beast-strikes-back |accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the [[rancor]] was originally to be played by an actor in a suit similar to the way how kaiju films like ''Godzilla'' were made.

'''''Morabaraba''''' is a traditional two-player [[Abstract strategy|strategy]] [[board game]] played in [[South Africa]] and [[Botswana]] with a slightly different variation played in [[Lesotho]]. The game is known by many names in many languages, including ''mlabalaba'', ''mmela'' (in Setswana), ''muravava'', and ''umlabalaba''. The game is similar to twelve men's morris, a variation on the Roman board game [[nine men's morris]].

While some believe that ''morabaraba'' was introduced to Southern Africa by British settlers, morris variants exist in many parts of the world; e.g. India (''char bhar''), Ghana (''achi''), Kenya (''shisimia''), Somalia (''[[Shax (board game)|shax]]''), Zimbabwe (''tsoro yemutwelve''), the Philippines (''tapatan'') and Mongolia (''gurgaldaj''). It is claimed that ''morabaraba'' boards carved in rock are dated to be at least 800 years old, which would exclude a European origin. However, many rock art images do not actually show ''morabaraba'', but the ''[[mancala]]''-type game of ''moruba'' (using {{em|rows}} of cupules).

''Morabaraba'' is today most popular amongst rural African youth in Southern Africa. In the traditional European games like nine men's morris, the counters are commonly referred to as "men", but in the South African game the counters are referred to as "cows", the game being particularly popular amongst youth who herd cattle.

According to the ''[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]'', the term ''morabaraba'' is derived from the [[Southern Sotho]] ''moraba-raba'', meaning 'to [[Gristmill|mill]]' or 'to go round in a circle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/morabaraba|title=morabaraba |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |at=American English section |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Morabaraba'' is accessible and easy to learn, and games can be played quickly, but the strategic and tactical aspects of the game run deep. While it may be played on specially produced boards (or [[Computer simulation|simulated]] by computer software as a [[video game]]), it is simple enough that a board can easily be scratched on a stone or into sand, with coins or pebbles (or whatever comes to hand) used as the pieces. The description below is compatible with [[Mind Sports South Africa]]'s "generally accepted rules".

There are three main phases to the game:

# Placing the cows
# Moving the cows
# Flying the cows

===Placing the cows===
* The board is empty when the game begins. Each player has 12 pieces, known as "cows"; one player has light cows and the other has dark cows
* The player with the dark cows moves first
* Each turn consists of placing a cow on an empty intersection on the board
* The aim is to create a "mill": a row of three cows on any line drawn on the board
* If a player forms a mill, he or she may remove or "shoot" one of the opponent's cows. The shot cow is removed from the board and not placed again. A cow in a mill may not be shot unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills, in which case any cow may be shot.
* Even if a move creates more than one mill, only one cow can be shot in a single move

===Moving the cows===
* After all the cows have been placed, each turn consists of moving a cow to an empty adjacent intersection
* As before, completing a mill allows a player to shoot one of the opponent's cows. Again, this must be a cow which is not in a mill, unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills.
* Players are allowed to "break" their own mills
* A mill may be broken and remade repeatedly by shuffling cows back and forth. Each time the mill is remade, one of the opponent's cows is shot. Of course, by breaking the mill the player exposes the cows which were in a mill to the risk of being shot by the opponent on his or her next turn.
* In the "generally accepted rules" published by Mind Sports South Africa, a mill which is broken to form a new mill can not be formed again on the next move

===Flying the cows===
* When a player has only three cows remaining, desperate measures are called for. This player's cows are allowed to "fly" to any empty intersection, not just adjacent ones.
* If one player has three cows and the other player has more than three cows, only the player with three cows is allowed to fly

===Finishing the game===
* A win occurs if one opponent has no moves
* A win occurs if a player has just two cows
* If either player has only three cows and neither player shoots a cow within ten moves, the game is drawn
* If one person cheats, then the other one wins by default

==''Morabaraba'' as sport==
Currently the International Wargames Federation is the international [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for the game as a competitive sport, and Mind Sports South Africa (MSSA) is the South African governing body. MSSA is recognised by both the South African Department of Sports and Recreation and the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) .

MSSA has developed amateur leagues, using different regional versions of the game, throughout the country, and has adopted a notation scoring system similar to that for nine men's morris.

The game is an official discipline of the Traditional World Games, which are held every five years. Tournaments were not just in South Africa, but also in Bangkok (Thailand), Melbourne (Australia), New Orleans (United States), Athens (Greece), and at the Epsom College in England.

==World Championships==
Since 1997, Morabaraba World Championships have been held, in three divisions: senior (i.e. adult males), women, and junior (boys and girls).  Divisional winners are shown in the table below.

[[File:Sesotho Morabaraba board.svg|thumb|right|280px|The board used for the Sesotho variation of ''morabaraba'']]
===Sesotho board===
This is the variation typically played by [[Sesotho]]-speakers in South Africa and Lesotho. It differs from the standard form in that the board does not have diagonals between  the center points of its sides and there is an additional intersection in the center of the board to prevent a draw.

===Eleven men's morris===
This is a European variation that uses the same board as ''morabaraba'' but is played with eleven counters. This prevents a situation where the game can end in a draw in the placement phase.

==Standard notation==
The standard Welt–Mühlespiel–Dachverband notation for nine men's morris works well for ''morabaraba'' {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see diagram)}}. It is very similar to [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation in chess]]. The board is laid out on a grid, with the columns in the grid being labelled a–g (from left to right), and rows in the grid being labelled from 1–7 (bottom to top). Each point is then referred to by its coordinate; for example, the top-left point in the middle (not inner) square is labelled b6. Moves are then formatted as in chess or draughts: placing a piece is denoted simply by the square where it is placed; moving a piece by the from and to squares (e.g. c5-d5); capturing by appending the captured piece to the move (e.g., c5-b6xe5 or c4xa1).

The people in southern Thailand make their puppets out of leather. It has a size between 15 and 50 centimeters. The performance consists of the puppet, the narrator, the actor, and the musician. The actor and the audience are split by a white screen when performing a show, that is distinct from other puppet shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xip.fi/atd/thailand/forms-of-puppet-theatre-nang-talung-and-hun.html Nang Talung], XIP, Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

Nang Talung has been extremely popular for a long time. On the other hand, Nang Talung is slowly disappearing because it is complicated. Presently, there is a campaign to preserve the heritage of art of shadow play to remain forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneweirdglobe.com/nang-talung-museum-thai-shadowplay-made-awesome/ Thai Shadow Play]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Script coverage''' is a [[filmmaking]] term for the analysis and grading of [[screenplay]]s, often within the "script development" department of a [[production company]].
While coverage may remain entirely verbal, it usually takes the form of a written report, guided by a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] that varies from company to company. Criteria include, but are not limited to:

* IDENTIFICATION: Title, Author, Type of Material, Locale, [[Genre]]
* LOGLINE: A one sentence summary
* COMMENT SUMMARY: A paragraph summary of the analysis
* GRADE:  ''Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor'' for categories that include characterization, premise, storyline, production values, dialogue and more
* SYNOPSIS: Summary of plot: 1-3 pages depending on script quality
* BUDGET: The script reader's estimated budget
* ANALYSIS

==Script timeline==

Script coverage is the summary and analysis of a script's plot and writing quality, used by production companies and agencies to track film and TV screenplays.  Coverage consists of a number of elements. The first is a 1-to-2-page synopsis of the script’s story highlighting the main characters and events of the tale. The second is a subjective review of the piece (typical length of which could range anywhere from 1 sentence, in short-form contest coverage, to 2 or 3 pages) which assesses the effectiveness of the screenplay’s various components—including its concept, story structure, story development, characters, dialogue, and writing style—and points out its strong points and problem areas.  The evaluation ends with a recommendation from the analyst as to what he/she feels the production entity should do with the script. This recommendation usually employs 1 of 3 terms:

•	'''Pass:''' The reader feels the script fails to make the grade in most areas and that the production entity should not proceed with it.

•	'''Consider:''' The reader feels the script has a considerable number of strong points and is good enough to proceed with, while acknowledging that it has a number of significant problems that need to be successfully solved before the piece can be considered suitable for production.

•	'''Recommend:''' The reader feels the script is extremely strong in all respects and that the production entity should proceed with it without reservation.

When completed, the synopsis, review, and evaluation are assembled and fronted with a cover page that lists the script’s vital information (author’s name, story genre, time and locations in which it takes place, length of the script, etc.) and contains a brief summary of the story and the review. The cover page usually includes a checklist in which the script’s various aspects are rated on a scale ranging from poor to excellent. Finally, the cover page highlights the analyst’s ultimate recommendation.

Although script coverage is a tool used primarily by motion picture production entities, it is sometimes used by screenwriting competitions as a way of separating "wheat from chaff." The coverage done for script competitions is usually simpler than that done for production companies—substituting a logline (a brief 1 or 2 line summary of the story) for the synopsis and simplifying the assessment—often employing only the checklist rating of the script’s various aspects.

In addition to production entities and screenwriting competitions, a number of independent services employ a roster of veteran script analysts to provide professional-level coverage for screenwriters who wish to see how their scripts will be received by the industry.This gives the writers a chance to identify and resolve problems before submitting them to production entities.

==Issues in coverage==

=== Economy of the script ===
By the very nature of summarizing a complicated plot, the coverage will not include every plot twist and subplot. Some characters will be omitted, or only briefly introduced for the sake of brevity. In order to decide on what will stay and what will go, the character and actions must support the main plot, and ultimately the premise of the story. Scripts that are not economical and include peripheral characters, scenes, and storylines that do not support character or plot development do not affect their motivation, and therefore can be omitted from the coverage. In this manner, well-written scripts may have longer synopses than poorly written scripts with a lot of extraneous action.

'''Seven stones''', traditionally known as '''Pittu Garam''', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Stones|url=http://www.traditionalgames.in/home/property-games/seven-stones-elu-kallu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]:ਪਿੱਠੂ ਗਰਮ, Urdu:{{Nastaliq|پٹھو گرم}}, {{lang-sd|پِٺُو گرم}}, [[Persian language|Persian]]: هفت سنگ) is a traditional [[South Asian]] game played between two teams. The game is called [[Lagori]] in [[kannada]]. The game requires a [[tennis ball]] and set of seven stones which can be stacked up to form a small tower. The aim of the [[game]] is to be able to break the tower and then rebuild it before getting hit by one of the opponent.

[[File:Pittu.JPG|thumb|Seven stones game|right]]

==Gameplay==
* Divide the players into two teams. Let there be team A and team B.
* Each player in team A takes their turn in breaking the tower from a certain distance using a tennis ball.
* A player from team B is assigned to catch the ball after it gets thrown by team A. The rest of team B become fielders.
* When a player from team A succeeds in knocking over the tower, the team's next aim becomes to rebuild the tower while everyone in team B tries to get all the players out in team A  by hitting them with the tennis ball.
* If team B succeeds in getting the players with the pittu coin in hand out from team A before the tower is rebuilt then they have defended a pittu.
* However, if team B fails to do so then team A gets a pittu and they carry on with their turn in breaking the tower.
* Once everyone in team A has had their turn the teams swap the roles.
* After both teams have defended the team with most number of pittu(s) wins.

==Rules==
* Each player gets three tries for attempting to break the tower. If the player fails to break the tower, next player comes in.
* If a team is successful in getting a pittu, the player which broke the tower gets an additional three tries.
* If a player successfully breaks the tower but a player from the opposite team catches the ball before it hits the ground, then the attacking player is deprived of his remaining tries.
* When a player from defending team picks up a tennis ball they may not move from that position till they have thrown the ball away.
* If all players fail to break the tower, the other team must at-least complete one tower to win the game.

A '''shared universe''' or '''shared world''' is a set of creative works where more than one writer (or other artist) independently contributes a work that can stand alone but fits into the joint development of the storyline, characters, or world of the overall project. It is common in genres like [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|title=Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1995|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-518408-3|pages=120–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from [[collaborative writing]] where multiple artists are working together on the same work and from [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] where the works and characters are independent except for a single meeting.

The term ''shared universe'' is also used within comics to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

A specific kind of shared universe that is published across a variety of media (e.g. novels, films, role-playing games, etc.), each of them contributing to the growth, history, and status of the setting is called an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

The term has also been used in a wider, non-literary sense to convey [[interdisciplinary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contingencies of Professional Differentiation |author=Smith, Harvey L. |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |date=Jan 1958 |volume=63 |issue=4 |page=410 |doi=10.1086/222264}}&lt;/ref&gt; or social commonality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Repetition in Conversation: Toward a Poetics of Talk |author=Tannen, Deborah |year=1987 |journal=Language |issue=63 |volume=63 |pages=574–605 |doi=10.2307/415006 |jstor=415006 |publisher=Language, Vol. 63, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in the context of a "shared universe of discourse".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=David R.|title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1993|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25464-3|pages=34–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}

== Definitions ==
Fiction in some [[Mass media|media]], such as most [[television programs]] and many [[comic book]] titles, is understood{{By whom|date=December 2017}} to require the contribution of multiple authors and does not by itself create a shared universe and is considered a collaborative art form. Incidental appearances, such as that of [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', are considered literary [[cameo appearance]]s. More substantial interaction between characters from different sources is often marketed as a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. While crossovers occur in a shared universe, not all crossovers are intended to merge their settings' [[back-stories]] and are instead used for marketing, parody, or to explore [[Alternate history|"what-if" scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=Mar 1994 |title=Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology |author=Reynolds, Richard |isbn=978-0-87805-694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comics &amp; Culture: analytical and theoretical approaches to comics |author=Magnussen, Anne and Hans-christian Christiansen, eds. |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |date=Apr 2000 |isbn=978-87-7289-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can become difficult for writers contributing to a shared universe to maintain consistency and avoid contradicting details in earlier works, especially when a shared universe grows to be very large. The version deemed "official" by the author or company controlling the setting is known as [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Not all shared universes have a controlling entity capable of or interested in determining canonicity, and not all fans agree with these determinations when they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers |author=Pustz, Matthew |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] may instead find some degree of consensus within the setting's [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=All Shapes of Hunger: Teenagers and Fanfiction |journal=Voya |author=Moore, Rebecca C. |date=Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers, in an effort to ensure that a canon can be established and to keep details of the setting believable, employ tools to correct contradictions and errors that result from multiple contributors working over a long period of time. One such tool is [[retcon]]ning, short for "retroactive continuity", which resolves errors in continuity that came about through previously-written conflicting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retcon Tricks |journal=Star Trek Monthly Magazine |author=Jones, Nick |date=Feb 2002 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers may also object when a story or series is integrated into a shared universe, feeling it "requir[es] one hero's fans to buy other heroes' titles".&lt;ref name="BurtCL"&gt;{{cite journal |title="Blown To Atoms or Reshaped At Will": Recent Books About Comics |author=Burt, Stephen |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 2005 |volume=32 |page=166 |doi=10.1353/lit.2005.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of existing material into a shared universe is not restricted to settings licensed from movies and television. For example, [[Larry Niven]] opened his [[Known Space]] setting to other writers initially because he considered his lack of military experience prevented him from adequately describing the wars between mankind and the [[Kzinti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scribner, Ted|title=Novel Collaborations |url=http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055400/http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which he has made the setting available for other writers became a topic of controversy, when [[Elf Sternberg]] created an [[erotic literature|erotic short story]] set in Known Space following an author's note from Niven indicating that "[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ringworld Engineers |author=Niven, Larry |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven has since clarified that his setting is still to be used only "under restricted circumstances and with permission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Larry Niven |publisher=Slashdot |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/10/167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110227/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F10%2F167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Niven granted to the several authors of the [[Man-Kzin Wars]] series. By contrast, author [[Eric Flint]] has edited and published collaborations with fan fiction writers directly, expanding his [[1632 series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1632: About this Site |author=Eves, David |date=Sep 2005 |url=http://1632.org/About.html |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A setting may also be expanded in a similar manner after the death of its creator, although this posthumous expansion does not meet some strict definitions of a shared universe. One such example is [[August Derleth]]'s development of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] from the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], an approach whose result is considered by some to be "completely dissimilar" to Lovecraft's own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tierney |first=Richard L. |title=The Derleth Mythos |publisher=Nightscapes |date=2004-09-09 |url=http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209052219/http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less controversial posthumous expansions include [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]]'s and later authors' sequels to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[Land of Oz|Oz]]'' stories and the further development of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' universe by [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], and [[David Brin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Following Asimov's Foundation |publisher=Cyberhaven |year=1999 |url=http://www.cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html |accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811055828/http://cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other published works of this nature take the form of a series of short-story [[anthologies]] with occasional standalone novels.

[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|Early example: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]], thereby establishing a shared continuity within the [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] "universe".]]
Within comics, the term ''shared universe'' has been used to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

By 1961, [[Marvel Comics]] writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], working with artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], merged the bulk of the publisher's comics characters into the [[Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="BurtCL" /&gt; Marvel sets its stories in an increasing number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]], each with an assigned number in a greater "[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]".&lt;ref name="MarvMulti"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 6: Fantastic Four |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=2004-11-24 |isbn=978-0-7851-1480-2 |author=writer, Kit Kiefer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]] and Marvel have also periodically co-published series in which their respective characters meet and interact. These [[intercompany crossovers]] have typically been written as self-limiting events that avoid implying that the DC Universe and Marvel Universe co-exist. Exceptions include the twenty-four comics released under the [[metafiction]]al [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Amalgam Comics]] in 1996, depicting a shared universe populated by hybridizations of the two companies' characters. Marvel has since referred to this as part of its setting's greater multiverse by labeling it Earth-692.&lt;ref name="MarvMulti" /&gt;

Although DC and Marvel's shared universe approaches to comics have set them apart from competitors in the industry,&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Brant W. |title=Myth Conceptions: 'Summer Blockbusters' |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |date=2006-06-05 |url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026024638/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; other companies have attempted similar models.

== Universes in films and television ==
{{Main|List of fictional shared universes in film and television}}
Universes in films (or television) mostly consist of a franchise featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also being part of a coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional universes with major presence in films are referred to as '''cinematic universes''', while fictional universes with major presence in television are refereed to as '''television universes'''. Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television universes are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.

An early universe in cinema history was the ''[[Universal Monsters#Recurring cast and characters|Universal Monsters]]'' series of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', which ran from 1931 to 1951 and featured recurring cast and characters.

Some universes in film have originated as film adaptations of novels, such as the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] based on the spy novels by [[Ian Fleming]]. The films adapt some elements from the novels, however they are not direct adaptations, additionally they were not adapted in the same order as the books released. The first film in the series is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), and has produced 23 sequels, with the most recent one being ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). Due to the series spanning more than 50 years, [[James Bond]] has been portrayed by six actors, all the other frequent cast of characters has also gone through replacements, additionally after all Fleming's novels were adapted the series shifted towards original scripts. However, all films are set within a single, coherent fictional continuity, even if the writers, directors and cast change between films. Aspects of the fictional universe are retained between films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|title=Every James Bond Movie Ever, Ranked Worst To Best|date=April 16, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717200714/http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|archivedate=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film series also originated as a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, taking many creative liberties. The original film titled ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) focused on present-day astronaut George Taylor landing on a mysterious planet ruled by apes, which is revealed to be a future planet Earth at the end of the film. The sequel ''Beneath'' focused on Brent, an astronaut sent on a rescue mission to save Taylor. The third film ''Escape'' introduced [[time travel]] and shifted the focus towards the apes Zira and Cornelius, who appeared as supporting characters in the previous films, as they travel to the past in Taylor's spaceship. The fourth and fifth films, ''Conquest'' and ''Battle'', focus on Zira and Cornelius' son Cesar leading the up-rise against the humans and to the future depicted in the original film. A television series and an animated series are also considered part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|title=Planet of the Apes: A Timeline and an Explanation|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713112149/http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the ''Planet of the Apes'' in the original timeline before the time travel occurred was explained in a prequel-reboot film series with the ape Cesar becoming the main protagonist again, with the story focused on his life from childhood to an old ape, and how the conflict between the apes and the humans, started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|title=The Planet of the Apes series is quietly showing the world how to reboot a franchise right|publisher=The Verge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610123359/https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|archivedate=June 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series was created by [[George Lucas]], produced by his self-funded production company Lucasfilm. It originated with the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977), followed by two sequels under the subtitles ''[[Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983); together, those three films are known as the original trilogy and focuses on [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia]]. The prequel trilogy composed of ''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) expanded the series into a Saga, and focused on Luke Skywalker's father [[Anakin Skywalker]], new cast members portrayed younger versions of characters from the Original trilogy, while other actors returned to their original trilogy roles. On television, the lore was expanded through animation, the animated film titled ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) served as the pilot of an [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated series of the same name]] (2008-2014). Lucas was deeply creatively involved in the previously mentioned works, but he ceased creative involvement with the ''Star Wars'' franchise in 2014. Lucasfilm announced that from April 2014, only such previously mentioned works would be considered canonical, along all of the fictional works released after such date. The animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' (2014-2018), was the first work released after. A sequel trilogy formed by ''[[Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017) and the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX|Episode IX]]'' (2019) featured many returning cast members along newcomers. The films’ main saga is conformed of the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies. A concurrent spin-off film series, known as the anthology films, expands the stories of plot points and characters from the main series. Additionally the series expanded into video games, comics, and novels, telling original stories based on the franchise, classifying it as an imaginary entertainment environment,&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel. [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fantasy-role-playing-game-a-new-performing-art/oclc/45575501 ''The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art''] (Jefferson, NC: McFarland. 2001) pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; where the films share the same [[Star Wars canon|continuity]] as all the other media formats, regardless of the different media formats. Lucasfilm's "Story Group" coordinates a cohesive story-telling and ensures consistency and synergy by avoiding plot holes between all the film and non-film works. The ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' brand is used to brand all the re-prints of non-canonical works (television films, animated series, video-games, comics, and novels) of the franchise which were produced and/or ceased production before April 2014. Lucas himself considered the ''Legends'' works as non-canonical because considered them to diminish his films meaning by not adhering to his vision. Albeit, Lucas did include a few of the ''Legends'' elements that he supported within his works, such as characters and places which made those included elements canonical. Storytellers after Lucas have also incorporated ''Legends'' elements in their stories, sometimes with the help of the original creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|title=How Star Wars Mastered the Shared Universe|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517220938/http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for comic book based films, there are two cinematic universes based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, both set within a different continuity. The [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], which originated in 2000, is the longest-running superhero film franchise to be set within the same continuity. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has the most films, as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|multiple TV shows]] and a separate run of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] that co-exist and share the same continuity, making the MCU an imaginary entertainment environment. The [[DC Extended Universe]] is a movie franchise that encompasses different movies series based on the [[DC Comics]] characters, all of them sharing a continuity.

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] created a fictional universe used in several of his films, as well as comics and a television series:  the [[View Askewniverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The View Askewniverse | url=http://www.viewaskew.com | website=[[View Askewniverse|The View Askewniverse]] | access-date=December 29, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216205425/http://www.viewaskew.com/ | archivedate=December 16, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is named for Smith's production company, [[View Askew Productions]]. The characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] (played by Smith) appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others.  Recurring characters, settings, and motifs of the View Askewniverse first appeared in Smith's debut film, [[Clerks]], in 1994.

Among the most successful novel-to-film adaptations are the film trilogies of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' (2012–2014) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (2001–2003), all of which were directed by [[Peter Jackson]], while serving as faithful adaptations of the novels by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (especially ''The Lord of the Rings''). The first work in the series was ''[[The Hobbit (novel)|The Hobbit novel]]'' published in 1937. The novels focused on the hobbits [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]], as well as the wizard [[Gandalf]], among other species such as dwarves and elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|title=Looking back on what made the Lord of the Rings trilogy special, 15 years later|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826115748/https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videogames taking place between the films of the saga have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|title=Middle-earth: Shadow of War - PlayStation 4 - www.GameInformer.com|website=www.gameinformer.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826123803/https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Universes in television ====
This refers to universes that are based on television shows without any films. Television series may lead to a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] set in the same universe, often focusing on a single character from the original. The American sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' led to two spin-off series based on its characters, in the form of ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[The Tortellis]]''.

A significant example of shared universes among television shows is the [[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis]], which suggests that hundreds of American television series take place in the same universe. It builds from the assumption that when an actor playing a character from one series guest-stars in a second series, in character, both of those series must take place in the same universe. The theory takes its name from a character in the final episode of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', where the common interpretation of the events of that finale is that the entire ''St. Elsewhere'' universe – including all connected series – exist only within Westphall's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Gravely|first1=Gary|title=A Multiverse of Narratives: Possible Worlds Theory and Authorship From the Lone Artist to Corporate Authors|date=August 2015|institution=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|location=Murfreesboro, TN|pages=166-167|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718228166|degree=Ph.D.|id=No.3719757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', known as the "[[Whoniverse]]", has relatively little consistency given its division into [[audio play]]s produced by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] and the BBC, the [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] universe novel, or a universe based on comics published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary Russell two |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721053617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television network [[The CW]] houses the [[Arrowverse]], a shared universe of television shows based on characters from DC Comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Black Lightning Part Of The Arrow-verse?

=== Universes in animated films and animated series ===
{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
The [[Mickey Mouse universe]] dates back to the 1930s when the animated cartoon was expanded into a newspaper strip. Although the characters occasionally portray other roles and with other names, the writers address this discrepancy by thinking of the characters as being "employed" by Disney as actors. [[Walt Disney]], when asked whether or not [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] were married, replied that the mice were indeed married in their "private li[ves]", but that they sometimes appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend for "screen purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Pixar universe]] is an elaborate [[fan theory]] suggesting that all [[Pixar]] animated movies take place in the same universe. At the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], during the "Pixar Secrets Revealed" panel, director [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] rejected the theory, with ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' co-director [[Ronnie del Carmen]] adding "Do you know what kinds of meetings we'd have to have to make sure all our movies line up?!"&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Things We Learned from the 'Pixar Secrets Revealed' Panel|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|accessdate=August 17, 2015|newspaper=Oh My Disney|date=August 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817120038/http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Originating in video games and the internet ==
The influence of the [[Internet]] on [[collaborative fiction|collaborative]] and [[interactive fiction]] has also resulted in a large number of amateur shared universe settings. Amateur authors have created shared universes by contributing to [[mailing lists]], story [[archive]]s and [[Usenet]].

One of the lesser known, but still widely popular shared universes is the [http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php Whateley Academy stories], a series set in a fictional superhero-themed universe detailing the events occurring at the titular mutant school Whateley Academy.

== Other media ==
The 2000 musical ''[[Seussical]]'' presented several works of [[Dr. Seuss]] as taking place in the same fictional world.

[[Hasbro]] toy products including [[G.I. Joe]] and [[Transformers]] are considered by their manufacturer to exist fictionally within the [[Hasbro Universe]].

{{nihongo|'''Shintaro Ishihara'''|石原 慎太郎|Ishihara Shintarō|born 30 September 1932}} is a Japanese politician and author who was [[Governor of Tokyo]] from 1999 to 2012. Being the former leader of right-leaning [[Japan Restoration Party]], Ishihara is one of the most prominent [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] politicians in modern [[Japanese politics]].

His arts career included a prize-winning novel, best-sellers and work also in theater, film and journalism. His 1989 book, ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'', co-authored with [[Sony]] chairman [[Akio Morita]] (1991 in English), called on the authors' countrymen to stand up to the United States.

After an early career as a writer and film director, he served in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] from 1968 to 1972, in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] from 1972 to 1995, and as Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. He resigned from the governorship to briefly co-lead the [[Sunrise Party]], then joined the [[Japan Restoration Party]] and returned to the House of Representatives in the [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20121216x3.html |title=Ex-Tokyo Gov.

== Early life and artistic career ==
Shintaro Ishihara  was born in [[Suma-ku, Kobe]]. His father Kiyoshi was an employee, later a general manager, of a [[shipping company]]. Shintaro grew up in [[Zushi, Kanagawa]]. In 1952, he entered [[Hitotsubashi University]], and he graduated in 1956. Just two months before graduation, Ishihara won the [[Akutagawa Prize]] (Japan's most prestigious literary prize) for the novel ''[[Season of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-shintaro.com/runner/index.html |title=太陽の季節：ここに始まる-炎のランナー |publisher=I-shintaro.com |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207112317/http://www.i-shintaro.com/runner/index.html |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/GOVERNOR/PROFILE/index.htm |title=Profile of the Governor, Tokyo Metropolitan Government |publisher=Metro.tokyo.jp |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930081836/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/GOVERNOR/PROFILE/index.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother [[Yujiro Ishihara|Yujiro]] played a supporting role in the movie adaptation of the novel (for which Shintaro wrote the screenplay), and the two soon became the center of a youth-oriented cult.&lt;ref name="citymayors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/tokyo_mayor.html |title=Mayors: Shintaro Ishihara: Governor of Tokyo|publisher=Citymayors.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishihara had dabbled in directing a couple of films starring his brother. Regarding these early years as a filmmaker, he stated to a ''Playboy'' interviewer in  1990 that "If I had remained a movie director, I can assure you that I would have at least become a better one than [[Akira Kurosawa]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'', Vol. 37, No. 10, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stonefish, Isaac (November 1, 2013) [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/01/the_man_who_would_be_warlord_shintaro_ishihara The Man Who Would Be Warlord].

In the early 1960s, he concentrated on writing, including plays, novels, and a musical version of ''[[Treasure Island]]''. One of his later novels, ''Lost Country'' (1982), speculated about Japan under the control of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="TimeCover"&gt;Larimer, Tim (April 24, 2000) [http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/cover1.html "Rabble Rouser"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408092720/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/cover1.html |date=April 8, 2013 }}, ''TIME Asia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also ran a theatre company, and found time to visit the [[North Pole]], race his yacht ''The Contessa'' and cross South America on a motorcycle. He wrote a memoir of his journey, ''Nanbei Odan Ichiman Kiro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezipangu.org/english/contents/news/naname/ishihara/ishihara2.html |title=Profile of Shintaro Ishihara |publisher=Ezipangu.org |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 to 1967, he covered the [[Vietnam War]] at the request of ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]''. The experience influenced his decision to enter politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensenfukoku.net/nation/nation.html |title=Sensen Fukoku |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424022352/http://sensenfukoku.net/nation/nation.html |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |df=mdy }}, accessed December 22, 2010. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In 1968, Ishihara ran as a candidate on the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) national slate for the [[House of Councillors]]. He placed first on the LDP list with an unprecedented 3 million votes.&lt;ref&gt;Emmerson, John J., ''Arms, Yen &amp; Power: The Japanese Dilemma'', (Tokyo: C.E. Tuttle, 1971), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; After four years in the upper house, Ishihara ran for the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] representing the [[Tokyo 2nd district (1947–1993)|second district of Tokyo]], and again won election.

In 1973, he joined with thirty other LDP lawmakers in the anti-communist ''Seirankai'' or "Blue Storm Group"; the group gained notoriety for sealing a pledge of unity [[Blood brother|in their own blood]].&lt;ref name="citymayors" /&gt;

Ishihara ran for [[Governor of Tokyo]] in 1975 but lost to the popular [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Socialist]] incumbent [[Ryokichi Minobe]]. Minobe was 71 at the time, and Ishihara criticized him as being "too old".&lt;ref name=JT01/&gt;

Ishihara returned to the House of Representatives afterward, and worked his way up the party's internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under [[Takeo Fukuda]] (1976) and Minister of Transport under [[Noboru Takeshita]] (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder.&lt;ref name="TimeInterview"&gt;"[http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html 'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091806/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html |date=April 8, 2013 }}," ''TIME Asia'', April 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 his campaign manager put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara's political opponent was an [[Koreans in Japan|immigrant from North Korea]]. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had a right to know.&lt;ref&gt;河信基 『代議士の自決ー新井将敬の真実』（河信基・三一書房）&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, shortly after losing a highly contested race for the party presidency, Ishihara came to the attention of the West through his book ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'', co-authored with Sony chairman [[Akio Morita]]. The book called on his fellow countrymen to stand up to the United States.

According to politician [[Kōichi Hamada]], Ishihara gave financial and political support to [[Aum Shinrikyo]], a religious cult that was involved in several murders and assassination attempts during the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;浜田幸一. 「ハマコーの非常事態宣言」 (1995.7) {{ISBN|4-391-11762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]] in 1995, Ishihara dropped out of national politics, suddenly ending a 25-year career in the Diet.

=== Governor of Tokyo ===
In the [[Tokyo gubernatorial election, 1999|1999 Tokyo gubernatorial election]], he ran on an independent platform and was elected as Governor of Tokyo. Among Ishihara's moves as governor, he:

* Cut metropolitan spending projects, including plans for a new [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation|Toei Subway]] line, and proposed the sale or leasing out of many metropolitan facilities.&lt;ref name="TimeCover" /&gt;
* Imposed a new tax on banks' [[gross profit]]s (rather than [[net profit]]s).&lt;ref&gt;DeWit, Andrew, and Masaru Kaneko, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/critiques/critique_IX_4.html "Ishihara and the Politics of His Bank Tax"], ''JPRI Critique'' 9:4, May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tokyo gubernatorial election, 2011|2011 gubernatorial election]], his share of the vote dipped to 43.4% against challenges by comedian [[Hideo Higashikokubaru]] and entrepreneur [[Miki Watanabe]].

On October 25, 2012, Ishihara announced he would resign as Governor of Tokyo in order to form a new political party in preparation for upcoming national elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishihara resigns as Tokyo governor to launch new political party|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/ishihara-set-to-launch-new-political-party|date=October 25, 2012|work=Japan Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232349/http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/ishihara-set-to-launch-new-political-party|archivedate=May 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his announcement, the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly]] approved his resignation on October 31, 2012, officially ending his tenure as Governor of Tokyo for 4,941 days, the second-longest term after [[Shunichi Suzuki (governor)|Shunichi Suzuki]]. His deputy [[Naoki Inose]] assumed the role of acting governor, and won the subsequent [[Tokyo gubernatorial election, 2012|gubernatorial election of 2012]].

===Sunrise Party===
Ishihara's new national party was expected to be formed with members of the right-wing [[Sunrise Party of Japan]], which he had helped to set up in 2010.&lt;ref name=JT01&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20121101a2.html "Ishihara leaves office with sights on Diet seat"], ''The Japan Times'', November 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When announced by co-leaders Ishihara and SPJ chief [[Takeo Hiranuma]] on November 13, 2012, [[Sunrise Party]] incorporated all five members of SPJ. SP would look to form a coalition with other small parties including Osaka Mayor [[Toru Hashimoto]]'s [[Japan Restoration Party]] (Nippon Ishin no Kai).&lt;ref name=JT02&gt;Aoki, Mizuho (November 14, 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20121114a2.html "Ishihara, Hiranuma unveil new party"], ''The Japan Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Ishihara and his co-leader Hiranuma said that the Sunrise Party would pursue "establishment of an independent Constitution, beefing up of Japan's defense capabilities, and fundamental reform of fiscal management and tax systems to make them more transparent". The future of nuclear power and the upcoming consumption tax hike were issues it would have to address with potential coalition partners.&lt;ref name=JT02/&gt;

===Sunrise Party merger with the Japan Restoration Party===
Only four days after the Sunrise Party was launched, on November 17, 2012 Ishihara and [[Tōru Hashimoto]], leader of the [[Japan Restoration Party]] (JRP), decided to merge their parties, with Ishihara becoming the head of the JRP. [[Your Party]] would not join the party, nor would Genzei Nippon, as the latter party's anti-consumption tax increase policy did not match the JRP's pro-consumption tax policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121117003460.htm New parties merge forces / Taiyo no To dissolves to join Ishin no Kai; Ishihara named chief]. [[Daily Yomiuri]]. November 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on a poll in early December 2012, ''Asahi Shimbun'' characterized the merger with Japan Restoration Party as the latter having "swallowed up" Sunrise. The poll, in advance of the December 16 Lower House elections, also said the association with SP could hurt JRP's chances of forming a ruling coalition even though JRP was showing strength relative to the ruling DPJ.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumura, Ai (December 4, 2012) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201212040092 "Survey: DPJ snubbed, Japan Restoration Party favored as coalition partner"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207232945/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201212040092 |date=December 7, 2012 }}. ''Asahi Shimbun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party for Future Generations ===
In the [[Japanese general election, 2014|December 2014 general elections]] he was a candidate for the [[Party for Future Generations]], but was defeated. Following this, he retired from politics.

== Political views ==
Ishihara is generally described as one of Japan's most prominent "[[far right]]" politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/-a095319883 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526055433/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/-a095319883 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |title=Shintaro Ishihara.

=== Foreign relations ===
Ishihara is a long term friend of the prominent Aquino family in the [[Philippines]].  He is credited as being the first person to inform future President [[Corazon Aquino]] about the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of her husband Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on August 21, 1983.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Ishihara has often been critical of Japan's foreign policy as being non-assertive. Regarding Japan's relationship with the US, he stated that "The country I dislike most in terms of [[Japan-United States relations|US–Japan ties]] is Japan, because it's a country that can't assert itself."&lt;ref name="TimeInterview" /&gt; As part of the criticism, Ishihara published a book co-authored with then-Prime minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], titled ''"No" to ieru Ajia – tai Oubei e no hōsaku'' in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=「NO」と言えるアジア (対欧米への方策) |last1=Ishihara|first1=Shintaro|authorlink1=Shintaro Ishihara|last2=Mohamad|first2=Mahathir|authorlink2=Mahathir Mohamad|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-334-05217-1|trans-title=The Asia that can say no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishihara has also long been critical of the Chinese government. He invited the [[Dalai Lama]] and the [[President of the Republic of China]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] to Tokyo.&lt;ref name="TimeCover" /&gt;

Ishihara is deeply interested in the [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens|North Korean abduction issue]], and called for economic [[sanctions against North Korea]].&lt;ref name="NPQInterview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalnpq.org/global_services/global%20viewpoint/10-23-03.html | title= Ishihara: Only Sanctions Will Force North Korea to Disarm; Japan Needs Its Own Missile Shield | date = October 22, 2003 | publisher = New Perspectives Quarterly | accessdate = July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Ishihara's campaign to bid Tokyo for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], he eased his criticism of the Chinese government. He accepted an invitation to attend the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, and was selected as a torch-bearer for the Japan leg of the [[2008 Olympic Torch Relay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = CCTV | script-title=zh:石原慎太郎受邀参加北京奥运开幕式 |language=Chinese | url = http://news.cctv.com/china/20080111/101582.shtml|date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on foreigners in Japan ===
On April 9, 2000, in a speech before a [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] group, Ishihara publicly stated that atrocious crimes have been committed repeatedly by illegally entered ''[[sangokujin]]'' (Japanese: [[wiktionary:三国人|三国人]] (third country national); a term commonly viewed as derogatory) and foreigners, and speculated that in the event a natural disaster struck the Tokyo area, they would be likely to cause civil disorder.&lt;ref&gt;original in Japanese: "今日の東京をみますと、不法入国した多くの三国人、外国人が非常に凶悪な犯罪を繰り返している。もはや東京の犯罪の形は過去と違ってきた。こういう状況で、すごく大きな災害が起きた時には大きな大きな騒じょう事件すらですね想定される、そういう現状であります。こういうことに対処するためには我々警察の力をもっても限りがある。だからこそ、そういう時に皆さん（＝自衛隊）に出動願って、災害の救急だけではなしに、やはり治安の維持も１つ皆さんの大きな目的として遂行して頂きたいということを期待しております。"&lt;/ref&gt; His comment invoked calls for his resignation, demands for an apology and fears among residents of [[Zainichi Korean|Korean descent in Japan]].&lt;ref name="TimeCover" /&gt; Regarding this statement, Ishihara later said:

{{quote|I referred to the "many ''sangokujin'' who entered Japan illegally." I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used ''[[gaikokujin]]'', or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.

... After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.

... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.&lt;ref name="TimeInterview" /&gt;}}

Much of the criticism of this statement involved the historical significance of the term: ''sangokujin'' historically referred to ethnic Chinese and Koreans, working in Japan, several thousand of whom were killed by mobs of Japanese people following the [[Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923.&lt;ref name="TimeCover" /&gt;

On February 20, 2006, Ishihara also said: "Roppongi is now virtually a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don't mean African-Americans—who don't speak English are there doing who knows what. This is leading to new forms of crime such as car theft. We should be letting in people who are intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aqkKn5G.sOhk Japan Threatened by China, Its Own Timidity: Ishihara]", ''Bloomberg'', February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2010, Ishihara said "many veteran lawmakers in the ruling-coalition parties are naturalized or the offspring of people naturalized in Japan".&lt;ref&gt;与党の党首や幹部は帰化した人の子孫が多い&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversial statements ===
In 1990, Ishihara said in a ''Playboy'' interview that the [[Rape of Nanking]] was a fiction, claiming, "People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese.  It has tarnished the image of Japan, but it is a lie."&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'', Vol. 37, No. 10, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/02/opinion/l-historical-forces-drove-us-and-japan-to-war-rape-of-nanking-105491.html Historical Forces Drove U.S. and Japan to War; Rape of Nanking]. New York Times. December 2, 1991 .&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to defend this statement in the uproar that ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iris Chang|Chang, Iris]] (1997) ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', [[Basic Books]], {{ISBN|0-465-06835-9}}, pp. 201–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also backed the film ''[[The Truth about Nanjing]]'', which argues that the Nanking Massacre was propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun (January 25, 2007){{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20070125a3.html |title="Filmmaker to paint Nanjing slaughter as just myth" |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122084420/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20070125a3.html |archivedate=November 22, 2012 |df=mdy }} , ''[[The Japan Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Ishihara, one of the eight judges for a literary prize, commented that homosexuality is abnormal, which caused an outrage in the gay community in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2000_April_3/ai_61635352/|title=Ishihara's homophobic remarks raise ire of gays | work=Japan Policy &amp; Politics | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview with women's magazine ''Shukan Josei'', Ishihara said that he believed "old women who live after they have lost their reproductive function are useless and are committing a sin," adding that he "couldn't say this as a politician." He was criticized in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly for these comments, but responded that the criticism was driven by "tyrant… old women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Japan Civil Liberties Union]]|url=http://www.jclu.org/katsudou/seimei_ikensho/20030127e/03speech.html|title=Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, The Third Consideration of Japanese Governmental Report: Proposal of List of Issues for Pre-sessional Working Group|accessdate=September 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123132001/http://www.jclu.org/katsudou/seimei_ikensho/20030127e/03speech.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an inauguration of a university building in 2004, Ishihara stated that French is unqualified as an international language because it is "a language in which nobody can count", referring to the counting system in French, which is based on [[vigesimal|units of twenty]] for numbers from 70 to 99 rather than ten (as is the case in Japanese and English). The statement led to a lawsuit from several language schools in 2005. Ishihara subsequently responded to comments that he did not disrespect French culture by professing his love of French literature on Japanese TV news.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Robert (July 28, 2005) [https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20050728TDY18001.htm "The governor's artistic side"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Daily Yomiuri''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Tokyo [[IOC]] press briefing in 2009, Governor Ishihara dismissed a letter sent by environmentalist Paul Coleman regarding the contradiction of his promoting the Tokyo Olympic 2016 bid as 'the greenest ever' while destroying the forested mountain of [[Minamiyama]], the closest '[[Satoyama]]' to the centre of Tokyo, by angrily stating Coleman was 'Just a foreigner, it does not matter'. Then, on continued questioning by investigative journalist Hajime Yokata, he stated 'Minamiyama is a Devil's Mountain that eats children.' Then he went on to explain how unmanaged forests 'eat children' and implied that Yokota, a Japanese national, was betraying his nation by saying 'What nationality are you anyway?' This was recorded on film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tokyo Governor and His Shocking Response to a Question Regarding the 2016 Tokyo Olympic Bid | publisher = YouTube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSWxdHDuDrc |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turned into a video that was sent around the world as the [[Save Minamiyama Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ning |title=Minamiyama |url=http://minamiyama.ning.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184132/http://minamiyama.ning.com/ |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ishihara claimed that [[Korea under Japanese rule]] was absolutely justified due to historical pressures from [[Qing Dynasty]] and [[Imperial Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ja:『与党は帰化した子孫多い』　石原知事 | date=April 18, 2010 | url =http://megalodon.jp/2010-0418-1750-39/www.tokyo-np.co.jp/s/article/2010041890070655.html | work =Tokyo Shimbun | accessdate = April 21, 2010 | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], Ishihara said "that the disaster was 'punishment from heaven' because Japanese have become greedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110314/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_earthquake_130 |title=Tide of bodies overwhelms quake-hit Japan |publisher=Associated Press |author1=Alabaster, Jay  |author2=Pitman, Todd  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=March 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318084945/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110314/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_earthquake_130 |archivedate=March 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/special/tokyo/TKY201103140356.html |title=asahi.com（朝日新聞社）：「大震災は天罰」「津波で我欲洗い落とせ」石原都知事 – 東京都知事選 |publisher=Asahi.com |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2011/03/15/Tokyo_Governor_Ishihara_says_earthquake_and_tsunami_was_divi/ |title=Tokyo Governor Ishihara says earthquake and tsunami was "divine punishment" - Worldnews.com |publisher=Article.wn.com |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he also commented that the victims of this disaster were pitiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asahi Shimbun|date=March 14, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This speech quickly caused many controversies and critical responses from the public opinion, both inside and outside Japan. The governor of [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] expressed displeasure about Ishihara's speech, claimed that Ishihara should have considered about the victims of the disaster. Ishihara then had to apologize about his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Japan Today | url = http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/ishihara-apologizes-over-Divine-punishment-remark#show_all_comments | title = Ishihara apologizes over Divine punishment remark }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], Ishihara stated that "Westerners practicing judo resembles beasts fighting. Internationalized judo has lost its appeal." He added, "In Brazil they put chocolate in norimaki, but I wouldn't call it sushi. Judo has gone the same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Daily Yomiuri |url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/topics/news/20120803-OHT1T00324.htm |script-title=ja:石原都知事「西洋人の柔道はけだもののけんか |date=August 3, 2012 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812051250/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/topics/news/20120803-OHT1T00324.htm |archivedate=August 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishihara has said that Japan ought to have nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Steve (February 15, 2013) [http://www.voanews.com/content/rising-voices-in-south-korea-japan-advocate-nuclear-weapons/1604309.html "Rising Voices in S.

==== Proposal to buy the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands ====
On April 15, 2012, Ishihara made a speech in Washington, USA, publicly stating his desire for Tokyo to purchase the [[Senkaku Islands|Senkaku]] Islands, called the Diaoyu Islands by mainland China, on behalf of Japan in an attempt to end the territorial dispute between China and Japan, causing uproars in Chinese society and increasing tension between the governments of China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tokyo governor seeks to buy islands disputed with China | publisher = Reuters | date = April 17, 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/us-japan-china-islands-idUSBRE83G0C020120417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara riles Beijing with plan to buy islands in a disputed area of the East China Sea | publisher= GlobalPost | date = April 17, 2012|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/120417/tokyo-governor-shintaro-ishihara-riles-beijing-plan-buy-is}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishihara is married to Noriko Ishihara and has four sons. Members of the House of Representatives [[Nobuteru Ishihara]] and [[Hirotaka Ishihara]] are his eldest and third sons; actor and weatherman [[Yoshizumi Ishihara]] is his second son.

[[File:Lifeshmoo.jpg|thumb|250 px]]
The '''shmoo''' (plural: '''shmoon''', also '''shmoos''') is a fictional [[cartoon]] creature created by [[Al Capp]] (1909–1979); the character first appeared in its classic [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' on August 31, 1948. The popular character has gone on to influence pop culture, language and even science. 
__TOC__

==Description==
A shmoo is shaped like a plump [[bowling pin]] with stubby legs. It has smooth skin, eyebrows and sparse whiskers—but no arms, nose or ears. Its feet are short and round but dextrous, as the shmoo's [[comic book]] adventures make clear. It has a rich gamut of facial expressions and often expresses love by exuding hearts over its head. [[Cartoonist]] Al Capp ascribed to the shmoo the following curious characteristics:
*They [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] and are incredibly prolific, multiplying exponentially faster than rabbits. They require no sustenance other than air.
*Shmoos are delicious to eat, and are eager to be eaten. If a human looks at one hungrily, it will happily immolate itself—either by jumping into a frying pan, after which they taste like chicken, or into a broiling pan, after which they taste like steak. When roasted they taste like pork, and when baked they taste like catfish. (Raw, they taste like [[oyster]]s on the half-shell.)
*They also produce eggs (neatly packaged), milk (bottled, grade-A), and butter—no churning required. Their pelts make perfect bootleather or house timbers, depending on how thick one slices them.
*They have no bones, so there's absolutely no waste. Their eyes make the best [[suspenders|suspender]] buttons, and their [[Vibrissae|whiskers]] make perfect toothpicks. In short, they are simply the perfect ideal of a subsistence agricultural herd animal.
*Naturally gentle, they require minimal care, and are ideal playmates for young children. The frolicking of shmoon is so entertaining (such as their staged "shmoosical comedies") that people no longer feel the need to watch television or go to the [[film|movies]].
*Some of the more tasty varieties of shmoo are more difficult to catch. Usually shmoo hunters, now a sport in some parts of the country, utilize a paper bag, flashlight and stick to capture their shmoos. At night the light stuns them, then they can be whacked in the head with the stick and put in the bag for frying up later on.

==The original story==
{{TOC right}}
In a sequence beginning in late August 1948, Li'l Abner discovers the shmoos when he ventures into the forbidden "Valley of the Shmoon" following the mysterious and musical sound they make (from which their name derives). Abner is thrown off a cliff and into the valley below by a primitive "large gal" (as he addresses her), whose job is to guard the valley. (This character is never seen again.) There, against the frantic protestations of a naked, heavily bearded old man who shepherds the shmoos, Abner befriends the strange and charming creatures. "Shmoos", the old man warns, "is the greatest menace to hoomanity th' world has evah known!" "Thass becuz they is so bad, huh?" asks Li'l Abner. "No, ''stupid''", answers the man—and then encapsulates one of life's profound [[paradox]]es: "It's because they's so ''good!!''".

Having discovered their value ("Wif these around, nobody won't nevah havta work no more!!"), Abner leads the shmoos out of the valley—where they become a sensation in [[Dogpatch]] and, quickly, the rest of the world. Captains of industry such as J. Roaringham Fatback, the "Pork King", become alarmed as sales of nearly all products decline, and in a series of images reminiscent of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the "Shmoo Crisis" unfolds. On Fatback's orders, a corrupt exterminator orders out "Shmooicide Squads" to wipe out the shmoos with a variety of firearms, which is depicted in a macabre and comically graphic sequence, with a tearful Li'l Abner misguidedly saluting the supposed "authority" of the extermination squads.

After the shmoos have been eliminated, Dogpatch's extortionate grocer Soft-Hearted John is seen cackling as he displays his wares—rotting meat and produce: "Now them mizzuble starvin' rats has t'come crawlin t'me fo' the necessities o' life!! They complained 'bout mah prices befo'!! Wait'll they see th' new ones!!". The exterminator congratulates him.

However, it is soon discovered that Abner has secretly saved two shmoos, a "boy" and a "girl". The boy shmoo, as a Dogpatch native, is required to run from the girl shmoo in the annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] race. (Shmoos are usually portrayed as gender-neutral, although Capp sidesteps this issue to allow the comic plot twist.) When he is caught by her, in accordance with the rules of the race, they are joined in marriage by Marryin' Sam (whom they "pay" with a dozen eggs, two pounds of butter and six cupcakes with chocolate frosting—all of which Sam reckons to be worth about 98 cents). The already expanding shmoo family is last seen returning towards the Valley of the Shmoon.

The sequence, which ended just before [[Christmas]] of 1948, was massively popular, both as a commentary on the state of society and a classic [[allegory]] of greed and corruption tarnishing all that is good and innocent in the world. The Shmoo caused an unexpected national sensation, and set the stage for a major licensing phenomenon. In their very few subsequent appearances in ''Li'l Abner'', shmoos are also identified by the [[U.S. military]] as a major threat to [[national security]].

==Analysis==
{{quote|The Shmoo, any literate person must know, was one of history's most brilliant [[utopia]]n satires.|''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Pakenham |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-09-29/entertainment/0209290383_1_al-capp-harlan-ellison-abner |title=Editor's Choice: The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo, by Al Capp, with an introduction by Harlan Ellison |work=Baltimore Sun |date=2002-11-29 |accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Capp is at his [[allegorical]] best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies", wrote comic strip historian [[Jerry Robinson]] (in ''The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art'', 1974). "Shmoos are the world's most amiable creatures, supplying all man's needs. Like a [[fertility]] myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy"—if not [[Western culture|western civilization]] as we know it, and ultimately [[society]] itself.

Al Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, "I Don't Like Shmoos", in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' (June 1949):

{{quote|I was driving from New York City to my farm in [[New Hampshire]]. The top of my car was down, and on either side of me I could see the lush and lovely [[New England]] countryside... It was the good earth at its generous summertime best, offering gifts to all. And the thought that came to me was this: Here we have this great and good and generous thing—the Earth. It's eager to give us everything we need. All we have to do is just let it alone, just be happy with it.

Cartoonists don't think like people. They think in pictures. Little pictures that will fit into a comic strip. And so, in my mind, I reduced the Earth... down to the size of a small critter that would fit into the ''Li'l Abner'' strip—and it came out a Shmoo... I didn't have any message—except that it's good to be alive. The Shmoo didn't have any social significance; it is simply a juicy li'l critter that gives milk and lays eggs... When you look at one as though you'd like to eat it, it dies of sheer ecstasy. And if one ''really'' loves you, it'll lay you a [[cheesecake]]—although this is quite a strain on its li'l innards...

I thought it was a perfectly ordinary little story, but when it appeared in newspapers, all hell broke loose! ''Life'', in an editorial, hailed the Shmoo as the very symbol and spirit of [[free enterprise]]. ''Time'' said I'd invented a new era of enlightened management-employee relationship, (they called it ''Capp''-italism.) ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' cussed me out as a Tool of the Bosses, and denounced the Shmoo as the [[Opium of the People|Opium of the Masses...]]}}

Superficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to mankind. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions ("If the Shmoo fits", he proclaimed, "wear it!"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html |title=Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, City Journal, Spring 2010 |publisher=City-journal.org |date=1934-08-13 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was widely seen to be stalking bigger game [[subtext]]ually. The story has [[social]], [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]] implications that continue to invite analysis to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1WXKH5B_XUC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=shmoo+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4PTGpTFDEU&amp;sig=Hq_NZ6RnoDKW-w8M1tjTIqUqkw4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3DxUS7j3GZP8tAPJ2aU1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shmoo%20analysis&amp;f=false |title=Media Analysis Techniques, 3rd ed. |author=[[Arthur Asa Berger]] |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000127.html |website=Future Hi |title=Shmoo Technology |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027014715/http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000127.html |archivedate=2004-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=shmoo+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kJPxQlilwQ&amp;sig=wPmqhDdGvOoWeWl1tpK7xWl0ZyM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RzpUS_uWDougswOq9tXhAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shmoo%20meaning&amp;f=false |title=Capp-italist Revolution: Al Capp's Shmoo Offers a Parable of Plenty |magazine=Life |date=20 December 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.nc.us/books/books.cgi?theshortlife&amp;happytimesoftheshmoo |first=KNS |last=Maré |website=Mountain Area Information Network |year=2002 |title=''The Short Life &amp; Happy Times of the Shmoo'' by Al Capp; with a foreward by Harlan Ellison |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617090532/http://main.nc.us/books/books.cgi?theshortlife&amp;happytimesoftheshmoo |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/SOC621/298lec4.pdf |title=Berkeley Sociology 298 Lecture 4: Class, Exploitation, Oppression; 5 March 2002 |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the remainder of his life, Capp was seldom interviewed without reference to the nature of the Shmoo story.

The mythic tale ends on a deliberately [[irony|ironic]] note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered—because they were deemed "bad for business". The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]]. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate [[socialist]] [[Norman Thomas]] on the effect of the Shmoo on modern [[capitalism]].

"After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo", according to publisher [[Denis Kitchen]]. "[[Communists]] thought he was making fun of socialism and [[Marxism]]. The [[right wing]] thought he was making fun of capitalism and [[the American way]]. Capp caught flak from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888467-1,00.html |title=Harvest Shmoon |magazine=Time |date=13 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him it was an [[apolitical]] [[morality tale]] about [[human nature]]... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there's no question about that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623103614/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-date=June 23, 2007 |title=''Everything and the Kitchen Shmoo:'' Interview with Denis Kitchen, April 2003 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shmoo inspired hundreds of "Shmoo clubs" all over North America. College students—who had made Capp's invented idea of the [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] a universally adopted tradition—flocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the [[University of Bridgeport]], even launched the "American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo" in early 1949.

Capp introduced many other allegorical creatures in ''Li'l Abner'' over the years—including '''[[Bald Iggles]], Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops''' and '''Bashful Bulganiks''', among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature—but none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: "For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way—with the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists..."

==Etymology==
The actual origin of Capp's word "shmoo" has been the subject of debate by [[linguists]] for decades, leading to the misconception that the term was derived from "[[schmo]]" or "[[schmooze]]". However, "shmue" was a [[taboo]] [[Yiddish]] term for the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zPgjduXBcQC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=%22al+capp%22+yiddish+words&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Z7AHEHSII4&amp;sig=EcKDyys4rwnkrsnPiWEXz5huZ-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result |title=Perspectives on American English |first=J. L. |last=Dillard |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1980 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into ''Li'l Abner''. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp himself wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness—in essence, [[Mother Nature]] herself. In Li'l Abner's words, "Shmoos ''hain't'' make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!"

==In science==
[[File:Shmoos s cerevisiae.jpg|thumb|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' mating type '''a''' with shmoo responding to '''α'''-factor]]
The term "shmoo" has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of [[science]]:
* "[[Shmoo plot]]" is a technical term relating to the graphical display of test results in [[electrical engineering]], dating back at least to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5217603/ |title=The Sensitivity Function in Variability Analysis |first=Charles |last=Belove |journal=[[IEEE]] Transactions on Reliability |volume=R-15 |issue=2 |year=1966 |pages=70–76 |doi=10.1109/TR.1966.5217603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name most likely arose because the shape of the two-dimensional plots often resembled a shmoo. The term is also a verb: to "shmoo" means to run the test.
*In [[microbiology]], the shmoo's uncanny resemblance to budding [[mating of yeast|yeast]]—combined with its near-limitless usefulness—has led to the character's adoption as a mascot of sorts for scientists studying yeast as a [[model organism]] for [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]]. In fact, the cellular bulge that is produced by a [[haploid]] yeast cell as a response to a pheromone from the opposite mating type (either {{typo|a}} or α) is referred to as a "shmoo", because cells that are undergoing mating and present this particular structure resemble the cartoon character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/hoodedutilitarian/2010/12/strange-windows-keeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-3/#more-12736 |title=Strange Windows: Keeping up with the Goonses (part 3) |first=Alex |last=Buchet |date=18 December 2010 |website=The Hooded Utilitarian |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole process is known to biologists as "shmooing". Shmoos are essential; without them, we would have neither [[bread]] nor [[beer]]. The word "shmoo" has appeared in nearly 700 science publications since 1974; it is used in labs studying the bread- and beer-making species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', (Source: ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, November 2007).
*It has been used in discussions of [[socioeconomics]], for instance. In [[economics]], a "[[widget (economics)|widget]]" is any material good which is produced through labor (extracted, refined, manufactured, or assembled) from a finite resource—in contrast to a "shmoo", which is a material good that reproduces itself and is captured or bred as an economic activity (the original shmoo reproduces without requiring any material sustenance). "If shmoos really existed, they would be a '[[free good]]'." [[Erik Olin Wright]] uses the "parable of the shmoo" to introduce discussion of class structure and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzuLVijEFbgC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=parable+of+the+shmoo&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Vz0OSRE-gC&amp;sig=EzcNyRciPN7rxlHhM3ljUD0Z7tE |last=Wright |first=Erik Olin |authorlink=Erik Olin Wright |title=Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Echinoderm]] biologists use "shmoo" (often spelled "schmoo") to refer to a very simple, highly derived, blob-shaped [[larva]] found in some [[sea urchin]]s (e.g. Wray 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory A. Wray |url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/3/308.short |title=Parallel Evolution of Nonfeeding Larvae in Echinoids |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=45 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=308–322 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/45.3.308 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*In the field of [[particle physics]], "shmoo" refers to a high energy [[cosmic ray]] survey instrument utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the [[Cygnus X-3]] Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. Over one hundred white "shmoo" detectors were at one time sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] [[constellation]]. The detectors housed [[scintillator]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape. The particle accelerator [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] houses superconducting magnets which produce ice formations that also resembled shmoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Higgins |first=William S. |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000966 |title=Shmoos of the Tevatron |magazine=Symmetry |date=June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The shmoo has been suggested as a hypothetical example of the potential [[falsifiability]] of [[natural selection]] as a key driving mechanism of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Licensing history==
{{quote|Of course, it was merchandised to death. I think they even had shmoo toilet seats.|Al Capp, ''Cartoonist PROfiles #37'', March 1978}}

An unexpected—and virtually unprecedented—postwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo in ''Li'l Abner''. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under "Economics") in ''Time's'' International section. Major articles also ran in ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a ''Life'' headline put it, "The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=life+magazine+shmoo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zkzHLwx3TW&amp;sig=nVW43cHolwZepvLo6JSyEhIEUIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cq06TdTZFov2tgP8uLD9Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck! |magazine=Life |date=20 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys and consumer products===

Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including "Shmooveralls". In 1948, people danced to the Shmoo [[Rhumba]] and the Shmoo [[Polka]]. The Shmoo briefly entered everyday language through such phrases as "What's Shmoo?" and "Happy Shmoo Year!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/alcappshmoo_rxvq.htm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522213154/http://www.essortment.com/all/alcappshmoo_rxvq.htm |archive-date=2009-05-22 |title=Al Capp's Shmoo |website=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced in less than a year, some of which sold ''five million units'' each.&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', 5 September 1949; and ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', 16 July 1949&lt;/ref&gt; In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated over $25&amp;nbsp;million in sales in 1948 dollars (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|25|1948|fmt=c}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name="deniskitchen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deniskitchen.com/docs/new_shmoofacts.html |title=The Shmoo Fact Sheet |first=Denis |last=Kitchen |publisher=Deniskitchen.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There had never previously been anything like it. Comparisons to contemporary cultural phenomena are inevitable. But modern crazes are almost always due to massive marketing campaigns by large media corporations, and are generally aimed at the youth market. The Shmoo phenomenon arose immediately, spontaneously and ''solely'' from cartoonist Al Capp's daily comic strip—and it appealed widely to Americans of ''all'' ages. Forty million people read the original 1948 Shmoo story, and Capp's already considerable readership roughly ''doubled'' following the overwhelming success of the Shmoo... |Denis Kitchen}}

The Shmoo was so popular it even replaced [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]] as the face of the Children's [[United States Treasury security#Nonmarketable securities|Savings Bond]], issued by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp's character, and promoted by the [[Federal Government of the United States]] with a $16&amp;nbsp;million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed "Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth and common ''cents'' [that] add up to aid to his nation". Al Capp accompanied President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fishinghistory.blogspot.com/2008/09/shmoo-part-i.html |title=The Shmoo Part I |first=T. E.

===Comic books and reprints===
''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'' (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886491,00.html |title=The Miracle of Dogpatch |magazine=Time |date=27 December 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s ''[[Crusade in Europe]]'' (the other big publication at the time).

The original book and its sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'' (1959), have been collected in print many times since—most recently in 2002—always to high sales figures.&lt;ref name="deniskitchen.com"/&gt;

There was also a separate line of [[comic book]]s, ''Al Capp's Shmoo Comics'' (featuring Washable Jones), published by the Capp family-owned [[Toby Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Steven |url=http://fourcolorshadows.blogspot.com/2012/05/super-shmoo-al-capps-shmoo-1949.html |title=Super Shmoo – Al Capp's Shmoo – 1949 |website=Four-Color Shadows |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comics historian and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] recently edited a complete collection of all five original ''Shmoo Comics'', from 1949 and 1950.

===Animation and puppetry===
Shmoos were originally meant to be included in the 1956 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], employing stage [[puppetry]]. The idea was reportedly abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had earlier appeared as a [[marionette]] puppet on television. "Shmoozer", a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring [[sidekick]] character on ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'', a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389616/epcast Fearless Fosdick (TV show) at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Capp's death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own [[Animated television series|animated series]] as part of ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (which consisted of reruns of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' mixed with the Shmoo's own cartoons; the two pairs of characters didn't actually "meet"). The characters ''did'' meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment ''Bedrock Cops'' as a police officer alongside part-time officers [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]]. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the ''L'il Abner'' character, other than a superficial appearance. A later [[Hanna-Barbera]] venture, ''[[The New Shmoo]]'', featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could magically "morph" into any shape at will—like ''[[Tom Terrific]]''. None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful.

==In popular culture==
*[[Frank Sinatra]], who was frequently spoofed by Al Capp in ''Li'l Abner'', has a line in the [[MGM]] musical ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949) about cops "multiplyin' like shmoos!"
*[[Florence King]] refers to owning a ceramic shmoo, which she threw out of her window after reading the books of [[Ayn Rand]].
*In the 1990 movie ''[[Book of Love (1990 film)|Book of Love]]'', the character Crutch wins a stuffed shmoo at a carnival.
*In the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' TV episode "Who Knew?", [[Colonel Potter]] (played by [[Harry Morgan]]) displays an inflatable shmoo toy in his office that he purchased for his grandson.
*In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'' stories, an alien species known as the [[Bandersnatch (Known Space)|Bandersnatch]], also edible and intelligent, is described as being "smooth as a shmoo".
*In the novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' by [[Greg Bear]], "Shmoo" is the name humans give to the race of [[robots]] that visits Earth, due to their similar shape.
*Some overlapping similarities exist between shmoos and [[tribble]]s—the multitudinous alien creatures featured in a 1967 TV episode from the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'']].  Like shmoos, tribbles ''also'' reproduced at such an alarming rate, they threatened ecological disaster. However, [[David Gerrold]]—who wrote "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]"—drew his inspiration from an actual event: Australia's environmentally destructive [[rabbit]] overpopulation.
*The characters Gleep and Gloop—two protoplastic creatures from the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] [[animated cartoon]] series ''[[The Herculoids]]''—were clearly inspired by (and are sometimes mistaken for) shmoos.
*French artists [[Etienne Chambaud]] and David Jourdan have written "Economie de l'abondance ou La courte vie et les jours heureux", a new adventure of ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'' from [[Diderot]], based on the discovery by Jacques of the Shmoo.
*In the 2006 film ''[[Lucky Number Slevin]]'', the character known only as "The Boss" (played by [[Morgan Freeman]]) refers to the Shmoo, recounting its original features as a source of plenty (in a monologue taken from an old ''Li'l Abner'' comic).
* The [[Marxist]] political philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]] used the story of the Shmoo to illustrate his objections to capitalism in an episode of ''Opinions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA9WPQeow9c |title=G. A. Cohen – Against Capitalism – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' uses a statue of the Shmoo to replace the giant phallic statue from the film [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] in the episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XXV]]".
* In the North American version video game, ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' there is an enemy monster called "''Schmoo''" (in the original Japanese version it is an [[Obake]] called "''Kyuu''" a homage to the character in manga, [[Obake no Q-tarō]]) which is apparently a homage to The Shmoo. Schmoo appear in the Forbidden Library and killing one may result in obtaining the rare sword "''Crissaegrim''" (its rare item drop), one of the most powerful swords in the game.
*During the Soviet Union's blockade of [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1948, candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners from transport planes by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron. The commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting the inflatable shmoos as part of Operation: Little Vittles.  "When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'', 11 October 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shmoos invaded the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], as challenger [[Thomas Dewey]] accused incumbent [[Harry S. Truman]] of "promising everything, including the Shmoo!"&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', 5 September 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Capp periodically reintroduced the Shmoos in ''Li'l Abner'', sometimes with significant variations. "Bad" Shmoos (called "Nogoodniks") debuted in a series of Sunday strips in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=264&amp;ai=41615&amp;arch=y&amp;ssd=8/24/2002%2012:01:00%20PM |title=Bad Shmoos from The Scoop Archive, 24 August 2002 |publisher=Scoop.diamondgalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nasty cousin of the good-natured Shmoo, Nogoodniks were a sickly shade of green, and had "li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look". Frequently sporting [[5 o'clock shadow]]s, eye patches, scars, bandages and other ruffian attributes—they devoured "good" Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of "hoomanity", and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch.
*In the ABC sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Beverley Goldberg endearingly refers to her children as Shmoos.

'''Sports TV Uganda Limited''' was incorporated in October 2007, and has been licensed by the Uganda Broadcasting Council &lt;ref&gt;Uganda Broadcasting Council, Workers' House, Kampala&lt;/ref&gt; on February 29, 2008. Sports TV has commenced test broadcast on July 14, 2008.

The station is broadcasting [[sport]]s from around the world, and 24/7, free-to-air. It is privately owned by Bent and Nada Andersen. Sports TV is broadcasting sports programmes compiled by [[Setanta Africa network]], a free-to-air broadcasters' network that is spreading across Africa, with broadcasters in over 20 African countries.

Sports TV is the first sports-only television channel in [[Uganda]]. As the last entrant on the Ugandan TV scene, the channel is already very popular and covers the central regions of Uganda, stretching as far as Busia town on Uganda-Kenya border in the north-east, and beyond Kalangala Islands and Masaka town in the south-east parts of the country.

Sports TV has acquired all its broadcasting equipment from ABE Electronica in Italy, including a solid state digital-ready 3KWA [[transmitter]]. 

Sports TV is, as other media houses in Uganda, licensed by Uganda Broadcasting Council, Uganda Communication Commission &lt;ref&gt;Uganda Communications Commission, Communications House, Kampala, {{cite web |url=http://www.ucc.co.ug/RadioTVStationsInUgandaJune2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219184236/http://www.ucc.co.ug/RadioTVStationsInUgandaJune2008.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Uganda Media Council.&lt;ref&gt;Uganda Media Council, Clement Hill Road, Kampala&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports TV was partly sold to the Vision Group, and is now Urban TV.

'''Television in the United Kingdom''' started in 1936 as a public service which was free of advertising. Currently, the United Kingdom has a collection of [[free-to-air]], [[free-to-view]] and [[Pay television|subscription]] services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 480 channels&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Taking the base Sky [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] TV Channels. A breakdown is impossible due to a) the number of platforms, b) duplication of services, c) regional services, d) part time operations, and e) audio. For the Sky platform alone, there are basically 485 TV Stations, '''additionally''' 57 "timeshifted versions", 36 HDTV versions, 42 regional TV options, 81 audio channels, and 5 promotion channels as of mid-2010&lt;/ref&gt; for consumers as well as on-demand content. There are six main channel owners who are responsible for most material viewed. There are 27,000 hours of domestic content produced a year at a cost of £2.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Taking the data from note 1 above, this is a very crude estimate&lt;/ref&gt; Since 24 October 2012, all television broadcasts in the United Kingdom have been in a digital format, following the end of analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland. Digital content is delivered via terrestrial, satellite and cable, as well as over IP.

== Broadcast television providers ==
[[Free-to-air]], [[free-to-view]] and [[Pay television|subscription]] providers are available, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the [[Electronic program guide|programme guide]] (EPG), [[video on demand]] (VOD), [[high-definition television|high-definition]] (HD), [[interactive television]] via the [[Red Button (Digital Television)|red button]], and coverage across the UK.  The UK's five most watched channels, [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], are available from all providers.

Broadcast television is distributed as radio waves via terrestrial or satellite transmissions, or as electrical or light signals through ground-based cables. In the UK, these use the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] standard. Most TVs sold in the UK come with a DVB-T (terrestrial) tuner for Freeview – a rare thing in Europe{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.  [[Set-top box]]es are generally used to receive channels from other providers. Most services have also integrated their broadcast TV services with additional video streams distributed via the Internet, or through their own [[Internet Protocol]] [[computer network|network]].

=== Digital terrestrial television ===
[[File:Television aerials mounted on chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|Chimney-mounted [[Yagi–Uda antenna|Yagi-Uda antennae]], more commonly known as ''[[Television antenna|aerials]]'', used for receiving terrestrial television.]]
{{main|Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom}}
{{see also|List of DTT channels in the United Kingdom}}
Digital terrestrial television launched in 1998 as a subscription service named [[ONdigital]]. Since October 2002, the primary broadcaster is [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], which is free of charge to view.

YouView is also distinctly marketed although it provides the same free channels as Freeview as it uses the same transmitter network.

The TV channels are transmitted in bundles, called [[Multiplex (television)|multiplexes]], and the available channels are dependent on how many multiplexes are transmitted in each area. 3 multiplexes, carrying channels from BBC, ITV, Channel 4, S4C, Channel 5 as well as radio, are available to 98.5% of the population from 1,154 transmitters. A further 3 multiplexes transmit to 90% of homes from 80 transmitters, and another 2 multiplexes are available to 76% of homes from 30 transmitters. The terrestrial service consisting of just the 3 public service multiplexes, available to 8.5% of the population, is informally called 'Freeview Light' by some websites. In Northern Ireland, a multiplex carrying channels from the Republic of Ireland is available to 90% of Northern Irish homes from 3 transmitters. Local TV and radio is available from an additional multiplex at 42 transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/operations/multiplexes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ukfree.tv/maps/freeviewlight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/tv-research/no3factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Catch-up TV services such as BBC iPlayer are available via the broadband connection of both Freeview and YouView receivers.  On YouView, subscription TV services from BT, TalkTalk, Plusnet, and global streaming services can also be received via the broadband connection. SureTV is a similar service in Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.

=== Cable television ===
[[File:Virgin Media cables revealed under pavement.jpg|thumb|right|A pavement dug up revealing the cables underneath. The green box is a common sight in areas with cable coverage, as are manhole covers inscribed with [[CATV]].]]
{{See also|Cable television by region#United Kingdom}}
There were many regional companies when cable television services were developed in the late 1980s and 1990s. Today they have amalgamated to become Virgin Media, which is available to 55% of households.&lt;ref name="virgincoverage"&gt;{{cite news|author=Finance |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/01/20/cnvirgin20.xml |title=Virgin media launch to cost £20m |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable TV is a subscription service normally bundled with a phone line and broadband.

WightFibre operates on the Isle of Wight, however acts as a distributor for Sky and YouView instead of having an integrated TV service.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wightfibre.com/television/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satellite television ===
[[File:Satellite dishes in the UK.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es on a wall in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London. The small oval dishes are most likely being used for viewing British services, and are known as [[Minidish]]es. The larger dishes are most likely being used for viewing satellite services from outside the UK.]]
{{See also|Satellite television by region#United Kingdom and Ireland|List of free-to-air channels at 28%C2%B0E}}

There are three distinctly marketed [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) services (also known as direct-to-home (DTH), to be distinguished from satellite signals intended for non-consumer reception).

'''[[Sky UK|Sky TV]]''' is a subscription service operated by [[Sky Limited|Sky Ltd]], owned by [[Comcast]], which launched in 1998 as SkyDigital.  Compared to the previous analogue service, it provided more channels, widescreen, interactive TV and a [[Video on demand#Near video on demand|near video on demand]] service using staggered start times for pay-per-view content. Innovations since have included high definition, 3d TV, a [[digital video recorder]], the ability to view recordings on other devices, remote operation via the Internet to add recordings, and on demand content via the satellite receiver's broadband connection of both Sky and 3rd party TV. The Sky subscription also includes access to [[Sky Go]], which allows mobile devices and computers to access subscription content via the Internet.

'''[[Freesat from Sky]]''', is a free satellite service owned by [[Sky Limited|Sky Ltd]].  Existing Sky TV customers can end their ongoing subscriptions, and opt for the Free-To-View viewing card, giving them the Freesat from Sky service. Freesat from Sky does not provide digital recording or video on demand.  Freesat from Sky has more channels than Freesat, which are mostly international or shopping channels.  The [[electronic program guide|on-screen programme guide]] lists subscription channels even thought they can't be viewed.

'''[[Freesat]]''' is a free satellite service created jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. Like Sky, it provides high definition content, digital recording and video on demand via the broadband connection.  The on-screen programme guide lists the available channels, rather than encrypted channels which need a subscription to view.

[[File:Eurobird.JPG|thumb|¼ scale mockup of the [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellite, a [[Spacebus 3000]]B2 manufactured by [[Thales Alenia Space|Alcatel Space]]]]Freesat, Freesat from Sky and Sky TV transmit from [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] [[satellite]]s at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] ([[Astra 2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]/[[Astra 2G|2G]]). As the satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]], they are positioned above the [[earth]]'s [[equator]]({{coord|0|N|28.2|E|name=Satellites transmitting Sky TV, Freesat and Freesat from Sky to the UK and Ireland}}) approximately 35,786&amp;nbsp;km above [[mean sea level]]; this places them above the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

== Internet video services ==

{{See also|IPTV|Internet television|List of Internet television providers|Mobile TV|Category:Internet television}}

[[File:Telephone pole silhouette.jpeg|thumb|right|Broadband TV services are often distributed via copper [[telephone line]]s]]

TV via the Internet can be streamed or downloaded, and consist of [[user-generated content|amateur]] or professionally produced content.  In the UK, most broadcasters provide catch-up TV services which allow viewing of TV for a window after it was broadcast.  Online video can be viewed via mobile devices, computers, TVs equipped with a built in Internet connection, or TVs connected to an external set-top-box, streaming stick or games console.  Most of the broadcast TV providers have integrated their set-top-boxes with Internet video to provide a hybrid broadcast and online service.

=== Catch-up services ===

Since 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. Often, these are available for a window after the broadcast schedule.  These services generally block users outside of the UK.

=== Online video services for professionally-produced content ===

There are numerous online services targeting the UK, offering a combination of subscription, rental and purchase options for viewing online TV.  Most are available via any Internet connection, however some require a specific broadband connection. Some services sell 3rd party services, such as Amazon's Prime Video.  For brevity, the following table does not include catch-up-only or amateur-only services, individual channels, distributors of illegal or adult content, services which solely redistribute free broadcast channels, or services which don't target the UK. In July 2018 [[Ofcom]] statistics showed that the 15.4 million subscribers to commercial online video services exceeded the number of traditional pay TV service subscribers for the first time.&lt;ref name=bbc-20180718&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44862598 |title='Netflix effect' poses challenge to British TV |last=Sillito |first=David |work=BBC News |date=18 July 2018 |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) ===

{{See also|Category:BBC television channels in the United Kingdom}}

[[File:BBC.svg|150px|right]]
The BBC is the world's oldest and largest broadcaster, and is the country's principal [[public broadcasting|public service broadcaster]]. The BBC is funded primarily by a [[television licence]] and from sales of its programming to overseas markets. It does not carry [[television advertising|advertising]]. The licence fee is levied on all households that watch or record TV as it's being broadcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/|title=Official TV Licensing website – Do you need a TV Licence?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fee is determined by periodic negotiation between the government and the BBC.

Its first analogue terrestrial channel, the BBC Television Service, launched in 1936. It rebranded to BBC 1 in 1964, the same year that BBC 2 launched, the UK's third analogue terrestrial channel after ITV. Both channels styled as [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] from 1997. BBC News 24 launched as an analogue cable channel in 1997, later rebranding to BBC News.  BBC Parliament, which was originally an analogue cable channel known as The Parliamentary Channel, was acquired by the BBC in 1998.  From 1998 onwards the BBC started digital TV transmissions, launching new channels and broadcasting via satellite in addition to terrestrial and cable. BBC Three closed as a broadcast channel in 2016, continuing as an Internet video service.

{{main|ITV (TV network)}}
{{See also|Category:ITV franchisees|ITV plc|List of ITV channels}}

ITV is the network of fifteen regional commercial television franchises, founded in 1955 to provide competition to the [[BBC]]. ITV was the country's first [[commercial television]] provider funded by [[television commercials|advertisements]], and has been the most popular commercial channel through most of its existence. Through a series of mergers, takeovers and relaxation of regulation, thirteen of these companies are now owned by [[ITV plc]]; the other two are owned by [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]]. ITV plc, the operator of all English, Welsh, [[Scotland|Southern Scotland]] and [[Channel Island]] franchises, had branded the channel as [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]] since 2001, with regional names being used prior to regional programmes only since 2002. The ITV name was restored in 2013. ITV plc also operate the [[Northern Ireland]] franchise under the [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] brand name. [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]], which operates the two other Scottish franchises, has now unified the regions under the single name of [[STV (TV channel)|STV]]. ITV has been officially known as '''Channel 3''' since 1990, although this is seldom used to identify itself.

ITV plc also operates digital channels [[ITV2]], [[ITV3]], [[ITV4]], [[ITVBe]], [[ITV Encore]] and [[CITV]], some with HDTV streams. [[ITN]], a subsidiary, currently holds the national news franchise, and [[ITV Breakfast]] operates the breakfast franchise.

[[File:Channel 4 logo 2015.svg|right|frameless|128x128px]]
Launched in 1982, Channel 4 is a state-owned national broadcaster which is funded by its commercial activities (including advertising). Channel 4 has expanded greatly after gaining greater independence from the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], especially in the multi-channel digital world launching [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], [[Film4]], [[More4]], [[4Music]], [[4seven]] and various [[timeshift channel|timeshift services]]. Since 2005, it has been a member of the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] consortium, and operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplexes with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] as [[Digital 3&amp;4]]. Since the advent of digital television, Channel 4 is now also broadcast in [[Wales]] across all digital platforms. Channel 4 was the first British channel not to carry regional variations for programming, however it does have 6 set advertising regions.

With Bauer Media Group, Channel 4 jointly owns a range of music channels under the Box Plus Network banner.

[[File:Channel 5 (UK) 2016.svg|128x128px|right]]
Channel 5 was the fifth analogue terrestrial channel to launch, in March 1997. Due to constraints with the available UHF frequencies at the time, many households had to retune their [[videocassette recorder|video recorders]], which shared the frequency on their RF output with the frequency used by Channel 5's new broadcasts. Channel 5 was the first terrestrial channel to also broadcast via satellite. From 2006 onwards, Channel 5 would launch new digital channels and an Internet on-demand service. After changing ownership several times, in May 2014 Channel 5 and its sister channels would be acquired by Viacom, an American [[media conglomerate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27240335 |title=Viacom to buy Channel 5 for £450m |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time it acquired Channel 5, Viacom already operated a large number of subscription channels in the UK, including the MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central channels, which are available via Sky TV, Virgin Media and NOW TV.  In terms of viewing share, the combined viewing across Viacom's free and subscription channels make Viacom the UK's fourth largest broadcaster, after BBC, ITV plc and Channel 4 Corp, according to BARB's viewing figures for January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/monthly-viewing-by-channel-group/ |title=Monthly viewing by channel group Jan 2018|publisher=BARB |date=January 2018 |accessdate=14 February 2018 |quote=8.1%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local television in the United Kingdom ===
{{further|Local television in the United Kingdom}}
On 18 January 2011, then [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]] [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] announced his intentions to set up a network of local television stations across the UK. The initial plan was to create a network of local television stations, connected through a national backbone. This plan would create a television network similar to that of the [[network affiliate|network-affiliate]] model in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Hunt outlines plans for 'local TV' – BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12220187|accessdate=19 January 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, however, it was announced that the national spine plan would be scrapped, and a 'bottom-up' approach would be followed instead, where stations are individually licensed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Jeremy Hunt confirms major shift in local TV policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/02/jeremy-hunt-local-tv|accessdate=2 June 2011|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Horwood, a former [[Trinity Mirror]] executive, announced that when the local television stations are first licensed, he intends to create a television network called Channel 6; this will be a network of local television stations, with Channel 6 supplying the prime time schedule (similar to the American network-affiliate model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conlan|first1=Tara|title=Has Richard Horwood found a way to make local TV profitable?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/18/richard-horwood-local-tv|accessdate=18 November 2010|work=The Guardian|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another operator, which has announced its intentions to set up a network of local television stations with a television network connecting them, is City TV Broadcasting. That company says it is basing its operations on the [[Citytv]] television system in Canada, but there does not appear to be any official affiliation with the latter's owner, [[Rogers Communications]]. City TV is initially bidding on a station to be based in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citytvbroadcasting.co.uk/about-city-tv-broadcasting/|title=About City TV Broadcasting|author=City TV Broadcasting|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731092626/http://www.citytvbroadcasting.co.uk/about-city-tv-broadcasting/|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==

British television differs from other countries, such as the [[Television in the United States|United States]], in as much that programmes produced in the United Kingdom do not generally have a long 'season' run of around 20 weeks. Instead, they are produced in a series, a set of episodes varying in length, usually aired over a period of a few months. See [[List of British television series]].

=== Terrestrial channel programming ===

==== Weekday ====

Weekday programming on terrestrial channels begins at 6&amp;nbsp;am with breakfast national news programmes (along with regional news updates) on [[BBC One]] and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. [[BBC Two]] also showed children's programming all morning until the start of 2013. That channel now broadcasts repeats of BBC One's daytime programmes. [[Channel 4]] predominately broadcasts comedy and music programmes such as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Freshly Squeezed]]'' in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:15&amp;nbsp;am on BBC One and 8:30&amp;nbsp;am on ITV.

Following this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home/garden makeover. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has a soap called ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' followed by dramas currently occupy the schedule. BBC Two broadcasts repeats of recent BBC One programmes with on-screen signing before airing news and politics programming between 11&amp;nbsp;am and 1&amp;nbsp;pm. ITV on the other hand takes over from GMB at 8:30&amp;nbsp;am, and generally broadcasts more human-interest chat-style shows, including ''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]'', ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' and ''[[Loose Women]]'', in the morning to mid-afternoon slots, with the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]'' (including a regional bulletin) at 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chatshow programmes in the morning including ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'' with regular news bulletins followed by the last nights ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' (when the show is on air). In the afternoon it shows a drama followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as ''[[Home and Away]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]'' and a film.

Until the end of 2012 BBC One showed children's programmes in the late afternoon but the channel now continues to show lifestyle programming until broadcasting the game show ''[[Pointless (game show)|Pointless]]'' at 5:15&amp;nbsp;pm. BBC Two used to show lifestyle programming such as ''[[Animal Park]]'' in the late afternoon before these programmes were switched to BBC One. BBC Two now broadcasts repeats unless it is showing sporting events. ITV shows a lifestyle programme followed by a chat show such as ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' before repeats of classic ITV shows, such as ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'', ''[[Poirot]]'' and ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' in late-afternoon, before a gameshow-style programme at 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm, which have included ''[[Golden Balls]]'' and ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.

News bulletins are broadcast between 6&amp;nbsp;pm and 7&amp;nbsp;pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national [[BBC News at Six]] and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 18.30, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the [[ITV Evening News]]. [[Channel 4 News]] starts at 7&amp;nbsp;pm.

Primetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps, including ''Doctors'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' on BBC One, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' on ITV, and ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' on Channel 4. These soap operas or 'continuing dramas' as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as ''[[Holby City]]'', are also fixed to scheduling. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the [[BBC Red Button]] service or the built in [[EPG|Electronic Programme Guides]].

At 10pm with the flagship national news on BBC One in [[BBC News at Ten]] and on ITV on [[ITV News at Ten]] followed by the regional late night news

After midnight, when late evening films are shown, many channels cease broadcasting "normal" programming or simulcast with another channel. Before 2000, the channels simply closed down. However, since then programming has been shown continuously. BBC One will join [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] in a multichannel simulcast and BBC Two shows a continuous loop of forthcoming programme previews and trailers, although prior to the completion of Digital switchover BBC Two had filled its overnight downtime with [[Pages from Ceefax]]. Between 2005 and 2007 ITV broadcast the [[ITV Play]] strand of phone-in participation TV programmes but now much of the night is dedicated to the text-based ITV information service [[ITV Nightscreen]]. Previously, Channel 4 had closed down to show live feeds of ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' (in the summer) and its spin-off, ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' (in January). However, since 2010, repeats of Channel 4 daytime shows have typically been shown. Until the end of the 2000s Channel 5 generally showed various sports from around the world, including boxing and football from European leagues as well as live American sport, with phone-in participation-TV ''[[Quiz Call]]'' on weekends. Quiz Call is now shown every night of the week.

==== Weekend ====

Weekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming, as well as afternoon live and recorded coverage of sporting events and films. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring reality or talent game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week.

== Cultural impact ==

{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}

=== Christian morality ===

In 1963 [[Mary Whitehouse]], incensed by the liberalising policies followed by [[Hugh Greene|Sir Hugh Greene]], then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign. She subsequently launched the Clean Up TV Campaign, and founded the [[Mediawatch-uk|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]] in 1965. In 2008, [[Toby Young]] in an article for ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote: "On the wider question of whether sex and violence on TV has led to a general moral collapse in society at large, the jury is still out. No one doubts that Western civilization is teetering on the brink ... but it is unfair to lay the blame entirely at the feet of BBC2 and Channel 4."&lt;ref name="independantwhitehouse"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/culture-why-mary-whitehouse-was-right-all-along-828784.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Culture: Why Mary Whitehouse was right all along | first=Toby | last=Young | date=18 May 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Criticism of the BBC#Jerry Springer: The Opera|BBC's broadcast of]] ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' elicited 55,000 complaints,&lt;ref name="timesspringer"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Bone Athens Last updated 1|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1547719,00.html |title=BBC 'right' to screen Jerry Springer musical |work=The Times |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provoked protests from Christian organisation [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]],&lt;ref name="springerprotest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4158977.stm |title=Protest held over Springer show |publisher=BBC News |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a private prosecution against the BBC by the [[Christian Institute]].&lt;ref name="springerprosecution"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4606085.stm |title=Legal threat over Springer opera |publisher=BBC News |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summons was not issued.&lt;ref name="springerprosrejected"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4098752.stm |title=Springer Opera legal bid rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=16 June 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] claimed that programmes such as ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Little Britain]]'' were eroding moral standards. The Synod criticised broadcasting trends that "exploit the humiliation of human beings for public entertainment", and called for research to determine the behavioural impact of sexual or violent images.&lt;ref name="telegraphsynod"&gt;{{cite news|last=Petre |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544349/Blame-TV-for-moral-decline-says-Synod.html |title=Blame TV for moral decline, says Synod |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

The '''[[British Academy Television Awards]]''' are the most prestigious awards given in the British television industry, analogous to the Emmy Awards in the United States. They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee.

The '''[[National Television Awards]]''' is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.

== Regulation ==

'''[[Ofcom]]''' is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom's duties include:
*Specification of the Broadcast Code, which took effect on 25 July 2005, with the latest version being published October 2008. The Code itself is published on Ofcom's website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527004300/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/ |archivedate=27 May 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides a mandatory set of rules which broadcast programmes must comply with. The 10 main sections cover protection of under-eighteens, harm and offence, crime, religion, impartiality and accuracy, elections, fairness, privacy, sponsorship and commercial references.&lt;ref name="ofcombcode"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/ |title=The Ofcom Broadcasting Code |publisher=Ofcom |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527004300/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/ |archivedate=27 May 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As stipulated in the [[Communications Act 2003]], Ofcom enforces adherence to the Code. Failure for a broadcaster to comply with the Code results in warnings, fines, and potentially revokation of a broadcasting license.
*Rules on the amount and distribution of advertising, which also took effect July 2005&lt;ref name="ofcomcodes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/ |title=Enforcement |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404174559/http://ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/ |archivedate=4 April 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Examining specific complaints by viewers or other bodies about programmes and sponsorship. Ofcom issues Broadcast Bulletins on a fortnightly basis which are accessible via its web site. As an example, a bulletin from February 2009 has a complaint from the National Heart Forum over sponsorship of [[The Simpsons]] by [[Domino's Pizza]] on [[Sky One]]. Ofcom concluded this was in breach of the Broadcast Code, since it contravened an advertising restriction of food high in fat, salt or sugar.&lt;ref name="ofcomsimpsons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb128/ |title=Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 128 – 23&amp;#124;02&amp;#124;09 |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151034/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb128/ |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Junk food#Marketing|Restrictions in food and drink advertising]] to children were introduced in November 2006.)&lt;ref name="ofcomfood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/11/nr_20061117 |title=News |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009183857/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/11/nr_20061117 |archivedate=9 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The management, regulation and assignment of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] in the UK, and licensing of portions of the spectrum for television broadcasting
*Public consultations on matters relating to TV broadcasting. The results of the consultations are published by Ofcom, and inform the policies that Ofcom creates and enforces.&lt;ref name="ofcomconsult"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/how-ofcom-consults | title=How Ofcom Consults | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ofcom issued fines to the total of £7.7m. This included £5.67m of fines to ITV companies, including a £3m fine to [[London Weekend Television|LWT]] over voting irregularities on [[Saturday Night Takeaway]], and fines totalling £495,000 to the BBC. Ofcom said [[2007 television phone-in scandals|phone-in scandals]] had contributed significantly to the fine totals.&lt;ref name="ofcomfines"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/02/ofcom_tv_fines_hit_77m.html |title=Ofcom TV fines hit£7.7m |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee for Advertising Practice''' (CAP, or BCAP) is the body contracted by Ofcom to create and maintain the codes of practice governing television advertising. The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP's web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.&lt;ref name="captvcode"&gt;[http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506194851/http://www.cap.org.uk/cap/codes/broadcast_codes/tv_code/ |date=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]''' is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licenses if necessary.

== Licensing ==
{{main|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}

In the United Kingdom and the [[Crown dependencies]], a '''[[television licence]]''' is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions. The money from the licence fee is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the BBC, and Welsh-language television programmes for [[S4C]]. The BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2 March 2005|title=BBC governors set to be scrapped|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4309325.stm|accessdate=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following figures for expenditure of licence fee income:

*50% – BBC One and BBC Two
*15% – local TV and radio
*12% – network radio
*10% – digital (BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC News 24, BBC Parliament, CBBC, CBeebies)
*10% – transmission costs and licence fee collection
*3% – BBC Online, Ceefax, and Interactive Content (including bbc.co.uk and BBC Red Button)

== Production ==

As of 2002, 27,000 hours of original programming are produced year in the UK television industry, excluding news, at a cost of £2.6bn. Ofcom has determined that 56% (£1.5bn) of production is in-house by the channel owners, and the remainder by independent production companies. Ofcom is enforcing a 25% independent production quota for the channel operators, as stipulated in the Broadcasting Act 1990.&lt;ref name="ofcomproduction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/01/nr_20060110a |title=television production sector review |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008025658/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/01/nr_20060110a |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In-house production ===

[[ITV plc]], the company which owns 12 of the 15 regional ITV franchises, has set its production arm [[ITV Studios]] a target of producing 75% of the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] schedule,&lt;ref name="itvp"&gt;[http://www.itvplc.com/itv/about/businesses/ Our businesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817154129/http://www.itvplc.com/itv/about/businesses/ |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum allowed by Ofcom. This would be a rise from 54% at present, as part of a strategy to make ITV content-led chiefly to double production revenues to £1.2bn by 2012.&lt;ref name="guardianitv"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Hewlett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/17/mondaymediasection3 |title=Media FAQ: Is Grade's ITV strategy right? &amp;#124; Media |work=The Guardian |date= 16 September 2007|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV Studios currently produces programmes such as ''[[Coronation Street]]'', ''[[Emmerdale]]'' and ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]''.&lt;ref name="itvproductions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granadamedia.com/sf/gm/standard.asp?section_id=3&amp;sub_section_id=0&amp;redirect_id=0 |title=Granada Media, a world leader in television production and distribution |publisher=Granadamedia.com |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the BBC has implemented a Window of Creative Competition (WOCC), a 25% proportion over and above the 25% Ofcom quota in which the BBC's in-house production and independent producers can compete.&lt;ref name="wocc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/network/wocc.shtml |title=Commissioning – Window of Creative Competition (WOCC) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225012149/http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/network/wocc.shtml |archivedate=25 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC produces shows such as ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and ''F***off I'm a Hairy Woman''.&lt;ref name="bbcproduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2007/04_april/miptv_nos.shtml |title=Press Office – BBC Worldwide sells 200 hours of programming to NOS |publisher=BBC |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel 4 commissions all programmes from independent producers.

=== Independent production ===

As a consequence of the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, and the 25% independent quota from the Broadcasting Act 1990, an independent production sector has grown in the UK. Notable companies include [[Talkback Thames]], [[Endemol UK]], [[Hat Trick Productions]], and [[Tiger Aspect Productions]]. A full list can be seen here: [[:Category:Television production companies of the United Kingdom]]

{{main|Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom}}

Analogue TV was transmitted via VHF (1936) and later UHF (1964) radio waves, with analogue broadcasts ending in 2012.

'''[[Very high frequency|VHF]]''' transmissions started in 1936 and closed in 1985 (with a gap 1939–1946), carrying two channels.  The launch channel was the [[BBC One|BBC Television Service]], known as BBC 1 since 1964. This was joined by [[ITV (TV network)|Independent Television]], a network of regional franchises launching between 1955 and 1962. The channels transmitted in monochrome using the [[405-line television system]] at 25 frames per second, initially with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 5:4, switching to [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3]] in 1950.

'''[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]''' transmissions started in 1964 and closed in 2012.  The launch channel was [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]. This would be joined by BBC 1, the ITV network, [[Channel 4]] or [[S4C]] in Wales, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] as well as a network of [[Restricted Service Licence#Television|local TV]] channels. Transmissions started using the [[CCIR System I|System I]] standard, a 625-line monochrome picture at 25 frames/second ([[576i]]) and a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Technical advancements included [[PAL|colour]] (1967), [[teletext]] (1974), and [[NICAM|stereo sound]] (1991).  The drive to switch viewers from analogue to digital transmissions was a process called the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom|digital switchover]].

Whilst there are no longer any analogue broadcasts in the UK, a PAL signal may be present in closed RF distribution systems, e.g. a video feed from an intercom in a block of flats, or a security system.

==== The rise of television in the UK ====

{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was established in 1927 to develop radio broadcasting, and inevitably became involved in TV in 1936. The BBC is funded by income from a "Broadcast Receiving Licence" purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the UK Government.

Television caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only two transmitters, near [[Alexandra Palace television station|London]] and [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station|Birmingham]], only 9% of British homes owned a television set. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs. (A. Smith, ''Television: An International History'' 1995)

Up until 1972, television broadcasting hours were tightly regulated by the British government, under the control of the Postmaster General. Before the launch of the commercial channel ITV in 1955, the BBC was restricted by law to just five hours maximum of television in a day. This was increased at the launch of the commercial channel ITV to a 7-hour broadcasting day for both channels. Gradually the number of hours were increased. Typically during the late 1960s the law regulated a 50-hour broadcasting week for all television channels in the UK. This meant BBC One, BBC Two and ITV could only broadcast normal programming for 7 hours a day Mondays to Fridays, and 7.5 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays.

Until 1957, television in the United Kingdom could not air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was called "Toddler's Truce", where the idea was that parents could put their children to bed, before prime time television would commence. This restriction was lifted in 1957.  However, on Sundays, television remained off the air from 6.00pm-7.00pm. This was in response to religious leaders fears that television would interfere with people attending church services.  In 1958 a compromise was reached, where only religious programming could be aired during this time slot. This restriction was lifted in January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/30006/toddlers-truce-why-you-couldnt-watch-british-tv-6pm-until-1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://moneyweek.com/16-february-1957-the-toddlers-truce-comes-to-an-end/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Postmaster General allowed exemptions to the regulations.  All schools programming, adult education, religious programming, state occasions, political broadcasts and Welsh language programming were totally exempt from the restrictions.  Sport and outside broadcasting events were given a separate quota of broadcasting hours which could be used in a year, starting off at 200 hours a year in the mid 1950s, rising to a quota of 350 hours a year by the late 1960s.  Broadcasting on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were also exempt from the tightly controlled restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Limits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of a conservative government in June 1970 brought in changes to the control of broadcasting hours. At first the typical broadcasting day was extended to 8 hours a day, with an increase in exemptions over Christmas and an increase in the sport/outside broadcasting quota.  On 19 January 1972, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British House of Commons that all restrictions on broadcasting hours on television would be lifted from that day, with the broadcasters allowed to set their own broadcasting hours from then on. By November 1972 a full daytime schedule had been launched on ITV from 9.30am each day, with the BBC also expanding their schedules to include more daytime programming.&lt;ref&gt;https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1972/jan/19/television-and-radio-broadcasting-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Government previously appointed people to the BBC's Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the [[BBC Trust]] replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers.

[[Commercial television]] was first introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts being strictly controlled by the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] the body controlling commercial television.

==== History of satellite television ====
The first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]], was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched [[Astra 1A|Astra]] satellite at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]], providing four analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB).

In 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels ([[Now (TV channel)|Now]], [[Galaxy (British television)|Galaxy]], [[The Movie Channel (UK)|The Movie Channel]], [[The Power Station (TV channel)|The Power Station]] and [[The Sports Channel]]) in [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|D-MAC]] format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the [[Squarial]], a flat plate antenna and [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper [[Satellite dish|dish]] and LNB technology.

The two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in [[Isleworth]] in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], whereas BSB had newly built offices in London ([[Marco Polo House]]). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB's D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's [[VideoCrypt]] video encryption system.

In 1994 17% of the group was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] (with [[American depositary receipt|ADRs]] listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]), and [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation owns a 35% stake. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

By 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]] position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new satellite, at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB's analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.

In May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name [[Freesat]], carrying a variety of channels from [[Astra 28.2°E]], including some content in HD formats.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Rose of Versailles'''''|ベルサイユのばら|Berusaiyu no Bara}}, also known as '''''Lady Oscar''''' or '''''La Rose de Versailles''''', is one of the best-known titles in [[Shōjo manga|''shōjo'' manga]] and a [[media franchise]] created by [[Riyoko Ikeda]]. It has been adapted into several [[Takarazuka Revue]] musicals, as well an [[anime]] television series, produced by [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and broadcast by the anime television network [[Animax]] and [[Nippon Television]]. The show remains incredibly popular in Italy.

''The Rose of Versailles'' focuses on [[Oscar François de Jarjayes]], a girl raised as a man to become her father's successor as leader of the Palace Guards. A brilliant combatant with a strong sense of justice, Oscar is proud of the life she leads, but becomes torn between class loyalty and her desire to help the impoverished as revolution brews among the oppressed lower class. Also important to the story are her conflicting desires to live life as both a militant and a regular woman as well as her relationships with [[Marie Antoinette]], Count [[Hans Axel von Fersen (Lady Oscar)|Axel von Fersen]], and servant and best friend [[André Grandier]].

It features elements of the [[yuri (genre)|yuri genre]] embodied in the relationship between Oscar and her protégée Rosalie Lamorlière, the secret daughter of the scheming [[Duchess de Polignac (Lady Oscar)|Madame de Polignac]]. Rosalie refers to Oscar as her first love.&lt;ref name="zodiac-names"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ikeda | first=Riyoko | authorlink=Riyoko Ikeda | title=The Rose of Versailles, Volume 3| publisher=[[Shueisha]] | location=Tokyo| date=1973| isbn=978-4-08-850116-1 | chapter= Chapter 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the court ladies also greatly adore Oscar, openly admiring her at parties and become very jealous when she brings female companions to them.&lt;ref name="drazen"&gt;Drazen, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|List of The Rose of Versailles characters}}
The setting is in [[France]], before and during the [[French Revolution]]. In the early part of the series, the main character is the young, flighty Queen of France, [[Marie Antoinette]], however later the focus of the story shifts to a woman named [[Oscar François de Jarjayes]]. Oscar's father, General Jarjayes, despaired over never getting a son (he had six daughters), and decided to raise his youngest daughter as a man. He trained her well in the arts of [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[horsemanship]] and [[Historical European martial arts|medieval combat]]. Oscar often practiced her skills with her best friend, companion and (technically) servant, André Grandier, whom she almost always defeated. André is the grandson of her nanny and thus they spent most of their time together in harmonic friendship; near the end of the story, this friendship blossoms into mutual love.

Oscar is the commander of the Royal Guard and responsible for the safety of Marie Antoinette, as well as the rest of the royal family. The story revolves around Oscar's growing realization of how France is governed, and the plight of the poor. Another important storyline is the love story between Marie Antoinette and the Swedish Count [[Axel von Fersen, Jr.|Axel von Fersen]]. The affair between the two is the subject of rumours through all of France, endangering the Queen's reputation and driving Oscar to request the Count to leave the country.

After the Count decides to leave and sign up for the American war of independence, Marie Antoinette becomes lovesick. She spends money in excess – expensive jewellery and clothes, attending balls every other night – to distract herself from pining for the only man she loved. This, in turn, weighs on the taxpayers of France, and poverty spreads throughout the country due to Marie Antoinette's squandering of money. Both the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]] and the appearance of the infamous [[Gabrielle de Polastron, comtesse de Polignac]] are central plot events taken from history, as well as the [[French Revolution]] and the fall of the Bastille – all given interesting interpretations through the fictional character Oscar and her companions.

On July 14, 1789, [[Storming of the Bastille|the Taking of the Bastille]], the crowds rebel but lack strategy, giving the military the advantage and making themselves easy target for cannon fire. However, Oscar and the regiment B then arrive to help organize the insurgents. During the following fierce battle, Oscar is shot and killed, but the Bastille eventually falls, symbolically striking down the French monarchy. After the Bastille is taken, the revolutionaries burst into the Palace searching for Marie Antoinette and her family. Many guards are killed and the royal family taken prisoner. Big trials are started for Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, but finally, both are declared guilty and [[guillotined]].

==Development==
Ikeda's editors were opposed to her idea of a biography of Marie Antoinette, and only its popularity among readers kept ''The Rose of Versailles'' in publication. Ikeda had read [[Stefan Zweig]]'s [[Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman|biography of Marie Antoinette]] in high school, and the first chapters focus on the queen, casting her as a ''shōjo'' heroine, and Du Barry as a rival. Oscar was created as a supporting character. Oscar eclipsed Marie Antoinette in popularity and due to reader feedback became the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=Mechademia |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Shōjo Manga |pages= 7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ikeda was influenced by [[Feminism in Japan#Second-wave feminism and birth control activism|second-wave feminist]] ideas when creating ''The Rose of Versailles'', using the French Revolution to depict the "inner revolution of the Japanese women" at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anan|first1=Nobuko|title=''The Rose of Versailles'': Women and Revolution in Girls' Manga and the Socialist Movement in Japan|journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|date=February 2014|volume=47|issue=1|pages=41–63|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of The Rose of Versailles chapters}}

''The Rose of Versailles'' is one of the most influential manga ever written.&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/RoV.htm | title= The Rose of Versailles: Overview | work= ProCulture.ca |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s [[Margaret (magazine)|Margaret Magazine]] in 1973, and became an instant success. It was published on 24 May 1982 and contains 10 volumes.

There is a less-known "[[sequel]]". It is known as ''[[Eikou no Napoleon – Eroica|Eikou no Napoleon]]'' or "The Glory of Napoleon". It has a few of the original characters and is mostly about the Empire of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I of France]].

In 1983, the first two volumes of ''The Rose of Versailles'' were translated into [[English language|English]] by [[Frederik L. Schodt]] for the purpose of teaching English to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers and released in [[North America]] by the North American branch of Sanyusha.&lt;ref name="jai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jai2.com/mytransmanga.htm|title=Translations of Manga|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|authorlink=Frederik L.

A snippet of the translated manga was also included in Schodt's ''Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics'' book. [[Udon Entertainment]] has officially announced the publication rights, with a scheduled release for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-07-11/udon-entertainment-adds-rose-of-versailles-manga/.90349|title=Udon Entertainment Adds Rose of Versailles Manga|last=|first=|date=11 July 2015|work=|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=20 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2018, Udon reported that most of the translation was complete and the series was going through editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Udon Responds to Rose of Versailles Question|url=https://comicsworthreading.com/2018/01/13/udon-responds-to-rose-of-versailles-question/|website=Comics Worth Reading|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaiden===
The ''Versailles no Bara Gaiden'' series is a collections of short stories written by [[Riyoko Ikeda]]. These stories were published in two separate magazines in 1974 (first publication) after the serialization of the manga ''The Rose of Versailles'', and 1984–1985 (second publication).

===Anime===
{{See also|List of The Rose of Versailles episodes}}

In 1979, ''The Rose of Versailles'' was released in Japan as a 40-episode (and 1 [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]) [[animated television series]], which ran from October 1979 to September 1980. Besides Japan, the series has also been broadcast in several other countries of [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]] under the title of ''Lady Oscar''.&lt;ref name="rov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.interlog.com/~dgsimmns/RoV/RoV.mainpage.html| title= The Rose of Versailles - Presentations | accessdate=2008-02-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080206125318/http://pages.interlog.com/~dgsimmns/RoV/RoV.mainpage.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime was directed by [[Tadao Nagahama]] (episodes 1-18) and [[Osamu Dezaki]] (episodes 19-40), who brought a cinematic approach to the series. [[Shingo Araki]] was the [[animation director]] and co-[[designer|character designer]] along with Akio Sugino and [[Michi Himeno]]. [[Kōji Makaino]] was in charge of the [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref name="pro"/&gt;

The [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] [[Employment|staff]] included the most recognized animation professionals then, who contributed in the making of the 40 episodes of the anime. In spite of the difficulties they had to go through, the staff could continue with their work and took advantage of the problems. The most important of said incidents was the change of direction at the middle of the project, which marked a notable difference between the first half of the anime (directed by [[Tadao Nagahama]]) and the second one (directed by [[Osamu Dezaki]]).&lt;ref name="yue-chan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://yue-chan.tripod.com/berubara/Serie.htm | title= Lady Oscar: Información General | work= El Portal de Yue-Chan | language=Spanish | accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime was finally aired on October 10, 1979 in Japan on the channel [[Nippon TV]]. From this point on, the series would be aired every Wednesday until September 3, 1980, with the airing of the last episode.

===Musicals===
{{Main|The Rose of Versailles musicals}}

''Rose of Versailles'' has also been dramatized for [[Takarazuka Revue]] by Shinji Ueda. Rose of Versailles has been called Takarazuka's most popular show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidappleyard.com/japan/jp41.htm|title=Japan Perspectives &amp;#124; "Japan's Takarazuka Theater makes women, and men, of talented girls"|last=Yates|first=Ronald E.|date=10 June 1990|website=Davidappleyard.com|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's role in Takarazuka history is particularly notable as it established the "Top Star" system that remains in place to this day. ''Rose of Versailles'' also triggered a large surge in the revue's popularity,&lt;ref name="TDR"&gt;Brau, Lorie. (Winter 1990) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1146045 The Women’s Theatre of Takarazuka.]" The [[MIT Press]]. TDR 34.4 :79-95. Retrieved 20 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as the {{Nihongo|"BeruBara Boom"|ベルバラブーム|Berubara Buumu}}.

From 1974 to 1976, all four Takarazuka troupes staged ''The Rose of Versailles'', drawing a total audience of 1.6 million. In 1989, it was restaged drawing an audience of 2.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Cavaye, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent shows were the  [[gaiden]] adaptations performed in mid-to-late 2008 by Snow troupe (led by [[Natsuki Mizu]]), Flower Troupe (led by [[Sei Matobu]]) and Star Troupe (led by [[Kei Aran]]). The scenarios for these new side-story adaptations were developed by Riyoko Ikeda specifically for the Revue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/news/detail/6856beada15196fad01d683184920bd4.html|title=2008 performance line up nationwide tour]|last=|first=|date=18 January 2008|website=|publisher=[[Takarazuka Revue]]|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926160621/http://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/news/detail/6856beada15196fad01d683184920bd4.html|archive-date=26 September 2008|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Rose of Versailles'' is currently 14th on the list of all-time best-selling shōjo manga, having sold a grand total of 15 million volumes worldwide&lt;ref name="comi"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://comipress.com/news/2006/09/27/796 | title=Learn French with "The Rose of Versailles" | work=Comipress.com | date=2006-09-27 | accessdate=2008-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 12 million in Japan only,&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; a "nation-wide best seller".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Napier |first=Susan J. |title=The Worlds of Japanese Popular Culture: Gender, Shifting Boundaries and Global Culture |editor=Martinez, Dolores P. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63128-9 |page=92 |chapter=Vampires, Psychic Girls, Flying Women and Sailor Scouts |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of circulation per volume, it is in fourth place with an average of 1,500,000 sales per volume. It is not well known in North America (except in Quebec) due to its age and lack of publicity, but remains a treasured classic in Japanese manga. The anime was ranked in the top 50 of a list of favourite anime series in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime|title=TV Asahi Top 100 Anime|last=|first=|date=23 September 2005|work=|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=20 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So far, the manga and anime have been translated into Arabic, Turkish, Korean, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Indonesian and Chinese. The "immense popularity" of the 1974 Takarazuka musical gained widespread attention, including academic attention, for not only Rose of Versailles, but for the field of [[shōjo manga]].&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Roberson, James E. |author2=Suzuki, Nobue |title=Men and Masculinities in Contemporary Japan: Dislocating the Salaryman Doxa |year=2003|publisher= Routledge |isbn= 0-415-24446-3 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research that went into the setting of ''Rose of Versailles'' led some teachers to use it in their classrooms and purchase it for their school libraries, which was a "Japanese educational first".  The popularity of the manga also created a boom in the study of the French language and made France, particularly Versailles a popular tourist destination for Japanese travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schilling|first=Mark|title=The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture|publisher=Weatherhill|year=1997|pages=207–208|isbn=978-0-8348-0380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moto Hagio]] believes the popularity of ''The Rose of Versailles'' influenced publishers to routinely collect serialized manga in [[Tankōbon|paperback]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619074807/http://www.tcj.com/history/the-moto-hagio-interview-conducted-by-matt-thorn-part-three-of-four/2|archivedate=June 19, 2010|url=http://www.tcj.com/history/the-moto-hagio-interview-conducted-by-matt-thorn-part-three-of-four/2|title=The Moto Hagio Interview conducted by Matt Thorn (Part Three of Four)|publisher=The Comics journal|date=March 11, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan J. Napier]] has described the court of ''The Rose of Versailles'' as being "a particularly good example of idealized Western Otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Napier |first=Susan J. |title=The Worlds of Japanese Popular Culture: Gender, Shifting Boundaries and Global Culture |editor=Martinez, Dolores P. |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=0-521-63128-9 |page=107 |chapter=Vampires, Psychic Girls, Flying Women and Sailor Scouts |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tierney says that the aesthetics of ''The Rose of Versailles'' cannot be described as purely Japanese or Western.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kenji Tierney | first1 = R.| title = :Beauty Up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics| journal = American Anthropologist| volume = 109| pages = 773–774| year = 2007| doi = 10.1525/aa.2007.109.4.773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Shamoon says that ''Rose of Versailles'' can be used to track the development of ''shōjo'' manga from being "a genre for children to being one for older readers". The bloody end of the main characters, while shocking, also whet the audience's appetite for more serious stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=[[Mechademia]] |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Shōjo Manga |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamoon sees the Oscar-André relationship as very different from the Cinderella-Prince Charming stories which "dominated" ''shōjo'' manga in the 1960s, where the female protagonist would lose her identity to her boyfriend. Shamoon considers that the Oscar-André relationship follows the pattern of pre-war ''[[Class S (genre)|dōseiai]]'' ''shōjo'' novels, which featured same-sex love between girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=Mechademia |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Shōjo Manga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazuko Suzuki says that after ''RoV'', "several works" were created with "nonsexual" female protagonists like Oscar, who realize their "womanness" upon falling in love.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. "Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon". In Sherrie Inness, ed., ''Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World''. London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.250 {{ISBN|0-8476-9136-5}}, {{ISBN|0-8476-9137-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rose of Versailles'' is famous for having the first "bed scene" in manga that was depicted by a woman,&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark (2000). "Male Homosexuality in Modern Japan: Cultural Myths and Social Realities", page 74. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press {{ISBN|0-7007-1425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has had a "profound impact" on female readers,&lt;ref name="Mechademia 2 p 15"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=Mechademia |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Shōjo Manga |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; including fan criticism of the adaptation of this scene to the anime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Thorn|Thorn, Matt]], (1997) [http://www.matt-thorn.com/shoujo_manga/jaws/index.php What Japanese Girls Do With Manga, and Why]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yukari Fujimoto]] has said that "for us junior and senior high school girls at that time, our concept of sex was fixed by that manga".&lt;ref name="Mechademia 2 p 15"/&gt;

===Legacy===
The series is generally cited as having been a major influence on ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Le Chevalier D'Eon]]''. Oscar makes a crossover appearance in the [[Lupin the Third|''Lupin III'']] [[Lupin the Third Part II|''Part II'' anime series]] episode "Versailles Burned with Love", and the series is mentioned as a frame of reference for the Rose Knights in the light novel series [[Gate (novel series)|''Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri'']].

'''The Undertaker vs. Mankind''' was a [[professional wrestling]] match between [[The Undertaker]] and Mankind, also known as [[Mick Foley]], of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and the third held inside the [[Hell in a Cell]] structure (two weeks following the second, which took place on the June 15 episode of ''Raw is War'' to promote the pay-per-view's dual main-event). The match took place at the [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] [[pay-per-view]] on June 28, 1998, at the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It would set the standard for future Hell in a Cell matches. During the bout, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#bump|bumps]]. Journalist [[Michael Landsberg]] called it "maybe the most famous match ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Undertaker interview|series=[[Off the Record with Michael Landsberg|Off the Record]]|network=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=2002-03-29|minutes=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events leading up to the match==
Upon debuting with the WWF in 1996, Mankind immediately began feuding with The Undertaker, debuting the night after [[WrestleMania XII]] when Mankind interfered in The Undertaker's match with [[John Layfield|Justin Hawk Bradshaw]]. For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches.&lt;ref name=pwi95&gt;2007 Wrestling almanac &amp; book of facts. "Wrestling’s historical cards" (p.95)&lt;/ref&gt; The feud intensified, and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas, and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost the Undertaker the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], assisting champion [[Goldust]] to victory. As a result, the first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]] was [[Professional wrestling booker|booked]] between the two at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]]. During the match, when Undertaker reached for [[Paul Bearer]]'s urn, Bearer hit him with it, betraying The Undertaker and allowing Mankind to "incapacitate" The Undertaker with the [[Mandible claw]], giving him the win.&lt;ref name=pwi95/&gt; After Bearer's betrayal, The Undertaker took his rivalry with Mankind to a new level, resulting in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] in the main event of [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. The Undertaker won the match after a [[chokeslam]] into the open grave, but after interference from [[Terry Gordy|The Executioner]], as well as the help of several other superstars, The Undertaker was ultimately "[[Premature burial|buried alive]]".&lt;ref name=pwi95/&gt;

After being buried alive, The Undertaker returned at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]] again pitting him against Mankind, but with a unique stipulation; hanging {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ring was Paul Bearer, enclosed in a steel cage. If Undertaker won the match, he would be able to get his hands on Bearer. Even though The Undertaker won the match, interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape The Undertaker's clutches.&lt;ref name=pwi97&gt;PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac &amp; book of facts. "Wrestling’s historical cards" (p.96–97)&lt;/ref&gt; With no manager, Undertaker developed a more humanized incarnation, with a different, gothic and [[Rebellion|rebelling attitude]] — perhaps to better fit him to [[The Attitude Era]], a more adult-oriented programming content [[The Attitude Era#Initiation|period of World Wrestling Federation]] —, proclaiming himself to be "The Lord of Darkness".&lt;ref name="undertakerpersona"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1052842-wwe-why-the-undertakers-gimmick-is-still-getting-over-22-years-later|title=The Undertaker: Why His WWE Gimmick Is Still Getting over 22 Years Later|publisher=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; After The Undertaker attended to other feuds and won the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[WrestleMania 13]], the feud with Mankind temporarily ended after one more match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]], won by The Undertaker.

In the following year, The Undertaker would either hold the WWF Championship or be in contention for it while Foley would gradually bring out his "Three Faces of Foley": Mankind, Dude Love, and his old gimmick from [[World Championship Wrestling]] &amp; [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], Cactus Jack.

==Prelude to the match==
On the June 1, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'', Foley would revert to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and restarted the feud with The Undertaker. Mankind reunited with Paul Bearer, the father and manager of Kane, and the new alliance challenged Undertaker and WWF champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to the second Hell in a Cell match on the June 15 episode of Raw. That bout ended in a no-contest, with Undertaker attacking Bearer in a locked cell while Austin assaulted Kane atop the structure. This set up the double main-event for King of the Ring; Austin and Kane in a First Blood match for the title, while Undertaker and Mankind would then be booked for a one-on-one inside [[Hell in a Cell]].

Before this match, Foley and [[Terry Funk]] were discussing the previous year's Hell in a Cell at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]] that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming [[Shawn Michaels]] onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming ideas about how to top that match when Funk said, "laughing, 'maybe you should let him throw you off the top of the cage.'" Foley:

{{Block quote|"Yeah," I shot back, "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and said quietly to Terry, "I think I can do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|author= Mick Foley|year= 1999|isbn=978-0-06-039299-4|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}}

When presented with the idea of throwing Foley off the top of the cage, Undertaker was a little more hesitant, even going as far as to ask Foley, "Mick, do you want to die?" Ultimately, Undertaker reluctantly agreed to perform the spot. Fittingly for Foley, the King of the Ring was scheduled to take place that year at the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. Foley himself trained to become a professional wrestler at [[Dominic DeNucci]]'s wrestling school in nearby [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], only {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh, bringing his career full circle.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 66–67, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html |title=Mick Foley Biography |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904210033/http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html |archivedate=September  4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match details==
Foley came out first and once he reached the cell, he threw a chair on top of the structure and began to climb up to the top. The Undertaker then made his way to the ring, saw Foley on top of the cell, and also climbed to the top. Both wrestlers then began to fight on the roof of the cell.

The first bump Foley would take came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and the Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the structure from a height of {{convert|16|-|22|ft|m|abbr=on}}, if including the angle of the fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|author= Mick Foley|year= 1999|isbn=978-0-06-039299-4|page=653}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent him crashing through the Spanish announcers' table, which triggered announcer [[Jim Ross]] to famously shout, "Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him!" and "As God as my witness, he is broken in half!"

Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while the Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Foley's longtime friend [[Terry Funk]] was the first person on the scene, followed by WWF's resident doctor, Dr. Francois Pettit, and various others, including [[Vince McMahon]], who broke character by looking legitimately worried about someone (Foley) that, on-air at least, he was supposed to dislike.  Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out of the arena.

Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cell, climbing to the top of the structure, with the Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cell surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and the Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night).&lt;ref name= FoleyDVD /&gt; With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.

Earlier as both were walking on the chain-link mesh which comprised the cell's ceiling, the metal fasteners were snapping off causing the roof to sag and partially give way under their combined weight. According to Terry Funk, the prop guy had purposely designed it that way, except it was never meant to give way completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZAmyUEP_v0C&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Terry Funk: More Than Just Hardcore - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second huge bump of the night, the Undertaker [[chokeslam]]med Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage, causing one panel to give way completely, resulting in Foley falling through and hitting the ring canvas hard below. In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, "Good God...Good God! Will somebody stop the damn match? Enough's enough!"; along with color commentator [[Jerry Lawler]] adding, "That's it. He's dead."

The cage giving way completely was a surprise to both Foley and the Undertaker.&lt;ref name= FoleyDVD &gt;{{cite video| people = Foley, Mick| title = Mick Foley's Greatest Hits &amp; Misses: A Life in Wrestling| medium = DVD | publisher = WWE Home Video| date = January 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall, yet he was able to stay in character.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes."&lt;ref name="FunkWilliams2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry Funk|author2=Scott E.

He also cited the fact that the ring onto which he landed had a harder surface than that of modern rings, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/mick-foley-explains-how-he-lied-to-convince-vince-mcmahon-to-let-him-take-the-bumps-in-the-1998-hell-in-a-cell/ |title=Mick Foley Explains How He Lied to Convince Vince McMahon to Let Him Take the Bumps in the 1998 Hell in a Cell |publisher=411MANIA |date=2017-04-08 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podcastone.com/pg/jsp/program/episode.jsp?programID=593d=1720335 ]{{deadlink|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDEryvNlpAg&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, The Undertaker would note that just before executing the chokeslam, he had been standing with his left foot on the same panel that Foley fell through, but at the last second decided to instead place it on the support bar the panel was attached to so that he would have more stability for lifting Foley; had he not done that, he would have fallen through and probably landed at least partially on Foley, thus potentially injuring Foley (and himself) far worse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker_vs._Mankind |date=September 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after getting up and being attended to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 657&lt;/ref&gt;

The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley being chokeslammed by the Undertaker onto a pile of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas, and The Undertaker executing the Tombstone Piledriver to end the match and the feud as planned.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match. Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained "somewhat sluggish" for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 666&lt;/ref&gt; Foley would go on to become a three-time WWF Champion after the match, and would be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2013, while Undertaker would develop his '[[The Streak (wrestling)|Streak]]' and win five more world championships.

In the storyline; the cell reappeared that night, as both Undertaker and Mankind interfered in the Austin/Kane First Blood match. Kane won the WWF title, although the match is not considered an official Hell in a Cell match, and Austin won back the belt one night later on the June 29 episode of Raw. The fourth Hell in a Cell match took place on Raw is War two months later, between tag team champions Mankind and Kane, concluding their alliance. This bout, like the second cell match which was also televised on Raw, involved interference from Undertaker and Austin. Three official Hell in a Cell matches transpiring in the summer of 1998 made this particular four-way feud unique, as well as the WWF championship title changing hands within its confines.

Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the [[list of professional wrestling terms#Spot|spots]] from the match at King of the Ring. In his autobiography ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]]'', Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'''s Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved. While WWE continues to have Hell in a Cell matches—and even now has an [[WWE Hell in a Cell|annual pay-per-view featuring the match]]—the match itself has been toned down somewhat in the wake of WWE moving towards more family-friendly programming since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130628220656/http://collarandelbow.com/is-hell-in-a-cell-still-relevant-in-a-pg-era/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Foley himself acknowledged in 2014 while being interviewed about the [[Monday Night Wars]] that had the match taken place today, WWE would have immediately stopped the match after the first fall off the top of the cage "and rightfully so."&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'' Have a Nice Day!&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley said in his first book that his wife cried during a post match phone conversation between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling,&lt;ref name=mf663&gt;Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 663–664&lt;/ref&gt; something that Foley did eventually do on a full-time basis in 2000. Fittingly, his last match as a full-time wrestler was also a Hell in a Cell match at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in February 2000; Foley decided to replicate his fall through the roof of the cell during the match and proper precautions were taken to ensure his safety performing the stunt.

After the match, Vince McMahon said to Foley, "You have no idea how much I appreciate what you have just done for this company, but I never want to see anything like that again."&lt;ref name=mf663/&gt; He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Dr. Pettit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to the Undertaker and asked "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm.

In 2011, this incident was named as the number one "[[wikt:OMG|OMG]]!" incident in the WWE history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD-notes |title=OMG! - The Top 50 Incidents in WWE History DVD |publisher=[[WWE| WWE Inc]] |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both participants have said that the original Hell in a Cell match, between The Undertaker and [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]] on October 5, 1997, was superior; The Undertaker named the Badd Blood contest as his favorite match,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Undertaker]] interview (Part 2). ''[[The Score Television Network|The Score]]''. April 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; while Foley called it the greatest Hell in a Cell bout ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2016/03/31/331-stone-cold-podcast-review-mick-foley-interviewed-by-steve-austin-noelle-foley-appears-and-discusses-her-intent-to-become-a-pro-wrestler-details-on-the-holy-foley-network-show/ |title=3/31 Stone Cold Podcast review: Mick Foley interviewed by Steve Austin, Noelle Foley appears and discusses her intent to become a pro wrestler, details on the "Holy Foley" network show - Pro Wrestling Dot Net |publisher=Prowrestling.net |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Verbum''''' was a [[Slovak language]] [[magazine]] focused primarily on writings of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Cornis-Pope &amp; John Neubauer, History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries. Volume III: The making and remaking of literary institutions (John Benjamins Publishing, 18 Jul 2007) [page [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=taw6AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Verbum+(Slovak+Magazine)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HSLLxC1_No&amp;sig=09onYLcIQY4klvUjq3gge7viwmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6v5CW9qfJAhXk56YKHcSLBogQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Verbum%20(Slovak%20Magazine)&amp;f=false   91].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Verbum'' was founded in May 1946 at the parish in [[Liptovský Hrádok]], by the Catholic modernist poet [[Janko Silan]]. The Magazine took contributions from the whole spectrum of Catholic intellectuals, many of whom were previously editors of journals  prior to [[World War II]]. The most important contributors included:
* [[Ladislav Hanus]], 
* [[Joseph Kútnik]], 
* [[Cyril Dudas]], 
* [[Vendelín Jankovič]]

In addition, the magazine also created a publishing house Verbum, in [[Košice]].

During its existence, the ''Verbum'' became very popular magazine, and could not manage to meet all orders. It had dedicated volumes that dealt with philosophy, art and one double issue was devoted to Protestantism. Verbum was instructed by [[communist]] officials  to be destroyed in March 1948 (marked activity contributed Jozef Straka, among other things, arrest of Bishop John Vojtaššáka). Several contributors were arrested and spent many years in a communist prison.

[[File:Water-Park-Slide-7955.jpg|thumb|right|Boy riding a water tube slide at [[Hawaiian Falls The Colony|The Colony Park]] in [[The Colony, Texas|The Colony]], Texas]]
A '''water slide''' (also referred to as a '''flume''', or '''water chute''') is a type of [[Playground slide|slide]] designed for warm-weather or indoor recreational use at [[water park]]s. Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size. Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide, or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide.

A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a [[swimming pool]] (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.

==Traditional water slides==

[[File:Abandoned water slide in Arkansas (2014).jpg|thumb|right|"Wild Water Rampage" at [[Dogpatch USA]], an abandoned theme park in [[Marble Falls, Arkansas]]]]

===Body slides===
As the name suggests, body slides feature no mat and require the person to sit directly on the surface of the slide. There are a variety of types of body slides including simple flumes, speed slides, bowls and AquaLoops - the latter three are explained below.

===Inline tube slides===
Some slides are designed to be ridden with a tube which typically seats either 2 or 3 riders inline. Similar to a traditional body slide, these slides include many twists and turns and come in a variety of types including bowls, funnels and half-pipes.

===AquaLoop===
{{Main|AquaLoop}}
The first known existence of a looping water slide was at [[Action Park]] in [[Vernon Township, New Jersey]] in the mid-1980s. [[Action Park#Cannonball Loop|The park's water slide]] featured a vertical loop but was repeatedly closed due to safety concerns.&lt;ref name="Traction Park 21"&gt;Austin, ''op. cit.'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tom Fergus"&gt;Fergus, Tom; May 2006; "Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts", in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Braybrook"&gt;Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; "A Survivor from Action Park Writes In", in "The Reaction to Traction at Action Park"; ''Weird NJ'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s, Austrian manufacturer ''Aquarena'' developed the world's first safe looping water slide, known as the ''AquaLoop''.

===Bowl===
A ''bowl'' is a type of water slide where riders descend a steep drop into a round bowl. Under the effects of [[centrifugal force]], the riders circle the outer area of the bowl before exiting down through the middle, often into a pool underneath but sometimes into an additional slide section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProSlide BehemothBOWLS- the biggest Bowl ride in the world! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qde5fR1BiA|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProSlide CannonBOWL- The World's Most Successful High Energy Tubing Bowl Ride! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_8D2mjRU9g|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=23 October 2010|author=ProSlide|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProSlide ProBOWLS- A High Thrill Body Ride Experience that Delivers a Double Dose of Excitement!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJrP_FksPJI|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=23 October 2010|author=ProSlide|date=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of water slide comes in various styles and is manufactured by ProSlide,&lt;ref name="ProSlide Behemoth Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behemoth ="Australian waterslides and leisure" Bowl|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_c.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715124536/http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_c.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProSlide Cannon Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannon Bowl|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_b.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715124635/http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_b.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProSlide Bullet Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullet Bowl|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_d.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715124828/http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_d.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProSlide Pro Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro Bowl|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_a.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715124849/http://www.proslide.com/rides_02_a.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; WhiteWater West&lt;ref name="WhiteWater SuperBowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=SuperBowl|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/superbowl.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteWater SpaceBowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceBowl|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/spacebowl.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Waterfun Products.&lt;ref name="Waterfun Body Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=AquaDrum Body Bowl|url=http://www.waterfunproducts.com/products/aquadrum-body-bowl.asp|publisher=Waterfun Products|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different variations can be ridden on a 4-person cloverleaf tube,&lt;ref name="ProSlide Behemoth Bowl"/&gt; 2 person inline tube,&lt;ref name="ProSlide Cannon Bowl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteWater SuperBowl"/&gt; single person tube&lt;ref name="ProSlide Bullet Bowl"/&gt; or as a body slide.&lt;ref name="ProSlide Pro Bowl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteWater SpaceBowl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterfun Body Bowl"/&gt;
[[File:八仙水上樂園1.JPG|thumb|left|A family rafting water slide attraction at [[Formosa Fun Coast]] in Taiwan]]

===Family rafting===
''Family rafting'' water slides have the largest capacity of all the different types of tubing water slides averaging between 4 and 6 riders per dispatch. Riders hop in a circular raft and travel down long, twisted {{Convert|4.5|m|adj=on}} channels to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammoth Falls - Wet'n'Wild Water World|url=http://wetnwild.myfun.com.au/Attractions/Rides/Mammoth-Falls.htm|publisher=MyFun|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of water slide is manufactured by Australian Waterslides and Leisure,&lt;ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"/&gt; ProSlide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammoth|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_04_a.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125028/http://www.proslide.com/rides_04_a.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProSlide Dark Mammoth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Mammoth|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_04_b.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125050/http://www.proslide.com/rides_04_b.php|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterfun Products&lt;ref name="Waterfun Products People Eater"&gt;{{cite web|title=People Eater|url=http://www.waterfunproducts.com/products/people-eater.asp|publisher=Waterfun Products|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and WhiteWater West.&lt;ref name="WhiteWater Family Rafting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Rafting|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/family_rafting.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these companies manufacture open-air slides while ProSlide also manufactures an enclosed version.&lt;ref name="ProSlide Dark Mammoth"/&gt;
[[File:Wet'n'Wild Water World Australia Tornado.jpg|thumb|A ProSlide Tornado at [[Wet'n'Wild Water World]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], Australia]]

===Funnel===
A ''funnel'' water slide requires riders to sit in a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from one side to the other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the [[ProSlide Tornado]] which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado Installations|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_01_inst.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/Abyss.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Half-pipe===
Similar to a funnel, a ''half-pipe'' features a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, this style of ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before coming to a rest at the base of the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidewinder|url=http://www.waterfunproducts.com/products/sidewinder.asp|publisher=Waterfun Products|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidewinder Mini|url=http://www.waterfunproducts.com/products/sidewinder-mini.asp|publisher=Waterfun Products|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent down a steep drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boomerango|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/boomerango.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Boomerango|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/family_boomerango.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Bro WhiteWater World.JPG|thumb|left|A multi-lane racer at [[WhiteWater World]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], Australia]]

===Multi-lane racer===
A ''multi-lane racer'' is a ride where between 4 and 8 riders dive head-first onto a mat and down a slide with several dips. As an additional component of this ride, both some offer an additional enclosed helix at the top of the ride. ProSlide offer ProRacers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProRacer|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_07_a.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090010/http://www.proslide.com/rides_07_a.php|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octopus Racers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octopus Racers|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_07_b.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090024/http://www.proslide.com/rides_07_b.php|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kraken Racers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kraken Racers|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides/krakenracer/|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while WhiteWater West have designed the Mat Racers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mat Racers|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/mat_racers.html|publisher=WhiteWater West}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Whizzards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whizzard|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/whizzard.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Waterslides and Leisure have also manufactured a standard multi-lane racer.&lt;ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Product Range|url=http://www.waterslide.net/product-range/|publisher=Australian Waterslides and Leisure|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maior toboagua do mundo.JPG|thumb|A speed slide at [[Beach Park (water park)|Beach Park]] in Brazil]]

===Speed slide===
A ''speed slide'' is a type of body slide where riders are sent down steep, free-fall plunges to the ground. Almost all water slide manufacturers offer a variation of this type of slide. ProSlide &amp; WhiteWater West both offer a speed slide with a trap door, the same trap door found on the AquaLoop.&lt;ref name="Australian Waterslides and Leisure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plummet|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_08.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Body Slides|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/body_slides.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water coaster===
{{confusion|Water coaster (roller coaster)}} 
A ''water coaster'' is a water slide that mimics a [[roller coaster]] by providing not only descents, but ascents as well. There are three different ways water coasters operate: [[Jet (fluid)|water jets]],&lt;ref name="WhiteWater Master Blaster"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master Blaster|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/master_blaster.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[conveyor belt]]s,&lt;ref name="WhiteWater ZipCoaster"&gt;{{cite web|title=ZipCoaster|url=http://www.whitewaterwest.com/zipcoaster.html|publisher=WhiteWater West|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linear induction motor]]s.&lt;ref name="ProSlide Rocket"&gt;{{cite web|title=ProSlide Rocket|url=http://www.proslide.com/rides_05.php|publisher=ProSlide|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129053517/http://www.proslide.com/rides_05.php|archivedate=29 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High powered water jets power the first type of water coaster, generically known as Master Blasters.

=== Drop slide ===
[[File:Plopsaqua (C34).JPG|thumb|Sky Drop at [[Plopsaqua]], Belgium.]]
A ''drop'' slide is a type of body slide where at the end of the slide, riders fall multiple feet into the water, as opposed to exiting into the water.

==Inflatable water slides==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Inflatable water slides are designed for the home user. They are typically made of a thick strong [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] and [[nylon]], and are inflated using an electric or gasoline powered [[Fan (mechanical)|blower]]. The water slide is attached to a water hose in order to generate the supply of water. There are small sized inflatable water slides for private house uses or larger inflatable water slides for school, picnic, corporate, or carnival style use. There are also swimming pool water slides which users can set up to slide straight into a pool.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Most parks avoid this due to safety concerns, and will have swimming sections in a separate pool.
