      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2351">"'''All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'''" is a [[proverb]]. It means that without time off from work, a person becomes both bored and boring. The exact origins of the phrase remain unclear, though it was recorded as early as 1659.

==History==
Though the spirit of the proverb had been expressed previously, the modern saying appeared first in [[James Howell]]'s ''Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish'' (1659),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html
|title = JamHowell Quotes and Quotations

|accessdate = 2011-01-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215124957/http://famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html| archivedate= 15 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in later collections of proverbs. It also appears in Howell's ''Paroimiographia'' (1659), p.&amp;nbsp;12.

Some writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in ''Harry and Lucy Concluded'' (1825) by the Irish novelist [[Maria Edgeworth]]:

{{cquote|All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, &lt;BR&gt; All play and no work makes Jack a mere toy.}}

==Uses in popular media==
The proverb has been used widely throughout popular media, notably including [[James Joyce]]'s short story "[[Araby (short story)|Araby]]"  to [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', the 1957 movie ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', and the 1980 horror movie ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/shining.html|title = Film Script, The Shining |page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. In Kubrick's film the main character, [[Jack Torrance]] (played by [[Jack Nicholson]]), is found to have abandoned the play he was writing in favor of typing this sentence over and over onto reams of paper. A number of other works have subsequently included a direct [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Antigua Recreation Ground''' is the [[national stadium]] of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. It is located in [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], on the island of [[Antigua]]. The ground has been used by the [[West Indies cricket team]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team]]. It has [[Test cricket]] status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/ground/59495.html Cricinfo]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of great cricketers, including [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] and [[Richie Richardson]], began their first-class careers there.

One of Antigua's most famous sons, [[Viv Richards]], scored the fastest [[test match cricket|Test match]] century off 56 balls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

v [[England cricket team|England]] in the ''"[[Blackwash]]"'' series of 1986 at the Recreation Ground. It was also where [[Brian Lara]] twice set the record for highest individual Test innings, scoring 375 in 1994 and the current record of 400 not out in 2004, both times against England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In May 2003 the West Indies completed the highest ever successful run chase in Test Cricket at the ARG, making 418/7 against Australia in their fourth innings to win by 3 wickets. 

Antigua is considered to be a good wicket on which to bat — hard and dry whilst not offering much bounce or movement to bowlers. This is colloquially known as a [[List of cricket terms#F|"featherbed"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After the building of the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]] for the 2007 World Cup, no further Test cricket was expected at the Recreation Ground.  However, due to the abandonment of the Second Test between West Indies v England on 13 February 2009 after just ten balls (due to an unfit outfield), an extra Test, called the Third Test, began at the Antigua Recreation Ground on 15 February 2009, despite concerns about the dilapidated condition of the stadium.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7886840.stm]

Like many other cricket grounds in the Caribbean, the Antigua Recreation Ground traditionally hosts a variety of off the field entertainment, particularly music, both live and recorded, during breaks in play. For many years, an entertainer called ''[[Gravy (entertainer)|Gravy]]'' would operate in the stands, usually in [[fancy dress]].

'''''Assassin's Creed III''''' is a 2012 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii U]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the fifth major installment in the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, and a direct sequel to 2011's ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release following in November 2012. A remastered version will be released for [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-3-remaster-launches-on-xbox-one-ps/1100-6461751/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered Is Finally On Its Way |first=Jordan |last=Ramée |date=17 September 2018 |access-date=26 September 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot is set in a [[historical fiction|fictional history]] of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the [[American Revolution]] from 1754 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] ancestor, [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Ratonhnhaké:ton|Ratonhnhaké:ton]], also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control in the colonies.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil Next]], for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertz |first=Matt |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/03/28/ac-iii-the-redesigned-anvil-engine.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed III: The Redesigned Anvil Engine |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |date=March 28, 2012 |access-date=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised it for its gameplay, narrative, diverse cast of characters, visuals and grand, ambitious scale, while criticism was directed at the unevenly developed gameplay mechanics and the glitches within the game. It was a massive commercial success, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. Its sequel, ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', was released in October 2013, and follows Ratonhnhaké:ton's grandfather&amp;nbsp;– [[Edward Kenway]]&amp;nbsp;– a pirate and Assassin operating in the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/28/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-hoists-new-hero/ |title=Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag hoists new hero onto PS3, 360, Wii U, PC |last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |date=February 28, 2013 |access-date=February 28, 2013 |work=[[Joystiq]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411051209/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/28/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-hoists-new-hero/ |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |publisher=[[AOL Inc.]] |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Assassin's_Creed#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the Assassin's Creed series}}
[[image:Assassins-creed-iii-screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Assassin's Creed III'' features new gameplay elements such as hunting and dual wielding of weaponry. Here the protagonist Connor uses two weapons, a tomahawk and a flintlock pistol, against a group of [[Red coat (British army)|redcoat]]s.]]
''Assassin's Creed III'' is a third-person action-adventure title set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and combat to complete various missions. The player takes the role of three characters during the course of the game. The main character is Desmond Miles, a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on [[2012 phenomenon|December 21, 2012]]. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar who seeks the location of the Vault. The second, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhaké:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier (which is 1.5 times bigger than [[Rome]] in ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''), the cities of [[Boston]] and [[New York City]]. Portions of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] can be explored via the flagship of the Assassins' navy, the ''Aquila'', captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.

[[Free running]] has been simplified to allow for more fluid [[parkour]] in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Close combat has been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take down multiple opponents at once and players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which include muskets, swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow and arrow, a rope dart (used to pull foes or hang them, while on a tree) as well as the Hidden Blades. In addition, the left Hidden Blade has a folding mechanism for blocking attacks, skinning an animal, and performing high-profile assassinations. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.

''Assassin's Creed III'' features new weather simulations such as [[snow]], [[fog]], and [[rain]]. The seasons can also change i.e., Summer and Winter, which not only affect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower in deep snow. Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies, aiding stealth. Unlike the past games, this one includes animals varying from domestic (horses, cows, dogs) to wild (deer, wolves, bears). The wild ones are found in the Frontier, and can be hunted for meat or marrow in order to be sold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to hunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also be used.

Economy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's adoptive home. The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors etc. suffering from displacement due to the war. Helping and interacting with these [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. From there on, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the goods to the cities via caravan. The player can also help them build relationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a small village. The player can also upgrade the Homestead manor as well as Connor's ship, the Aquila.

A revamped version of ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''{{'}}s recruitment feature returns as players can enlist citizens to the Assassins' cause by completing "Liberation" missions. They also have a much larger skill set, which allows them to start a riot, provide a covert escort, act as a personal bodyguard etc. Other side missions include collecting Almanac pages, exploring underground tunnels to locate fast-travel stations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating frontiersman rumors about [[UFO]]s and [[Sasquatch]], "peg-leg" missions in which Connor goes to underground forts and wastelands to uncover the legend of [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]]'s treasure, and others.

''Assassin's Creed III'' also features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the ''Aquila'', the player can navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storms, high waves, and rocks. Engagements are by cannon, with [[broadside]]s covering both flanks of the ship, [[swivel gun]]s that can be used to damage smaller ships which can also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from the broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable them. The ''Aquila'' is used in the side missions known as "[[Privateer]] missions" and is also used in some of the main missions.

The [[Wii U]] version of the game has extra features. The player has the ability to change weapons on the go and the map is always visible on the [[Wii U Gamepad]]. The Wii U version also supports [[Off TV Play]]. With this feature enabled, the main screen is redirected to the Wii U Gamepad.

Online multiplayer returns in this installment by Ubisoft Annecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/03/19/ubisoft-annecy-on-assassins-creed-iii-multiplayer/ |title=Ubisoft Annecy working on Assassin's Creed III Multiplayer| publisher=[[VG247]] | date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with returning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named Wolfpack, in which 1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through a sequence of 25 stages. It also features Domination, a team mode where players will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from the opposing team.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
Following the events of ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations'', the game explores the life of an 18th-century assassin in [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]] during the [[American Revolution]]; a half-English, half-[[Mohawk Nation|Mohawk]] man named Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Stace|title=Connor goes loud: Assassin's Creed III gets first showing|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/03/26/connor-goes-loud-assassins-creed-iii-gets-first-showing/|work=[[VG247]]|accessdate=June 19, 2012|date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose father is Grand Master of the Templar Order in the colonies. Connor is caught up in the Assassins' conflict with the Templar order when his Native American village is attacked by the Templars, who intend to seize control of the newly forming country.

Other characters include Minerva ([[Margaret Easley]]) and Juno (Nadia Verrucci), members of Those Who Came Before; and the Grand Master of the 18th century Templar Order in England, Reginald Birch ([[Gideon Emery]]).

===Plot===
Immediately after the events of [[Assassin's Creed: Revelations|the previous game]], Desmond Miles, his father William, with allies Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings find the Temple of the First Civilization in a cave in [[New York (state)|New York]] and access it using their Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact of immense power. After partially activating the temple, Juno uses it to communicate with Desmond. Desmond is placed in the Animus where Juno's influence causes him to experience the life of his ancestor Haytham Kenway in 1754 century England.

Haytham assassinates a patron at the [[Royal Opera House]] and steals a medallion; the Key to the Temple's inner chamber. Haytham is dispatched to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] to locate the Temple. While in Boston, he kills a slave trader, freeing a group of Mohawks including a woman named Kaniehti:io, who asks Haytham to refer to her as Ziio after he proves unable to pronounce her full name. She helps Haytham find the Temple in exchange for him killing [[Edward Braddock|General Braddock]]. Haytham and Ziio find that the Key is not able to open the temple itself. The pair develop a romantic relationship during their time together, which results in a son, Ratonhnhaké:ton. Haytham is then seen inducting a new member, [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] into the Order, only for it to be shown to actually be the Templar Order instead of the Assassins.

The perspective then shifts to Ratonhnhaké:ton's childhood in 1760. His mother dies during an attack on his village which Ratonhnhaké:ton believes was led by the Templar [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. Years later, the village Elder informs a teenage Ratonhnhaké:ton that their tribe's duty is to prevent the Temple's discovery. The Elder gives him a transparent Sphere which allows Juno to communicate with him; she tells him of his importance and shows him the Assassins' symbol. The symbol leads him to the retired Assassin Achilles Davenport, who reluctantly begins training him as an assassin.

Achilles suggests Ratonhnhaké:ton rename himself "Connor" to enable him to move more freely throughout the Colonies, in fear that some colonists might reject him as a tribe member. While seeking supplies in Boston, Connor is framed by the Templars for instigating the [[Boston Massacre]]. Over the following years, Connor kills several Templars, and aids in the Revolutionary War between the Patriots and the British. Connor meets with his father, and the two forge a temporary alliance to eliminate a rogue Templar. Later, Haytham uncovers a letter detailing [[George Washington]]'s plan to remove the Indigenous population, including Connor's tribe, from the frontier to prevent them supporting [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|the Loyalists]]. Connor returns to his village and learns that Lee has recruited several Mohawk warriors to turn back the Patriots sent to eradicate them. Connor neutralizes the warriors to avoid conflict, but his childhood friend Kanen'tó:kon cannot be reasoned with and Connor is forced to kill him.

Meanwhile, Desmond is occasionally roused from the Animus to retrieve power cells from Manhattan and Brazil, necessary for activating the Temple, before the Templar Daniel Cross can take them. William goes after the final cell himself, but is captured by the Templars' modern day front, Abstergo Industries. Desmond assaults the facility, kills Cross and [[Warren Vidic]], and rescues his father.

Connor becomes conflicted about eliminating the Templars, and hopes to work with Haytham towards a common vision of peace and freedom. However, Haytham remains convinced of the chaos of freedom and the necessity to control the nation by replacing Washington with Lee. Lee is disgraced by Washington for attempting to sabotage the outcome of the [[Battle of Monmouth]] and takes refuge in the heavily fortified [[Fort George, New York|Fort George]]. Connor infiltrates the fort and is confronted by Haytham; they duel, and Connor kills him. Connor later kills Lee and recovers the Key. With the Colonial Templars eliminated, Connor returns to his village only to find it empty, and the Sphere left behind. Using it, Juno instructs him to conceal the Key where it cannot be found; Connor buries the Key in the grave of Achilles' son, Connor Davenport.

In 2012, Desmond retrieves the Key and accesses the Temple's inner chambers. Juno informs him that activating the pedestal will save the world, but at the cost of his life. Minerva appears before them, opposing the plan as it will free Juno, who was sealed away in the temple to prevent her conquering humanity. Juno and Minerva explain that if the [[solar flare]] occurs, Desmond will be one of the few survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. After Desmond's later death, he will become revered as a god, whose well-intended legacy will be manipulated to control future generations, restarting the cycle. Desmond chooses to sacrifice himself in order to save humanity and give them the opportunity to fight Juno rather than be destroyed. William, Shaun, and Rebecca leave the temple as Desmond activates the pedestal; a global aurora protects the planet from the solar eruption. Juno commends Desmond's choice and declares that it is time for her part to begin.

In an epilogue, Connor takes down the Templar portraits in the Davenport Manor's basement and burns them, signifying the end of his journey. In addition, his return to his village is detailed further, showing he spoke to a hunter there, who revealed that the land had been sold to settlers in order to settle the new United States government's war debts. Connor also travels to the pier in New York, where he witnesses the last of the British Regulars leave America for good. However, he also sees evidence of the slave trade present in the newly formed nation, right next to the pier of citizens cheering at the departure of the British, learning that not all people have been freed.

Following this, a modern-day voiceover can be heard directing the player to locate a number of 'pivot points' that have been spread out across the memories' graphical representation of Colonial America. Once collected, the voiceover returns to congratulate, and informs that they have now connected to the [[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|cloud]].

==Development==

===Origins===

Work on ''Assassin's Creed III'' began in January 2010 (almost immediately after the release of ''Assassin's Creed II'') by a senior team of Ubisoft developers.&lt;ref name="gi1"/&gt; The title was in development for two and a half years and had the longest development cycle since the first ''Assassin's Creed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1326914/assassins_creed_3_why_starting_from_scratch_has_been_worth_it_interview.html |title=Assassin's Creed 3: Why Starting From Scratch Has Been Worth It&amp;nbsp;– Interview (Feature) |publisher=NowGamer |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com/5896386/50-things-about-assassins-creed-iii-that-you-should-know |title=50 Things About Assassin's Creed III That You Should Know |publisher=Kotaku |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ubisoft first revealed ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' in 2010, as new details came to light, there was some confusion within the gaming community as to whether this would be ''Assassin's Creed III''. According to the developers, ''Brotherhood'' was not ''Assassin's Creed III'', and the third installment would not star a "pre-existing character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps3blog.net/2010/07/08/assassins-creed-brotherhood-is-not-assassins-creed-3|title=Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is not Assassin's Creed 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/14389-ubisoft-brotherhood-is-not-assassins-creed-25/|title=Ubisoft: Brotherhood is not Assassin's Creed 2.5&amp;nbsp;– Neoseeker News Article |publisher=Neoseeker.com |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft Montreal's developers stated in their interviews that ''Assassin's Creed III'' would be released eventually.

Jean-François Boivin of Ubisoft also stated that each numbered title in the series will introduce a new lead character and a new setting.&lt;ref name="ac3-gamerzine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/news/assassins-creed-3-details.html|title=Ubisoft reveals first ever details on Assassin's Creed 3|publisher=Gamerzines.com|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822001845/http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/news/assassins-creed-3-details.html|archivedate=August 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrice Désilets, former series' creative director, said that the series has always been planned as a trilogy. He also commented on the story of ''Assassin's Creed III'', saying that it would focus on Assassins' quest to prevent the end of the world in 2012, and their race against time to find temples and Apples of Eden built by "Those Who Came Before". Desmond would be searching for clues as to the locations of these temples, by exploring memories of one (or more) of his other ancestors.&lt;ref name="ac-vgb-ultimate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/06/10/assassins-creed-3-will-see-desmond-become-the-ultimate-assassin.htm|title= Assassins Creed 3 will see Desmond Miles become the Ultimate Assassin |publisher=Video Games Blogger|date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 Alexandre Amacio, creative director of ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'', announced that the next installment of the franchise was to be released before December 2012, however, Amacio himself would not be directing the game.&lt;ref name="amancioquit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingunion.net/news/assassins-creed-revelations-creative-director-quits-ubisoft--7488.html|title=Assassin's Creed: Revelations Creative Director Quits Ubisoft|publisher=GamingUnion.net|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate = January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes from the idea that Desmond Miles, the modern day protagonist of the series, was to finish his tale by December 2012. Amacio said that gamers should not have to play a futuristic game after the time period in which it is set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pereira|first=Chris|title=Expect a Larger Gap Between Future Assassin's Creed Releases|url=http://www.1up.com/news/expect-larger-gap-between-assassins-creed-games|publisher=[[1UP.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-announcement===
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed during an earnings call on November 8, 2011, that a new "major" ''Assassin's Creed'' game would be released in 2012. Guillemot refused to go into any further detail on the title beyond its confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Mike|title=New Assassin's Creed in 2012, confirms Ubi|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/325502/new-assassins-creed-in-2012-confirms-ubi/|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to MCV, Guillemot dismissed the notion that annual ''Assassin's Creed'' installments are diluting the brands, stating instead that they're necessary to "satisfy the demand". Guillemot also claimed in the same interview that this year's ''Assassin's Creed'' will be the series' "biggest to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/333495/assassins-creed-3-will-be-series-biggest-yet-ubisoft/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 will be series' 'biggest yet'&amp;nbsp;– Ubisoft |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Ubisoft officially confirmed the existence of ''Assassin's Creed III'', and its North American release date of October 30, 2012.&lt;ref name="AC3-conf"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=Jim|title=Assassin's Creed III Coming In October|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/02/15/assassin-39-s-creed-3-release-date.aspx |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillemot described ''Assassin's Creed III'' as "the true next generation of both the ''Assassin's Creed'' brand and interactive entertainment/storytelling in general. We will push the title a lot because it's a fantastic product that the team has been working on for three years. What we have seen is just fabulous."&lt;ref name="AC3-conf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC3-confirmed"/&gt; Guillemot went on to say the publisher's investing more heavily in the game than in any other title in the series.&lt;ref name="AC3-confirmed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivan |first=Tom |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/336082/assassins-creed-3-release-date-october-30/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 release confirmed for October |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal leaks====
[[image:AC3 canoe - a lost feature.jpeg|thumb|right|An early screenshot of ''Assassin's Creed III'' showed Connor paddling a canoe. However, the feature was removed from the final version.]]
Reports that ''Assassin's Creed III'' would take place during the American Revolution surfaced following a supposed "inside source" at Ubisoft, who made such a claim in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Andy|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/333754/assassins-creed-3-heads-to-american-revolution-rumour/?cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=CVG-General-RSS |title=Assassin's Creed 3 heads to American Revolution&amp;nbsp;– Rumour |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 29, 2012, an upcoming promotional image of the game was sent to [[Kotaku]] by a [[Best Buy]] employee, along with information from the retailer that a full reveal was imminent.&lt;ref name="EG-leak"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-01-assassins-creed-3-set-in-american-revolution-report |title=Assassin's Creed 3 set in American Revolution&amp;nbsp;– report |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked promotional image led to a general consensus that the game was set in North America during the American Revolution, and at least in part, a snowy setting.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Around the same time, Ubisoft mentioned "a major announcement from Assassin's Creed" was "only days away" via the series' official Facebook. The page's cover photo also depicted a snowy and bleak setting.&lt;ref name="EG-leak"/&gt; Furthermore, ''[[Game Informer]]'' appeared ready to confirm the fresh details via an advertising banner posted on its site. Images showed the new assassin standing next to American revolutionary leader [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="EG-leak"/&gt;

Following the reports, Ubisoft released ''Assassin's Creed III''{{'}}s official box art on March 1, 2012, which confirmed the game's American Revolution setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150594293448068.391304.6119163067&amp;type=3|title=Assassin's Creed III Packshots|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=[[Ubisoft]] on [[Facebook]]|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company said it will announce "all the details" at 5pm on March 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-01-official-assassins-creed-3-box-art-confirms-american-revolution-setting |title=Official Assassin's Creed 3 box art confirms American Revolution setting |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ''Game Informer'' revealed its latest cover feature, which included more artwork of the game's new main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/338061/assassins-creed-3-is-official-set-in-america-first-images/|title=Assassin's Creed 3 is official, set in America&amp;nbsp;– First images|last=Robinson|first=Andy|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, several screenshots were leaked ahead of Ubisoft's official reveal, and the first gameplay details emerged via ''Game Informer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivan |first=Tom |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/338285/first-assassins-creed-3-screenshots-appear-online/ |title=News: First Assassin's Creed 3 screenshots appear online |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-announcement===
''Assassin's Creed III'' was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5, 2012. Ubisoft described the game as the "most ambitious" project in the company's history, with twice the production capacity of any previous title from the publisher. The game's engine, AnvilNext, delivers improved visuals, character models and AI, allowing for battlefields full of fighters.&lt;ref name=unveiling/&gt; Ubisoft later said it's aiming to make ''Assassin's Creed III'' "look next-gen" on current-gen consoles using the new AnvilNext engine.&lt;ref name="robinson1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Andy |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/338581/assassins-creed-3-aiming-to-look-next-gen-on-360-ps3-ubisoft/ |title=News: Assassin's Creed 3 'aiming to look next-gen' on 360, PS3&amp;nbsp;– Ubisoft |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft said that when Rockstar's ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' released midway through ''Assassin's Creed III''{{'}}s development, it was surprised to see Rockstar had included wild animal hunting and a giant frontier to explore—features both planned for its own sequel. Lead writer Corey May said Ubisoft's now looking at ''Red Dead''{{'}}s success and trying to take the formula in "new directions". Similarities between these two games are down to "a convergence of minds", said ''Assassin's Creed III'' writer Matt Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Andy |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/341576/assassins-creed-3-team-looking-at-red-dead-redemption-success/ |title=News: Assassin's Creed 3 team 'looking at Red Dead Redemption success' |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Director [[Alex Hutchinson (video game director)|Alex Hutchinson]] said Ubisoft steered clear of making the ''Assassin's Creed III'' protagonist a female character because the game's setting is not a strong match. Hutchinson said while many people wanted to see female assassins in the series, the American Revolution setting makes it difficult this time round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PDT |url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-female-hero-would-be-a-pain-says-developer-6368577 |title=Assassin's Creed III female hero would be a 'pain,' says developer&amp;nbsp;— GameSpot.com |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330210429/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-female-hero-would-be-a-pain-says-developer-6368577 |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft recommends the PC version of the game to be played with a controller even though it will still support keyboard and mouse setup. Ubisoft Montreal's creative director Alex Hutchinson admitted: "We're definitely supporting PC, we love PC, but I think it'll be PC with a controller. I don't see us investing hugely in a mouse and keyboard setup. I think if you want to play on PC and you want to play Assassin's Creed, you have a controller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/assassins-creed-2012/1221571p1.html|title=Huge Preview: Assassin's Creed 3|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=March 26, 2012|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The score to ''Assassin's Creed III'' was composed by Scottish composer [[Lorne Balfe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scifislacker.com/scifi-music/lorne-balfes-music-for-assassins-creed-iii-released-by-ubisoft/ |title=Lorne Balfe’s Music for Assassin’s Creed III Released by Ubisoft |year=2012 |access-date=11 November 2018 |work=Scifi Sacker}}&lt;/ref&gt; who previously co-composed the soundtrack of ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'' with longtime ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series composer, [[Jesper Kyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelvenables/2012/11/07/lorne-balfe-assassins-creed-iii/#62cc41e654c7 |title=Lorne Balfe: Musical Master of Assassin's Creed 3 |first=Michael |last=Venables |date=7 November 2012 |access-date=11 November 2018 |magazine=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's soundtrack is the first soundtrack of the series' main games to not feature Jesper Kyd.

Ubisoft's senior vice president of sales and marketing, Tony Key, said the game would enjoy the biggest marketing commitment in company history.&lt;ref name="AC3-preorder"/&gt; Ubisoft UK MD Rob Cooper has said that ''Assassin's Creed III'' is a good entry point for newcomers to the series, and that he thinks ''Assassin's Creed III'' will hold its own against this year's biggest releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CVG Staff |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/339238/assassins-creed-3-a-great-time-for-gamers-to-join-the-adventure/ |title=News: Assassin's Creed 3 'a great time for gamers to join the adventure' |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the ''Assassin's Creed: Double Pack'' was released both as a retail purchase for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and for download on [[PlayStation Network|PSN]], which brings together the first ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' in a virtual compilation box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playstationedge.com/ps3/more-details-revealed-for-the-ubisoft-double-packs-on-ps3-xbox-360/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713061219/http://playstationedge.com/ps3/more-details-revealed-for-the-ubisoft-double-packs-on-ps3-xbox-360/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |title=More Details Revealed For The Ubisoft Double Packs on PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 |publisher=PlayStation Edge |date=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-21-assassins-creed-double-edition-rayman-3-hd-on-eu-playstation-store |title=Assassin's Creed Double Edition on EU PlayStation Store |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft has collaborated with several retail outlets on pre-order bonuses available through several store chains throughout the world.

Dutch site Entertainment Business reported that thieves made off with a truck on November 14, 2012, in transporting the entire launch shipment of ''Assassin's Creed III'' on PC for Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Ubisoft stated that it won't affect launch as copies will be sourced elsewhere. Those who pre-ordered the ''Join or Die'' edition, however, were affected as allegedly this cannot be re-manufactured. Ubisoft also passed on serial numbers and barcodes to retailers of the stolen games, and placed the same numbers on a blacklist preventing them from receiving online authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caruana |first=Christine |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/379989/assassins-creed-3-pc-shipment-stolen/ |title=PC News: Assassin's Creed 3 PC shipment stolen |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/11/22/assassins-creed-3-benelux-pc-shipment-half-inched-report/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 Benelux PC shipment half-inched&amp;nbsp;– report |publisher=[[VG247]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of pro-American and anti-British prejudice===
In June 2012 Ubisoft and in particular its French-Canadian subsidiary [[Ubisoft Montreal]] had to fend off increasing accusations of [[anti-British sentiment|anti-British]] prejudice after trailers and box art depicting the killing of British [[Red coat (British army)|Redcoats]] started to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-06-12-assassins-creed-iii-devs-have-nothing-against-the-british|title=Assassin's Creed III devs have "nothing against" the British|last=Williams|first=Mike|publisher=Games Industry|date=June 12, 2012|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One site described the 'July 4' live-action trailer as "American [[nationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/07/04/watch-the-terrible-4th-of-july-assassins-creed-iii-live-action-trailer/|title=Watch The Terrible 4th Of July 'Assassin's Creed III' Live-Action Trailer|last=Kain|first=Eric|date=July 4, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2015 |publisher=''[[Forbes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead script writer Corey May defended the developers and publisher [[Ubisoft]] from allegations of bigotry and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/350667/assassins-creed-3-dev-promises-weve-got-nothing-against-the-british/|title=Assassin's Creed 3 dev promises: 'We've got nothing against the British'; Lead writer explains Redcoat blood-fest|last=Harlup|first=Andy|publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |date=June 12, 2012|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy, however, continued because marketing materials continued to depict only the British as the enemy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-3-anti-british-bias-brian-154567/|title='Assassin's Creed 3′ Writer Denies British Hate|last=Sipple|first=Brian|date=June 12, 2012|accessdate=October 26, 2012 |publisher=Games Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number of gaming news outlets noting US trailers cutting scenes that did seem to depict the protagonist killing Patriots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/10/05/how-the-uk-trailer-for-assassins-creed-iii-tops-the-us-version/|title=UK Trailer for Assassin's Creed III Is More Historically Accurate Than the US Version|last=Pinchefsky|first=Carol|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=October 5, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5949062/heres-the-stuff-from-the-new-assassins-creed-iii-trailer-that-ubisoft-doesnt-want-americans-to-see|title=Here's the Stuff from the New Assassin's Creed III Trailer That Ubisoft Doesn't Want Americans to See|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 5, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/products/assassin-s-creed-iii/news/ubisoft-censors-american-deaths-in-latest-assassin-s-creed-3-trailer|title=Ubisoft censors American deaths in latest Assassin's Creed 3 trailer|last=Liebl|first=Matt|publisher=GameZone|date=October 5, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher eventually decided that the Limited Edition of the game wouldn't be sold in the UK or Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118227-Assassins-Creed-III-Limited-Edition-for-Americans-Only|title=Assassin's Creed III Limited Edition for Americans Only|last=Lemon|first=Marshall|publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''|date=July 3, 2012|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However upon the game's release, critics said their depiction was balanced and fair. ''[[Official Xbox Magazine|Official Xbox Magazine UK]]'' felt that "the strongest aspect of ACIII is the more mature moral tone&amp;nbsp;– there's none of the anticipated 'yay, America'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/47178/reviews/assassins-creed-3-review/?page=2|title=Assassin's Creed OXM UK Review|last=Blyth|first=Jon|publisher=''[[Official Xbox Magazine|Official Xbox Magazine UK]]''|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another review by [[Kotaku]], the reviewer notes "publishers from big video game companies are not known for subtlety or complexity of theme", going on to say "the marketing always suggested that Assassin's Creed III's igniting of the Revolution would be a game of interactive jingoism; its developers always said it was not. The developers were the ones being accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/10/assassins-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review/|title=Assassin's Creed III: The Kotaku Review|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beefjack.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-all-the-targets-are-british-except-theyre-not/|title=They're all British, but they're not|publisher=Beef Jack|accessdate=November 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114045927/http://beefjack.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-all-the-targets-are-british-except-theyre-not/|archive-date=November 14, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail editions===
On March 26, 2012, Ubisoft announced three collectors' editions of ''Assassin's Creed III'', The ''Freedom'', ''Join Or Die'' and ''Special'' editions, exclusive to [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] countries and Australia. On June 1, 2012, Ubisoft also announced another collectors' edition of ''Assassin's Creed III'', the ''UbiWorkshop'' Edition. Ubisoft and Sony partnered to offer the game as a bundle with the [[PlayStation 3]] console, which was offered from the day of the game's release.&lt;ref name="Joystiq bundle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert |first=Ben |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/04/assassins-creed-3-getting-its-own-ps3-hardware-bundle-comes-wi/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 getting its own PS3 hardware bundle, comes with 'special DLC' |publisher=Joystiq |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its release, ''Assassin's Creed III'' on the PlayStation 3 received four exclusive single-player missions, titled ''The Benedict Arnold Missions''. The gameplay revolves around [[Benedict Arnold]] and his connections with turning West Point over to the British. Script writer Matt Turner stated that the Benedict Arnold missions were some of the most historically accurate missions in the game, as "some scenes have the actual words spoken by key players in the events at West Point, according to the records from the court proceedings following what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/10/23/assassins-creed-iii-expose-benedict-arnold-exclusively-on-ps3/|title=Assassin's Creed III: Expose Benedict Arnold Exclusively on PS3|last=Shuman|first=Sid|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tyranny of King Washington''===
On October 3, 2012 Ubisoft revealed the first portion of DLC for the game, called ''The Tyranny of King Washington.'' The story revolves around an alternative history "The United Kingdom of America", wherein George Washington has seized an Apple of Eden, becomes corrupted by its power, and dubs himself King. The player is tasked with overthrowing the dictator. The single-player campaign is separated into 3 episodic installments.&lt;ref name="King Washington/Season Pass"/&gt; In the DLC, Ratonhnhaké:ton gains new abilities: the "Power of the Bear" for strength, the "Power of the Eagle" for speed, the "Power of the Wolf" for stealth, "Warpaint" to enhance the abilities, and "Alpha of the Pack", giving the ability to call wolves to help in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/ac3/en-US/news/news_detail.aspx?c=tcm:19-82239&amp;ct=tcm:6-231-32|title=Meet the Tyranny of King Washington's Ratonhnhaké:ton|publisher=Ubisoft.com|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2013, the first episode of the DLC was announced, titled "''The Infamy''". Set in 1783, Ratonhnhaké:ton awakens from what appears to be an alternative reality where the events of the main game involving him have never happened. He is tasked to find George Washington, corrupted heavily by the Apple of Eden. Washington has crowned himself King and begun to enslave and massacre the Frontier's population.

''Assassin's Creed III'' received positive reviews, with critics praising the visuals, narrative, combat style, hunting mechanics, naval missions and Homestead system, while complaining about the game's glitches and some of the missions' prescriptive layouts. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version 85.56% and 85/100,&lt;ref name="GRPS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 84.92% and 84/100,&lt;ref name="GRX360" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCX360" /&gt; the Wii U version 83.00% and 85/100,&lt;ref name="GRWIIU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCWIIU" /&gt; and the PC version 80.75% and 80/100.&lt;ref name="GRPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;

Daniel Bischoff of [[GameRevolution]] gave it 5/5 stars, saying "Combining the best of the franchise so far, ASSASSIN'S CREED III doesn't disappoint long-time fans who've been with the series while also making it easy enough to jump in for the kill."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/57743-assassins-creed-iii-review&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave the game a score of 8.5/10, saying "It achieves so much that you can't help but respect it, no other open world game has ever given us a setting that's as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this". They did however say "Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions' unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create".&lt;ref name="AC3 IGN"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/30/assassins-creed-iii-review | title = Assassin's Creed III Review | accessdate = October 30, 2012 | publisher = IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] gave a similar review, stating "It takes chances with its opening, with its story, and with its characters. It expands the series' gameplay in enjoyable and sensible ways. As with many ambitious games, not every arrow fired hits the bull's eye, yet this big, narratively rich sequel is easy to get invested in" and gave a score of 8.5/10.&lt;ref name="AC3 GSpot"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/assassins-creed-iii/reviews/assassins-creed-iii-review-6399036/ | title = Assassin's Creed III (Xbox 360) Review | accessdate = October 30, 2012 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' awarded the game 9.5/10, saying "''Assassin's Creed III'' delivers everything the series has promised, and throws in a little more for good measure ... Most players will likely spend the first six hours of ''Assassin's Creed III'' wrapping their heads around the profound size and ambition of the game".&lt;ref name="AC3 GI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iii/b/xbox360/archive/2012/10/30/assassin-39-s-creed-iii-review-staggering-scope-and-breadth.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed III Staggering Scope And Breadth|last=Miller|first=Matt|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012 |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] felt that "''Assassins Creed III'' [was] not perfect ... But there is so much story, so much multiplayer, and so much stuff to do that your average 10 hour game should be terribly ashamed of itself".&lt;ref name="AC3 G4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb |first=Morgan |url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/65904/assassins-creed-3/review/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3 Review for Xbox 360 |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] |date= |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' gave it 8.5/10, and said "[Its] newly refined gameplay and incredibly rich setting are captivating stuff ... It improves on the underlying ''Assassin's Creed'' formula in a handful of subtle but tangible ways ... And its unwavering commitment to storytelling is both rare and impressive". They did however criticize, "Pacing problems which can drag the campaign into busy-work tedium".&lt;ref name="AC3 OXM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxmonline.com/assassins-creed-iii-review?page=0,1|title=Assassin's Creed 3 Review|publisher=''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' was more critical, giving the game a 72/100 and stating that ''Assassin's Creed III'' had "Entertaining storytelling and fantastic naval combat marred by terrible mission design and endemic feature creep"&lt;ref name="PCGAMER"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/assassins-creed-3-review/ |title= Assassin's Creed III Review |accessdate = December 4, 2012 |publisher = ''[[PC Gamer]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer felt that homesteading detracted from the central theme and story, and narrowly scripted optional objectives punished players for thinking laterally. "It's about pattern recognition rather than creative thought, binary reactions with no room for life or dynamism."

In December 2015, ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked the game as the ninth best game in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/12/13/ranking-the-entire-assassin-s-creed-series.aspx|title=Ranking The Entire Assassin's Creed Series|last=Juba|first=Joe|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2012, Ubisoft stated that in the three weeks since the game's pre-order campaign began, numbers had already surpassed the total U.S. pre-order numbers of ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' and exceeded 10 times more than the pre-orders ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'' attracted in a comparable time frame.&lt;ref name="AC3-preorder"&gt;{{cite web |author=PDT |url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-setting-ubisoft-preorder-records-6368828 |title=Assassin's Creed III setting Ubisoft preorder records&amp;nbsp;— GameSpot.com |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234257/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-setting-ubisoft-preorder-records-6368828 |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2012, Ubisoft announced that the game is the most pre-ordered game in the company's history, more than doubling pre-orders for ''Revelations'', the previous record holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/25/assassins-creed-iii-pre-orders-break-ubisoft-record?abthid=50896fcbf6090bd57d000033|title=Assassin's Creed III Pre-Orders Break Ubisoft Record|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2012 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Assassin's Creed III'' was the bestselling game in the United Kingdom in the week of its release, with the best sales of the series to date. It was the biggest launch in publisher Ubisoft's history and the third biggest launch of any game in the UK in 2012 (behind ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'' and ''[[FIFA 13]]''). It doubled the launch week sales of ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', and beat 2011's ''Revelations'' by over 117,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-05-uk-charts-assassins-creed-3-top-second-biggest-launch-of-the-year |title=UK chart: Assassin's Creed 3 top, second biggest launch of the year |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=November 5, 2012 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2222373/assassin-s-creed-3-making-a-killing-in-the-uk-games-charts|title=AC3 Sales|publisher=The Inquirer|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ubisoft, ''Assassin's Creed III'' sold over 3.5 million units in its first week, which represents a 100 percent year-over-year increase from ''Revelations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-06-assassins-creed-3-sales-estimated-at-over-3-5-million-units |title=Assassin's Creed 3 sales estimated at over 3.5 million units |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=November 6, 2012 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2012, Ubisoft announced that the game had sold 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/12/assassins-creed-iii-sales-pass-7-million |title=Assassin's Creed III Sales Pass 7 Million |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, ''Assassin's Creed III'' was the 3rd bestselling title of 2012, after being on sale for 2 months.&lt;ref name="UKSales"&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Ding |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-dominates-uk-2012-charts/0108868 |title=Revealed: The UK's Top 20 bestselling games of 2012 |publisher=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]] |date=January 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DQlfVlEG?url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-dominates-uk-2012-charts/0108868 |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NPD Group]], the game was the 4th bestselling game of 2012 in North America.&lt;ref name="Salesof2012"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jordan |last=Mallory |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/01/10/december-npd-2012-sales-hit-13-26-billion-black-ops-2-leads-t/ |title=December NPD: 2012 sales hit $13.26 billion, Black Ops 2 leads the pack |publisher=AOL |work=Joystiq |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Da2gjZ6A?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/01/10/december-npd-2012-sales-hit-13-26-billion-black-ops-2-leads-t/ |archivedate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, 2013, Ubisoft announced that the game had sold 12 million copies worldwide, representing an almost 70 percent increase over ''Revelations'' at the same point of its lifecycle, and making it the best-selling game in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivan |first=Tom |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/389939/assassins-creed-3-12-million-sales-boost-ubisofts-q3/ |title=News: Assassin's Creed 3: 12 million sales boost Ubisoft's Q3 |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical issues===
On November 14, 2012, Ubisoft reassured that the PC version of ''Assassin's Creed III'' will launch with fewer bugs than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. A new patch was in the works to fix glitches on all versions. It was the second title update for the game following a large patch available day-one. The PC launch came with both of these patches included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-14-assassins-creed-3-pc-will-be-less-buggy-than-the-console-versions-at-launch |title=Assassin's Creed 3 PC "will be less buggy than the console versions" at launch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days, Ubisoft detailed the sizable patch scheduled for release across the major platforms. This extensive patch was designed to address a list of around one hundred identified bugs present within the single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes plaguing the player experience. Some of the problems outlined involve substantial environmental instability, severe NPC technical issues, occasional console crashes and various issues involving sound synchronization amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-16-huge-assassins-creed-3-patch-detailed |title=Ubisoft details huge Assassin's Creed 3 patch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=November 16, 2012 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, franchise main writer [[Corey May]] stated that the ''Assassin's Creed III'' plot leaves possible sequels "plenty of room to play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Mike|title=Assassin's Creed 3 plot leaves possible sequels 'plenty of room to play'|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/369899/assassins-creed-3-plot-leaves-possible-sequels-plenty-of-room-to-play/|publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Assassin's Creed III'' associate producer Julien Laferrière said that further ''Assassin's Creed'' games featuring new hero Connor depend on reaction to character, stating "We made three games with Ezio because people loved Ezio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tom|title=Ubisoft: Assassin's Creed 3 sequels depend on reaction to new hero Connor|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-24-assassins-creed-3-sequels-depend-on-player-reaction-to-new-hero-connor|publisher=Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, The Gaming Liberty spotted a supposed Ubisoft survey that suggested another annual installment could be set for release next year. The survey asked participants how they would feel about a return of Desmond, Connor and the American Revolution setting, and if they would purchase such a title if it were to be released next year, suggesting that Ubisoft had its eye on repeating the ''Brotherhood'' and ''Revelations'' route of the Ezio trilogy. The survey was also said to ask how participants would feel about the introduction of a co-op mode, and how they feel about Naughty Dog's ''Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception'', possibly suggesting a move to more scripted gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/381043/assassins-creed-4-survey-suggests-2013-sequel-with-co-op/|title=Assassin's Creed survey suggests 2013 sequel with co-op|first=Andy|last=Robinson|publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com|accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-29-would-you-like-co-op-in-the-next-assassins-creed|title=Would you like co-op in the next Assassin's Creed?|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2013, Ubisoft posted their first promotional picture and cover for their next ''Assassin's Creed'' game, following leaked marketing material days before.&lt;ref name="cover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5987035/assassins-creed-iv-is-all-about-pirates-according-to-this-poster|title=Assassin's Creed IV Is All About Pirates, According To This Poster|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku.com|date=February 26, 2013|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'', it serves as a sequel to ''Assassin's Creed III''{{'}}s modern story and a prequel to its ancestral storyline. The game is set in the [[Caribbean]] islands during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], and centers around Edward Kenway; the father of Haytham Kenway, and grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton, the playable characters of ''Assassin's Creed III''.

'''''Assassin's Creed III: Liberation''''' is a 2012 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Ubisoft]], initially as an exclusive title for [[PlayStation Vita]]. [[Sony]] announced the game at its press conference during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]], few days after first leaks about the game presented in ''[[Game Informer]]''.&lt;ref name="PSP-Team teases new Assassin's Creed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp-team.pl/newsy/e3-2012-wyciek%C5%82y-pierwsze-informacje-o-assassins-creed-3-liberation-dla-ps-vita-14104/ |title=E3 2012: Wyciekły pierwsze informacje o Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation dla PS Vita &amp;#124; PSP-team&amp;nbsp;— O kieszonkach Sony PS Vita i PSP |publisher=Psp-team.pl |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004135139/http://psp-team.pl/newsy/e3-2012-wyciek%C5%82y-pierwsze-informacje-o-assassins-creed-3-liberation-dla-ps-vita-14104 |archivedate=October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on October 30, 2012 alongside ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', with which it can be linked.&lt;ref name="Joystiq confirmed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mallory |first=Jordan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/04/assassins-creed-3-liberation-confirmed-for-vita-launches-octo/ |title=Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation confirmed for Vita, launches October 30 [Update!] |publisher=Joystiq |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was re-released as '''''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD''''' for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] via the [[PlayStation Network]], [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]],&lt;ref name="HD release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-10-assassins-creed-liberation-hd-confirmed-for-2014-release|title=Assssin's Ceed Liberation HD confirmed for 2014 release|last=Phillips|first=Tom|publisher=Eurogamer.net|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. It was later packed as part of "Assassin's Creed The Americas Collection" for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], along with ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''. In May 2019, the game will be re-released as a part of ''[[Assassin's Creed III|Assassin's Creed III Remastered]]'' for [[Playstation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].

The plot is set in a [[historical fiction|fictional history]] of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The game is set between 1765 and 1777, and primarily features the series' first female protagonist, [[Aveline de Grandpré]], an African-French Assassin around the end of the [[French and Indian War]], in 18th century [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name = "IGN reveal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Joystiq confirmed"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Assassin's Creed III: Liberation'' retains the "franchise's trademark open world and gameplay",&lt;ref name="IGN&amp;nbsp;— review"/&gt; while making use of the [[PlayStation Vita]]'s touchscreen and rear touch pad, cameras and gyroscope. These include Chain Kill combat, and the ability to pickpocket people.&lt;ref name="2D-X confirmed"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Torres (228 Posts) |url=http://www.2d-x.com/assassins-creed-iii-liberations-head-writer-walks-me-through-a-demo/ |title=Assassin's Creed III: Liberation PS Vita |publisher=2D-X |date= |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113134334/http://www.2d-x.com/assassins-creed-iii-liberations-head-writer-walks-me-through-a-demo/ |archivedate=November 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By linking the game to ''Assassin's Creed III'', the player receives an in-game version of Connor's tomahawk, an exclusive character skin, a multiplayer character and a complete upgrade of all ammunition pouches.&lt;ref name = "Joystiq confirmed"/&gt;  The game uses the same engine that runs ''Assassin's Creed III'', allowing for the same gameplay experience as a console release. Aveline also has her own new set of animations as well as have the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as the familiar swords, knives, pistols and hidden blade.&lt;ref name = "GI article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Matt|title=Assassin's Creed III Liberation: The first 10 things you need to know|journal=Game Informer|issue=231 July 2012|pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiplayer, exclusive to the original Vita version, consists of players tapping nodes on a map, using characters (represented with static portraits) to capture bases and collect supplies, among other things. This differs from the series usual competitive multiplayer which had players assassinating each other for sport.

==Plot==
In the modern day, Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of Abstergo which is in charge of producing multimedia goods, releases their first major product, ''Liberation'', a video game about the life of the Assassin [[Aveline de Grandpré]]. The game, however, is heavily censored, with any details regarding the Assassin-[[Knights Templar|Templar]] war being omitted, in an attempt to portray the Assassins as the villainous force. As the player progresses through the game, they are greeted by messages from a group of hackers known as Erudito, giving them access to the full story hidden behind Abstergo's censoring attempts.

The main portion of the game takes place in [[Louisiana]] near the end of the [[French and Indian War]], where [[Kingdom of France|France]]'s defeat caused the city of [[New Orleans]] to be taken over by the [[Spanish Empire]]. The citizens were upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]] made a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot was later uncovered by Aveline, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him.

Following this, de Ferrer made another deal with a man named Baptiste, who was hoping to defect from the Assassins to the Templar Order. Baptiste took on the identity of the recently deceased François Mackandal, as a ruse to attract followers to his cause. His plan was to poison New Orleans' nobles and take control of smuggling operations within the Louisiana [[Bayou]], although his sole purpose was actually to force Agaté, Assassin and mentor to Aveline, out of hiding in the bayou. His plot failed however, as Aveline tracked Baptiste down, killed his followers and assassinated the false Mackandal.

In 1766, the Templar [[Antonio de Ulloa]] arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left control of the area to French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport slaves to a Templar worksite in [[New Spain|Mexico]], creating a rebellion among French officials and the citizens of New Orleans.

Agaté ordered Aveline to assassinate de Ulloa to eradicate Templar presence in New Orleans. Aveline ambushed de Ulloa's carriage and confronted the governor, who told her that slaves had been taken to [[Chichen Itza|Chichén Itzá]]. However, Aveline spared his life and let Ulloa leave the city, in return for a lens used to decode Templar documents and a map leading her to the Templar worksite in Chichén Itzá. Aveline's act of mercy destroyed any trust Agaté had in his student, as she had disobeyed his explicit orders.

Aveline disguised herself as a slave bound for Mexico and made her way to the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá. Whilst there, she came across a defiant slave who mentioned that Jeanne, Aveline's mother, was stationed in Chichén Itzá. Aveline investigated thoroughly and uncovered a page from Jeanne's diary and a map that lead to an artifact located inside a cenote. Upon exploring this cave system, she came across an ancient chamber filled with ruins from the [[First Civilization]], along with a fragment of the artifact she was searching for, known as the Prophecy Disk. Aveline then encountered de Ferrer, and killed him and his men. She was reunited with her mother who, after inadvertently revealing that she and Madeleine are Templars, warns her not to let the disk fall into Agaté's hands.

Two years later, Aveline returned to New Orleans to find that a man by the name of Vázquez was using Spanish soldiers to seize control of the bayou. She suspected him to be the head Templar of Louisiana, a.k.a. the Company Man, who de Ferrer had mentioned in Chichén Itzá. After retrieving the final piece of the Prophecy Disk in Chichén Itzá, Aveline went back to New Orleans once more to begin her quest in freeing slaves in the city. Her stepmother, Madeleine de L'Isle, became aware of her work and asked her to help a slave named George escape north. Whilst escorting him through the swamp, she met with her smuggler allies Élise Lafleur and Roussillon, helping them to deliver supplies to American Patriots who were fighting in the American Revolutionary War. Vázquez attempted to stop Aveline and her allies by sending Spanish soldiers their way, but Aveline defeated them and ensured George and the supplies reached their destination. After returning to the city, Aveline attended a governor's ball under disguise and managed to get close to Vázquez and assassinate him. However, to her surprise, Vázquez revealed that he was not the Company Man. Following this, Aveline learned that her father, who had been ill for some time, had died.

In 1777, Aveline headed to the [[New York (state)|New York]] Frontier, and teamed up with the Assassin Connor to find a Templar officer who was working for the Company Man. She discovered the officer to be George, the same slave she had freed years before, and the Company Man was none other than Madeleine. After confronting her stepmother at her mansion, Aveline traveled to the bayou and met with Agaté to inform him of her discovery. Agaté was unable to accept his failure and believing that Aveline had sided with the Templars, attacked her. Aveline overpowered him and attempted to convince him to leave Louisiana for his own safety, but Agaté could not live with the humiliation and instead chose to dive to his death. On realizing this, Aveline quickly attempted to save him, but only managed to grasp his necklace which tore away from his neck.

Following her mentor's death, Aveline saw her situation as an opportunity to infiltrate the Templars and eradicate it from within. Upon returning to New Orleans, she made her way to the [[St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans)|Saint Louis Cathedral]] and gave Madeleine Agaté's necklace to show her allegiance. Following this, she was inducted into the Templar Order by her stepmother. At this point, the Abstergo version of the game ends, but a final 'Erudito' mission reveals the true, uncensored ending. After her induction, Aveline gave Madeleine the two halves of the Prophecy Disk. However, she could not make sense of the scrambled messages within. Aveline saw this as her moment to strike and reclaim the Prophecy Disk. She eliminated all the Templars inside the cathedral and assassinated Madeleine.

Now alone inside the cathedral, Aveline stepped up to the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed. She connected the locket she wore around her neck, which once belonged to her mother, to the artifact, causing it to display a holographic recording detailing a message from the time of the First Civilization. This message recounted the election of Eve as the leader of the rebellion during the Human-First Civilization War.

Initial reviews for ''Assassin's Creed III: Liberation'' were mixed to positive. [[Metacritic]], which assigns a score based on reviews from industry leaders, has the game scored at 70/100 based on 64 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="metacriticiii"/&gt;

Shaun McInnis, reviewer for [[GameSpot]], gave the game a score of 6.5/10, praising the protagonist as "...a woman born from the romance between a wealthy father and a slave mother, someone who has overcome her uncertain upbringing to find a new life in the Assassin Brotherhood". McInnis also commended the setting, writing "...a brilliant version of 18th-century New Orleans, one that beautifully reflects the diverse cultural ambience formed over years of operating as a French trading port". However, he also wrote that the game "squanders its most unique ideas...Liberation takes little advantage of its own narrative format" and that the plot is "largely aimless and hastily delivered".&lt;ref name="mcinnisiii"/&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Greg Miller stated, "The moves and kills you'd expect are here, but the story is boiled down to be easy to jump in and out of. That takes away some of the excitement in playing through it", giving it 7.2/10.&lt;ref name="IGN&amp;nbsp;— review" /&gt; In December 2015, ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked the game as the 10th best game in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/12/04/ranking-the-entire-assassin-s-creed-series.aspx|title=Ranking The Entire Assassin's Creed Series|last=Juba|first=Joe|work=Game Informer|publisher=GameStop|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B.C. II: Grog's Revenge''''' is a 1984 [[video game]] by [[Sierra On-Line]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ColecoVision]], and [[MSX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/bc-ii-grogs-revenge|title=B.C. II: Grog's Revenge for Coleco Adam (1984) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/bcs-quest-for-tires-ii-grogs-revenge/3030-12640/releases/|title=BC's Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge International Releases - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sequel to ''[[B.C.'s Quest For Tires]]'' and is based on ''[[B.C. (comic)|B.C.]]'', the newspaper [[comic strip]] by [[Johnny Hart]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls Thor, a [[caveman]], who rides a [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[unicycle]]. Thor is searching for the "[[Meaning of Life]]" within several mountains.

The player must navigate through the mountains, collecting [[clam]]s. Like the comic strip, they are used as money, in this case to pay the toll to another caveman, Peter, to access the next mountain.

There are two modes of play. The first is along the mountainside, where the user can move all four directions, but must avoid falling off the cliff, slamming into the wall, hitting a rock or a hole, or encountering the creature Grog, who will yell "GROG" and knock the player off the mountain. There is also a green dinosaur that will eat the player's "tire" on contact. The player may enter caves to enter the second mode. The caves are dark except for a beam of light emanating from the player, and clams must be collected without running into stalagmites. At the end of a mountain, there is a bridge to a new mountain. If the player has enough clams, the game continues; otherwise, it is necessary to return to find more clams.&lt;ref name="Compute Gazette"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/details/1985-09-computegazette | title= B.C.

==Reception==

'''beIN Sports''' ({{lang-ar|بي إن سبورتس العربية}}) is a group of [[Sports broadcasting|sports channels]] based in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], serving the [[Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. It is owned by [[beIN Media Group]], a subsidiary of [[Al Jazeera Media Network]]. The channels primarily broadcast in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but it also offers feeds in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]],

Formerly known as '''Al Jazeera Sport''', it was re-named beIN Sports in December 2013 to unify it with Al Jazeera's [[beIN Sports|international group of sports networks]] in the lead-up to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/television-and-radio/2013/12/31/Al-Jazeera-Sports-rebranded-beIN-SPORTS.html|title=Al Jazeera Sport rebranded beIN SPORTS|last=|first=|date=|website=Al Arabiya English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the network acquired MENA rights to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-jazeera-sport-buys-english-586038|title=Al Jazeera Sport Buys English Premier League Soccer TV Rights for Middle East|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 2017, the [[IOC]] announced a partnership with beIN Sports to launch a local linear version of [[Olympic Channel]] for MENA on 1 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/olympic-channel-announces-bein-tie-up|title=Olympic Channel announces BeIN tie-up|work=SportsProMedia|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels==
There are 11 Arabic-language sports channels in the beIN Sports group:
* beIN Sports HD ([[free-to-air]]) (focused in Arabic football competitions)

== Piracy in Saudi Arabia ==
Beginning June 2017, as part of a [[2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] over alleged funding of extremist groups by the Qatari government, beIN was banned from selling its subscriptions in Saudi Arabia, and the beIN Sports channels were briefly banned in the United Arab Emirates (the ban was reversed the following month).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stepfeed.com/saudi-arabia-is-launching-its-own-sports-tv-network-to-compete-with-bein-5435|title=Saudi Arabia is launching its own sports TV network ... to compete with beIN The network will eventually include 11 channels|author=Mariam Nabbout|accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/media/uae-qatar-media-blocked/index.html|title=Blocked in Dubai: Qatar cartoon and soccer channels|first=Zahraa|last=Alkhalisi|date=8 June 2017|agency=CNN|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/uae-restores-qatar-bein-sports-network-air-170722144955060.html|title=UAE restores Qatar's BeIN sports network on air|date=23 July 2017|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/bein-sports-back-on-tv-in-the-uae-1.613012|title=BeIN Sports back on TV in the UAE|first1=Steven|last1=McCombe|first2=Roberta|last2=Pennington|date=22 July 2017|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Saudi Arabia, a service known as beoutQ emerged soon afterwards, which [[Pirate decryption|repackages beIN Sports channels as their own]] by overlaying its own [[digital on-screen graphic]]s on the feed. The service's associated decoder boxes and subscriptions are widely available across the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/analysis/world-cup-broadcasting-pirates-saudi-arabias-bein-sport-qatar|title=World Cup pirates: Saudi Arabia’s BeIN action threatens future of international sports broadcasting|work=SportsPro|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/21/premier-league-games-screened-illegally-via-saudi-satellite-firm|title=Premier League games 'screened illegally via Saudi satellite firm'|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-21|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/premier-league-piracy-beoutq-bein-saudi-arabia-qatar-ligue-1|title=BeoutQ illegally shows opening Premier League and Ligue 1 games|work=SportsPro|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/bein-sports-qatar-beoutq.html |title=The Brazen Bootlegging of a Multibillion-Dollar Sports Network |first=Tariq |last=Panja |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it primarily rebroadcasts beIN Sports content, the channels have obtained content from other sources, such as [[Eleven Sports]] and the U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster [[Telemundo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/media/398975-nbcuniversal-says-fifa-world-cup-broadcasts-were-stolen-in-middle-east|title=NBCUniversal says FIFA World Cup broadcasts were stolen in Middle East|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channels have also broadcast anti-Qatar propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The operation, which claims to be backed by Colombian and Cuban investors, has faced international criticism from sports leagues and sanctioning bodies, due to its retransmissions of copyrighted sports content and event coverage that was licensed exclusively to beIN Sports in the [[MENA]] region. Preliminary findings by beIN traced beoutQ's feeds to [[Arabsat]] satellites (whose frequencies are frequently promoted in beoutQ's advertising), although the provider has consistently denied that it is involved in the operation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[FIFA]] attempted to indirectly negotiate a deal with beIN (as MENA rightsholder) to sub-license rights to the opening match, final, and all [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi team]] matches at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], to a Saudi Arabian broadcaster. However, no deal was reached, and beoutQ ultimately broadcast the entire tournament from various sources, including beIN and the [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation]] (who was offering Arabic-language broadcasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/06/21/why-arabs-are-watching-a-pirated-world-cup-feed|title=Why Arabs are watching a pirated World Cup feed|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/world-cup-middle-east-piracy-saudi-arabia-qatar-blockade-1202842354/|title=World Cup: Diplomatic Crisis in Middle East Stokes Fears of Piracy|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|date=2018-06-13|work=Variety|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the World Cup, beIN Sports commentators were accused by Saudi critics, including [[Turki Al-Sheikh]] (head of the [[General Sports Authority]]), of making on-air comments critical of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/media/398900-saudi-arabia-considers-legal-action-after-politicised-bein-world-cup-coverage|title=Saudi considers legal action after 'politicised' beIN Sports World Cup coverage|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2018, minister Saud al-Qahtani stated that the [[Saudi Arabian Football Federation]] had filed a complaint with FIFA against beIN Sports' monopolization of sports broadcast rights in the MENA region. He also stated that the government had been confiscating beoutQ equipment, and would "conduct inspection campaigns in coordination with all relevant bodies to prevent any attempt to broadcast any illegal content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/media/399237-saudis-dismiss-bein-sports-fifa-world-cup-tv-piracy-claim|title=Saudis dismiss beIN Sports' FIFA World Cup TV piracy claim|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Global/Issues/2018/06/18/World-Cup/FIFA-BeoutQ.aspx|title=FIFA Accuses BeoutQ Of Illegally Broadcasting Games|website=Sports Business Daily|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA, [[Ligue 1]], the [[Premier League]], and [[UEFA]], have threatened legal actions targeting beoutQ. While it encountered difficulties finding legal representatives in Saudi Arabia due to the lack of diplomatic relationships, beIN has attempted to seek legal action against beoutQ via France and the United States. In August 2018, beIN presented further evidence, in consultation with [[Cisco Systems]], [[Nagravision|Nagra]], and Overon, that the beoutQ feeds originated from Arabsat. The report came after it was revealed that beoutQ had broadcast the entire opening fixture of the [[2018–19 Premier League]], and most of the opening fixture of the [[2018–19 Ligue 1|2018–19 Ligue 1 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www2.gulf-times.com/story/603496/Premier-League-gets-tough-with-Saudi-piracy|title=Premier League gets tough with Saudi piracy|date=2018-08-21|work=Gulf-Times|access-date=2018-08-26|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/sports/qatar-saudi-arabia-beoutq-bein-sports.html|title=Qatar’s BeIN Sports Says It Has Proof of Saudi Role in Piracy Dispute|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2018, beIN Sports was fined US$2.6 million by Saudi Arabia for violations of [[competition law]], including [[Tying (commerce)|forced bundling]] of its services with other unrelated channels. beIN responded to the fine by claiming it was politically-motivated, arguing that they were being "attacked by the Saudi authorities for doing exactly what sports and entertainment broadcasters around the world do, and indeed what other broadcasters active in the Saudi market also do", and that the actions were "another illegitimate attempt by Saudi Arabia to drive beIN’s highly successful business from the country, putting politics ahead of the interests of Saudi consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bein-sports-fined-by-saudi-authorities-as-beoutq-row-escalates|title=BeIN Sports fined by Saudi authorities as BeoutQ row hots up|last=|first=|date=|work=SportsPro|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2018, beIN Sports' license to broadcast in Saudi Arabia was officially revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://advanced-television.com/2018/08/23/saudis-ban-bein-sports/|title=Saudis ban beIN Sports|last=|first=|date=|website=Advanced Television|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During legal proceedings in the United States, beIN linked the beoutQ website to Saudi businessman Raed Khusheim, who is CEO of the UAE-based television provider Selevision. Khusheim denied the claims, arguing that it was a "smear campaign" by beIN stemming from business disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-unlikely-victim-of-saudi-arabias-dispute-with-qatar-tv-rights-1536266561|title=An Unlikely Victim of Saudi Arabia’s Dispute With Qatar: TV Rights|last=Stancati|first=Margherita|date=2018-09-06|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, the [[BBC]] and [[Sky plc]] issued letters to [[European Commissioner for Trade]] [[Cecilia Malmström]] condemning beoutQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bbc-sky-beoutq-piracy-saudi-arabia|title=BBC and Sky call for EU action over BeoutQ piracy|work=SportsPro|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">A '''bit part''' is a role in which there is direct interaction with the principal [[actors]] and no more than five lines of dialogue, often referred to as a five-or-less or [[under-five]] in the United States, or '''under sixes''' in [[United Kingdom|British]] television.

A bit part is higher than that of an extra and lower than that of a [[supporting actor]]. An actor who regularly performs in bit roles, either as a [[hobby]] or to earn a living, is referred to as a '''bit player''', a term also used to describe an aspiring actor who has not yet broken into supporting or leading roles.

Unlike [[Extra (acting)|extras]], who do not typically interact with principals, actors in bit parts are sometimes listed in the [[Motion picture credits|credits]]. An exception to this practice is the [[cameo appearance]], wherein a well-known actor or other [[celebrity]] appears in a bit part; it is common for such appearances to be uncredited.

In [[MGM]]'s 1951 screen version of the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'', the role of the cook Queenie ([[Frances E. Williams]]) was reduced from a significant [[supporting role]] in the [[Stage (theatre)|stage version]] to a bit part in the film. Williams, whose appearance was not intended as a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], was not listed at all in the credits. On the other hand, [[William Warfield]], whose role as Joe, Queenie's husband, was also drastically shortened in the film from the stage original, did receive screen credit because he sang ''[[Ol' Man River]]''.

Bit parts are often significant in the story line and sometimes pivotal, as in [[Jack Albertson]]'s role as a postal worker in the 1947 [[feature film]] ''[[Miracle on 34th&amp;nbsp;Street]]''. Some characters with bit parts attract significant attention. [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] remarked that "there are no small parts, only small actors."&lt;ref name="stanislavski quote"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hooton|first1=Christopher|title=The actors consistently choosing the best movies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-actors-consistently-choosing-the-best-movies-a7210771.html|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=18 October 2016|location=London|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dabbs Greer]], a bit actor, once said, "Every [[character actor]], in their own little sphere, is the lead."&lt;ref name="dabbs greer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Valerie J.|title=Dabbs Greer, 90; busy character actor played everyman-type roles|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/01/local/me-greer1|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=18 October 2016|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cinema of Georgia''' has been noted for its [[cinematography]] in Europe. [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] director [[Federico Fellini]] was an admirer of the Georgian film: "Georgian film is a completely unique phenomenon, vivid, philosophically inspiring, very wise, childlike. There is everything that can make me cry and I ought to say that it (my crying) is not an easy thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FILMFESTIVAL: NEW GEORGIAN CINEMA at TOFIFEST Film festival in Poland (tofifest.pl)|url=http://georgien.blogspot.ca/2010/06/fil-new-georgian-cinema-at-tofifest.html|website=georgien.blogspot.ca|accessdate=30 January 2018|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Crazy Horse Saloon''' or '''Le Crazy Horse de Paris''' is a [[Paris]]ian [[cabaret]] known for its stage shows performed by nude female dancers and for the diverse range of magic and variety 'turns' between each nude show and the next. Its owners have helped to create related cabaret and [[burlesque]] shows in other cities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/christian-louboutin-brings-the-crazy-horse-cabaret-to-australia-20170717-gxcvvy.html|title=Christian Louboutin brings the Crazy Horse cabaret to Australia|last=Jinman|first=Richard|date=2017-07-19|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrelated businesses have used the phrase "Crazy Horse" in their names.

The Paris Crazy Horse occupies former wine cellars (12 in all which have been knocked together) of an impressive [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmanian]] building at 12 [[Avenue George-V]] (from the British king [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], in French "George Cinq").

[[Alain Bernardin]] opened it in 1951 and personally operated it for decades until his death by suicide in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the original waiters (their names stitched in large letters onto the backs of their waistcoats) were also substantial shareholders in the original company. The enterprise remained a family business, in the hands of Bernardin's three children, until 2005, when it changed hands. By this time the name "Le Crazy Horse de Paris" was used for the original venue and ''Crazy Horse Paris'' for one in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] (formerly ''La Femme'') at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]].

The dancers may have been deliberately chosen to be indistinguishable on stage in height and in breast size and shape in the past, but now they have a more diverse group of dancers. All in incredible shape and very skilled. Along with its dancers, the Crazy Horse has also been a popular venue for many other artists, including magicians, jugglers, and mimes. Bernardin explained that he loved magic because it corresponded with his vision: "[Magic] is a dream.  There is no show that is more dreamlike than a magic show.  And what we do with the girls is magic, too, because they aren't as beautiful as you see them onstage.  It's the magic of lights and costumes.  These are my dreams and fascinations that I put onstage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kjmagic.com/miscellaneous/magic.html "Kevin James at the New Crazy Horse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514074135/http://www.kjmagic.com/miscellaneous/magic.html |date=2006-05-14 }}, September 1992, ''[[Magic Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under new shareholders and new management from 2005, Crazy Horse started featuring famous or prestigious artists stripping for a limited number of shows, including [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Carmen Electra]], [[Paradiso Girls|Aria Cascaval]], [[Arielle Dombasle]] or [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMUlqPd_g9X1mVPch3aCpZKs2RKQ Pamela Anderson at Paris' Crazy Horse cabaret for Valentine's Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419135321/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMUlqPd_g9X1mVPch3aCpZKs2RKQ |date=2008-04-19 }} ''[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]'', Feb 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSL0177816020080201 Pamela Anderson to perform at nude revue] ''[[Reuters]]'', Feb 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They also hired [[Philippe Decouflé]] as choreographer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistikrezo.com/actualites/Divers/crazy-horse-desirs.html Découflé’s ‘Désirs’ at Crazy Horse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307015131/http://www.artistikrezo.com/actualites/Divers/crazy-horse-desirs.html |date=2010-03-07 }}, Artistik Rezo (in French). 2010-03-04.

Before the strike, which caused the cancellation of a high-profile revue for one day but generated a fantastic buzz for the cabaret, some sources mentioned a salary of €2,000 per month. Other sources said that settlement yielded a 15 percent pay raise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsmakers: May. 17-24, 2012:Clothes off, the show’s on|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/05/24/newsmakers-may-17-24-2012/|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=MacLeans (weekly newsmagazine)|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers were denied by the management of the cabaret.

The Paradiso Girls have named their album Crazy Horse after the club, as one of their members [[Paradiso Girls|Aria Cascaval]] worked there. The club is referenced in the song "[[Live with Me]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1969, and also mentioned in the 1987 [[Mötley Crüe]] song "[[Girls, Girls, Girls (Mötley Crüe song)|"Girls, Girls, Girls"]]."

== Film history ==
*In 1977, the club created and appeared in a documentary film, known as ''[[Crazy-Horse, Paris-France]]'', or ''Crazy Horse de Paris''.
*''Crazy Horse-Le Show'': a 2004 documentary in DVD format.

A '''digital video recorder''' ('''DVR''') is an [[electronic device]] that records video in a digital format to a [[disk drive]], [[USB flash drive]], SD [[memory card]], [[SSD]] or other local or networked [[mass storage]] device. The term includes [[set-top box]]es with [[direct to disk recording]], [[portable media player]]s and [[TV gateway]]s with recording capability, and digital [[camcorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USER-Digital Video Recorder Or Personal Video Recorder |url=http://en.usersdt.com/article/199.html  |publisher=ShenZhen USER Special Display Technologies, Co., Ltd |access-date=2017-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502185303/http://en.usersdt.com/article/199.html |archivedate=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal computers are often connected to [[video capture]] devices and used as DVRs; in such cases the [[application software]] used to record video is an integral part of the DVR. Many DVRs are classified as [[consumer electronic]] devices; such devices may alternatively be referred to as '''personal video recorders''' (PVRs), particularly in Canada.

== History ==

=== Hard-disk-based digital video recorders ===
[[File:Series 2 tivo back.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Back view of a [[TiVo]] Series2 5xx-generation unit]]
Consumer digital video recorders [[ReplayTV]] and [[TiVo]] were launched at the 1999 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a PVR?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-pvr.htm|access-date=2017-04-10|website=wiseGEEK – clear answers for common questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also demonstrated a unit with DVR capability, but this did not become available until the end of 1999 for full DVR features in Dish Network's DISHplayer receivers. TiVo shipped their first units on March 31, 1999. ReplayTV won the "Best of Show" award in the video category&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Jan_6/ai_53524364/ |title=ReplayTV Wins CES 1999 'Best of Show' Award |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Netscape]] co-founder [[Marc Andreessen]] as an early investor and board member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/09/business/netscape-pioneer-to-invest-in-smart-vcr.html |title=Netscape Pioneer to Invest in Smart VCR |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |first=John |last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; but TiVo was more successful commercially.

Legal action by media companies forced ReplayTV to remove many features such as automatic commercial skip and the sharing of recordings over the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/21/business/technology-replaytv-s-new-owners-drop-features-that-riled-hollywood.html?pagewanted=all |title=ReplayTV's New Owners Drop Features That Riled Hollywood |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-07-21 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |first=Eric A. |last=Taub}}&lt;/ref&gt; but newer devices have steadily regained these functions while adding complementary abilities, such as recording onto [[DVD]]s and programming and remote control facilities using PDAs, networked PCs, and Web browsers.

In contrast to [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], hard-disk based digital video recorders make "[[time shifting]]" more convenient and also allow for functions such as pausing live TV, instant replay, [[Chase Play|chasing playback]] (viewing a recording before it has been completed) and skipping over [[advertising]] during playback.

Many DVRs use the [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] format for compressing the digital video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Video Recorders What are they and where they are going?|url=http://info300.net/tzonts/Brief1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502162623/http://info300.net/tzonts/Brief1.html|accessdate =2017-04-10|archive-date=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video recording capabilities have become an essential part of the modern [[set-top box]], as TV viewers have wanted to take control of their viewing experiences. As consumers have been able to converge increasing amounts of video content on their set-tops, delivered by traditional '[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]' [[Cable TV|cable]], [[Satellite TV|satellite]] and [[Terrestrial TV|terrestrial]] as well as [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks, the ability to capture programming and view it whenever they want has become a must-have function for many consumers.

====Digital video recorders tied to a video service====
At the 1999 CES, Dish Network demonstrated the hardware that would later have DVR capability with the assistance of Microsoft software.&lt;ref name="microsoft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/jan99/echostarpr.mspx |title=WebTV Networks and EchoStar Communications Introduce First Internet TV Satellite Product and Service |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=1999-01-07 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221221342/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/jan99/echostarpr.mspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included WebTV Networks internet TV.&lt;ref name="microsoft.com"/&gt; By the end of 1999 the Dishplayer had full DVR capabilities and within a year, over 200,000 units were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Manes, 06.11.01, 12:00 AM ET |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0611/146.html |title=Forbes |publisher="Forbes" |date= 2001-06-11|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satelliteguys.us/655841-post51.html |title=Judge Stops Countersuit against TiVo |publisher=SatelliteGuys.US |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206004749/http://www.satelliteguys.us/655841-post51.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, digital video recorders are often referred to as "plus boxes" (such as BSKYB's [[Sky+]] and Virgin Media's [[V+]] which integrates an [[High-definition television|HD]] capability, and the subscription free [[Freesat+]] and [[Freeview+]]). [[Freeview+]] have been around in the UK since the late 2000s. British Sky Broadcasting markets a popular combined receiver and DVR as Sky+. [[TiVo]] launched a UK model in 2000, and is no longer supported, except for third party services, and the continuation of TiVo through [[Virgin Media]] in 2010. South African based Africa Satellite TV beamer Multichoice recently launched their DVR which is available on their DStv platform. In addition to ReplayTV and TiVo, there are a number of other suppliers of digital terrestrial ([[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]) DVRs, including Thomson, [[Topfield]], Fusion, [[Pace Micro Technology]], [[Humax]], VBox Communications, [[AC Ryan Playon]] and [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]] (ADB).

Many satellite, cable and [[IPTV]] companies are incorporating digital video recording functions into their [[set-top box]], such as with [[DirecTiVo]], DISHPlayer/DishDVR, Scientific Atlanta [[Explorer 8300|Explorer 8xxx]] from Time Warner, Total Home DVR from AT&amp;T [[U-verse]], [[Motorola DCT6412]] from Comcast and others, [[Moxi]] Media Center by Digeo (available through Charter, Adelphia, Sunflower, Bend Broadband, and soon Comcast and other cable companies), or Sky+. [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] introduced their DVR system, called [[Astro MAX]], which was the first PVR in Malaysia but was phased out two years after its introduction.

In the case of digital television, there is no ''encoding'' necessary in the DVR since the signal is already a digitally encoded MPEG stream. The digital video recorder simply stores the digital stream directly to disk. Having the broadcaster involved with, and sometimes subsidizing, the design of the DVR can lead to features such as the ability to use interactive TV on recorded shows, pre-loading of programs, or directly recording encrypted digital streams. It can, however, also force the manufacturer to implement non-skippable advertisements and automatically expiring recordings.

In the United States, the FCC has ruled that starting on July 1, 2007, consumers will be able to purchase a set-top box from a third-party company, rather than being forced to purchase or rent the set-top box from their cable company.&lt;ref&gt;WIldstrom, W. H.: [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070630_146146.htm "An Early Independence Day."]&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling only applies to "navigation devices," otherwise known as a cable television set-top box, and not to the security functions that control the user's access to the content of the cable operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/News_Releases/1999/nrcb9009.html |title=FCC Press Release |publisher=Fcc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall net effect on digital video recorders and related technology is unlikely to be substantial as standalone DVRs are currently readily available on the open market.

In Europe [[Free-To-Air]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesystem-world.com/web/it_en/electronic/catalogue/184/witv/955/turn-iphone-and-ipad-pc-windows-tablet-and-smartphone-android-into-a-pvr-tv.html|title=Turn iPhone and iPad, PC,  tablet and smartphone Android into a PVR TV Wi.TV – TELE System Digital Srl|work=TELE System}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pay TV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vboxcomm.com/digitenne-and-canaldigitaal-to-ip.html|title=Digitenne and CanalDigitaal live TV across your home|author=Super User|work=vboxcomm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV gateway]]s with multiple tuners have whole house recording capabilities allowing recording of TV programs to [[Network Attached Storage]] or attached USB storage, recorded programs are then shared across the home network to [[tablet computer|tablet]], [[smartphone]], PC, Mac, Smart TV.

=== Introduction of dual tuners ===
In 2003 many Satellite and Cable providers introduced dual-tuner digital video recorders. In the UK, [[BSkyB]] introduced their first PVR [[Sky+]] with dual tuner support in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky's second PVR to debut by March 2001|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/skys-second-pvr-to-debut-by-march-2001/1201341.article|date = 12 September 2000|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054202/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/skys-second-pvr-to-debut-by-march-2001/1201341.article|archive-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These machines have two independent tuners within the same receiver. The main use for this feature is the capability to record a live program while watching another live program simultaneously or to record two programs at the same time, possibly while watching a previously recorded one. [[Kogan.com]] introduced a dual-tuner PVR in the Australian market allowing free-to-air television to be recorded on a removable hard drive. Some dual-tuner DVRs also have the ability to output to two separate television sets at the same time. The PVR manufactured by UEC ([[Durban]], South Africa) and used by [[Multichoice]] and [[Scientific Atlanta]] 8300DVB PVR have the ability to view two programs while recording a third using a triple tuner.

Where several [[digital subchannel]]s are transmitted on a single RF channel, some PVRs can record two channels and view a third, so long as all three subchannels are on two channels (or one).&lt;ref&gt;[http://seura.com/TF5000PVRt(ExceptAustralia)1.0.pdf Manual of a PVR which can record 2 programs and watch a third if only 2 multiplexes used; see section 3.5.2: watching television while dual recording] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232641/http://seura.com/TF5000PVRt(ExceptAustralia)1.0.pdf |date=2014-04-26 }} Retrieved 2014-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, DVRs were used by 32 percent of all TV households in 2009, and 38 percent by 2010, with viewership among 18- to 40-year-olds 40 percent higher in homes that have them.&lt;ref name=WhyNewShows&gt;Battaglio, Stephen. "Why the New Shows Aren't Working" ''[[TV Guide]]''; October 18, 2010; Pages 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Integrated television sets===
[[File:Intergrated LCD DVR3.JPG|thumb|Side view of an LCD monitor with built-in DVR]]
DVRs are integrated into some [[television set]]s (TVs). These systems simplify wiring and operation because they employ a single power cable, have no interconnected ports (e.g., [[HDMI]]), and share a common [[remote control]].

===VESA compatibility===
[[File:VESA Compatible DVR.JPG|thumb|Underside of a VESA-compatible DVR]]
[[VESA]]-compatible DVRs are designed to attach to the VESA mounting holes (100×100&amp;nbsp;mm) on the back of an LCD television set (TV), allowing users to combine the TV and DVR into an integrated unit.

===Set-top boxes===
''Over-the-air'' DVRs are standalone set-top-boxes that record broadcast television programs. Several companies have launched over-the-air DVR products for the consumer market over the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-17742_7-10019233-19.html|title=Most anticipated tech of 2014 (pictures)|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pay-TV operators provide set-top boxes that allow subscribers to attach their own [[network-attached storage]] (NAS) hard drives or solid-state or flash memory to record video and other media files (e.g., audio and photos).

===PC-based===
Software and hardware are available which can turn personal computers running [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]] into DVRs, and is a popular option for [[HTPC|home-theater PC]] (HTPC) enthusiasts.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

====Linux====
There are many [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]] DVR applications available for [[Linux]]. For example, [[TV gateway]] interfaces to DVB tuners and provides network tuner and TV server functions, which allows live viewing and recording over IP networks. Other examples include [[MythTV]], [[Video Disk Recorder]] (VDR), [[LinuxMCE]], [[TiVo]], [[VBox Home TV Gateway]], and [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]] (formerly XBMC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=PVR|title=The XBMC Live TV and PVR/DVR Setup Guide |date=2013-07-03|work=xbmc Media Centre|access-date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mac OS====
[[Elgato]] makes a series of digital video recording devices called EyeTV. The software supplied with each device is also called EyeTV, and is available separately for use on compatible third-party tuners from manufacturers such as Pinnacle, TerraTec, and Hauppauge.

[[SageTV]] provided DVR software for the Mac but no longer sells it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geektonic.com/2011/06/whats-next-for-sagetv-customers-post.html |title=What's Next for SageTV Customers Post-Google? |publisher=GeekTonic |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously sold devices support the Hauppauge HVR-950, myTV.PVR and HDHomeRun hardware with its DVR software. SageTV software also included the ability to watch YouTube and other online video with a remote control.

[[MythTV]] (see above) also runs under [[Mac OS X]], but most recording devices are currently only supported under Linux. Precompiled binaries are available for the MythTV front-end, allowing a Mac to watch video from (and control) a MythTV server running under Linux.

Apple provides applications in the FireWire software developer kit which allow any Mac with a FireWire port to record the MPEG2 transport stream from a FireWire-equipped cable box (for example: Motorola DCT62xx, including HD streams). Applications can also change channels on the cable box via the firewire interface. Only broadcast channels can be recorded as the rest of the channels are encrypted. ''FireRecord (formerly iRecord)'' is a free scheduled-recording program derived from this SDK.

====Windows====
There are several free digital video recording applications available for [[Microsoft Windows]] including [[GB-PVR]], [[MediaPortal]], and [[Orb (Software)|Orb]] (web-based remote interface).

There are also several [[Proprietary software|commercial]] applications available including [[CyberLink]], [[SageTV]] (which is no longer available after Google acquired it in June 2011), [[Beyond TV]] (which is considered discontinued despite an official announcement from SnapStream since the last update was October 2010 and they are concentrating on their enterprise search products), [[DVBViewer]], [[Showshifter]], [[InterVideo WinDVR]], the [[R5000-HD]] and [[Meedio]] (now a dead product – Yahoo! bought most of the company's technology and discontinued the Meedio line, and rebranded the software Yahoo! Go – TV, which is now a free product but only works in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Please note:

Retrieved 09 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;). Most [[TV tuner card]]s come bundled with software which allows the PC to record television to hard disk. See [[TV tuner card]]. For example, [[Leadtek]]'s WinFast DTV1000 digital [[TV card]] comes bundled with the WinFast PVR2 software, which can also record analog video from the card's [[composite video]] input socket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leadtek.com/eng/tv_tuner/news_detail.asp?newsid=611&amp;pronameid=382&amp;lineid=6 "turn your PC into a powerful DVD video recorder" … "recording and capturing digital video from digital TV", Media Release, October 1st, 2007]. ''Leadtek''. Retrieved 09 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows Media Center]] is a DVR software by Microsoft which was bundled with the [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Media Center edition of Windows XP]], the Home Premium / Ultimate editions of [[Windows Vista]], as well as most editions of [[Windows 7]]. When Windows 8 was released in 2012, Windows Media Center was not included with Windows 8 OEM or Retail installations, and was only available as a $15 add-on pack (including DVD Playback codecs) to Windows 8 Pro users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/getting-windows-media-center-on-windows-8-bought/324dc94b-0750-44b0-8e78-08c59fd4130b Getting Windows Media Center on Windows 8 bought through DreamSpark]. ''Windows''. Retrieved 9 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embeddable===
[[File:1-Channel Embeddable DVR.jpg|thumb|Embeddable DVR with [[incremental encoder]] interface for position tracking]]
An ''embeddable'' DVR is a standalone device that is designed to be easily integrated into more complex systems. It is typically supplied as a compact, bare circuit board that facilitates mounting it as a subsystem component within larger equipment. The control keypad is usually connected with a detachable cable, to allow it to be located on the system's exterior while the DVR circuitry resides inside the equipment.

==Source video==
[[Television]] and [[video]] are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but differ in their technical meaning. Video is the visual portion of television, whereas television is the combination of video and audio [[modulation|modulated]] onto a [[Carrier wave|carrier frequency]] (i.e., a television channel) for delivery. Most DVRs can record both video and audio.

===Analog sources===
The first digital video recorders were designed to record [[analog television]] in [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] formats.

To record an analog signal a few steps are required. In the case of a television signal, a television [[Tuner (radio)|tuner]] must first demodulate the radio frequency signal to produce baseband video. The video is then converted to digital form by a [[frame grabber]], which converts each video image into a collection of numeric values that represent the [[pixel]]s within the image. At the same time, the audio is also converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter running at a constant sampling rate. In many devices, the resulting digital video and audio are compressed before recording to reduce the amount of data that will be recorded, although some DVRs record uncompressed data. When compression is used, video is typically compressed using formats such as H.264 or MPEG-2, and audio is compressed using AAC or MP3.

====Analog broadcast copy protection====
Many consumer DVRs implement a copy-protection system called ''Copy Generation Management System—Analog'' ([[CGMS-A]]), which specifies one of four possible copy permissions by means of two bits encoded in the [[VBI]]:
* Copying is freely allowed
* Copying is prohibited
* Only one copy of this material may be made
* This is a copy of material for which only one copy was allowed to be made, so no further copies are allowed.

CGMS-A information may be present in analog broadcast TV signals, and is preserved when the signal is recorded and played back by analog [[VCR]]s. VCRs do not understand the meanings of the bits but preserve them in case there is a subsequent attempt to copy the tape to a DVR.

DVRs such as TiVo also detect and act upon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/243 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718033009/http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/243 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-18 |title=Questions about copy protection – TiVo |publisher=Support.tivo.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analog protection systems such as [[Macrovision]] and [[DCS Copy Protection]] which were originally designed to block copying on analog VCRs.

===Digital sources===
Recording digital signals is generally a straightforward capture of the binary [[MPEG]] data being received. No expensive hardware is required to [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantize]] and [[Video compression|compress]] the signal (as the [[Broadcasting|television broadcaster]] has already done this in the studio).

DVD-based PVRs available on the market as of 2006 are not capable of capturing the full range of the visual signal available with [[high definition television]] (HDTV). This is largely because HDTV standards were finalized at a later time than the standards for DVDs. However, DVD-based PVRs can still be used (albeit at reduced visual quality) with HDTV since currently available HDTV sets also have standard A/V connections.

====ATSC broadcast====
[[ATSC]] television broadcasting is primarily used in North America. The ATSC data stream can be directly recorded by a digital video recorder, though many DVRs record only a subset of this information (that can later be transferred to [[DVD]]). An ATSC DVR will also act as a [[set-top box]], allowing older televisions or monitors to receive digital television.

=====Copy protection=====
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] attempted to limit the abilities of DVRs with its "[[broadcast flag]]" regulation. Digital video recorders that had not won prior approval from the FCC for implementing "effective" [[digital rights management]] would have been banned from [[interstate commerce]] from July 2005, but the regulation was struck down on May 6, 2005.

====DVB====
[[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] [[digital television]] contains audio/visual signals that are broadcast over the air in a [[Digital data|digital]] rather than [[analog (signal)|analog]] format. The DVB data stream can be directly recorded by the DVR. Autonomous devices (this is, that can be used without a computer/tablet) that can store in an external [[hard disk drive]] are called a [[telememory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.differo.es/video/telememory.html |title=Differo – Telememory |publisher=Differo.es |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923184508/http://differo.es/video/telememory.html |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital cable and satellite television====
Recording [[satellite television]] or [[digital cable]] signals on a digital video recorder can be more complex than recording analog signals or broadcast digital signals. There are several different transmission schemes, and the video streams may be encrypted to restrict access to subscribers only.

A satellite or cable [[set-top box]] both decrypts the signal if encrypted, and decodes the MPEG stream into an analog signal for viewing on the television. In order to record cable or satellite digital signals the signal must be captured after it has been decrypted but before it is decoded; this is how DVRs built into set-top boxes work.

Cable and satellite providers often offer their own digital video recorders along with a service plan. These DVRs have access to the encrypted video stream, and generally enforce the provider's restrictions on copying of material even after recording.

====DVD====
Many DVD-based DVRs have the capability to copy content from a source DVD ([[ripping]]). In the United States, this is prohibited under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] if the disc is encrypted. Most such DVRs will therefore not allow recording of video streams from encrypted movie discs.

====Digital camcorders====
A digital [[camcorder]] combines a camera and a digital video recorder.

Some DVD-based DVRs incorporate connectors that can be used to capture digital video from a camcorder. Some editing of the resulting DVD is usually possible, such as adding [[chapter point]]s.

Some digital video recorders can now record to solid state [[flash memory card]]s (called ''flash camcorders''). They generally use [[Secure Digital]] cards, can include wireless connections ([[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]]), and can play [[SWF]] files. There are some digital video recorders that combine video and graphics in real time to the flash card, called [[DTE (Direct To Edit)|DTE]] or "direct to edit".  These are used to speed-up the editing workflow in video and television production, since linear videotapes do not then need to be transferred to the edit workstation (see [[Non-linear editing system]]).

== File formats, resolutions and file systems ==
DVRs can usually record and play [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[MPEG-2]] [[.mpg]], [[MPEG-2]] .[[MPEG transport stream|TS]], [[VOB]] and [[ISO image]]s video, with [[MP3]] and [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] audio tracks. They can also display images ([[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) and play music files ([[MP3]] and [[Ogg]]).

Some devices can be [[firmware|updated]] to play and record in new formats. DVRs usually record in proprietary [[file system]]s for [[copy protection]], although some can use [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file systems. Recordings from [[standard-definition television]] usually have 480p/i/576p/i while [[HDTV]] is usually in 720p/1080i.

== Applications ==

=== Security ===
[[File:Lorex 4K NVR.jpg|thumb|[[Lorex by FLIR|Lorex]] 4K NVR, a security digital video recorder]]
Digital video recorders configured for [[physical security]] applications record video signals from [[closed-circuit television]] cameras for detection and documentation purposes. Many are designed to record audio as well. DVRs have evolved into devices that are feature rich and provide services that exceed the simple recording of video images that was previously done through VCRs. A DVR CCTV system provides a multitude of advanced functions over VCR technology including video searches by event, time, date and camera. There is also much more control over quality and frame rate allowing disk space usage to be optimized and the DVR can also be set to overwrite the oldest security footage should the disk become full. In some DVR security systems remote access to security footage using a PC can also be achieved by connecting the DVR to a LAN network or the Internet.
Some of the latest professional digital video recorders include video analytics firmware, to enable functionality such as 'virtual tripwire' or even the detection of abandoned objects on the scene.

Security DVRs may be categorized as being either PC-based or [[embedded system|embedded]]. A PC-based DVR's architecture is a classical personal computer with [[video capture card]]s designed to capture video images. An embedded type DVR is specifically designed as a digital video recorder with its [[operating system]] and [[application software]] contained in [[firmware]] or [[read-only memory]].

==== Hardware features ====
[[Computer hardware|Hardware]] features of security DVRs vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:
* Designed for [[19-inch rack|rack]] mounting or desktop configurations.
* Single or multiple video inputs with connector types consistent with the analogue or digital video provided such as [[coaxial cable]], [[twisted pair]] or [[optical fiber cable]]. The most common number of inputs are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. Systems may be configured with a very large number of inputs by networking or [[Bus (computing)|bussing]] individual DVRs together.
* Looping video outputs for each input which duplicates the corresponding input video signal and connector type. These output signals are used by other video equipment such as matrix switchers, [[multiplexer]]s, and [[video monitor]]s.
* Controlled outputs to external video display monitors.
* Front panel switches and indicators that allow the various features of the machine to be controlled.
* Network connections consistent with the network type and utilized to control features of the recorder and to send and/or receive video signals.
* Connections to external control devices such as [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]].
* A connection to external pan-tilt-zoom drives that position cameras.
* Internal CD, DVD, VCR devices typically for archiving video.
* Connections to external [[storage media]].
* Alarm event inputs from external security detection devices, usually one per video input.
* Alarm event outputs from internal detection features such as motion detection or loss of video.

==== Software features ====
Software features vary between manufacturers and may include but are not necessarily limited to:
* User-selectable image capture rates either on an all input basis or input by input basis. The capture rate feature may be programmed to automatically adjust the capture rate on the occurrence of an external alarm or an internal event
* Selectable [[image resolution]] either on an all input basis or input by input basis. The image resolution feature may be programmed to automatically adjust the image resolution on the occurrence of an external alarm or an internal e vent.
* Compression methods determine quality of playback. H.264 hardware compression offers fast transfer rates over the Internet with high quality video.
* [[Motion detection]]: Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects motion in the total image or a user definable portion of the image and usually provides sensitivity settings. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or be used to trigger changes in other internal features.
* Lack of motion detection. Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects the movement of an object into the field of view and remaining still for a user definable time. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or used to trigger changes in other internal features.
* Direction of motion detection. Provided on an input by input basis, this feature detects the direction of motion in the image that has been determined by the user as an unacceptable occurrence. Detection causes an internal event that may be output to external equipment and/or be used to [[Event-driven programming|trigger]] changes in other internal features.
* Routing of input video to video monitors based on user inputs or automatically on alarms or events.
* Input, time and date [[Time and date stamping|stamping]].
* [[Alarm]] and event logging on appropriate video inputs.
* Alarm and event search.
* One or more sound recording channels.
* [[Archiving|Archival]].

== Privacy concerns ==
Some (very few), but certainly not all, digital video recorders which are designed to send information to a service provider over a [[telephone line]] or [[Internet]] (or any other way) can gather and send real-time data on users' viewing habits.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, David: [http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dm/pubs/TiVo%20report.htm "TiVo's Data Collection and Privacy Practices."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062056/http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dm/pubs/TiVo%20report.htm |date=2011-09-28 }}  26 March 2001. Last Viewed 18 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV advertisements==
{{see|TV advertising}}
Digital video recorders are also changing the way television programs advertise products. Watching pre-recorded programs allows users to fast-forward through [[commercials]], and some technology allows users to remove commercials entirely. Half of viewers in the United States, for example, use DVRs to skip commercials entirely.&lt;ref name=WhyNewShows/&gt; This feature has been controversial for the last decade, with major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright and should be banned.

In 1985, an employee of Honeywell's Physical Sciences Center, David Rafner, first described a drive-based DVR designed for home TV recording, [[time-slipping]], and [[commercial skipping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Video Recorders|url=http://www.lauttamus.com/Security/Products/dvr.asp|dead-url=Y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502192503/http://www.lauttamus.com/Security/Products/dvr.asp |archive-date=2014-05-02 |access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Patent 4,972,396  focused on a multi-channel design to allow simultaneous independent recording and playback. Broadly anticipating future DVR developments, it describes possible applications such as streaming compression, editing, captioning, multi-channel security monitoring, military sensor platforms, and remotely piloted vehicles.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The first DVR which had a built-in commercial skipping feature introduced in 1999 by [[ReplayTV]] at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas. In 2002, five owners of the ReplayTV DVR sued the main television networks and movie studios, asking the federal judge to uphold consumers' rights to record TV shows and skip commercials, claiming that features such as commercial skipping help parents protect their kids from excessive consumerism. ReplayTV was purchased by SONICblue in 2001 and on March 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV's ability to skip commercials. In 2007, [[DirecTV]] purchased the remaining assets of ReplayTV.
A [[Third-party software component|third-party]] add-on for Windows Media Center called "DVRMSToolbox" has the ability to skip commercials.
There is a command-line program called Comskip that detects commercials in an MPEG-2 file and saves their positions to a text file. This file can then be fed to a program like [[MEncoder]] to actually remove the commercials.

Many speculate that television advertisements will be eliminated altogether,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} replaced by [[Product placement|advertising in the TV shows themselves]]. For example, ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' advertises [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Kohler Company|Kohler]], and [[Home Depot]] by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]] of [[NASCAR]] are named after sponsors.

Another type of advertisement shown more and more, mostly for advertising TV shows on the same channel, is where the ad overlays the bottom of the TV screen, blocking out some of the picture. "Banners", or "logo bugs", as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is done in much the same way as severe weather warnings are done. Sometimes, these take up only 5–10% of the screen, but in the extreme, can take up as much as 25% of the viewing area. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example of this is the 2E ads for ''[[Three Moons Over Milford]]'' in the months before its premiere. A video taking up approximately 25% of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television program.

Because of this widely used new technology, advertisers are now looking at a new way to market their products on television. An excerpt from the magazine ''[[Advertising Age]]'' reads: "As advertisers lose the ability to invade the home, and consumer's minds, they will be forced to wait for an invitation. This means that they have to learn what kinds of advertising content customers will actually be willing to seek out and receive."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Henry. "Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. Buying Into American Idol". (p. 66–67)&lt;/ref&gt;

With ad skipping and the time-sensitive nature of certain ads, advertisers are wary of buying commercial time on shows that are heavily digitally video-recorded.&lt;ref name="adver"&gt;{{cite news | last = Young | first = Susan | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002941.html?categoryid=3606&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 | title = Devotees delay 'Lost' passion | date = 2009-04-28 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = 2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technology today makes it possible for networks to insert ads dynamically on videos being played in DVRs. Advertisers could inject time-relevant ads to recorded programs when the program is viewed. This way the ads could be not just topical but also personalized to viewers interests. [[DirecTV]] in March 2011 signed an arrangement with [[NDS Group]] to enable the delivery of such addressable advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucas |first=Amy |title=DIRECTV Chooses NDS Dynamic™ to Support Addressable Advertising |url=http://www.nds.com/press_releases2011/DIRECTV_NDSDynamic_220311.html |work=Corporate Communications |publisher=NDS |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726022944/http://www.nds.com/press_releases2011/DIRECTV_NDSDynamic_220311.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed that viewers prefer to forward ads, than to switch the channel.  By switching channels, viewers will have the probability of skipping the beginning of their program.  Users might switch to a channel that is also showing ads.  Having the ability to pause, rewind, and forward live TV gives users a chance to change the channel fewer times.  Forwarding ads can have a later affect on the viewer.  Ads that get the viewers' attention will influence the viewers' to rewind and watch what was missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilbur|first=Kenneth C.|title=How the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) Changes Traditional Television Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=37|issue=1|page=144|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367370111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, [[Dish Network]] announced Hopper service, costing $10 extra per month, which recorded [[prime-time]] programming from the four major broadcast networks. With the Auto Hop feature, viewers can watch the programs they choose without commercials, without making the effort to fast-forward. On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-05/dish-s-ad-skip-tool-may-benefit-from-cablevision-dvr-case.html |title=Dish's Ad-Skip Tool May Benefit From Cablevision DVR Case |last=Jeffrey |first=Don |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patent and copyright litigation ==
{{Globalize|US|date=December 2010}}
On July 14, 2005, [[Forgent Networks]] filed suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgent.com/ip/746cases.shtml |title=Home &amp;#124; Asure Software |publisher=Forgent.com |date= |access-date=November 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114095749/http://www.forgent.com/ip/746cases.shtml |archivedate=January 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against various companies alleging infringement on {{US patent|6285746}}, entitled "Computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording". The listed companies included EchoStar, DirecTV, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Comcast, Time Warner, and Cable One.

[[Scientific-Atlanta]] and [[Motorola]], the manufacturers of the equipment sold by the above-mentioned companies, filed a counter-suit against Forgent Networks claiming that their products do not violate the patent, and that the patent is invalid. The two cases were combined into case 6:06-cv-208, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division.

According to court documents, on June 20, 2006, Motorola requested that the United States Patent and Trademarks Office reexamine the patent, which was first filed in 1991, but has been amended several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgent.com/ip/docs/208-327-1.pdf |title=Home &amp;#124; Asure Software |publisher=Forgent.com |date= |access-date=November 21, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2007, Cablevision Systems Corp lost a legal battle against several Hollywood studios and television networks to introduce a network-based digital video recorder service to its subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvrwire.com/2006/04/06/tivo-vs-echostar-lawsuit-update/ |title=AOL TV |publisher=Pvrwire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 4, 2008, Cablevision won its appeal. John M. Walker Jr., a Second Circuit judge, declared that the technology "would not directly infringe" on the media companies' rights.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/business/media/05adco.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | title=A Ruling May Pave the Way for Broader Use of DVR | first=Brian | last=Stelter | date=August 5, 2008 | access-date=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected.

In court, the media companies argued that network digital video recorders were tantamount to video-on-demand, and that they should receive license fees for the recording. Cablevision and the appeals court disagreed. The company noted that each user would record programs on his or her own individual server space, making it a DVR that has a "very long cord."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 2004, TiVo sued EchoStar Corp, a manufacturer of DVR units, for patent infringement. The parties reached a settlement in 2011 wherein EchoStar pays a one-time fee (in three structured payments) that grants Echostar full rights for life to the disputed TiVo patents upon first payment(as opposed to indefinite and escalating license fees to be constantly renegotiated), and Echostar granted TiVo full rights for life to certain Echostar patents and dropped their counter-suit against TiVo.

In January 2012, AT&amp;T settled a similar suit brought by TiVo claiming patent infringement (just as with Echostar) in exchange for cash payments to TiVo totaling $215 million through June 2018 plus "incremental recurring per subscriber monthly license fees" to TiVo through July 2018, but grants no full lifetime rights as per the Echostar settlement.

In May 2012, [[Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network, LLC|Fox Broadcasting sued Dish Network]], arguing that Dish's set-top box with DVR function, which allowed the users to automatically record prime-time programs and skip commercials, was copyright infringement and breach of contract. In July 2013, the 9th circuit rejected Fox's claims.

The '''''Dune'' prequel series''' is a sequence of novel [[trilogy|trilogies]] written by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. Set in the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]], the novels take place in various time periods before and in between Herbert's original six novels, which began with 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. In 1997, [[Bantam Books]] made a $3 million deal with the authors for three ''Dune'' [[prequel]] novels, partially based upon notes left behind by Frank Herbert, that would come to be known as the ''[[#Prelude to Dune|Prelude to Dune]]'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="PW Dune 1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19971117/35200-pw-bantam-pays-3m-for-dune-prequels-by-herbert-s-son.html |title=Bantam Pays $3M for ''Dune'' Prequels by Herbert's Son |date=November 17, 1997 |first=Judy |last=Quinn |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 1999's ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'', the duo have published 11 ''Dune'' prequel novels to date.

* ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'' (1999)
* ''[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]'' (2000)
* ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'' (2001)

===Plot===
As the ''Prelude to Dune'' series begins, an impatient Crown Prince [[Shaddam IV|Shaddam]] is plotting to end the reign of his father, [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Elrood IX]], by any means possible. Young  [[House Atreides]] heir [[Leto I Atreides|Leto]] becomes close with the ruling family of the important technology world [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]], but the ensuing intrigue surrounding a [[Tleilaxu]] takeover of Ix makes Leto an enemy in Shaddam. Very close to their goal of producing a [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] scheme behind the scenes to secure their influence; the virile [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] crosses them and pays a heavy price. [[Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]], the Bene Gesserit [[Lady Jessica]] and Harkonnen enemies [[Duncan Idaho]] and [[Gurney Halleck]] ally themselves with Leto, and Shaddam nearly destroys the all-important planet [[Arrakis]] thinking he has found a replacement for its priceless and essential export, [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]].&lt;ref name="Prelude"&gt;{{cite serial |last=Herbert |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Herbert |author2=Kevin J.

==''Legends of Dune''==
'''''Legends of Dune''''' is a [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] of novels written by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], set in [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]]. The series takes place over 10,000 years before the events of the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', and chronicles the universe-spanning war against [[thinking machines (Dune)|thinking machines]] that would eventually become known as the [[Butlerian Jihad]].&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/books/2009/Dune-The-Butlerian-Jihad-by-Brian-Herber--Kevin-J-Anderson--13987.php |title=Review: ''Dune: The  Butlerian Jihad'' by Brian Herbert  &amp; Kevin J.

The books in the series are:
* ''[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad|The Butlerian Jihad]]'' (2002)
* ''[[Dune: The Machine Crusade|The Machine Crusade]]'' (2003)
* ''[[Dune: The Battle of Corrin|The Battle of Corrin]]'' (2004)

===Plot===
The series explains that after our own time, humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the [[Titan (Dune)|Titans]] use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe. The Titans soon make the transition into [[cyborg]]s called [[cymek]]s; through the use of specialized interfaces, their brains are installed inside giant, mobile, mechanized "bodies." These fearsome, weaponized bodies make the Titans virtually immortal {{mdash}} and invincible. Their rule lasts for a century. Then, having mistakenly given one attendant [[artificial intelligence]] program too much autonomy, the Titans suddenly find themselves overthrown and enslaved by an AI consciousness calling itself [[Omnius]] that seizes control of the entire universe though the interconnected machine network. For over 900 years the Titans live in perpetual servitude to Omnius, cruelly subjugating humanity, quelling human insurrections and secretly plotting their own return to power.&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01"/&gt;

At the time of the ''Legends of Dune'' series, over 500 planets {{mdash}} called the '''Synchronized Worlds''' {{mdash}} are under complete machine control, their former human populations either enslaved or killed. The relatively few planets of remaining free humans are united under the '''League of Nobles''', a government using what resources it has to defend the League Worlds against machine aggression. A prominent figure in the human rebellion is [[Serena Butler]], the charismatic daughter of the League Viceroy; the murder of her young son at the hands of the independent robot [[Erasmus (Dune)|Erasmus]] finally incites the Butlerian Jihad, with humanity mounting a decisive offense against machine rule.&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01"/&gt; This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century, with much loss of human life but ending in human victory at the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The Jihad also gives rise to the [[Bene Gesserit]], the [[Spacing Guild]], the [[Sardaukar]] army, the [[Landsraad]], and [[House Corrino]], whose [[Padishah Emperor]]s rule the universe for the next 10,000 years, until the events of ''Dune'' and the accession of [[Paul Atreides]].&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite serial |last=Herbert|first=Brian |author2=Kevin J.

Torondo's growing power threatens the [[House Corrino|Corrino]] Emperor Salvador, as well as the Sisterhood on [[Rossak]] and the Mentat School on [[Lampadas]], each of which harbors secret technology. Space travel tycoon Josef Venport also plots to salvage machinery which he believes can be useful in his business empire.&lt;ref name="Sisterhood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert|first=Brian |author2=Kevin J. Anderson |title=[[Sisterhood of Dune]] |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mentats of Dune'' finds [[Gilbertus Albans]] carefully managing his Mentat School under the watchful eye of the fanatical Butlerians, while [[Raquella Berto-Anirul]] seeks to rebuild her own Sisterhood School on [[Wallach IX]]. To secure his control of interstellar commerce and strike a blow against the Butlerians, Venport places a trade embargo on any planet which embraces Torondo's movement.&lt;ref name="Blog 11.15.13"/&gt;

'''''Emanuelle in America''''' is a 1977 Italian [[sexploitation film]], the third in a series starring [[Laura Gemser]],&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[DVD Talk]]|title=Emanuelle In America|first=by G. Noel|last=Gross|date=July 13, 2003|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/6895/emanuelle-in-america/}}&lt;/ref&gt; made to cash in on the success of the [[France|French]] film ''[[Emmanuelle (film)|Emmanuelle]]'' (1974) and its sequels.&lt;ref name=DT/&gt; It was the second in the series to be directed by [[Joe D'Amato]]. It is infamous for its "hardcore footage of unsimulated fellatio, penetration, ejaculation and unconventional horse husbandry"&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;.

==Plot ==   
The fearless American journalist and fashion photographer Emanuelle travels throughout the world  in search of a good story for her editor. Emanuelle is actually a globe-trotting reporter who is not afraid to disrobe in the name of investigative journalism.  On her journey, she goes to Europe looking to investigate the private [[harem]] of a wealthy tycoon, Eric Van Darren where she watches a naked woman masturbate a horse named Pedro before having a sapphic encounter in a steam room. There she meets an Italian Duke, Alfredo Elvize and travels to his house in Venice where she ends up in a threesome with him and his wife before taking part in an orgy at a party they throw. She likes to see for herself what really goes on at diplomatic parties. Later, she is sent out to a private holiday resort island where women pay for men to fulfill their ultimate carnal desires. Here she sees a couple watching a disturbing [[snuff film]] and becomes determined to find out who made it. Emanuelle stumbles upon a group that uses kidnapped girls to make and sell snuff films. 

She has been taking several pictures with a small spy camera installed in her necklace. Eventually, she gets caught in the act and this follows with a brush with death which leaves Emanuelle wondering if it is perhaps time to hang up her camera for good. Loaded with plenty of photos with her story, on her return to New York City, she meets her editor but he refuses to print the story and the images. She feels disgusted and quits her job and goes on a long vacation with her boyfriend.

'''Foxy boxing''' is a form of [[sports entertainment]] which involves two or more women [[boxing]] (or pretending to do so) in a sexualized context as a form of erotic entertainment. The participants are typically dressed in revealing clothing such as [[bikini]]s or skintight [[leotard]]s, while the actual fight usually focuses on the beauty of the combatants rather than fighting skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=opYA03qIQPYC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Good with Their Hands |author=Carlo Rotella |publisher=University of California Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-24335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxy boxing is unusual in that the audience generally does not care who wins. It is believed to have its roots in "singles' bars in southern California" after the interest in women's boxing began to decline in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports: A-G |last=Christensen |first=Karen |authorlink= |author2=Allen Guttmann |author3=Gertrud Pfister  |year=2001 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |location= |isbn= |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srYYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZUztTMyWFcGAlAfzgrCNAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgU |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream competitive sport of [[women's boxing]] has tried to avoid association with  foxy boxing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The boxer's heart: how I fell in love with the ring |last=Sekules
 |first=Kate |year=2000 |publisher=Villard |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6G1AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the successful female boxer [[Mia St. John]] emphasised her sexuality by appearing on the cover of [[Playboy]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Women boxers: the new warriors |page=22 |year=2006 |author=C. Ondine Chavoya |isbn=978-1-55885-475-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a popular entertainment used in the [[Philippines]] for military men in the 1980s and 90s. It included both boxing and wrestling and the women were expected to "draw blood and show bruises before they got paid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Madonnas and martyrs: militarism and violence in the Philippines |last=Hilsdon |first=Anne-Marie |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |location= |isbn= |pages=99–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3zDXQ-2B0kC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kftTKv9A4X6lwee8YyMAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxy boxing was also utilized by bar owners in [[Thailand]] for the same type of audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The morning after: sexual politics at the end of the Cold War |last=H. Enloe |first=Cynthia |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=University of California Press |location= |isbn= |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHTECm_g6xoC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZUztTMyWFcGAlAfzgrCNAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of fighting was formed into a new genre by David Borden, into what came to be known as [[Kaiju Big Battel]], which was staged fights with a heavy [[tokusatsu]] and pop culture influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=October 2002 |title=Anime Instincts |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=Bob Guccione, Jr. |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiUGaclNKKQC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=507tTIuJKMWBlAft09GQAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although foxy boxing is more of an entertainment spectacle than a sport, it has resulted in injuries. A foxy boxer at a high-end strip club in Rhode Island sued her employer after her silicone breast implants were ruptured in a fight. The class action suit ruled her employer liable.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Media and popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The sport is frequently referenced in [[popular culture]]:
*Homer Simpson on ''The Simpsons'' mentioned it three times: In the season one episode "[[Homer's Night Out]],"Foxy Boxing" is one of the places where Homer and Bart stop at in their quest for [[Princess Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family |last=Groening |first=Matt |year=1997 |publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York |isbn=  0-06095252-0|page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the season six episode "[[Lisa on Ice]]", he tells Lisa that "if the Bible has taught us nothing else--and it hasn't--it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot-oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The gospel according to the Simpsons |last=I. Pinsky |first=Mark |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location= |isbn= |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qlrh_eGSPZQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22foxy+boxing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2ErtTITvDIWKlwful9X9AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foxy%20boxing%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on the season 12 episode "[[Tennis the Menace]]", Homer builds a tennis court, only to learn that tennis is not the same as foxy boxing (or as he calls it, "the sport where the chicks wail on each other").
*The ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "Boxing Luanne" centered on [[Luanne Platter]] thinking she has taken up mainstream women's boxing, only to find she has been underwritten by [[Buck Strickland]] for foxy boxing.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' season one episode 9 "Glades" contains a scene of two women foxy boxing approximately 9 minutes into the episode.   The owner of the club promoting the event even refers directly to the sport stating, "Foxy Boxing is what's in now"
* In the final episode of the TV Series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' (Discos &amp; Dragons, Season 1, Ep. 18) [[Seth Rogen]]'s character Ken is thrown out of a disco club for causing a scene and making fun of disco music.  As he's being escorted from the building, the bouncer at the disco club tells him not to worry too much because the disco will be shut down the following week in favor of foxy boxing.&lt;ref name="freaks"&gt;(29 October 2010).

* On the March 17, 2010 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Jon Stewart compares the U.S. congressional debate over health care reform to foxy boxing.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode [[Baby, You Knock Me Out]] [[Lois Griffin]] starts her "boxing career" as a foxy boxer.
*In Season 2, Episode 5 of ''[[30 Rock]]'', Kenneth throws a party rumored to have foxy boxing.
*In ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', [[Barney Stinson]] is a fan of foxy boxing.

'''Geoffrey George Gibbs''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (25 November 1940 – 17 August 2006) was an Australian actor and acting teacher.

==Biography==
Gibbs was born in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia]] in 1940, and was educated at [[Aquinas College, Perth]]. He studied for bachelor's and master's degrees in arts at the [[University of Western Australia]], and later a PhD from [[Ohio State University]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;''Who's Who in Australia'', Volume 35; Herald and Weekly Times, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs was founding dean of dramatic arts at the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]] (WAAPA) from 1979 to 1988, and trained several of Australia's best-known actors, including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Lisa McCune]] and [[William McInnes]].&lt;ref name=dimensions&gt;{{cite web|last=Hussain|first=Benazir|title=Episode 8: WAAPA Teacher|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_people/Transcripts/s650684.htm|work=Dimensions with George Negus|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, he was made chairman of the International Foundation for Arts and Culture, a non-profit organisation formed to promote the creation of new work and cultural and artistic residencies.&lt;ref name=aotearoa&gt;{{cite book|last=Maufort|first=Marc|title=Performing Aotearoa: New Zealand Theatre and Drama in an Age of Transition|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9052013594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoff and wife, Carole had three children: Paige Gibbs, Ashleigh Gibbs and Nathan Gibbs.

==Honours==
Gibbs was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) in the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours, for service to the performing arts through the establishment, development and promotion of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, and through professional associations.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1040490&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true GIBBS, Geoffrey George], ''It's an Honour'', 10 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the Academy Theatre at WAAPA was renamed the Geoff Gibbs Theatre in his honour. The ceremony at which the theatre was renamed was officiated by star graduate Hugh Jackman.&lt;ref name=ggtheatre&gt;[http://www.waapa.ecu.edu.au/about/venues-and-studios/geoff-gibbs-theatre Geoff Gibbs Theatre], Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deep Throat poster 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;The film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' helped inaugurate the Golden Age of Porn.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''Golden Age of Porn''', or '''porno chic''', refers to a 15-year period (around 1969–1984) in [[Pornography in the United States|commercial American pornography]], which spread internationally,&lt;ref name="WP-20070719"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paasonen |first1=Susanna |last2=Saarenmaa |first2=Laura |title=The Golden Age of Porn: Nostalgia and History in Cinema |url=https://susannapaasonen.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/01pornification23-32.pdf |date=July 19, 2007 |format=[[PDF]] |work=[[WordPress]] |accessdate=April 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book-2015"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=DeLamater|editor-first1=John|editor-last2=Plante|editor-first2=Rebecca F.|editor-link1=John DeLamater |title=Handbook of the Sociology of Sexualities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0d3yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |page=416 |date=June 19, 2015 |work=[[Springer Publishing]] |accessdate=April 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which sexually explicit films experienced positive attention from mainstream cinemas, movie critics, and the general public.

Following mentions by [[Johnny Carson]] on his popular ''[[Tonight Show]]'' and [[Bob Hope]] on TV as well,&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt; ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' achieved major box-office success, despite being rudimentary by mainstream standards. In 1973, the more accomplished, but still low-budget, film ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' was the seventh most successful film of the year, and was well received by major media, including a favorable review by film critic [[Roger Ebert]].&lt;ref name="RE-19730613" /&gt; The phenomenon of porn being publicly discussed by celebrities, and taken seriously by critics, a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "porno chic", began for the first time in modern American culture.&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121" /&gt; It became obvious that box-office returns of very low-budget adult erotic films could fund further advances in the technical and production values of porn, making it extremely competitive with Hollywood films. There was concern that, left unchecked, the vast profitability of such films would lead to Hollywood being influenced by pornography.&lt;ref name="LL-1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Police Department 1975" /&gt;

Prior to this, thousands of U.S. state and municipal anti-obscenity laws and ordinances held that participating in the creation, distribution, or consumption of pornography constituted criminal action. Multi-jurisdictional interpretations of obscenity made such films highly susceptible to prosecution and criminal liability for obscenity, thereby greatly restricting their distribution and profit potential. However, the [[US Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision in ''[[Miller v. California]]'', narrowing and simplifying the definition of obscenity, resulted in dramatically fewer prosecutions nationwide. Freedom in creative license, higher movie budgets and payouts, and a "Hollywood mindset", all contributed to this period.

However, with the increasing availability of [[videocassette recorder]]s for private viewing in the 1980s, video supplanted film as the preferred distribution medium for pornography, which quickly reverted to being low-budget and openly gratuitous, ending this "Golden Age".&lt;ref name="Bad Infamy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehman|first=Peter|title=Bad: Infamy, Darkness, Evil, and Slime on Screen|year=2003|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|location=Albany, New York|isbn=978-0791459409|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pornographic films were produced in the early 20th century as [[Stag film|"stag" movies]], intended to be viewed at male gatherings or in brothels. In the United States, social disapproval was so great that men in them sometimes attempted to conceal their face by subterfuge, such as a false mustache (used in ''[[A Free Ride]]'') or even being masked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=Black and White and Blue: Adult Cinema from the Victorian Age to the VCR|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554903023|pages=67–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBP6yjQwT8QC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few people were ever identified as appearing in such films; and performers were often presumed to have been prostitutes or criminals. [[Vincent Drucci]] is said to have performed in a pornographic film made in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm, ''My Al Capone Museum'' [http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm "Vincent 'The Schemer' Drucci"], Mario Gomes, accessed 14/6/14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Candy Barr]], who appeared in the 1950s ''[[Smart Alec (1951 film)|Smart Alec]]'', was virtually unique among those appearing in stag films, having attained a degree of celebrity through her participation.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/arts/04barr.html?_r=0|title=Candy Barr, 70, Stripper and Star of 1950's Stag Film, Dies |last=Martin |first=Douglas |date=January 4, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, during the late 1960s, there was regular semi-underground production of pornographic films on a modest scale. After answering New York City newspaper advertisements for nude models, [[Eric Edwards (pornographic actor)|Eric Edwards]]  and [[Jamie Gillis]], among others, appeared in these films, which were silent black and white 'loops' of low quality, often intended for peep booth viewing in the proliferation of [[adult video arcade]]s around [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=William J.

==The era==
[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol]]

=== Beginnings ===
''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre|released]] in 1969,&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005" /&gt; and, more freely, ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph|Mona]]'', by [[Bill Osco]], released in 1970,&lt;ref name="PG-20080716" /&gt; were the first films depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical distribution in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PG-20080716" /&gt; Although ''Blue Movie'' involved [[sexual intercourse]], the film, starring [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] and [[Louis Waldon]], included substantial dialogue about the [[Vietnam War]] and various mundane tasks.&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810" /&gt; Besides being a seminal film in the 'Golden Age of Porn', ''Blue Movie'', according to Warhol, was a major influence in the making of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring [[Marlon Brando]], and released a few years after ''Blue Movie'' was made.&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB-BlueMovie"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Blue Movie (1969) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062745 |date= |work=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''Mona'' differed from ''Blue Movie'' by presenting more of a [[Plot (narrative)|story plot]]: Mona (played by Fifi Watson) had promised her mother that she would remain a virgin until her impending marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://picpal.com/fleshgordon/fgint3.html |title=Flesh Gordon Interview 3 |publisher=PicPal.com |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123431/http://picpal.com/fleshgordon/fgint3.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in December 1971, the film ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'', one of the first adult erotic films, after ''Blue Movie'' in 1969,&lt;ref name="WS-1969"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=July 21, 1969: Andy Warhol's Blue Movie Opens |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-1969.html |date=1969 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JW-2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haggerty |first=George E. |title=A Companion to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUf3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=Variety+June+18,+1969+%22Blue+Movie%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fce9PuITMk&amp;sig=YSS9R0fpvprgjHJMeFvp8VxiLoU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinxffWnbnKAhWIrD4KHZIRAUcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Variety%20June%2018%2C%201969%20%22Blue%20Movie%22&amp;f=false |date=2015 |work=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page=339 |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be reviewed by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; was [[55th Street Playhouse|released]] and opened in theaters across the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rutledge (1989) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The film's title is a [[Parody film|parodic]] reference to the [[The Boys in the Band (play)|1968 play]] by [[Mart Crowley]], and the related [[Derivative work|1970 film adaptation]], ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''.&lt;ref name = Halter&gt;{{cite news

===''Deep Throat''===
The 'Golden Age of Porn' continued in 1972 with ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. It officially premiered at the World Theater&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2664/ World Theater] at CinemaTreasures.org&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City on June 12, 1972 and was advertised in ''[[The New York Times]]'' under the [[bowdlerized]] title ''Throat''.

In its second year of release, ''Deep Throat'' just missed ''Variety's'' top 10. However, by then, it was often being shown in a double bill with the most successful of the top three adult erotic films released in the 1972–1973 era, ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'', which easily outperformed ''Deep Throat'', while leaving ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' trailing in third place.&lt;ref name=lewis211-212&gt;Lewis, p.211-212&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Devil in Miss Jones''===
The 1973 film ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' was ranked number seven in  the ''Variety '' list of the  top ten highest-grossing pictures of 1973, despite  lacking the wide release and professional marketing of Hollywood and having been virtually banned across the country for half the year (see Miller v. California, below).&lt;ref name=lewis211-212 /&gt; Some critics have described the film as, along with ''Deep Throat'', one of the "two best erotic motion pictures ever made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offensive literature: decensorship in Britain, 1960–1982|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|author=Sutherland, John |year=1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udkN4xWi2r0C|isbn=0-389-20354-8|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Friedkin]] called ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' a "great film", partly because it was one of the few adult erotic films with a proper storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema|publisher=Indiana University Press|author=Williams, Linda Ruth |year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOiY931rxDEC|isbn=0-253-34713-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] referred to ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' as the "best" of the genre he had seen and gave it three-stars (of four).&lt;ref name="RE-19730613"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Devil In Miss Jones – Film Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devil-in-miss-jones-1973 |date=June 13, 1973 |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert also suggested the film's box office receipts were inflated as a way of [[money laundering|laundering]] the profits from illegal activities, although such a method would have required organised crime to be paying taxes on their illegally obtained income.&lt;ref name="CST-20050211"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Inside Deep Throat |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/inside-deep-throat-2005 |date=February 11, 2005 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market, Eric Schlosser, p144&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Devil in Miss Jones'' was one of the first films to be inducted into the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dirtybob.com/xrco/hall.htm |title=Hall of Fame |publisher=Dirty Bob/X-Rated Critics Organization |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound-recording, cinematography, and story-line of ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' were of a considerably higher quality than any previous porn film. The lead, [[Georgina Spelvin]], who had been in the original Broadway run of ''[[The Pajama Game]]'', combined vigorous sex with an acting performance some thought as convincing as anything to be seen in a good mainstream production. She had been hired as a caterer, but [[Gerard Damiano]], the film director, was impressed with her reading of Miss Jones's dialogue, while auditioning an actor for the non-sex role of 'Abaca'. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s '' review, "With ''The Devil in Miss Jones'', the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may have a tough time ignoring in the future". The review also described the plot as comparable to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s play ''[[No Exit]]'',&lt;ref name=Lewis11&gt;Lewis, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to describe the opening scene as, "a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature."&lt;ref name=Lewis11/&gt; It finished by stating, "Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare." &lt;ref name="Hollywood v.

==="Porno chic"===
{{See also|Pornographication}}
An influential five-page article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1973 described the phenomenon of porn being publicly discussed by celebrities, and taken seriously by critics, a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "porno chic".&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |date=January 21, 1973 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jan Willem | first = Geerinck | title = Porno Chic (blog) | url = http://www.jahsonic.com/PornoChic.html | website = jahsonic.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expressed the opinion that pornographic films would continue to extend their access to US theaters, and the [[Mainstream#In film|mainstream film industry]] would gravitate toward the influence of porn.&lt;ref name="LL-1970"&gt;From a 1970s interview with Linda Lovelace, shown in the documentary ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Police Department 1975"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mafia Money Infiltrates Pornos Movie Business | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19751012&amp;id=uIcpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ctEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=828,4533369&amp;hl=en | work = [[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] | date = October 12, 1975 | access-date = September 5, 2016 | quote = "If the trend continues, these people are going to become a major force in the movie industry within a few years," said Capt.

===Supreme Court's 1973 ''Miller v. California''===
Supreme Court's 1973 ''[[Miller v. California]]'' decision redefined obscenity from "utterly without socially redeeming value" to lacks "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value". Crucially, it made 'contemporary community standards' the criterion, holding that obscenity was not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]; the ruling gave leeway to local judges to seize and destroy prints of films adjudged to violate local community standards. The Miller decision stymied porn distribution.&lt;ref name="Hollywood v. Hard Core" /&gt;
''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'', as well as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and  ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', was prosecuted successfully during the latter half of 1973; the Supreme Court's Miller decision closed much of America to the exhibition of adult erotic films, and often led to it being banned outright.

===Post-1973===
In the aftermath of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision to have put mass box office returns beyond the reach of pornographic films, the leaps in the films' quality that had occurred between 1972 and 1973 were not sustained. With their relatively modest financial means, a predicted move of organized crime into Hollywood failed to materialize.&lt;ref name="New York Police Department 1975"/&gt; Pornographic films continued to be a highly profitable business, and thrived throughout the rest of the 1970s, leading to the concept of porn "stars" gaining currency. Ostracism of porn performers meant they almost invariably used pseudonyms. Being outed as having appeared in porn usually put an end to an actor's hope of a mainstream career.&lt;ref name=Nitke&gt;[[Barbara Nitke|Nitke Barbara]], in {{cite web |url=http://atomiclegdropzine.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/american-ecstasy-the-photography-of-barbara-nitke-and-the-golden-age-of-pornography/ |title=American Ecstasy: The Photography of Barbara Nitke and The Golden Age of Pornography |date=February 4, 2014 |publisher=AtomicLegdropZine.wordpress.com/ |accessdate=June 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527071231/http://atomiclegdropzine.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/american-ecstasy-the-photography-of-barbara-nitke-and-the-golden-age-of-pornography/ |archivedate=May 27, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An indication of the returns still possible was that a 1976 release, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Musical Comedy]]'', favorably reviewed by film critic [[Roger Ebert]] in 1976,&lt;ref name="RE-19761124"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Alice in Wonderland:An X-Rated Musical Fantasy |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alice-in-wonderland-1976 |date=November 24, 1976 |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly grossed over $90 million globally.&lt;ref name="Hollywood v.

In general, after 1973, adult erotic films emulated mainstream filmmaking storylines and conventions, merely to frame the depictions of sexual activity to prepare an 'artistic merit' defense against possible obscenity charges. The adult film industry remained stuck at the level of 'one day wonders', finished by participants hired for only a single day. The ponderous technology of the time meant filming a simple scene would often take hours due to the need for the camera to be laboriously set up for each shot.&lt;ref name=brennan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://susannahbreslin.net/blog/2013/11/21/cx246pc0b0u1ooo36fyytpnrt4hv78 |title=From Sexploitation Star to Porn Star: An Interview with Colleen Brennan | authorlink=Susannah Breslin |first=Susannah |last=Breslin |publisher=Susannah Breslin official site |date=November 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated sustained performances might be required on cue at any time over the course of a day, which was an issue for men without the recourse to modern [[Viagra]]-type drugs.&lt;ref name=Nitke /&gt;&lt;ref name=brennan /&gt; Production was concentrated in New York City where organized crime was widely believed to have control over all aspects of the business, and to prevent entry of competitors. Although their budgets were usually very low, a subcultural level of appreciation exists for films of this era, which were produced by a core group of around thirty performers, some of whom had other jobs. Several were actors who could handle dialogue when required. However, some participants scoffed at the idea that what they did, qualified as "acting".&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood v. Hard Core" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nitke /&gt; By the early 1980s, the rise of home video had led to the end of the era when people went to movie theaters to see sex shot on 35mm film with production values, ultimately culminating with the rise of the internet in the 1990s and beyond.&lt;ref name=Nitke /&gt;

At the time of the maturation of the second wave, movies increasingly were being shot on video for home release.

As their popularity rose, so did their control of their careers. John Holmes became the first recurring porn character in the "Johnny Wadd" film series directed by [[Bob Chinn (film director)|Bob Chinn]]. Lisa De Leeuw was one of the first to sign an exclusive contract with a major adult production company, [[Vivid Video]], and Marilyn Chambers worked in mainstream movies, being one of the first of a rare number of crossover porn actors.

'''''Good Old Schooldays''''' is a 1930 American film produced by [[The Van Beuren Corporation]] and released by [[Pathé|Pathe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=krazykat1977|title=Aesop's Fables - Good Old Schooldays|date=2012-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnSZjByCySA|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which features Milton and Rita Mouse, was directed by [[John Foster (cartoonist)|John Foster]] and Mannie Davis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Released on March 7, 1930,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M7vwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=good+old+schooldays+aesop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WPyyi601kq&amp;sig=o9iWfhEb0C4My7n8_r0BXqIuiN8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2kKmo3tjbAhXCDcAKHRB9BpAQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=good%20old%20schooldays%20aesop&amp;f=false|title=The First Hollywood Sound Shorts, 1926–1931|last=Bradley|first=Edwin M.|date=2009-04-27|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476606842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film takes place inside of a schoolhouse, and is part of a series entitled [[Aesop's Sound Fables|''Aesop's Sound Fables'']], though its plot has no relation to the fables.

==Characters==
As with many of the Aesop Sound Fables at that time, this cartoon featured both Milton and Rita Mouse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are also other characters, like goats, dogs, and mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The school dancing, from Good Old Schooldays (1930).png|thumb|289x289px|The school dancing.]]
The film starts with many species of animals traveling to school. The teacher rings a bell to signal the start of lessons. In response of the bell, the teacher is flung about by the excited students entering the school. The children to sing "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", which was a ''[[de facto]]'' anthem for America at that time. After the singing, an animal gives the teacher an [[apple]], before taking it back and eating it when the teacher wasn't looking. Rita then plays a [[piano]], and Milton sings a [[song]]. However, he forgets the words and begins to sing phrases of nonsense. After the performance, the teacher asks a mouse (named Willie Jones) in the class if he has written his composition yet. Jones says no, but he can whistle "the theme song". He then brings out a [[flute]] and starts to play. The other animals join in, using both themselves and various items as instruments. These include a goat using his [[dunce cap]] as a trumpet, the elephant using his trunk as a [[trombone]], and several duck's using their beaks as a [[xylophone]]. Due to the music, the schoolhouse comically dances. As a result of the dancing, the building collapses and all the animals run out of it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The film ends with a moral, which is unrelated to the preceding film and portrayed as a cartoon featuring a man and a girl. The man states that "A Powdered Nose is No Guarantee of a Clean Neck." This angers the lady, who trips him up with her foot and hits him in the head with her [[Handbag|purse]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reception ==
''Good Old Schooldays'' received mixed reviews in the cinema review magazines at that time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/motionpic41moti|title=Motion Picture News (Jan - Mar 1930)|last=Motion Picture News|first=|date=1930|publisher=New York, Motion Picture News|others=New York The Museum of Modern Art Library|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/filmdailyvolume55152newy|title=The Film Daily (Jan-Jun 1930)|last=New York|first=Wid's Films and Film Folk|date=1930|publisher=New York, Wid's Films and Film Folks, Inc.|others=Media History Digital Library|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was featured as &lt;nowiki&gt;''Okay''&lt;/nowiki&gt; by the ''[[Motion Picture News]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The magazine said that whilst "This release has sufficient merriment to tickle the sides of the crabbish", the magazine criticised the lack of amusing gags and the magazine's closing note for the cartoon was that it was "Okay for a heavy feature".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The cartoon was viewed more favorable by [[The Film Daily|''The Film Daily'']],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; who said the film was a "highly amusing filler".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice''''' is a [[dark fantasy]] [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by the British video game development studio [[Ninja Theory]]. Self-described as an "[[Independent video game development|independent]] [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA game]]", it was created by a team of approximately twenty developers led by writer and director Tameem Antoniades. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in August 2017, with an [[Xbox One]] version in April 2018. The game features support for [[virtual reality]], which was added in an update in 2018. 

Inspired by [[Norse mythology]] and [[Celts|Celtic culture]], ''Hellblade'' follows Senua, a [[Pict]] warrior who must make her way to [[Hel (location)|Helheim]] by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess [[Hel (being)|Hela]]. In parallel, the game acts as a [[metaphor]] for the character's struggle with [[psychosis]], as Senua, who suffers from the condition but believes it to be a curse, is haunted by an entity known as the "Darkness", [[Auditory hallucination|voices in her head]] known as "Furies", and memories from her past. To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with [[neuroscientist]]s, mental health specialists, and people suffering from the condition.

The game blends several [[Video game genre|genres]], including [[hack and slash]], [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]], and [[psychological horror]]. [[Voice acting]] is an integral part of the game, while its [[cutscene]]s combine [[motion capture]] by Melina Juergens, and [[live action]] performances by other actors. ''Hellblade'' was a commercial success and was well received by critics, who praised it as a [[Video games as an art form|work of art]] and applauded its uncommon choice of revolving around psychosis, the quality and uniqueness of its approach of the condition, and its story and main character. Its overall presentation, along with Juergens' performance, were also considered superior in quality to what independent games usually provide, although its [[gameplay]] and other elements received some criticism. The game sold over a million copies across all platforms by June 2018.

== Gameplay ==
''Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice'' is divided in two types of gameplay: the first allows Senua to walk freely and interact with her surroundings. Those parts focus on either story via voiceover, as Senua travels from one location to another, or the resolution of a puzzle or challenge of some kind to progress further. She can use a capacity known as "focus", in reference to her tendency to see things differently from other people due to her condition, to trigger puzzle-related events. If she uses her focus on totems hidden throughout the game, it triggers a memory via [[voice-over]] of her friend Druth telling her of the [[Norse mythology|stories of the Norsemen]]; activating all forty-four of them triggers a bonus cutscene shortly before the game's climax, that extends on Druth's backstory.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; Several [[Level (video gaming)|areas]] feature their own exclusive mechanics or trials, such as reaching a safe zone in time before Senua dies, or using the focus ability to modify the structure of her surroundings.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

In addition, ''Hellblade'' features fights against malformed representations of Northmen who block her progression, including occasional [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. During those fights, Senua has her sword drawn out, and is turned towards one of her enemies, on which the camera is automatically focused; she can use two kind of attacks, quick or heavy, kick an enemy to prevent it from blocking her attacks, [[Parry (fencing)|parry]], or dodge.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; She can also charge the opponent she is currently focusing on, to either get closer or directly attack or kick it.&lt;ref name="PCGN"/&gt; If she parries or dodges enough, she can use her focus ability in battle to move faster than her enemies or dissipate the shadows some of them are made of, which makes them impervious to regular attacks.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; Once she obtains [[Gram (mythology)|Gramr]], Senua can charge her heavy attacks for additional damage and parries more efficiently, both of which can allow her to use her focus ability. If Senua suffers a strong hit, or several hits in a row, she falls to the ground, and the player must press the corresponding button repeatedly as fast as possible before an enemy deals her a fatal blow; if she does not get back up in time, she dies. The closer she is to death, the harder it is for her to get back up; she can also die from a regular hit, if she was already very close to death.

''Hellblade'' does not feature any [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] or tutorials. Instead, Druth, Furies, or the Darkness, provide audio indications on [[game mechanics]], and how to progress through levels and puzzles.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; The Furies also provide Senua advice in battle, notably warning her if an enemy is attacking from her back.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; They react when Senua takes damage, and panic heavily if she is close to death: how nervous they are when she takes a hit is representative of how much damage she can still take.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The nature of most apparitions, events witnessed, or voices heard, is purposely left unclear, and can be interpreted as either an actual apparition by a spirit, a memory of Senua, or a trick created by the Darkness or one of the deceptive creatures she has to face.&lt;ref name="PCGN"/&gt; As such, the clues given during the game are not always reliable, except for Druth's: certain Furies try to demotivate Senua, or give false indications such as telling her she took the wrong way, or that she is walking into a trap.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt; Another core mechanic is the possibility of [[permadeath]], which is meant to delete the player's [[saved game|save data]] after they surpass a number of deaths.&lt;ref name="Permadeath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer2"/&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the late [[8th century]], the game starts with Senua (Melina Juergens), a [[Pict]] warrior from [[Orkney]] arriving at the border of [[Hel (location)|Helheim]] in a quest to save the soul of her dead lover, Dillion ([[Oliver Walker]]), from the goddess [[Hel (being)|Hela]].&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt; Senua believes she suffers from a [[curse]], and hears "Furies", voices in her head commenting her every actions, notably one, the Narrator ([[Chipo Chung]]), who is aware of the player's presence and talks to them. She is also followed by the Darkness ([[Steven Hartley]]), a dark entity at the core of the curse. She carries Dillion's severed head to use it as a vessel to his soul, and is also guided by her memories of the stories of Druth (Nicholas Boulton), a former slave of the [[Norsemen]] well versed in their legends, now deceased, who became her friend and mentor during a year-long self-imposed [[exile]]. To enter Helheim, Senua defeats both the fire [[Jötunn|giant]] [[Surtr|Surt]] and the spirit of illusions [[Valravn]], but as she crosses the bridge to Helheim, is attacked by Hela, who defeats her with a single blow, shattering her sword. Barely surviving the encounter, she follows visions of Druth and a man-shaped light she believes to be Dillion to a great tree where she faces four challenges linked to her past, and is rewarded with the legendary sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gramr]], strong enough to kill gods.

Meanwhile, Senua's backstory is unveiled through her hallucinations, revealing that her mother Galena (Ellie Piercy) suffered the same curse she did, but did not believe it to be dreadful. However, Senua's devoutly religious father Zynbel (also performed by Hartley) did, and burned Galena alive. Senua witnessed the event at age five, which caused her psychosis to worsen significantly and led her to convince herself her mother died willingly. Her father, convincing her that her condition was a curse, abused Senua emotionally and physically and isolated her from the rest of the world until she met Dillion when he visited her village. The two fell in love, and Senua left her father to be with him, as he saw her as different and misunderstood instead of cursed. However, after a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] killed many in Dillion's village, Senua, believing the fault to be hers, left in exile. When she returned a year later having hopefully left the Darkness behind, she found everyone killed by Norsemen who had invaded, sacrificing Dillion in a [[blood eagle]] to their gods.&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt; Remembering the stories of Druth, Senua departed on her journey to save Dillion's soul from the gods of the Norsemen.

Ultimately, Senua fights against the influence of the Darkness and defeats the beast [[Garmr|Garm]]. She then realizes the Darkness is a representation of her father's abuse and beliefs, and frees herself from the Furies. Soon after, she faces a legion of Hela's warriors in a hopeless fight, and is killed. In her final moments, she recalls Dillion telling her of the importance of the acceptance of loss. As the imagery of Helheim fades away, Hela drops Dillion's head into the abyss, but as the camera returns to her, Senua is standing in her place, with a dead Hela in place of Senua's body. Having accepted that it was never possible to bring her lover back, and that she is not responsible for his death or anyone else's, Senua frees herself from the Darkness' influence, and accepts the Furies not as a curse, but a part of who she is. She invites the player to follow her, while the Narrator says her goodbyes to the player.

==Development==

''Hellblade'' was announced for the [[PlayStation 4]] at Sony's [[Gamescom]] media briefing on August 12, 2014, where a trailer was shown. In a joint statement, Ninja Theory described the game as "an experience focused on delivering a deep character in a twisted world, with brutal uncompromising combat", and stated that they wanted to "make a smaller, more focused game experience that is uncompromising in its combat, art and story".&lt;ref name="Sony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/08/12/hellblade-revealed-for-ps4-developed-by-ninja-theory/|title=Ninja Theory's Hellbalde announced|last=Matthews|first=Dominic|work=[[Playstation]]|date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813071358/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/08/12/hellblade-revealed-for-ps4-developed-by-ninja-theory/|archivedate=August 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers called it an "[[Independent video game development|independent]] [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA game]]", with their goal being to make a game with all the qualities and production values of any AAA game on the market, but with creative freedom and an "indie spirit".&lt;ref name="RedBullGames-2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/hellblade-ninja-theory-interview|title=Why Hellblade is the world’s biggest indie game|first=Damien|last=McFerran|website=[[Red Bull Games]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015090459/https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/hellblade-ninja-theory-interview|archivedate=October 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team eventually succeeded in releasing the game independently, but to achieve this could only release it via [[digital distribution]].&lt;ref name="Break Even"/&gt;&lt;ref name="$29.99"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-release-date|title=Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is only $29.99 - here's why|first=Kirk|last=McKeand|work=wcfftech|date=June 6, 2017|accessdate=November 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707133453/https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-release-date|archivedate=July 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing ===
The main inspiration of Senua's character was the [[Iceni]] queen [[Boudica]], while her name came from [[Senuna]], a Celtic goddess long lost to historians but re-discovered in 2002, whose name was at first read incorrectly as Senua.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; Based on what is believed of the way Celtic warriors looked, Senua was given war paints, and braided hair clumped with [[Lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; Doing research to find the right angle for the character, the team found out that in the [[8th century]], the [[Roman Empire]] had conquered almost all of [[Europe]], but were unable to conquer a group of [[Celts]] in the northern reaches of [[Great Britain]] known as the [[Picts]]. Towards the end of the century, the first [[Viking]]s arrived in the lands of the Picts, more specifically the islands of [[Orkney]], and quickly replaced them as the main population of the land. Based on the belief that the Norsemen were known for sacrificing the leaders of the tribes they had conquered to their gods, the game's director and lead writer Tameem Antoniades decided to use this as the basis for Senua's quest and trauma, and to have her find everyone in her village killed by the Norsemen and her lover sacrificed to Norse gods via the [[blood eagle]], a ritualized method of execution whose authenticity is actually debated among historians.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Frank | first =Roberta | title =Viking atrocity and Skaldic verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle | journal =English Historical Review | volume =XCIX | issue =CCCXCI | pages =332–343 | publisher =Oxford Journals | date =1984 | url =http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCIX/CCCXCI/332.full.pdf+html | doi =10.1093/ehr/XCIX.CCCXCI.332 | accessdate =30 March 2015 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160209061037/http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCIX/CCCXCI/332.full.pdf+html | archivedate =February 9, 2016 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy"&gt;{{cite book| last =Tracy| first =Larissa| title =Torture and Brutality in Medieval Literature: Negotiations of National Identity| publisher =DS Brewer| date =2012| location =| pages =109–111| url =http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853| isbn =9781843842880| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194210/http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853| archivedate =September 23, 2015| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;{{cite web| last =Dash| first =Mike| authorlink =Mike Dash| title =The Vengeance of Ivarr the Boneless| website =Smithsonian.com| publisher =Smithsonian| date =18 March 2013| url =http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-vengeance-of-ivarr-the-boneless-4002654/| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Antoniades, the team, researching [[Celts|Celtic culture]] and the Celts' views on mental disorder, found out that they used the term "gelt" for a man or woman who had been driven mad by a curse, grief, or the trauma of a battle, and that the gelt would take to a life in the woods in search of penance, punishment and purgatory; the team decided to make Senua a gelt, who had left her home in exile for those reasons. The character of Druth was based on both a real Irish Celt named Findan who was enslaved by the Norsemen in the 8th century, but eventually escaped and became a monk, and the Celtic tale of "a mad sinner who flees battle into exile and takes on a beastly nature, growing feathers on his body". The character was given a backstory similar to Findan's, a cloak featuring feathers, and was named after another word used by the Celts to describe mental disorder, "druth", meaning "fool" or "one who utters the words of gods".&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt;

=== Inclusion of psychosis ===
Antoniades and his team initially conceptualized ''Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice'' as "a compelling, adult, fantasy game".&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/mind/hellblade-senua%E2%80%99s-sacrifice-psychosis-interview|title=How Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice deals with psychosis|last=Lloyd|first=James|date=October 10, 2017|website=[[BBC Focus|Science Focus]]|access-date=August 16, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813183747/http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/mind/hellblade-senua%E2%80%99s-sacrifice-psychosis-interview|archivedate=August 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was always supposed to be hinted as taking place in Senua's mind, but with her mental illness originally less central to the story. However, the team came to see it as an opportunity to raise awareness on psychosis; regarding the team's interest with the condition, Antoniades stated "It is easy to see the pain and suffering caused by physical diseases or physical trauma, it is not so easy to see the mental suffering or trauma or severe mental illness. But what if we could find a way to see it ? Games are capable of drawing you in for hours on end, playing the role of a character who's different from you, experiencing their perspective, and actively involving you in a world that functions with a different set of rules. [...] There are many things that happen in the world of ''Hellblade'' that make perfect sense within the context of Senua's mind. [...] To complete Senua's quest, you have to internalize and accept the logic and meaning behind these things to progress"; he notably felt that using the tendency of certain psychotics to see patterns others would not see or notice as a game mechanic to solve puzzles would provide a unique angle impossible in media other than video games.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/10/8760093/hellblade-ps4-mental-illness-video|title=In PS4's Hellblade, hell is a warrior's mental illness|first=Owen|last=S.

{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote="It’s been refreshing to see a representation of psychosis in which the person isn’t just a sort of passive receptacle for madness. Senua is the hero of her own story, trying to make sense of her experiences and work her way through them – that’s incredibly de-stigmatising. In representations of mental illness onscreen, you usually have the illness first, and then a two-dimensional character attached to that. In this case, the character is fully-formed, and they are not defined by their condition."| source =—Prof. Paul Fletcher, [[neuroscientist]] and psychosis expert, who worked on the game.&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt;|width=18%|align=right}}
Antoniades admitted that during his research, he "didn't have to look very far to discover my own ignorance of the subject".&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; To portray psychosis properly, Ninja Theory "consulted world-leading neuroscientists and non-profit organizations like [[Wellcome Trust]] to properly capture the experience of psychosis and its devastating effects on the human mind".&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/08/09/hellblade-mental-illness-ninja-theory/#/slide/1 |title=Hellblade and Why Mental Illness Needs the Mainstream Spotlight |last=Briers |first=Michael |date=August 9, 2017 |website=PlayStationLifeStyle.net |access-date=August 13, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809212216/http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/08/09/hellblade-mental-illness-ninja-theory/#/slide/1 |archivedate=August 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoniades "learnt that people can experience hallucinations and delusional beliefs without it being a problem – the illness comes when those experiences cause suffering. Often the recovery is not about curing yourself of hallucinations, but finding ways to live with them. That was a revelation to me".&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt;

Experts who worked closely with the team include [[Professor]] Paul Fletcher from the [[University of Cambridge]], and writer and psychologist Professor Charles Fernyhough from the [[Durham University|University of Durham]], an expert on [[Auditory hallucination|voice hearing]].&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; Ninja Theory received funding for the game from the Wellcome Trust, who also helped them creatively in their depiction of mental illness, notably by helping them to get in contact with people suffering from it.&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt; They also worked with a "recovery college", an establishment which acts as both a [[health facility]], and a [[college]] for its patients. Antoniades was marked by the story of "a girl who has to live with an angry voice screaming at her, slamming on her doors and walls 24 hours a day. That's someone who would often see corpses hanging in the room, so real that they would sometimes try to rescue them"; this inspired several events featured in the game as well.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt;

When working with experts, the team realized that "quite often, the illness comes not from the [[symptom]]s, but from the [[Social stigma|stigma]], [[Social isolation|isolation]], and [[Abuse|mistreatment]] that comes about from the rest of society". This led the team to make Senua's father and the way he abused and isolated her during her youth the real nature of the Darkness which haunts her.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; To create the voices heard by Senua, the team "worked closely with a group of voice-hearers to try and get these sounding as realistic as possible"; Senua's visual hallucinations, including her flashbacks, or the way several elements of a level appear brighter than they should be, were also based on descriptions from people suffering from delusions.&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt; In June 2017, the team presented the near-finished game to several of the people suffering from mental illness they had collaborated with, as a way to see if the final result had "reflected their views or if it had misrepresented them".

=== Casting, filming and recording ===
Senua's [[voice acting]] and [[motion capturing]] were performed by German freelance photographer and [[video editor]] Melina Juergens, who had never done either of those things prior to ''Hellblade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://melinajuergens.wixsite.com/portfolio|website=melinajuergens.wixsite.com|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was used by the team as a [[stand-in]] for Senua for several months while they perfected their motion capture techniques, and they eventually came to the conclusion that she could play the character in the finalized game. Game director and lead writer Tameem Antoniades stated that he knew her well enough to know that he did not have to teach her how to act, but to "relive her own internal pain".&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; All [[cutscene]]s feature Juergens' vocal performance as she recorded it during the filming of her physical performance with motion capture suit and markers, rather than before or afterwards during a voice acting session.&lt;ref name="Diary18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt; In addition to the camera placed in front of Juergens' face to capture her expressions for her animated counterpart, Antoniades used a portable camera to film the scenes as they appear in the final game. As they only had one camera, the team opted to make all the cutscenes be presented as one single [[long take]], the objective being to make the viewer feel like "an observer, like a presence watching Senua throughout".&lt;ref name="Diary18"/&gt;

Operating on a much smaller budget with ''Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice'' than their previous games, Ninja Theory went out of their usual ways to film the cut scenes of the game. Instead of going to bigger studios and having a team of approximately 20 people film several actors together, like they did in the past, they filmed only Juergens in a small space, with only three other people needed on set: Antoniades directing and filming, one person to look after the audio, and one person to look after the motion capture process. To save more money, the team used equipment described by Antoniades as "fairly cheap", including material bought at a low price at [[IKEA]] and on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="Diary18"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 4, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=250&amp;v=FACTByOjqyQ|title=Hellblade Development Diary 18: The Shoot Set Up|publisher=[[Ninja Theory]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a further cost-saving measure, they used their own boardroom for the motion capture scenes, rather than using external motion capture studio spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/ninja-theory-boardroom-budget-hellblade-gdc-2018 | title = Hellblade's Budget Required Ninja Theory to Use Their Own Boardroom as a Motion Capture Studio | first=  Caty | last = McCarthy | date = March 22, 2018 | accessdate = March 22, 2018 | work = [[USGamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet capturing Juergens' expressions and voice was provided to the team by Technoprops. The team opted to feature only two cameras on the helmet, as they felt that having four would be too uncomfortable for Juergens and impact her performance. The audio recording device was the most expensive part of the setup, and was placed around Juergens' forehead to avoid recording breathing sounds. Because all of Juergens' audio was recorded live, the team could not give her indications or reminders directly, or play music she would synchronize her performance with. For this reason, pre-recorded audio notes by Antoniades and excerpts from the soundtrack would be played at the same time on headphones both he and Juergens would wear, so they could act accordingly and in synchronization with each other.&lt;ref name="Diary18"/&gt;

To feature the voices in Senua's head in a way that would be realistic regarding actual people suffering [[auditory hallucination]]s, the team, based on descriptions by Professor Charles Fernyhough, an expert on the subject, recorded several actors using [[binaural recording]] that also records the 3D position of sound, so the voices would sound as close or distant as the actors were to the microphone, replicating the way human ears perceive sounds. The team then invited voice hearers to listen to the result in order to give them feedback for future recordings.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt; The original score for the game was composed by David García and [[Andy LaPlegua]]; the song "Just Like Sleep" by Passarella Death Squad is played during the final battle, and the song "Illusion" by [[VNV Nation]] plays during the ending credits.

The game received "generally favorable reviews", according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt; Its choice to depict and revolve around [[psychosis]] was applauded as a unique and interesting choice, as was the execution of those themes, and the idea of blending its approach with Norse mythology and the [[grief]]-ridden journey of Senua. Juergens' performance, and the game's sound, artistic direction, tense atmosphere, and low price, were also praised; the quality of its production value and graphics was singled out as superior to what independent games usually offer.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="play"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGN"&gt;{{cite web |last=McKeand |first=Kirk |date=August 8, 2017 |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-permadeath-review-pc |title=Hellblade is frustrating, confusing, and uncomfortable, but that's the point |publisher=''[[PCGamesN]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223114520/https://www.pcgamesn.com//hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-permadeath-review-pc |archivedate=December 23, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wtech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/review/hellblade-senua-sacrifice-masterpiece/|title=Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice Review – An Independent Masterpiece with AAA Quality|first=Alessio|last=Palumbo|work=wcfftech|date=August 19, 2017|accessdate=November 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902030856/http://wccftech.com/review/hellblade-senua-sacrifice-masterpiece/|archivedate=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RedBullGames-2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="$29.99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/games-like-hellblade-are-eroding-the-border-between-indie-and-triple-a/|title=Games like Hellblade are eroding the border between indie and triple-A|first=Lief|last=Johnson|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=November 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114033459/http://www.pcgamer.com/games-like-hellblade-are-eroding-the-border-between-indie-and-triple-a/|archivedate=November 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reception of the combats and puzzles were more mixed, with several reviewers complaining about combat being too repetitive and simplistic, the lack of variety in the enemies, and about the puzzles being redundant.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

Brandin Tyrrel of [[IGN]] praised the story, sound, directing, art direction, voice acting, music, and innovative presentation, and stating "it unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it’s punctuated by moments of beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me." He added "As impressive as [''Hellblade's''] story is, Ninja Theory’s smart design reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and intuitive mechanics [...] Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it’s a game or a story".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Brad Shoemaker of [[Giant Bomb]] stated as a narrative effort, its success was "almost unparalleled in the medium". He applauded the story, sound, characters, graphics, Juergens' performance and "piercing intensity". He appreciated the less artistic elements, but felt that the gameplay for battles was "usually satisfying but can also feel like a chore in confined spaces". However, the described the boss fights as "all unique and exceptionally memorable".&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt; Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' gave the game a 9 out of 10, praising its "incredibly compelling story", "fast, stylish combat", and "beautiful and horrible audio and visual design".&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;
{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote="''Hellblade''{{'}}s gameplay mechanics are few and relatively straightforward--though at half the price of most games with this quality of production, that's easier to forgive--but as a narrative effort its success is almost unparalleled in the medium."| source =—[[Giant Bomb]]&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;|width=18%|align=right}}
In a positive review, Leif Johnson of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised ''Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice'' for its themes, presentation and story, but complained that the "inspiration doesn't carry over to the actual fights. [...] I frankly found it kind of dull in the one-on-one duels at the start, and it didn't help that the enemies sometimes seem to skip a few animations when reacting to attacks. Nor does it help that there's precious little variation in the foes themselves, who almost always show up as tall, shirtless warriors with deer-skull helmets or as beefy berserker shamans. By the end of the first hour, you've basically seen every non-boss you're going to see". He did, however, consider combat to get much better once Senua has to face many enemies at once.&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; In one of the rare publications to give the game a somewhat negative review, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' was unhappy with the game's depiction of Senua's condition.&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/critic-reviews?dist=negative|title=Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (negative reviews)|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226174030/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/critic-reviews?dist=negative|archivedate=February 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers were less enthusiastic, with most criticism directed at the gameplay, fights and puzzles; however, most of them still praised ''Hellblade'' as a work of art. Among those were ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s review, who found ''Hellblade'' to be "undeniably memorable, telling a compelling tale that explores subject matter many consider taboo". However, he believed that the gameplay suffered from the game's themes. Unaware of the fake nature of the game's supposed permadeath, he complained that it was too unclear how close to a permanent game over he was, and felt the sense that he was in "frustrating". He also found the puzzles tedious, and believed that the idea of the fight sequences allowing certain enemies to be offscreen translated poorly to gameplay.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

=== Depiction of psychosis ===

The game's depiction of psychosis was applauded, and often described as the game's greatest quality. Several media outlets and reviewers analysed the game's depiction of psychosis in more detail: it was noted that all parts of the game, including the fights and puzzles, were made to further the depiction of Senua's psychosis and revolved around her condition.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt; Paul Fletcher, a [[neuroscientist]] and psychosis expert at the [[University of Cambridge]] who worked on the game, said that "It’s been exciting to see Senua received so positively by those who have lived with experiences of psychosis".&lt;ref name="BBCFocus"/&gt;

Michael Briers of ''PlayStationLifeStyle.net'', stated that, "by working closely with neuroscientists and those unfortunate few who have been diagnosed as psychotic, ''Hellblade'' carefully avoids those cheap, half-assed tropes that render a character insane and, therefore, woefully one-dimensional. Not only does it act as a disservice to those who suffer with mental illness, this practice of painting in broad strokes only minimizes the room for nuance, but ''Senua’s Sacrifice'' boldly cuts through the white noise".&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; Leif Johnson of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the gripping depiction of a character suffering from psychosis, stating "Ninja Theory uses haunted eyes to full effect in long, moody closeups peppering the narrative. [Senua] peers not only into the darkness, but seemingly past the camera, past the screen. Looking back, I found depths of despair and anger there that were sometimes hard to meet head on [...] Some people would crumble under such pain. But still Senua fights. It's a little inspiring."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt;

Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' noted that although Senua's psychosis is a cause of tragedy in her life, the game also depicted her condition as something that can bring her contentment, stating that her hallucinations are sometimes "actually lovely too, reflecting that psychosis can manifest as colour and beauty." Regarding the story as a whole, she stated "you [the player] learn about the trauma Senua has faced, made greater by her struggles with her own mental health and others' lack of understanding of it. Great care has been taken, with input every step of the way from psychologists and people who have experienced psychosis, to give as faithful a representation of it as possible. The hardest battles are fought in the mind, says Dillion, although Senua has physical battles as well".&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

Mollie L Patterson of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' declared that "while I can’t speak to that side of things from personal experience, I can tell you that I was legitimately affected by [Senua's] condition at times. Playing a good portion of the game with headphones on, quiet moments were often broken by the never-ending chatter of those other selves conflicting in their thoughts, with some wanting to help their host in her quest, and others constantly telling Senua (and you) that she was wrong in her choices, that she was destined to failure, or that it was all hopeless. It’s hard to explain how powerful those words can be, even as a player detached from Senua’s condition, and it was one of many elements that helped form a bond between us.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt;
{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote="It's very hard to represent what this experience is like, partly because it's such a personal, intense, emotional experience. [...] What they've come up with is so compelling, it's by far the best representation I've heard of what these experiences are like."| source =—Prof. Charles Fernyhough, expert on [[Auditory hallucination|voice hearing]], on the game's portrayal of the voices in Senua's head.&lt;ref name="Senua's Psychosis"/&gt;|width=18%|align=right}}
Shoemaker also stated "''Hellblade''{{'}}s single most powerful trick is a near-constant stream of voices in Senua's head, recorded with a spatial audio technique so they feel like they're all around you, nagging at you, undermining your decisions and your confidence. These voices are frequently in conflict with what you're doing and even with each other; one side can be encouraging you while the other mocks you mercilessly. The effect is striking. Over time Senua's pain becomes palpable, incontestable, especially as the stress worsens the longer these voices harangue you, the more vicious and deranged they become. It's important to remember that you as the player, though, have the luxury of turning them off whenever you want. ''Hellblade''{{'}}s robust bag of psychological tricks and the sheer fact of Senua's distressing reality result in the game's uncommon ability to capture the feelings of worthlessness, lack of control, of being misunderstood and shunned, the strange mix of hope and despair that can accompany a debilitating mental illness".&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

Not all media outlets were satisfied with the game's depiction of the condition. In an article he published to criticize the game, ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'' gaming editor Jason Faulkner, who had experience working with the mentally ill, praised Senua's character, but was highly critical of the game, stating that it should have focused on helping people to truly understand psychosis, and have the condition be "focal and explicit", instead of representing it metaphorically: "If you go into the game without any background information, you might assume that Senua is living with delusions and Norse mythology-inspired hallucinations — or you might think that she’s being haunted by demons and ghosts. [...] The portrayal of Senua’s mental illness would be better served by showing both sides of her story: what’s in her head and what’s actually happening." He also stated that the game "stifles the opportunity to inject commentary about the broader picture of mental health care", notably by not depicting [[caregiver]]s or other people dedicated to helping those with mental illness in real life. Unlike most articles reflecting on the ending, who saw it as a metaphor for Senua learning to live with her illness, Faulkner believed that the ending was magically curing Senua, and condemned the game for it.&lt;ref name="Mic"&gt;{{cite web |last=Faulkner|first=Jason |date=August 15, 2017 |url=https://mic.com/articles/183611/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-mental-illness-plot-device#.OEqsc7Gk4 |title=‘Hellblade’ tries to show the real experience of psychosis — but ends up using it as a plot device|publisher=''[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'' |accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' deplored that Senua's psychosis was depicted as "something of an asset: a helpful superpower that can give you the strength to soldier on through the darkness, so long as you can put up with the odd breakdown here and there."&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt;

=== Death mechanic ===
Early in the game, after Senua's hand turns to [[Decomposition#Fresh|rot]] because she got "tainted", the Darkness tells her that every time she "dies" (every death turns out to be a vision of a possible future), the rot will spread further up, until it reaches her head and consumes her soul; the game implies that, if this happens, it will result in a [[permadeath]], as the player's save would be deleted, and all game progress until then would be erased. However, several media outlets later found out that the rot stops spreading after a certain amount of deaths, and cannot progress further before a certain point in the game, ultimately making it impossible for it to reach Senua's head.&lt;ref name="Permadeath"&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Ben |date=August 8, 2017 |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-permadeath-bluff |title=Hellblade’s permadeath is a bluff |publisher=''[[PCGamesN]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025003009/https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-permadeath-bluff |archivedate=October 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=August 9, 2017 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-09-theres-more-to-hellblades-permadeath-than-meets-the-eye |title=There's more to Hellblade's permadeath than meets the eye |publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923095319/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-09-theres-more-to-hellblades-permadeath-than-meets-the-eye |archivedate=September 23, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid McCarter of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' strongly defended Ninja Theory's move, calling it "great game design and a modern expression of unreliable narration". He stated "As the story progresses, the nature of the corruption becomes clearer as the player comes to understand a correlation between Senua’s backstory and psychology and the way they perceive the game’s dangers. It is a beautifully executed bit of narrative design, game systems and story working in tandem."&lt;ref name="PermadeathPoint"&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarter |first=Reid |date=August 11, 2017 |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/how-hellblades-permadeath-works-isnt-the-point/ |title=How Hellblade's permadeath works isn't the point |publisher=''[[PC Gamer]]'' |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821055317/http://www.pcgamer.com/how-hellblades-permadeath-works-isnt-the-point/ |archivedate=August 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PCGamesN]]'' called it a "clever decision", as it "focuses on Senua’s own fear of her enemies and degrading mental state".&lt;ref name="Permadeath"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called it "a cool trick that makes the player feel a sense of dread as they're playing the game. Dread, anxiety and death are all themes ''Hellblade'' revolves around. It certainly fits".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer2"/&gt;

Antoniades said that the permadeath mechanic was a bluff: while the rot will spread on Senua's body over repeated deaths, it will never fully reach her head; the wording they chose to describe this was meant to convey part of the fear associated with mental illness and psychosis directly to the player. Antoniades said "We were looking for ideas of how you introduce fear, and one of those ideas was the permadeath mechanic. It's the only time we're very explicit about what will happen to you in the game." He considered that they believed that players and critics have mistaken their wording on the permadeath mechanic when the game was released, which created a "blowout", but he defended their use of the wording as "it's your interpretation as a player that taints the meaning behind it.

In addition to the awards received by the game, the team of ''Hellblade'', including Antoniades and Juergens, won the award for Best Real-Time Graphics &amp; Interactivity at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 2016, for a showcase demonstration of a technique they called "Realtime Cinematography", during which they performed and filmed live a scene from ''Hellblade'', which was "shot, captured and edited to final quality in minutes, a process that would normally take weeks or months".&lt;ref name="BestRealTime"/&gt;

'''''Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome''''' (also known as '''''Imperivm III: Great Battles of Rome''''' or '''''Imperivm RTC: Great Battles of Rome''''') is a sequel to RPG/[[real-time strategy|RTS]] games ''[[Celtic Kings: Rage of War]]'' and ''[[Imperivm II: The Punic Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/imperivm_great_battles_of_rome |title=Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome |author=fista1.103 |access-date=15 November 2018 |work=[[Gog.com]] |publisher=[[CD Projekt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game, released in May 2005, was developed by [[Haemimont Games|Haemimont]] together with [[FX Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fx-interactive-presents-imperivm-great-battles-of-rome-at-e3 |title=FX Interactive Presents Imperivm - Great Battles Of Rome At E3 |date=16 May 2005 |access-date=15 November 2018 |work=Games Industry |location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game contains various civilizations to choose from, among them are: Rome (Imperial and Republican), Egypt, Germania, Brittania, Iberia, Gaul and Carthage. It has a more elaborate hero system over its predecessor.

== Gameplay ==
The game focuses on tactics, troop mobility and terrain topography rather than sheer strength of numbers for winning battles. Though resources are important, there is less relevance in gathering them than in other real-time battle games. Instead of sending an army of servants to mine, lumber, collect food or gather any other kind of resources these are generated at a constant rate directly proportional to the inhabitants of a population center.

There are 3 player modes to choose from:

*Conquest: The battles involved on this game are focused on raising an empire by conquering all the known ancient world, the user can choose any of the available civilizations (see below) to do so.
*Rome's Greatest Battles: A good amount of effort has been dedicated to historical accuracy; not only on the graphics but on the story line of this pre-built scenarios on which the player can live Rome's defining moments, from [[Battle of Zama|The Battle of Zama]] which marked the final and decisive end of the [[Second Punic War]] to the rebellion of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra.
*Custom Game: These feature is always present in modern-day real time tactic and strategy games, it can be used to practice against computer opponents on custom made scenarios or to go on-line and battle against other human players

=== Civilizations ===

There are different civilizations to choose from, each with unique weakness and strengths: [[Egypt]], [[Carthage]], [[Republican Rome]], [[Imperial Rome]], [[Gallia]], [[Germania]], [[Hispania]] and [[Britannia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.fxinteractive.com/p067/images/Guia%20Desafios%20de%20Roma.pdf |title=Guía de juego |date=January 2005 |location=Madrid |access-date=25 November 2018 |language=es |work=[[FX Interactive]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20150919015108/http://www.fxinteractive.com/p067/images/Guia%20Desafios%20de%20Roma.pdf |archive-date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battles ===
''Imperivm: Great Battles of Rome'' revives the battles which made Ancient Rome one of the great empire of the world, such as the [[Siege of Numantia]], [[Battle of Actium|August victory against Mark Antony and Cleopatra in Egypt]], [[Marcomannic Wars|Marcus Aurelius campaign against the Germans in the north of the Rhin river]], [[Lusitanian War|Viriathus uprising in the West Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Siege of Alesia]] leadered by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aevi.org.es/pdf/Dossier_de_prensa_Galardones_aDeSe_2005.pdf |title=Galardones aDeSe 2005.

A special kind of unit called hero, which has become standard on Real-Time Strategy and Real-Time Tactic games, is used to group the different classes of soldiers under one command.

As a soldier builds up on experience he becomes more effective in combat.

By assaulting keeps a civilization can also gain access to loot like extra food or gold.

==== Heroes ====
Unlike normal military units, heroes are generally stronger and more valuable in battle. Their main strength lies in the ability to attach a group of up to 50 units, which from then on would follow their commands.  When attached, the units receive part of the hero's experience as a bonus to their own. In addition, heroes arrange armies in specific formations that provide their units with an additional bonus when executing the stand ground command.  Unlike units each hero has five skills that are unique to them and their civilization. These improve not only their individual combat abilities but also that of their army.  Some of them are beneficial to the hero and the units attached to the hero.  Other skills are beneficial to the units or help during battles.

==== Formations ====
There are four kind of formations in the game: Square, Block, Line and Center Cavalry. Each gives different bonus. Usually the maximum number of units on an army is limited to 50 but in the case of Republican Rome this cap can be pushed up to 70.

Also, different formations favors mixes on soldiers classes quantities. For example; choosing a line formation would benefit an army composed of a majority of ranged attackers.

By grouping two or more Generals the size of an army can be effectively increased. Orders can be issued simultaneously to each General who in turn would relay them to their troops. Conveniently once that the positions of the joined armies have been set, the computer will make the best effort to keep the defined distance between groups.

This feature gives more possibilities since this allows specialization of groups. Each can choose the more convenient formation, for instance, two armies, one composed only from ranged attackers and the other of a good mix of melee troops, can choose line and block respectively.

As a unit gets to see more action his skill level increases; every unit has a level to reflect this, thus it is possible to get a favorable outcome when facing a numerically superior enemy with battle hardened troops, the most appropriate formation and some maneuvering.

=== Buildings and Population Centers ===
There are several classes of populations centers.

====Villages====
These population centers produce food at a constant rate. Each one has a population limit and current living people, depending on the completeness of population the production rate decreases or increases, also the people can be transferred to keeps or fortresses. Campaigning Troops can be supplied from these places though is much more useful to use scorched earth tactics to avoid defending a counterattack if the village is at the very end of the supply lines.

====Walled City====
The main establishment; this is where the player recruits troops, make most of the basic training for them and upgrade certain abilities. Every walled city has a tavern, a coliseum, a blacksmith, a temple for the gods and a certain class of town center. What varies, according to the civilization, is what can be obtained on those buildings.

====Keeps====
These are smaller than the walled city but play an important role by gathering resources as extra money or soldiers. Among them are: Gold Keep, Trading Keep and Training Keep.

The most obvious uses are as a forward base and defense point, keeps (no matter what class of keep) will attack any hostile nation party within certain range, but only when they have at least one occupant, the rate of fire can be increased by garrisoning more soldiers at the building but a line of supply must be established in order to keep alive the troops inside the fortification.

*Gold Keep: Gold keeps can be used to increase the gold income for a particular civilization. When a building of this class has 2000 gold coins; it will generate more money, the player in possession of the keep can sent the surplus money to his walled city to aid in his war effort. By keeping an average population above 85% in the walled city and one Gold Keep a player can support two medium-sized armies to aid in the expansion of his empire.
*Trading Keep: These buildings are also useful to earn an extra income by means of selling food sent from a near village or walled city; the profits can be sent either to the walled city or be invested on a Gold Keep.
*Training Keep: These building are useful to raise the skill level of regular troops, generals or mercenaries. By storing food inside the building troops garrisoned inside will increase their level, though just to a certain level cap.
*Recruit Keep: In this building peasants are slowly turned into Level 1 Mace Warriors; these troops in turn can be sent to the training keep to raise their level. Food is also required for this transformation.

====Ruins====
These are used to increase the power of your priest by performing rituals or they can contain powerful magic items that increase wielder's stats.

==''Liga Imperivm''==

"'''Just Lose It'''" is a song by American rapper [[Eminem]] from his fifth [[studio album]], ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'' (2004). It was released on September 28, 2004 as the [[lead single]] from ''Encore'', and was later included on his [[greatest hits album|greatest hits compilation album]], ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'' (2005). The song caused controversy as its lyrics and [[music video]] parodies [[Michael Jackson]], who was being accused of [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|child molestation]] at the time. The song also pokes fun at [[Beavis]]/[[Cornholio]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and others. It also heavily spoofs [[Pee-wee Herman]], going as far as imitating his signature shout during the chorus and Eminem dressing like him in the video.

The song peaked at number 6
on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in the United States and reached number one in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway.

==Background==
Two skits regarding the Michael Jackson controversy were included on ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', "Paul (Skit)" and "Em Calls Paul (Skit)". The lyrics to "Just Lose It" refer to Jackson's legal troubles, however he does state in his song "... and that's not a stab at Michael, That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho...." At the beginning of the song there is a lyrical excerpt from Eminem's 2002 single "[[Without Me]]" about how "Shady's back". The line "Snap back to reality. Look! It's B. Rabbit" and "You signed me up to battle" refers to "[[Lose Yourself]]" and Eminem's character in the [[movie]] ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''. In the second verse of the song there is a line "So fellas, fellas..." which is a reference to [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]'s song "[[Baby Got Back]]". The line "Girl you know you're my world," from the chorus, is a reference to the chorus of his song "[[Superman (Eminem song)|Superman]]" from his album ''[[The Eminem Show]]''.

==Critical reception==
The song received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it too similar to Eminem's previous work. [[AllMusic]] highlighted the song in a review of the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/encore-mw0001996708 |title=Encore - Eminem &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=2004-11-12 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitchfork was also positive: "'Just Lose It' is still most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially multilayered as the best of ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', yet it's still more curio than anything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott Plagenhoef |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/ |title=Eminem: Encore &amp;#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' wrote: "Em (is) reduced to making funny noises to keep things interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-nme-7560 |title=Eminem : Encore |publisher=NME |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Browne of ''Entertainment Weekly'', however, felt mixed: "First [on the album] came the sarcastically bouncy "Just Lose It", a lazy retread of earlier hits that, with its easy-target references to Michael Jackson, made Eminem appear to be the one who'd actually lost it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Browne |first=David |url=http://ew.com/article/2004/11/19/encore/ |title=Encore |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=793 |date=2004-11-19 |page=80 |accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; J-23 panned the song and called it "by far the worst song Eminem or Dr. Dre has ever made. It really seems like their object here was to make the worst song possible.

==Music video==
The video contains a parody of a rap battle scene from ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' in which it is Eminem, as B-Rabbit, versus Eminem, as Slim Shady. It also contains several scenes where Eminem is walking down the streets naked. As he is doing this, [[Dr. Dre]] is seen driving next to him, looking disgusted. For the music video, the lyrics were edited slightly, notably the phrase "shake that ass", becoming the less provocative "shake that thing". Other changes include the muting of some parts of the second verse, and the phrase "butt naked" becoming "buck naked". Such examples of parodies that are included in this video are [[Michael Jackson]], [[MC Hammer]] and his hit single "[[U Can't Touch This]]", [[Pee-wee Herman]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and the movie ''[[Bad Santa]]'', by displaying Eminem as a "mall santa" and even going so far to include [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], the actor who played the elf from the actual movie, as Eminem's helper. Some of the celebrities who appeared in this music video were [[Paris Hilton]], Monica Parales, [[Erik Estrada]], [[Alyson Stoner]], [[BooBoo Stewart]], [[Omar Benson Miller]], [[De'Angelo Wilson]], [[Mekhi Phifer]] and [[Dr. Dre]]. The video was later nominated at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video|Best Rap Video]], but lost to [[Ludacris]]' "[[Number One Spot]]". [[Much Music]]'s 50 Most Controversial Videos ranked it #1 for its jokes on famous people.

===Controversy===
The [[music video]] for "Just Lose It" generated controversy by parodying singer [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's child molestation]] trial, [[Health and appearance of Michael Jackson|plastic surgery]] and an incident in 1984 when Jackson's hair caught fire whilst filming a [[Pepsi]] commercial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Eminem-1703.html Stevie Wonder slams Eminem for mocking Michael Jackson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A week after the release of "Just Lose It", Jackson called into [[Steve Harvey]]'s [[The Steve Harvey Morning Show|radio show]] to report his displeasure with the video. "I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video," Jackson said in the interview. "I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive." Jackson continued: "I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/14/usa.michaeljacksontrial | work=The Guardian | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | title=Michael Jackson threatens to sue over mocking video by Eminem | date=February 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including [[Stevie Wonder]], who called it "kicking a man while he's down" and "bullshit",&lt;ref name="MJ"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://allhiphop.com/2004/12/06/stevie-wonder-has-harsh-words-for-eminem/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305053630/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=3825|archivedate=2005-03-05|title=Stevie Wonder has words to say about Eminem|work=AllHipHop|author=Hope, Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvey, who declared, "Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back."&lt;ref name="MJ" /&gt; The video was banned on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] channel, after complaints from [[Benzino]] and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that [[Nelly]]'s "[[Tip Drill (song)|Tip Drill]]" video which has been alleged to be [[Misogyny in rap music|misogynistic]] was aired. Both were only seen on ''[[BET: Uncut]]''.) However [[MTV]] did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel.

'''''Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo||キングスグレイブ ファイナルファンタジーXV|Kingusugureibu: Fainaru Fantajī Fifutīn|lead=yes}}}} is a 2016 Japanese [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] [[fantasy]] film directed by Takeshi Nozue and scripted by Takashi Hasegawa from a story by [[Kazushige Nojima]] and Saori Itamuro. Developed primarily by [[Square Enix]]'s exclusive CGI studio [[Visual Works]], ''Kingsglaive'' is based on the setting and story of the 2016 video game ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', which is thematically connected to the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' subseries. ''Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV'' released theatrically in July 2016 in Japan by [[Aniplex]], and received a limited theatrical run in August in North America by [[Stage 6 Films]]. Digital and physical home video versions were released in October 2016, and the film was bundled with different editions of ''Final Fantasy XV'' alongside ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV]]''.

''Kingsglaive'' runs parallel with the events of ''Final Fantasy XV'', focusing on [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII|Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII]], the father of main character [[Noctis Lucis Caelum|Noctis]]. The main protagonists are from the Kingsglaive, an elite combat corps who share Regis's magical powers and defend the kingdom of Lucis and its Crystal from the invading empire of Niflheim. Faced with continued detrimental conflict, Regis accepts an armistice with Niflheim: as part of the peace treaty, his son must marry Lady [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Lunafreya Nox Fleuret|Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]] of the imperial province of Tenebrae. The treaty turns out to be a ruse for Niflheim to invade, and Kingsglaive soldier [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Nyx Ulric|Nyx Ulric]] is caught up with Regis and Lunafreya in a battle to secure the future of Lucis. The movie's voice cast includes [[Gō Ayano]], [[Shiori Kutsuna]] and [[Tsutomu Isobe]] in Japanese; and [[Aaron Paul]], [[Lena Headey]] and [[Sean Bean]] in English.

''Kingsglaive'' was made as part of a planned multimedia expansion of ''Final Fantasy XV'' to negate having to develop a series of games using the setting and characters. Beginning production in 2014 by the same team that created ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' (2005), ''Kingsglaive'' used discarded concepts from the original version of ''Final Fantasy XV''{{'}}s story, with the aim being to create a self-contained experience with a dedicated cast and relatable plot. Multiple external studios were brought in to help complete the project within the short development time. Its announcement was delayed to 2016 due to the early reveal of ''Final Fantasy XV''. ''Kingsglaive'' grossed $6.55 million during its limited theatrical run and earned a further {{US$|4.5 million|long=no}} in the United States from its DVD and Blu-ray releases. Reception to the movie was mixed, with praise going to the visuals and lead actors' performances, while the story and supporting cast were widely criticized.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
{{Main article|Final Fantasy XV#Setting}}
''Kingsglaive'' takes place on the Earth-like world of Eos, running parallel to the opening events of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The kingdom of Lucis is home to a magical Crystal, given to humanity by the world's deities and used by the ruling Caelum dynasty to defend Lucis from invaders via a magical barrier known as the Wall. The Crystal is kept in a special chamber within the Royal Citadel, its powers only accessible through the hereditary Ring of the Lucii.&lt;ref name="XVworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFXVscenU"/&gt; For centuries, Lucis has been at war with the militaristic and technologically advanced empire of Niflheim, which has conquered the other nations using its Magitek armies.&lt;ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIXVblowout"/&gt;

Lucis's crown city Insomnia is protected from Niflheim by the Kingsglaive—an elite corps made up of immigrants from beyond the city limits with whom the Crystal's power are shared by the ruling monarch [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII|Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII]].&lt;ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFXVscenU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIXVblowout"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "XVsummary1"/&gt; The movie opens with Regis accepting a peace treaty with Niflheim: as part of the treaty, Regis must cede the territories around Insomnia to Niflheim and have his son [[Noctis Lucis Caelum|Prince Noctis]] marry [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Lunafreya Nox Fleuret|Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]], former princess of Tenebrae.&lt;ref name="GIXVblowout"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "XVsummary1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GemEdition"/&gt;

===Plot===
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
During a visit to Tenebrae, Regis and Noctis—who is recuperating from a near-death experience—are targeted for assassination by Niflheim. Tenebrae is subsequently attacked, and in the invasion Queen Sylva is killed by Niflheim's General Glauca. Regis attempts to flee with Lunafreya, but she decides to stay with her brother [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ravus Nox Fleuret|Ravus]]; both become subjects under Niflheim's rule.

Twelve years later, the Kingsglaive fight to protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and Daemons, unnatural monsters tamed for military use. During one such operation, [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Nyx Ulric|Nyx Ulric]] defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a Daemon. Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ardyn Izunia|Ardyn Izunia]]'s offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two days before the treaty is to be signed, Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent on a mission to escort Lunafreya to Altissia to meet Noctis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Iedolas Aldercapt|Iedolas Aldercapt]], Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.

Regis agrees to deploy the Kingsglaive, although their commander Drautos has disappeared. While Nyx succeeds in rescuing Lunafreya, many of the Kingsglaive turn on him; Nyx, Lunafreya and rebel leader Luche Lazarus escape as the ship disintegrates. At the treaty-signing ceremony, the Niflheim delegation springs a surprise attack and kills the ruling council, while their army enters by destroying the Wall with help from the rebels, who are subsequently massacred. Lunafreya and Nyx reach the Citadel just as Regis is battling Glauca. During the fight, Glauca cuts the Ring of the Lucii from Regis's hand. Ravus attempts to put on the Ring and claim its power, but it rejects him and destroys his arm before he can remove it. Nyx, Lunafreya and Regis retrieve the Ring and flee with Glauca in pursuit. Regis forces the two to go on without him, dying in his ensuing battle with Glauca. Aldercapt and Ardyn—having successfully stolen the Crystal—leave Insomnia to be destroyed by Niflheim's Daemons.

Summoned to the city plaza by a call from Drautos, Nyx and Lunafreya are cornered by Luche, who reveals himself to be Crowe's killer. Luche almost kills Nyx before being tricked by Lunafreya into putting on the Ring, resulting in his death. Drautos then appears, but is attacked by Libertus, who reveals that Drautos is in fact Glauca. Just as Glauca is about to kill them, Nyx puts on the Ring. He is confronted by the spirits of the past kings of Lucis; initially rejected due to being not of their bloodline, his resolve and the threat to the Crystal persuade them to allow his use of their power at the cost of his life. After fending off Glauca, Nyx returns the Ring to Lunafreya before entrusting her to Libertus, telling them to flee. With the Ring's borrowed power he engages Glauca in a titanic battle throughout Insomnia, animating the city's statues of past rulers, known as the "Old Wall," to combat Niflheim's Daemons. Their fight ends as dawn approaches, with Nyx mortally wounding Glauca; Nyx dies shortly after as payment for using the Ring's power, wishing for Noctis to rule well in the future. In the aftermath, Libertus escorts Lunafreya out of the city, but she tells him to stay behind. Lunafreya then leaves with the Ring to find Noctis.

In a [[post-credits scene]], Noctis and his companions are en route to Altissia when their car breaks down, leading into the opening scenes of ''Final Fantasy XV''.

==Production==
''Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV'' forms part of the "''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe", a multimedia project based around the 2016 video game ''Final Fantasy XV'' that includes the [[original net animation]] series ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV]]'': the story of ''XV'', originally a spin-off title called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', was large enough to have covered several games, but as the team did not want to create any additional games, they decided to create additional media.&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamUniverse"/&gt; While similar in style to the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' project, the media associated with ''Final Fantasy XV'' came before the game's release rather than after it, acting as insight into the world and characters.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredMusic"/&gt; ''XV'' and its associated media likewise hold a thematic connection to ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy]]'', a compilation of games and associated media sharing a common mythos while boasting unconnected stories and settings. While distanced from the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' brand for marketing purposes, the world of ''XV'' still uses its mythos and design elements.&lt;ref name="GIXVblowout"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FinaTabata"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FamGamescom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FNCchange"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TabataCapitalInterview"/&gt; ''Kingsglaive'' was designed so it would not be necessary for people to watch to understand the main game. Despite this, references to the events of ''Kingsglaive'' were included in the game.&lt;ref name="XVdisconnect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSBkings"/&gt; Following the release of the game, director [[Hajime Tabata]] described ''Kingsglaive'' and ''Brotherhood'' as granting a better view of the game's world, adding that those who only played the game might notice the missing context.&lt;ref name="EngadgetInterview"/&gt;

''Kingsglaive'' was primarily developed by [[Visual Works]], a division of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' developer [[Square Enix]] dedicated to the creation of CGI cutscenes.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureInterview"/&gt; The director was Takeshi Nozue. Nozue's previous notable experience with feature-length productions was the 2005 feature ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]''. While he had been co-director of ''Advent Children'', he was sole director of ''Kingsglaive''.&lt;ref name="JPGtiming"/&gt; Tabata acted as producer.&lt;ref name="SilKingsglaiveB"/&gt; While compared upon reveal to ''Advent Children'', it was stressed that the two served very different purposes: while ''Advent Children'' was designed for fans of its parent title ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997), ''Kingsglaive'' was intended for both prospective players of ''Final Fantasy XV'' and people new to the ''Final Fantasy'' series, acting as an entry point into the narrative of ''Final Fantasy XV''.&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt; The project was also much greater in scale than ''Advent Children'', requiring help from multiple external studios.&lt;ref name="JPGtiming"/&gt; Nozue later commented that another aspect of ''Kingsglaive'' was to bolster sales of the game's platforms prior to release, with a movie offering a greater means of reaching potential buyers.&lt;ref name="PolyReleases"/&gt; Production work on ''Kingsglaive'' began three years prior to its release, with full development beginning in 2014 after an extended period of preparatory work. From this point, production lasted approximately two and a half years.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilKingsglaiveA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GWIinterview"/&gt;

So the production could be managed in the short time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of the production process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases of trial and error until the final product was solidified.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt; ''Kingsglaive'' was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early.&lt;ref name="JPGtiming"/&gt; So as to remain close to the development of ''Final Fantasy XV'', the lead staff of ''Kingsglaive'' moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry.&lt;ref name="VentureInterview"/&gt; In addition to the staff of ''Advent Children'', Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: [[Digic Pictures]], who had worked on the graphics for the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series; and [[Image Engine]], who had worked on multiple films including ''[[Jurassic World]]'' (2015) and the television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredInterview"/&gt; According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingsPuppet"/&gt; The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredInterview"/&gt;

===Story and characters===
The story of ''Kingsglaive'' was based around a portion of the original opening of ''Final Fantasy XV'', which would have shown the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of ''Kingsglaive''.&lt;ref name="KotakuQA"/&gt; To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core.&lt;ref name="FFDinfo"/&gt; That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by [[Kazushige Nojima]].&lt;ref name="ffxv_staff"/&gt; The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script.&lt;ref name="FFDcomments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilKingsglaiveB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredInterview"/&gt; Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GWIinterview"/&gt; The storyline was designed to complement and set the stage for the events of ''Final Fantasy XV'' without revealing major plot elements from the game.&lt;ref name="GWIinterview"/&gt; The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt; As many team members were ''Final Fantasy'' fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.&lt;ref name="PSBkings"/&gt;

The central theme for the overall story of ''Final Fantasy XV'' was the bond between father and son: ''Kingsglaive'' represented the theme from the father Regis' point of view.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredInterview"/&gt; According to Nozue, another key element during the early segment of the movie was displaying how the world's society sees Regis's responsibilities, along with the emotions involved in such a role.&lt;ref name="PSBkings"/&gt; The main goal for the film's characters was to portray them as normal people with character flaws, rather than magical superheroes.&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt; Nyx was an original character created for the movie with no connection to the events of the game, intended to act as a medium for the wider audience ''Kingsglaive'' was aimed at.&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt; Nyx also provided a medium for the story themes surrounding immigration issues, which in turn brought the audience closer to the main cast.&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt; While Nyx was original, multiple key characters from the game played prominent roles, particularly Regis, Lunafreya, and Ardyn.&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt; Lunafreya was highlighted as the "keystone" connecting the game, the movie, and the anime series ''Brotherhood''.&lt;ref name="FFRinfo"/&gt; While her role in the film was not an active one, her strength was conveyed through her single-minded devotion to her goals.&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt;

===Design===

Prior to full production, the team created a [[Technology demonstration|tech demo]] in 2012 to test the creation and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled ''[[Luminous Studio#Agni's Philosophy|Agni's Philosophy]]'', which also acted as a test demo for the [[Luminous Studio]] engine which would be used for ''Final Fantasy XV''.&lt;ref name="NicoMaking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4agni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LuminousOrigins"/&gt; Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor.&lt;ref name="CGproductionA"/&gt; The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of ''Agni's Philosophy''.&lt;ref name="NicoMaking"/&gt; The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.&lt;ref name="CGproductionA"/&gt;

The characters' body and facial movements were recorded using [[motion capture]]: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences.&lt;ref name="TVSpecial"/&gt; The motion actors provided the basis for their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt; For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features as close as possible to their in-game counterpart.&lt;ref name="GWIinterview"/&gt; As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on [[photogrammetry]] and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts.&lt;ref name="CGproductionA"/&gt; Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.&lt;ref name="CGproductionB"/&gt;

Insomnia—the capital of Lucis—was based in general on international cities, while its core was based on Tokyo: Western elements were added based on fan criticism of Insomnia being too similar to Tokyo during the game's early stages. The design of the Niflheim airships was an updated version of those in the earlier days of ''Final Fantasy XV''{{'}}s development, when it was known as ''Versus XIII''.&lt;ref name="NicoMaking"/&gt; Regis was extensively redesigned for the movie, which in turn altered his appearance in the game. Initially created with a younger appearance, the team wanted him to have a proper regal air so he would have presence in ''Kingsglaive'', so they aged the character significantly and created a story-based context for the change.&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt; The overall theme of the ''Final Fantasy XV'' universe was "a fantasy based on reality": to reinforce this, Square Enix collaborated with [[Audi]] on a custom version of their [[Audi R8]] model as the royal family's personal transport, and included references to real-world brands and companies such as [[Japan Airlines]].&lt;ref name="GemEdition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFDcomments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSuncovered"/&gt; Most of the movie's individual props such as the car, Nyx's daggers, the Niflheim mechs and the Ring of the Lucii were created and rendered before main production had begun.&lt;ref name="CGproductionA"/&gt;

Lighting and its effect on characters' skin was of particular importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting.&lt;ref name="CGproductionB"/&gt; [[Previsualization]] was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the [[V-Ray]] software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create ''Kingsglaive'', they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes.&lt;ref name="CGinterview"/&gt; For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]] animation software.&lt;ref name="NicoMaking"/&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy XV}}
The film's score was composed by [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R. Graham]], with the main theme by [[Yoko Shimomura]], the composer for ''Final Fantasy XV''.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilKingsglaiveB"/&gt; The score for ''Kingsglaive'' was described by Nozue as "Shimomura meets Hollywood". This effect was reinforced by Graham's work.&lt;ref name="FamUncoveredMusic"/&gt; According to Graham, Nozue wanted a complex musical score. The harmonics and themes change throughout the score to create both an ambiguous atmosphere and a sense of impending tragedy and loss.&lt;ref name="TVSpecial"/&gt; Graham was brought on board to create a score that would fill the film's world and act as a counterbalance to Shimomura's music from the game, which was incorporated into the overall score. Due to the themes and events of ''Kingsglaive'', Graham needed his music to reflect the weight, contradictions, and shifting "light and dark" perspectives of the characters and locations. To achieve this, he used a combination of live orchestra and electronic elements. He wrote more than 100 minutes of music.&lt;ref name="GrahamInterview"/&gt; Recording was done in Nashville using a symphonic orchestra.&lt;ref name="TVSpecial"/&gt; The soundtrack was released as a two-disc album on September 7, 2016.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveOST"/&gt;

==Release and promotion==
''Kingsglaive'' was first announced in March 2016 at "Uncovered: ''Final Fantasy XV''", a media event dedicated to the game. Its release was handled by publisher Square Enix and distributor [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveAnnounce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyReleases"/&gt; At the time, no theatrical release was announced for the West.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveAnnounce"/&gt; In June at the 2016 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], it was announced that ''Kingsglaive'' would receive a limited theatrical release in North America, beginning on August 19; its theatrical release was handled by [[Stage 6 Films]] with [[Vertical Entertainment]] and Square Enix.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveTheatresNA"/&gt; A further week's run was announced for some areas.&lt;ref name="SilReception"/&gt; It was later announced that [[Le Grand Rex]] would be hosting a French premiere for ''Kingsglaive'' on September 15.&lt;ref name="frenchrelease"/&gt; ''Kingsglaive'' released in Japanese cinemas through [[Aniplex]] on July 9, 2016 where day one fans were given exclusive Lunafreya post cards. Tickets went on sale on April 23.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveRelease"/&gt; Prior to its theatrical release, a television special titled "XV Universe Report" aired in Japan, featuring behind-the-scenes information and interviews regarding ''Final Fantasy XV'' and its associated media.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveSpecial"/&gt; ''Kingsglaive'' was included on [[Blu-ray]] in the "Deluxe Edition" and "Ultimate Collector's Edition" of ''Final Fantasy XV'', which were released worldwide on November 29, 2016.&lt;ref name="GemEdition"/&gt; The movie was also included in the "''Final Fantasy XV'' Film Collection", a box set which includes ''Final Fantasy XV'' and ''Brotherhood''.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveBox"/&gt; The digital version of the film was released on streaming and download services on August 30 2016; the standalone Blu-ray and DVD versions were released on October 4 2016.&lt;ref name="PolyReleases"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted in Japan in 10th place, selling 22,818 tickets for a total of 35,516,460 yen (US$345,507) in two days.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveTakings1"/&gt; By July 20, over 70,000 tickets had been sold, bringing a total gross of over 105,000,000 yen in Japan ({{USD|0.9 million}}).&lt;ref name="bom"/&gt; Its high takings were attributed to positive [[word of mouth]] following the initial release.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveTakings2"/&gt; During the openings of its limited run in the United States, the film grossed a further $190,000.&lt;ref name="SilReception"/&gt; It eventually grossed $269,980 in the region.&lt;ref name="numbers international"/&gt; Upon release in China in March 2017, the film entered at #4 in the top-grossing films of that week, being the highest grossing new release with $3.90 million.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveChina"/&gt; The film went on to gross {{US$|4.2 million|long=no}} in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV China (2017) |url=http://english.entgroup.cn/652752/ |website=EntGroup |date=March 20, 2017 |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its total worldwide gross reached over $6.4 million as of April 2017.&lt;ref name="numbers international"/&gt; The home video releases of ''Kingsglaive'' were among the top 20 best-selling DVD and Blu-ray releases for October 2016.&lt;ref name="KingsglaiveDVDsales"/&gt; The two releases reached a combined gross of $4,549,411 in the United States.&lt;ref name="numbers international"/&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 13%, based on 16 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.8/10.&lt;ref name="RottenScore"/&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average to reviews, the film has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MetaScore"/&gt; Critics were generally negative about the film, although popular opinion rendered a more positive response.&lt;ref name="SilReception"/&gt;

Christian Holub of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a score of C+, describing the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent [[Warcraft (film)|''Warcraft'' movie adaptation]]: he said that the visuals "offer a deep dive into the [[Uncanny Valley]]", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak.&lt;ref name="EWreview"/&gt; Meghan Sullivan, writing for [[IGN]], gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up ''Kingsglaive'' as "a very beautiful and very confusing movie".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Andrew Barker for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' frequently questioned whether ''Kingsglaive'' could count as a movie, as he often felt like he was watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and too full of throwaway characters.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview"/&gt; [[Wired (website)|Wired]]'s Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of ''Final Fantasy XV''. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".&lt;ref name="WiredReview"/&gt;

[[Eurogamer]]'s Aoife Wilson found it difficult to pin down why she had enjoyed the movie, as she found it "bloated and badly done," ending up saying that, despite its flaws, it felt like part of the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise. She again praised the visuals, but found the dialog to be the movie's weakest point despite the efforts of the lead actors. She summed up ''Kingsglaive'' by saying that "as a two-hour piece of promotional material for a game, it works".&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Scott Clay of RPGFan called watching the movie a necessity for fully understanding the world of ''Final Fantasy XV'', and praised it for its visuals and action scenes, although he noted that there were probably better action movies available. He felt that ''Kingsglaive'' managed to get him invested in the story of ''Final Fantasy XV'', saying that "[the movie] is no masterpiece — in fact, it's nowhere close to one — but it does its job nicely by setting up what could potentially be a very cool story".&lt;ref name="RPGFreview"/&gt; [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Ashley Oh missed the character development usually seen in the ''Final Fantasy'' games although the cast did their best with the script, and while she found the visuals "jaw-droppingly gorgeous" and enjoyed the references to other ''Final Fantasy'' titles, she found the story "very weak". She also faulted the lack of strong female characters, something that had been a noted feature in earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles.&lt;ref name="PolyReview"/&gt; In contrast to the majority of reviewers, Anthony John Agnello of [[GamesRadar]] gave the movie a perfect score of 5/5 stars, calling it "an expert blend of world building, humanity, and the magical strangeness of ''Final Fantasy''" and praising it for balancing its scene setting for ''Final Fantasy XV'' with creating a relatable experience, in addition to lauding its visuals and relatable characters.&lt;ref name="GRreview"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Alexa Ray Corriea was also fairly positive: while she noted that it was not a coherent movie on its own, she felt that it was a first step by Square Enix to regain fan trust after earlier missteps. She generally enjoyed the story despite a few contrived elements, and gave unanimous praise to the movie's large-scale and more intimate visuals.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

'''''Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music''''' was a 1981 [[Broadway musical]] revue written for and starring American singer and actress [[Lena Horne]]. The musical was produced by Michael Frazier and Fred Walker, and the cast album was produced by [[Quincy Jones]]. The show opened on May 12, 1981, and after 333 performances, closed on June 30, 1982, Horne's 65th birthday. Horne toured with the show in the U.S. and Canada and performed in London and Stockholm in 1984.

==Background==
Lena Horne (born June 30, 1917– May 9, 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/lena-horne/about-the-performer/487/ |title=Lena Horne – About the Performer &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American singer and actress. Horne joined the chorus of the [[Cotton Club]] at the age of sixteen and became a band singer and nightclub performer before moving to Hollywood where she had small parts in numerous movies, and much more substantial parts in the films ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' and ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'' (1943). Due to the [[red scare]] and her progressive political views, she was blacklisted and unable to get work in Hollywood. She returned to her roots as a nightclub performer. In the 1960s she participated in the [[March on Washington]] and performed in nightclubs and television. She announced her retirement in March 1980 and performed a two-month farewell tour of the United States.&lt;ref name="google386"&gt;James R. Parish and Michael R. Pitts (2003). Quoted in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ot333QIkMT4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Hollywood Songsters: Garland to O'Connor]''. Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 386. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94333-8}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Director Arthur Faria discarded the multi character script called ''Lena's World'' and  conceived for her a one-woman show which became  ''Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music''-

==Format==
Throughout the show Horne sang and danced to [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs, [[jazz standards]], music from films in which she had appeared, and songs written for her. The show sought to portray Horne's life from her beginning in show business to the present. During the show she spoke of the racism that she had encountered, describing how Hollywood producers told her she opened her mouth too big when she sang and devised a makeup for her, Light Egyptian, which was applied to white actresses such as [[Ava Gardner]] and [[Hedy Lamarr]], who took roles that Horne could have possibly played.

Horne performed her signature song, "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]", twice in the show, the first time more subdued than the second.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/13/arts/theater-lena-horne-the-lady-and-her-music.html|title=Theater: 'Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music' |date=1981-05-13| accessdate=2010-02-03 |work=New York Times | first=Frank | last=Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by dancers and backup singers. Costumes were designed by [[Giorgio di Sant' Angelo]].

== Response ==

=== Critical reception ===
The Broadway production opened on May 12, 1981, after thirteen previews, and met with a positive critical responses. [[Stephen Holden]], reviewing the album of the show in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', wrote that Horne had "turned the conventions of the one-person extravaganza inside out...Instead of a self-glorifying ego trip, her performance is a shared journey of self-discovery about the human cost (to the audience as well as the singer) of being a symbol", adding that Horne's singing "hits peaks of ferocity, tenderness, playfulness and sheer delight that would have seemed unthinkable in her glamour-girl days...her performance here is a sustained cry of affirmation, and because that affirmation acknowledges the bitterness, cynicism and toughness of the world, it's exceptionally moving in ways that conventionally optimistic musical celebrations rarely are".&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/192838/review/6209826/theladyandhermusicliveonbroadway |title=Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music |date=1981-11-26 |accessdate=2010-02-03 |work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' described Horne as "the most awesome performer to have hit Broadway in years",&lt;ref name="google386"/&gt; while ''[[The New York Times]]'' said she "transforms each song...into an intensely personal story that we've never quite heard before".&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

The show was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on December 7, 1984. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] positively reviewed the film, adding that Horne transformed "pretty tunes and banal lyrics into something that is both erotic and political, a fretting of raw edges"&lt;ref name="NY mag"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lena Horne: the Lady and Her Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeYCAAAAMBAJ|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]], pg. 85|accessdate=February 3, 2010|author1=New York Media|first1=LLC|date=1984-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performance was later issued on VHS video, it has not been re-issued on DVD as of 2015.

[[File:Katy Perry - Super Bowl XLIX Halftime 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katy Perry]] performing at the [[Super Bowl XLIX halftime show]], February 2015. It is the most watched halftime show according to ratings calculated by Nielsen.]]

[[Halftime show]]s are a tradition during [[American football]] games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the [[Super Bowl]], the annual championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), represents a fundamental link to [[Popular culture|pop culture]], which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest. As the Super Bowl itself is typically the most-watched event on television in the United States annually, the halftime show has been equally-viewed in recent years: the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XLIX]] featuring [[Katy Perry]] was viewed by 118.5 million, as part of an overall telecast that peaked at 120.3 million at its conclusion—the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-is-most-watched-show-in-u-s-television-history/358523/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"&gt;Campbell (1995), pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvbn-2015ratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl XLIX is Most-Watched Show in U.S. Television History With 114.4 Million Viewers|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-is-most-watched-show-in-u-s-television-history/358523/|website=TV By The Numbers|publisher=Tribune Media|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL claims that the [[Super Bowl LI]] halftime show, with [[Lady Gaga]] was the "most-watched musical event of all-time," citing a figure of 150 million viewers based on the television audience, as well as unique viewership of video postings of the halftime show on the league's platforms, and [[social media]] interactions (a metric that was never calculated prior to 2017).&lt;ref name="svg-mostwatched"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratings Roundup: Super Bowl LI Halftime Show Is Most-Watched Musical Event In History; NHRA on Fox Revs Up|url=http://www.sportsvideo.org/2017/02/17/ratings-roundup-super-bowl-li-halftime-show-is-most-watched-musical-event-in-history-nhra-on-fox-revs-up/|website=Sports Video Group|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation-mostwatchedmusical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl LI halftime show was the most-watched musical event in history across all platforms|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/17/14652362/super-bowl-li-halftime-show-most-watched-musical-event-nfl|website=SB Nation|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show was seen by 117.5 million television viewers, making it the second-highest-rated halftime show.&lt;ref name="deadline-ladygagaratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Scores Second-Most Watched Super Bowl Halftime Show Ever|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/lady-gaga-super-bowl-tv-ratings-halftime-show-fox-1201903703/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the [[Grambling State University]] Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), [[drill team]]s, and other performance ensembles such as [[Up with People]]. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature [[pop music]] acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]] and [[Gloria Estefan]]. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, [[Super Bowl XXVII]] featured a [[Super Bowl XXVII halftime show|headlining performance]] by [[Michael Jackson]]. After [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], whose halftime show featured an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts, the halftime show began to feature [[classic rock]] acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in [[Super Bowl XLV|2011]].

== Background ==
[[File:SuperBowl I - Los Angeles Coliseum (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the halftime show at [[Super Bowl I]]]]
During most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college [[marching band]]. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring [[drill team]]s and other performance ensembles; the group [[Up with People]] produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogram the game]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=If NFL doesn't put on a halftime show, someone else will | url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/05/if-nfl-doesnt-put-on-a-halftime-show-someone-else-will/ | first=Mike | last=Florio | work=ProFootballTalk.com  |date=February 5, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the introduction of popular music acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Clint Black]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme—begun with Super Bowl III—ended, replaced by major music productions by [[arena rock]] bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts in an alleged "[[wardrobe malfunction]]", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being [[rock music|rock]] artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  These shows were considered "family friendly" and the time in which they took place has been described as "the age of reactionary halftime shows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/boobs-beyonce-brass-bands-the-evolution-of-the-super-bowl-halftime-show.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Super Bowl XLV]], the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.

The NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/sports/football/03halftime.html?ref=sports

== Details on specific shows == &lt;!-- referenced only --&gt;

=== [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] ===
U2 performed 3 songs: "[[Beautiful Day]]," "[[MLK (song)|MLK]]," and "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]." During the beginning of "MLK" and continuing until the end of "Where The Streets Have No Name," a large banner behind the band displayed the names of all the people who lost their lives on the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bono ended the song by opening up his jacket, the inside of which displayed the American flag.

=== [[Super Bowl XL]] ===
For [[The Rolling Stones]], the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo ([[John Pasche]]'s "Cunning Linguist" first used in 1971 on their ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: "[[Start Me Up]]," "[[Rough Justice (The Rolling Stones song)|Rough Justice]]," and "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]." The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown.

However, the choice of The Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the [[Music of Detroit|traditional Detroit]] "[[Motown#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]]," and no artists from the area were included.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Bill.

This section lists notable professional wrestling promoters during the "[[History of professional wrestling in the United States#Television era (1950s to 1970s)|Golden Age of Professional Wrestling]]" following the creation of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in 1948. While most promoters operated [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|specific wrestling "territories"]] as members of the NWA, a number of so-called "outlaw" promotions were also prominent during this period.

==Miscellaneous stories==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}

==="The Goddess of Death"===
"The Goddess of Death" was Hodgson's first published story, and appeared in 1904 in ''[[Royal Magazine]]''.

A village is terrorized by a number of murders by [[strangulation]], and the chief suspect is a statue of the goddess [[Kali]] stolen from a [[Thugee]] temple. The narrator is a visitor who believes there must be a rational explanation, but he finds it increasingly difficult to explain what is going on when the town's mysterious 8-foot statue is missing from its base and he sees what looks like the statue itself running through the night, carrying a cloth [[garotte]].

Recruiting a friend to help him, the narrator leads a group to find the statue before it kills again. A volunteer is killed, but the narrator shoots at the statue, which disappears into a lake. Things look hopeless until the narrator consults the private journal of the Colonel who brought the statue from India. He learns of a secret catch in the statue's base which lowers and raises it, and which allows entry into a secret passage. Someone has been living inside the secret passage, and at its end, where the tunnel reaches the lake, he sees what appears to be another statue in the water. As he tries to pull it out, he realizes that it is an enormous "Hindoo" ([[Hindu]]) high priest wearing a white gown and a mask to imitate the statue; the bullets in fact did reach their mark and the mysterious man is dead. He was a "high priest" who had come to avenge the destruction of his temple.

==="Terror of the Water-Tank"===
This story was first published in 1907 in ''Blue Book Magazine''.
&lt;ref name="swb"&gt;Samuel W. Bruce, "William Hope Hodgson (1877-1918)". in
Harris-Fain, Darren, ed. ''British Fantasy and Science Fiction Writers Before World War I''. Detroit, MI: Gale Research, 1997. pp.121-131. {{ISBN|0810399415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson introduces the story as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Crowning the heights on the outskirts of a certain town on the east coast is a large, iron water-tank from which an isolated row of small villas obtains its supply. The top of this tank has been cemented, and round it have been placed railings, thus making it a splendid "look-out" for any of the townspeople who may choose to promenade upon it. And very popular it was until the strange and terrible happenings of which I have set out to tell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "strange and terrible happenings" begin with the discovery of a murder victim on the tank; he died by [[strangulation]]. The strangled man is the father of the narrator's fiancee, which leads to the narrator's involvement in the story. A local man named Dr. Tointon has been investigating; he has found that the strangled man's watch and watch chain are missing. The narrator notices that the mud around the tank is undisturbed, indicating that no one passed that way.

No real progress is made until several days later when a policeman who had been patrolling the tank is also found dead; he has been strangled as well. Although witnesses heard the man die, and would have seen anyone leaving the tank via the stairs, the mud beside the tank remains undisturbed. Tointon tells the narrator that he has not yet formed a conclusion, but will speak to him the following day.

The next day comes, but Tointon sends the narrator a note asking him to delay their meeting until late that evening. While waiting, the narrator questions Dufirst, the tank-keeper, a bearded black man whom he considers "an ugly little beast." In Dufirst's cottage the narrator discovers the first strangled man's missing watch and watch chain. The narrator summons the nearby police inspector and has Dufirst arrested. Later that evening we learn that the doctor is still out of town and has become seriously ill.

In the weeks that follow, Dufirst is tried and convicted of the first murder and scheduled for hanging. When Dr. Tointon recovers and returns, he is shocked to learn what has happened, believing that Dufirst is innocent. He assembles a team to investigate the water-tank that evening, bringing along a police constable, a loaded shotgun and several lanterns. Covering the lanterns, they hold a silent vigil on top of the tank. In the dead of night, a "very slight, slurring, crawling sort of noise" is heard. The lanterns are uncovered, and the doctor fires his shotgun.

The constable is found lying on the tank, but he is not dead—he has simply fainted from fright. The perpetrator is a "writhing yellow something, like an eel or a snake... flat as a ribbon." This creature has emerged from the tank, via a pipe, and climbed up onto the railing around the tank. The doctor's belief is confirmed; we learn that when he investigated the original crime he discovered slime on the tank railings and moisture on the collars of the victims. The exact nature of the creature remains a mystery, as its head has been destroyed by the shotgun blast, but the doctor believes that it is an abnormal creature because it developed under "abnormal conditions."

==="Bullion"===
This story was first published in 1911 in ''Everybody's Weekly''

A ship is transporting a valuable cargo of gold bullion packed into chests, and stored in a separate locked and sealed room. But when mysterious whispering is heard in the night, an investigation leads the [[first mate]] to think he is losing his mind; first chests are missing, and then they aren't!

The narrator, who is the ship's [[second mate]], is aboard "one of the fast clipper-ships running between London and Melbourne at the time of the big gold finds up at Bendigo." The captain, named Reynolds, complains to him of a strange whispering in his cabin, and asks if the second mate will trade cabins with him. The previous captain, Captain Avery, had previously died in the room, of no known cause. Although the second mate agrees to the switch, believing the captain's concern to be nonsense, in a few nights he is hearing a mysterious whispering as well. The ship carries a very valuable cargo of gold bullion, so the mate gives orders to open and examine the special compartment holding the gold, which is positioned just below the captain's cabin in the lazarette. He awakens the captain, and they enter the lazarette and examine the compartment. The whispering can clearly be heard, but again the source of it cannot be found. The second mate and captain open the sealed room, and find that the thirteenth of the sixty chests is missing! However, when the captain leaves and returns with the purser, and they examine the chests again, they are all present and accounted for. No explanation can be found.

A round-the-clock guard is set up. The three officers (the captain and the two mates) take turns sleeping inside the bullion compartment itself, locked in with the gold, while the petty officers keep watch, pacing around the bullion compartment twenty-four hours a day. The guard inside the room is woken every hour to confirm that the chests are all there. When it is time for the narrator to stand guard, he awakens groggily to discover that a number of chests are missing, but believes that he must be dreaming. When he awakens, the chests are all in place. Shortly thereafter, the first mate actually dies during his watch, again of no apparent cause. No explanation can be found, although the strange whispering is heard again.

After the ship docks in London, bank officials come on board to remove the gold. Everything seems normal, and the watch is in place, but when the door into the bullion compartment is opened, the first mate on guard inside is found to be dead, again of no apparent cause. When the bullion is removed, all seems in order, until the bank reports that all of the chests actually contain lead! As additional cargo is unloaded, an especially heavy case arouses the second mate's suspicion, and he has the man operating the crane "accidentally" drop a case. It bursts open, and chests of gold bullion are found. An elaborate plot is revealed, in which conspirators brought aboard identical chests containing lead, stored in other cargo; the special compartment to hold the bullion was built with a sliding door and connection to a secret passage. In the dead of night the thieves gradually swapped the chests. To avoid detection by the guard inside the compartment they used a narcotic gas. Too low a dose allowed the second mate to awaken and see the chests missing; but too high a dose killed the first mate. The same narcotic gas evidently killed the previous captain, who was gassed to keep him from learning too much about the theft going on directly beneath his cabin.

==="The Mystery of the Water-Logged Ship"===
This story was first published in 1911 in the ''[[Grand Magazine]]''.

A yacht comes perilously close to colliding with a swamped, dismasted, derelict vessel; only the captain's instincts prevent the crash, as he sees a flash of light in the darkness. The source of the light cannot be found, but the yacht's spotlight picks out the derelict. Investigating the vessel, the crew of the yacht decides to tow it,  in order to collect money for salvage. They arrange a tow-line, and leave a skeleton crew of four volunteers, together with the bo'sun, aboard. A little later, the captain of the yacht is shocked to discover that the towline is no longer connected and the ship is a considerable distance from the yacht. The crewmen aboard the vessel are gone.

The same scenario plays out again; the second mate leads another group of volunteers, but the line is again found disconnected and the men gone. No explanation is found. The yacht keeps a close watch on the ship all night, and in the morning the crew again boards the derelict and inspects it thoroughly. A half-dozen armed men are left aboard, this time under the direction of the [[Third mate|third officer]]. At dusk the mate's whistle is heard, and there is a loud shouting from the derelict, but by the time the crew of the yacht investigates again, the men are gone.

Finally, the crew of the yacht set up an iron-barred cage on the deck of the derelict, with a group of armed men inside, and they hold a vigil while the yachts hover expectantly nearby, ready to turn their spotlight on the derelict. In the dead of night a strange noise is heard, and the men in the cage fire a gun. The yacht trains its spotlight squarely onto the derelict ship, and the men are astonished to see that the rigging of the derelict ship is full of pirates. In the ensuing gun battle, all the pirates are killed. The derelict is not really flooded; while the upper part of the hold is filled with water and floating timber, it has been retrofitted with an airtight compartment underneath, accessible through the hollow lower masts, and is complete with electric lights, ventilation fans, and motive power. The lost men are found below, bound in chains but unharmed amidst a king's ransom in stolen gold.

==="The Ghosts of the ''Glen Doon''"===
This story was first published in 1911 in ''The Red Magazine''.

Another floating derelict is the subject of an investigation because of a mysterious tapping. A brave (or foolhardy) man bets that he can spend the night aboard the allegedly haunted ship. Is the tapping noise produced by the ghosts of the men who drowned when it sank, or is there a more prosaic explanation?

We learn that the iron ship ''Glen Doon'' "turned turtle" (flipped upside-down) and trapped ten workers aboard. For twenty-four hours the ship floated upside-down. The tapping of the workers' hammers on the hull led rescuers to attempt to drill holes in the ship, but this just allowed the air to escape faster, and the men were drowned as the ship sank.

Seven months later, the ship was bought at auction and raised, although she then sat idle for another five years. No living soul is aboard her, but in the dead of night mysterious tapping can be heard, allegedely the ghosts of the drowned men. Larry Chaucer, the young son of a wealthy local, wagers that he can spend the night alone aboard the ship unmolested.

He and a number of his friends first climb aboard and investigate; aside from some silt, the ship appears completely empty, yet the faint tapping can be heard, although its precise source cannot be located. As they inspect the ship the tapping ceases. The men withdraw to a boat near the ship and to the dock to listen for trouble, leaving Chaucer aboard to perform his vigil. As they wait, the tapping sound resumes, audible even across the bay. Suddenly the firing of a pistol is heard, and then a scream. The men race for the ship, but the young daredevil can't be found. Only his empty pistol and his lantern remain. As the men explore the hold, a strange sound is heard, as if someone were ascending through the stillness of the hold, but no one can be seen. The men hastily leave the hold.

Days pass, and the police investigate in excruciating detail; Larry Chaucer's wealthy father is involved. The ship is emptied completely; the silt is removed, and the internal bulkheads are removed until the ''Glen Doon'' is little more than an iron shell. Nothing is found. Police officers keep watch on board, and patrol-boats are stationed near the hulk, looking for any clue, as fruitless weeks pass. One night the hammering sound starts again, and as armed detectives keep watch on the deck they see:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a man's head and face, the hair as long as a woman's, and dripping with sea water, so that the cadaverous face showed white and unwholesome from out of the sopping down-hang of the hair. In a minute there followed the body of the strange man, and the sea water ran from his garments, glistening as the moon-breams caught the drops. He came inboard over the rail, making no more noise than a shadow, and paused, swaying with a queer movement full in a patch of moonlight. Then, noiseless, he seemed to glide across the deck in the direction of the dark gape of the open main hatchway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the men try to stop him, and fire at him, the figure disppears into the hold, and no trace of him can be found. Investigation continues. Mechanics are hired to drill holes into the sides of the ship, demonstrating that there are no secret compartments. They even drill into the bottom of the ship, patching the holes with hot lead to prevent the ingress of water. The hollow steel lower masts are investigated as well, and found to be empty. The search looks hopeless until the police inspector discovers a single hair stuck in a nearly invisible metal seam in a hollow mast. A secret door into the mast is discovered and opened. At the bottom of the hollow mast, a secret passage is found, leading down into a shaft that opens into another vessel, made from discarded boilers welded together, suspended below the ''Glen Doon''. In it is a band of counterfeiters stamping coins; this is the source of the mysterious tapping. The miscreants are apprehended. Larry Chaucer presumably met his death at the hands of the counterfeiters.

==="Mr. Jock Danplank"===
This story was first published in 1912 in ''The Red Magazine''.

Mr. Jock Danplank, a British citizen who has spent time living in the United States, has come into a substantial inheritance that includes not only money but a cottage complete with gardening and housekeeping staff and a stunningly beautiful garden. But Danplank's deceased uncle neglected to tell anyone just where the money was to be found. Near death, he was heard to mutter "seventy-seven feet due east", but was unable to finish his instructions.

Danplank and his wife, Mary, take possession of the cottage and examining a large, ornate desk, attached to the floor, that was also part of the bequest. During the days and nights that follow, it becomes clear that Danplank's cousin is also trying to locate the money; he repeatedly invades the cottage grounds and angers the aged head gardener by trampling on the flower-beds; he even digs enormous pits on the grounds in the dead of night.

As the story reaches its climax Danplank and his wife arrange a surprise for the cousin. They silently observe him tampering with the ornate table in the cottage, and afterwards, while he and his confederates are digging another deep pit in the gardens, fill the pit with water and photograph him clambering out, covered with mud. The cousin's examinations have given them a clue, and they discover that by putting the table back in its original position they are able to use the [[compass rose]] in the desktop to locate the treasure. The story ends with another common Hodgson motif: a snide letter to the cousin, enclosing proofs of the photographs (for potential blackmail or criminal prosecution) and indicating that the treasure has been found.

Hodgson may have intended to introduce Jock Danplank as another recurring character. However, he did not use Danplank again. [[Sam Moskowitz]] in his introduction to the story collection ''Out of the Storm'' writes that the plot "...provides an inconsequential bit of fiction, interesting only for the clever utilization of photography in the story." (Hodgson was a noted photographer).

==="The Mystery of Captain Chappel"===
This story was first published in 1917 in ''The Red Magazine''.

A mysterious murder has taken place. Because the victim was observed leaving a pub and then found dead nearby, only a minute later, having traversed only a short distance on an empty street with high walls on either side, police are baffled. The initial setup is presented as a [[locked room mystery]], in which the murder appears impossible given the circumstances. Cobbler Juk, the uncle of the police officer investigating, is informally recruited, and turns out to be a talented amateur sleuth. A second murder takes place, this time of Saddler Atkins.

The cobbler believes that he knows who will be killed next, and so he and his nephew the police officer stake out the home of Councillor Tomkins, waiting. What they see is quite baffling: a seven-foot creature, emitting disturbing, inhuman noises, observes the councillor, then crashes through a window and attacks him, with the cobbler and constable giving chase. The creature escapes, but Tomkins is dead.

We next join the cobbler in surveillance of a black man, whom they accost outside his home. He fights off the cobbler; in his home the cobbler finds an object, which is not revealed to the reader.

In the conclusion the cobbler explains the whole story: he has uncovered evidence that the three dead men worked together, many years ago, on a ship that was apparently involved in illegal seal poaching. The black man worked for the three, and to guarantee his silence the three cut out his tongue. The black man has been working his revenge, wearing a costume in the shape of a seal head. The cobbler tracked the man by an idiosyncratic habit: while waiting for his victims, he drops the matches that he uses to light his pipe, after tearing them in two and twisting them in a distinct manner. These twisted half-matches were found at the first two crime scenes and also in the floor-sweepings from a local pub.

==="The Home-Coming of Captain Dan"===
This story was first published in 1918 in ''The Red Magazine''.

Captain Dan himself is a very colorful character who speaks in a mixture of nautical argot and gutter French.

==="Merciful Plunder"===
This story was first published in 1925 in ''Argosy-Allstory Weekly''.

A sea captain named Mellor is carrying out trading in a seaport on the Adriatic coast; the seaport is involved in "the wars so common in the Balkans." Mortar and rifle fire is audible in the distance, but Captain Mellor is more disturbed to hear the horrible sounds of a mass execution of twenty minors, who had been fighting as irregular guerilla warriors, in the town square. Twenty more youths remain locked in the local jail awaiting execution the next morning. Mellor, pretending to support the executions and displaying little sympathy for the youths, gets a tour from a Frenchman. Mellor observes the pitiful condition of the prisoners, and watches as a guard puts out a cigarette against one boy's leg; he also learns the layout of the jail building and the location and number of the guards.

That night, Mellor leads a daring raid. A cliff edge lies behind and above the jail, and with his chief engineer George and two other crewmen, in the dark of night they put into place a spar and pulley to lower the captain and his chief engineer to the jail window. While they are nearly caught, with the help of the boys they manage to remove the window bars with a hacksaw; the boys kill one guard with one of the bars, and the captain manages to incapacitate two others. The boys are removed through the window and spirited away aboard Mellor's ship. The Frenchman never learns by what means the boys have miraculously disappeared, although he remains appalled by Mellor's outward cavalier attitude, telling him "the good God was kinder than you."

==="The Haunting of the ''Lady Shannon''"===
The story was first published in 1975 in the collection ''Out of the Storm'' edited by [[Sam Moskowitz]].

A young seaman on board the ''Lady Shannon'', discussing Captain Teller and his cruelty and violent tendencies, encourages the other seamen to stand up to the man. Overhearing the discussion are three apprentices. The fate of another seaman, Toby, at the hands of the captain and second mate is revealed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Last trip they treated one of the ordinaries so badly that the poor chap went queer -- silly. Mind you, he acted like a goat and gave both the second mate and the skipper slack; but they knocked all that out of him and some of his brains as well, I believe. Anyway, he went half-dotty before the end of the voyage."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few days later, Seaman Jones, a vocal advocate of standing up for himself, bites off a plug of tobacco and is noticed by the second mate. He refuses to throw his tobacco overboard and the mate attacks him. They fight, and Jones severely injures the mate. The captain begins shouting and firing his revolver, although he only wounds one man by accident. The first mate also attacks Jones; in the fracas, the captain throws his revolver and accidentally strikes the first mate, who is knocked unconscious. One of the apprentices, Tommy, involuntarily shouts "Hurray!" and is attacked by the captain, who beats him, knocking him unconscious. Jones meanwhile attacks the second mate, and is also knocked unconscious, while the first mate has recovered. At the end of the complicated fracas Tommy, the second mate, and Jones are all unconscious. The second mate recovers with the administration of whiskey.

Two nights later, Jones is still only semi-conscious. As the second mate keeps watch, he abruptly screams and falls; he is found to be dead of a stab wound, although the weapon and the source of the attack are unknown; the attack seemed to come out of nowhere, right under the captain's watchful eye. The captain is deeply disturbed, and musters the entire crew for inspection. Everyone is present and accounted for, except Jones and Tommy. We learn that, in the opinion of the first mate, Jones is near death, and the apprentice Tommy is also still too badly injured to have committed the murder. The captain and the first mate are baffled, and become suspicious that the cause was supernatural.

The next day the captain becomes hopelessly drunk; the first mate disposes of the second mate's body, and repeatedly checks on the state of seaman Jones. The first mate goes on watch that evening. During his watch, he sends an older sailor repeatedly to check on Jones; at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the seaman reports that Jones has died. A disturbing grating sound is immediately heard, and the first mate, his imagination working overtime, becomes agitated, believing Jones' ghost may be coming for him. We learn that Tommy is also doing poorly, which only adds the mate's fears.

That evening, the captain and the mate keep watch together. After the moonrise, a "strange husky inhuman gurgle" is heard from the bridge, and a "low, incredible, abominable laughter." The mate panics, screaming "he's come for me!" and running to the bridge; he is suddenly stabbed. A figure comes at the captain: "something white and slender that ran upon the captain noiselessly." The captain, panicked, crashes into the steel side of the deck-house and is knocked unconscious. The figure vanishes overboard, apparently without a splash.

In the aftermath, we learn that the white figure was Toby, the ordinary seaman, who had been "hazed to the verge of insanity by the brutality of the captain and the officers on the previous voyage." He was covered with flour, and apparently had been living as a stowaway in among the cargo; he had stabbed the officers from a vantage point hidden in a ventilator. In conclusion, the story tells us that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tommy regained his health, as did both Captain Jeller and Jacob, the mate; but as a "hardcase" skipper and a "buck-o-mate", they are no longer shining examples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="The Heathen's Revenge"===
This story was first published in 1988 in chapbook form as "The Way of the Heathen."

==="The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder"===
This is considered by some editors such as Jeremy Lassen to be one of Hodgson's finest short stories. It features a remarkable crew of aged sailors who seem to have been at sea for decades; even the one they call the "boy" is fifty years old.

==="The Albatross"===
First published in the American pulp magazine ''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]. ''
An albatross is captured on a ship and a message is found tied to it which tells of a water-logged boat where a woman is alone with a ship full of rats. She only has a week's supplies left and as their ship is becalmed, one man takes it on himself to rescue her by rowing to her distant vessel and taking on the rats.&lt;ref name="swb" /&gt;

==="The Smugglers"===

==="In the Wailing Gully"===

==="The Girl with the Grey Eyes"===
Hodgson is not known as a writer of romantic stories, although several of his novels contain themes of romantic love amidst the horror and adventure. This is one of a small number of stories that he wrote specifically targeted to female readers of romance magazines.

==="Kind, Kind and Gentle is She"===

==="A Timely Escape"===

==="On the Bridge"===
This story, presented as a factual minute-by-minute account of events on the bridge of a ship as it navigates through iceberg-filled waters, was actually written to capitalize on interest in the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]].

==="Through the Vortex of a Cyclone"===
A four-masted ship is absorbed by a terrible cyclone storm; an excellent example of the fight between man and nature. The atmosphere is masterly graduated; the story begins among the quiet waters of the ocean beneath clear and blue sky, but gradually the horizont is getting darker, a strange voice is heard, then the ship is plunged into the monstrous hurricane. Then, when it is exactly in the Vortex (the center of the cyclone), the crew members fire an old pistol loaded with a flash-dust and they see the legendary Pyramidal Sea, a sea raised to a high water-hills, while the cry of the cyclone is circulating around them in a distance of several tens of miles. Though not being a fiction or horror story, this tale belongs to the best Mr. Hodgson ever wrote.

'''Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe''' (21 September 1849&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; – 25 March 1905), known professionally by his stage name '''Maurice Barrymore''', was an India-born British stage actor. He was the [[patriarch]] of the [[Barrymore family|Barrymore acting family]], father of [[John Barrymore|John]], [[Lionel Barrymore|Lionel]] and [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]], and great-grandfather of actress [[Drew Barrymore|Drew]].&lt;ref name=death&gt;Said that Maurice had died in [[Amityville, New York]], pp. 21–22, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blythe in [[Amritsar]], [[British India|India]], he was the son of William Edward Blythe (1818–1873), a surveyor for the [[British East India Company]], and his wife Charlotte Matilda Chamberlayne de Tankerville (1822–1849) who had some French descent. Herbert, the youngest of seven had an older brother named Will and two sisters named Emily and Evelin. Three other siblings had died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160517125914/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/annapizzey/macblyth.htm The Blyth Family, personal reminiscence of Margarita Alice Caroline Blyth(1878-1952), niece of Herbert Blyth (Maurice Barrymore)]...(Wayback Machine)&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda, after a difficult pregnancy, died shortly after giving birth to Herbert on 21 September 1849. In his formative years Herbert was raised by his Aunt Amelia Blythe, his mother's sister, and later by other family members. Amelia, a Chamberlayne by birth, had married a brother of Herbert's father and was a Blythe by marriage. Herbert was sent back to England for education at [[Harrow School]], and studied Law at [[Oxford University]], where he was captain of his class [[Association football|football]] team in 1868. Herbert also became enamored of the sport of [[boxing]]. The [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]] were firmly established at this time but it wasn't unusual to see [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare knuckle]] fights. On 21 March 1872 Herbert won the [[middleweight]] boxing championship of [[England]]. Years later many of Herbert's friends would be sports figures of the day, particularly boxers and wrestlers such as [[William Muldoon]], [[John L. Sullivan]], [[James J. Corbett]] and a young actor named [[Hobart Bosworth]], the latter of whom Herbert would stage in an amateur bout with his son Lionel.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;James Kotsilibas Davis (ca. 1977) ''Great Times Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore''&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert's father expected him to become a [[barrister]], but Herbert fell in with a group of actors, which scandalized the elder Blythe. That same year 1872 Herbert sat for his first posed theatrical photographic portrait by noted photographer Oliver Sarony, an older brother of the better remembered [[Napoleon Sarony]]. In order to spare his father the "shame" of having a son in such a "dissolute" vocation, he took the stage name Maurice Barrymore (though he never legally changed from "Blythe"), inspired by a conversation he had with fellow actor Charles Vandenhoff about William Barrymore (1759–1830),&lt;ref&gt;American and British Theatrical Biography page 74 c.1979 by J.P. Wearing Retrieved 12 August 2015 {{ISBN|0-8108-1201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early 19th-century English thespian, after seeing a poster depicting Barrymore in the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. He wanted his first name to be pronounced in the French manner (môr-ĒS) instead of the English (MÔR-is). His friends avoided that altogether by simply calling him "Barry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.about.com/library/prm/blbarrymore2.htm American History From About&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at americanhistory.about.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and marriage to Georgiana Drew==
[[File:Maurice Barrymore.jpg|thumb|Maurice Barrymore as Wilding in ''Captain Swift'' (1888) by C. Haddon Chambers&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark%3A%2F13960%2Ft3417ff02;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=4 C. Haddon Chambers (1888) ''Captain Swift'' at Hathi Trust Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Portrait of Maurice Barrymore.jpg|right|thumb|Maurice Barrymore mid 1890s.]] 
On 29 December 1874, Barrymore emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the SS ''America'' to [[Boston]], and joined [[Augustin Daly]]'s troupe, making his début in ''[[Under the Gaslight]]''.

He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] début in December 1875 in ''[[Pique (play)|Pique]]'' opposite [[Emily Rigl]]; in the cast was a young actress, [[Georgiana Drew]], known as Georgie. Maurice and Georgiana had been introduced earlier by her brother [[John Drew Jr.]] who had befriended Maurice when he first arrived in America. After a brief courtship, Barrymore and Georgie married on 31 December 1876, and had three children: [[Lionel Barrymore|Lionel]] (born 1878), [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]] (born 1879), and [[John Barrymore|John]] (born 1882). While their parents were on tour, the children lived with Georgiana's mother in Philadelphia. Maurice also owned a farm on Staten Island to keep his collection of exotic animals. Georgiana died 2 July 1893, from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. For a summer in 1896, Lionel and John were left on the farm in the care of the man who fed the animals. Barrymore remarried exactly one year after Georgie's death to Mamie Floyd, much to Ethel's consternation. During his career, Maurice Barrymore played opposite many of the reigning female stars of the time including [[Helena Modjeska]], [[Mrs. Fiske]], [[Mrs. Leslie Carter]], [[Olga Nethersole]], [[Lillian Russell]], and [[Lily Langtry]].

==Shooting==
On 19 March 1879, in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], Texas, Barrymore and fellow actor Ben Porter were shot by a notorious [[gunfighter]] and bully named Jim Currie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://old.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=porter&amp;GSfn=benjamin&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GSsr=81&amp;GRid=19443&amp;df=all&amp; Ben Porter, findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeArment"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeArment|first=Robert K.|title=Deadly Dozen: Forgotten Gunfighters of the Old West|volume=2|date=30 March 2012|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806138633|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrymore and Porter had played cards earlier with Currie, winning some money from him. That evening, while Barrymore, Porter and the actress Ellen Cummins dined at the White House Saloon, an intoxicated Currie began insulting and goading them into a fight. Barrymore challenged Currie to a fistfight. Currie shot him in the chest and then shot Porter in the stomach. John Drew, Jr., also with the company, showed up at the doorway after being alerted by all the commotion but Currie didn't shoot him. Porter was killed, while doctors spent the night operating on Barrymore to save his life. Georgie, then several months pregnant with Ethel, rushed to Texas to be at her husband's side enduring a long train trip. He made a full recovery, and returned to Marshall for the legal procedures that followed. Currie's brother was Andrew Currie, mayor of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana, from 1878 to 1890 and later a member of the Louisiana state legislature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy2G-wG-eoAC&amp;|title=Eric Brock's Shreveport}}&lt;/ref&gt; who apparently used his influence to secure a not guilty verdict (after a 10-minute deliberation).&lt;ref name="DeArment"/&gt; An enraged Barrymore vowed never to return to Texas.

According to a 2004 [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] ''[[Biography (television program)|Biography]]'' piece, after the Ben Porter tragedy, Barrymore asked Georgiana to tour with him and [[Helena Modjeska]] in a play he had written. Georgiana and the children had converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] under Helena's influence. Learning that he and Helena had resumed their romance, Georgiana, who had been given ownership of the play by Barrymore, forced his hand by closing it. Helena's husband, its producer, [[lawsuit|sued]] her. The real reason for Georgiana's actions never got into the press. However, Barrymore's many dalliances did make the newspapers.

==''Nadjezda''==
In 1884, Barrymore wrote a play titled ''Nadjezda'' (meaning "hope").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Literary gossip|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=7 Feb 1884|volume=1|issue=10|page=158|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n80/mode/1up|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period he sailed with his wife Georgiana and their children Lionel, Ethel and John, then respectively 6, 5 and 2, to England to visit relatives he hadn't seen since migrating to America. (He had inherited some money from his aunt Amelia, one of his family members who helped raise him.) During the trip Barrymore met the great French actress and star [[Sarah Bernhardt]]. Without copyrighting his play, he gave her a copy of the manuscript. In 1886, [[Victorien Sardou]] wrote his play ''[[La Tosca]],'' which later achieved great fame as an opera. Barrymore claimed that Bernhardt had given his play to Sardou and that ''La Tosca'' plagiarized it, and sought an injunction to stop [[Fanny Davenport]] from putting on further performances. In affidavits read out in court Bernhardt said that she had never seen the play and knew nothing about it, and Sardou said that preliminary material for the play had been in his desk for fifteen years. In fact, the only resemblance to ''La Tosca'' is the unholy bargain the heroine makes to save her husband's life, similar to that of Tosca and Baron Scarpia. As Sardou pointed out in his affidavit, this plot device is a common one and had been notably used by Shakespeare in ''[[Measure for Measure]].''

==Last years==
[[File:Belasco's The Heart of Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|Lithograph of Barrymore with [[Mrs. Leslie Carter]] in ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', 1895]]
In 1896, Barrymore became the first major Broadway star to headline in [[Vaudeville]]—a brave foray at the time that he and Georgie speculatively would have later made into motion pictures had they lived. In the 1895 theater season on Broadway he co-starred with Mrs. Leslie Carter in ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]''. In the 1899 season on Broadway he had a success playing opposite Mrs. Fiske in the part of Rawdon Crawley in ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Famous Actors and Actresses On the American Stage: Documents of the American Theater History'' Vol. 1 A-J by William C. Young c.1975; (Maurice Barrymore entry pages75-81 with splendid photo as Rawdon Crawley)&lt;/ref&gt; This play was based on a character from [[William Thackeray]]'s novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''. ''Becky Sharp'' was Barrymore's last Broadway success. In 1900, Barrymore toured the U.S. with a play called ''[[The Battle of the Strong]]'' co-starring a young [[Holbrook Blinn]]. In the company of this play was a five-year-old child actress, [[Blanche Sweet]], who grew up to be a silent movie actress and acted with Lionel in his first film. When the ''Battle of the Strong'' company stopped in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] Barrymore sat for his last posed photograph. Also during this time he got to spend time with his son John, who was now in his late teens. Lionel and Ethel were on the road in theater companies, having already started their careers.

==Mental breakdown and death==
On 28 March 1901, Barrymore was performing at the Lion Palace Theatre in New York when he suddenly departed from his monologue and shocked the audience with what was described as "a blasphemous attack on the Jews" and a rant of "such an emotional pitch that tears rolled down his face."  After further erratic behavior, Barrymore was committed to Bellevue Hospital by a court order obtained by his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1901/03/30/page/1/article/barry-more-in-an-asylum "Barrymore in an Asylum"], ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 30 March 1901, p1&lt;/ref&gt; 
In reporting his death on 25 March 1905, ''[[The New York Times]]'' recalled that "He was playing a [[vaudeville]] engagement [in 1901] at a [[Harlem]] theatre when he suddenly dropped his lines and began to rave". The following day he became violent and was taken to [[Bellevue Hospital|Bellevue]] insane ward by his son, John, who lured him under the pretense of starring in a new play. At Bellevue and later [[Amityville, New York|Amityville]] he was diagnosed with the lingering effects of [[syphilis]], an incurable disease in his day. During his stay at Bellevue he almost strangled his daughter Ethel when she paid a visit to him. Ethel, through her early success on the stage, would pay for her father's stay in the institutions. A trained boxer, Barrymore's strength remained, as in a scuffle with one of the Bellevue attendants, he picked the man up over his head and threw him into a corner. In 1905 his son Lionel visited him at Amityville and the subject of San Francisco came up. Maurice called Lionel a  "goddamned liar" and stated that San Francisco had been destroyed by fire and earthquake. Lionel writing in his autobiography says his father had foreseen the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|great 1906 earthquake]] a full year before it took place.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Barrymore writing in ''We Barrymores'' c.1951&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice died at Amityville in his sleep, and Ethel had him buried at Glenwood Cemetery in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt; When the cemetery was later closed his remains were moved to Mount Vernon Cemetery, also in Philadelphia, where his first wife and her family are buried. Barrymore was fondly remembered and his death was widely reported in the country's newspapers. Barrymore had lived long enough to see all three of his children grow to adulthood and enter the family business of [[acting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161019021718/http://nystage1903.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/ssvulcania-mauricebarrymore1.jpg "Tribute to Maurice Barrymore"] by actor/friend [[Henry Miller (actor)|Henry Miller]](Wayback version)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In memoriam==
In honor of his life, Michael J. Farrand penned the memorial narrative poem "The Man Who Brought Royalty to America" in 2000, based on the definitive biography ''Great Times, Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore'' by James Kotsilibas Davis (Doubleday, 1977).

A '''Moon landing''' is the arrival of a [[spacecraft]] on the surface of the [[Moon]]. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 2]] mission, on 13 September 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1959-014A | title = Luna 2 | publisher = NASA–NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Apollo 11]] was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11_40th.html NASA Apollo 11 40th anniversary].&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|six manned U.S. landings]] (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landings]] happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.

To date, the [[United States]] is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.

== Unmanned landings ==
After the unsuccessful attempt by the [[Luna 1]] to land on the Moon in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] performed the first hard (unpowered) Moon landing later that same year with the [[Luna 2]] spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with [[Ranger 4]]. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landings]] and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the [[Luna 9]] and [[Luna 13]] missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] soft landings.

The Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil [[sample return mission|sample return]] with the [[Luna 16]] probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by [[Luna 20]] and [[Luna 24]] in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first [[Lunokhod]], [[Luna E-8 No.201]], the [[Luna 17]] and [[Luna 21]] were successful unmanned [[lunar rover]] missions in 1970 and 1973.

Many missions were failures at launch.  In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: [[Luna 15]], [[Luna 18]], and [[Luna 23]] all crashed on landing; and the U.S. [[Surveyor 4]] lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.

More recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around {{convert|8000|km/h}}, often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome [[lunar orbit#Perturbation effects|perturbations]] from lunar [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s ("masscons") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter [[Hiten]] impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The [[European Space Agency]] performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter [[SMART-1]] on 3 September 2006.

[[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian [[Chandrayaan-1]] lunar orbiter and performed [[remote sensing]] experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.

The Chinese lunar orbiter [[Chang'e 1]] executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission [[Chang'e 3]] was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.

== Manned landings ==

{{Further|Apollo program}}

[[File:Lunar surface shortly after landing, Apollo 16.jpg|thumb|right|The view through the window of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] ''Orion'' shortly after [[Apollo 16]]'s landing.]]

A total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a [[Lunar Module]] on each of six [[NASA]] missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on [[Apollo 11]], and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with [[Gene Cernan]] and [[Jack Schmitt]] on [[Apollo 17]]. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.

All Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the [[Command Module]]. The last three missions had a [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|rover]] for increased mobility.

== Scientific background ==
In order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the [[gravity well]] of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a [[rocket]]. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] or [[Jet aircraft|jets]], a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its [[speed]] at high altitudes in the [[vacuum]] outside the Earth's [[atmosphere]].

Upon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about {{convert|160|km/h}} and be ruggedized to withstand a "hard landing" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a "soft landing" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized [[seismometer]] package in 1962 all failed.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger3"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1962-012A|title=NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Ranger 3 Details| accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.

The speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the [[escape velocity]] of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is {{convert| 2.38|km/s}}.&lt;ref name="GgLunarXPrize-MoonInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/education/learning-guides/escape-from-the-moon|title=Escape from the Moon!|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in velocity (referred to as a [[delta-v]]) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original [[launch vehicle]] as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] carried out by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using [[atmospheric entry]] techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.

The Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.&lt;ref name="nasa-luna2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1959-014A|title=NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Lun 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crash landings&lt;ref name="hard-landing"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| title= Homepage of V.V Pustynski for students of YFT0060| publisher= [[Tartu Observatory]]| location= Estonia| accessdate= 17 February 2011| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20121218012317/http://www.aai.ee/~vladislav/program_yft0060.html| archivedate= 18 December 2012| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been [[list of artificial objects on the Moon|many such Moon crashes]], often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a [[Quake (natural phenomenon)#Moonquake|moonquake]] on [[seismometer]]s that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the [[internal structure of the Moon]].

To return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the [[gravity well]] of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the [[kinetic energy]] of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and [[parachute]]s must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.

{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
The intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. [[World War II]]  had introduced many new and deadly innovations including [[blitzkrieg]]-style surprise attacks used in the [[invasion of Poland]] and in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the [[V-2 rocket]], a [[ballistic missile]] which killed thousands in attacks on London and [[Antwerp]]; and the [[atom bomb]], which killed hundreds of thousands in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the [[hydrogen bomb]].
[[File:Luna 3 moon.jpg|left|thumb|The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.]]
[[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon "could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers".&lt;ref name="ley195707"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1957-07/Galaxy_1957_07#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy Science Fiction | date=July 1957 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | number=61–71|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union [[Rocket launch|launched]] ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' as the first [[artificial satellite]] to orbit the Earth and so initiated the [[Space Race]]. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}   Also, the steady beeping of the [[radio beacon]] aboard ''Sputnik 1'' as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  as effective propaganda to [[Third World]] countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet [[political system]] compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a [[solar orbit]], the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen [[far side of the Moon]]. These were the [[Luna 1]], [[Luna 2]], and [[Luna 3]] spacecraft.

[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|right|thumb|A 1963 conceptual model of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo Lunar Excursion Module]]]]
The U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, [[NASA]]. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBMs]]) that would bridge the so-called [[missile gap]] and enable a policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the Soviets known as [[mutual assured destruction]] or MAD. These newly developed [[missile]]s were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).

While NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.

== Early Soviet unmanned lunar missions (1958–1965) ==
[[File:Lunik 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Luna 3 transmitted the first photos of the far side of the Moon]]
After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public "[[Luna programme|Luna]]" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a "[[Sputnik programme|Sputnik]]" or "[[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]]" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.

In contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] and [[Ranger program]]s. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/Programs/pioneer.html JPL Pioneer Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928103019/http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/Programs/pioneer.html |date=28 September 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lunar Impact{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780007206_1978007206.pdf| title=Lunar Missions 1958 through 1965| accessdate=9 September 2009| publisher=Nasa History Series|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1962-012A| title= NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Ranger 4 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1964-007A|title=NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Ranger 6 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These surface packages were to use [[retrorocket]]s to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface.

=== Pioneer missions ===
Three different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an [[infrared]] image scanning television system with a [[image resolution|resolution]] of 1 [[milliradian]] to study the Moon's surface, an [[ionization chamber]] to measure [[radiation]] in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect [[micrometeorites]], a [[magnetometer]], and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the [[United States Air Force]], exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around {{convert|110,000|km|mi}} and {{convert|1450|km|mi|}}, far short of the roughly {{convert|400000|km|mi}} required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.

NASA then collaborated with the [[United States Army]]'s [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] ICBM, carrying only [[photocells]] which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a [[Geiger-Müller tube]] detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around {{convert| 100000|km|mi}}, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than {{convert|60000|km|mi}}, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a [[solar orbit]].

The final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four "[[paddlewheel]]" [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] extending from a one-meter diameter spherical [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the [[Peak of Eternal Light|poles]], record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure [[Magnetic field of celestial bodies|magnetic fields]], detect [[Alfvén wave|low frequency electromagnetic waves]] in space and use a sophisticated integrated [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.

Following the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as [[Mariner program|Mariners]]; lunar versions were [[Ranger program|Rangers]]. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.

=== Ranger missions ===
{{See also|Ranger program}}
The Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger1"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1961-021A|title=NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Ranger 1 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1961-032A|title=NASA – NSSDC – Spacecraft – Ranger 2 Details|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacecraft experiments included a [[H-alpha|Lyman-alpha]] telescope, a [[rubidium|rubidium-vapor]] [[magnetometer]], electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range [[particle detector]]s, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating [[ionization chamber]], [[cosmic dust]] detectors, and [[scintillation counter]]s. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of {{convert|110000|km|mi}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|60000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger1"/&gt;

From that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the [[magnetosphere]] over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth [[parking orbit]] after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.

The first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger5"/&gt; All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1&amp;nbsp;m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of {{convert|5050|lbf|kN}},&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger4"/&gt; and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in diameter. This lander (code-named ''Tonto'') was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid [[freon]]. A 42&amp;nbsp;kg (56 pounds) {{convert|30|cm|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

This payload sphere contained six silver-[[cadmium]] batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.

No cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the {{convert|3.1|m|ft}} Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.&lt;ref name="nasa-ranger4"/&gt; Seconds before impact, at {{convert|5|and|0.6|km|mi}} above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ranger.html here]).

Other instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at {{convert|330|m|ft}} above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

On Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior [[sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of the spacecraft by keeping it above the [[boiling]] point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Heat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While [[Ranger 6]] suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent [[Ranger 7]] mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.

Breaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the [[Ranger 7]] mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the [[United States Congress]] intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with [[Ranger 8]] and [[Ranger 9]] further buoyed U.S. hopes.

[[File:Луна-16.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander]]
[[File:Soviet moonrover.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic moon rover]]
The [[Luna 9]] spacecraft, launched by the [[Soviet Union]], performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February, 1966. [[Airbags#Airbag landing systems|Airbags]] protected its {{convert|99|kg|lb}} ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over {{convert|15|m/s|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="astronautix-luna9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lunae6.htm|title=Astronautix Luna E-6|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luna 13]] duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moon Exploration|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/space-exploration/moon-exploration-article.html|work=National Geographic |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luna 16]] was the first [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic probe]] to land on the [[Moon]] and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burrows |first=William E. |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library | pages=432 |isbn=0-375-75485-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented the first [[lunar sample]] return mission by the [[Soviet Union]], and was the third lunar [[sample return mission]] overall, following the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 12]] missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by [[Luna 20]] (1972) and [[Luna 24]] (1976).

In 1970 and 1973 two [[Lunokhod]] ("Moonwalker") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5&amp;nbsp;km ([[Lunokhod 1]]) and 37&amp;nbsp;km ([[Lunokhod 2]]). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.

The U.S. [[robot]]ic [[Surveyor program]] was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the [[radar]] and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.

== Transition from direct ascent landings to lunar orbit operations ==
Within four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.

However, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a {{convert|50|km|mi}}-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned {{convert|160|km|mi|}}-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.

[[File:Space Race 1957-1975 black text.png|thumb|450px|A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the USA and USSR.]]

Advances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such [[direct ascent]]s use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.

In contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission profile for a manned Moon landing.

Accordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.

An unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's [[lunar maria|maria]]. Such mass concentrations ("[[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.

Controlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA [[Lunar Prospector]] orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist [[Eugene Shoemaker]] was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor – currently the only human remains on the Moon.

== Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967–1970) ==
{{Main|Soviet manned lunar programs}}
[[File:Zond Assembly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zond program|Zond]] mounted on top stage of Proton booster in assembly hangar.]]
It is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called [[free return trajectory]]. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.

Manned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around {{convert|17000|mph|km/h m/s}}. Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around {{convert|25000|mph|km/h m/s}}. The [[g-force|g-loading]] on astronauts during the resulting [[acceleration|deceleration]] can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.

Achieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.

Initial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and U.S. [[Mercury program|Mercury]] programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten [[Gemini program|Gemini]] low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]] that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.

After the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The [[Zond program|Zond]] spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational [[Proton rocket|Proton]] launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation [[Soyuz spacecraft]] requiring development of the advanced [[N-1 rocket|N-1]] booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.

Like Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the [[Apollo 13]] mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.

[[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the [[Space Race]] with its payload of tortoises, insects, plants, and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.

As a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]], and because of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of [[Apollo 8]] from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.

In early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in [[Baikonur]], giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. [[Cosmonauts]] went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.

By this time flights of the third generation U.S. [[Apollo Program|Apollo]] spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The [[Apollo 8]] mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the [[Saturn V]] booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. [[Apollo 10]] then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within {{convert|47,400|ft|km}} altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt [[Luna 15]] in July 1969, the stage was set for [[Apollo 11]].

=== US strategy ===
{{Main|Apollo program#Political pressure builds}}
Plans for manned Moon exploration originated during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, [[Wernher von Braun]] had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, [[atmospheric re-entry]] without [[Ablation|ablative]] overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik]], von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.

After the [[Space race#Humans in space|early Soviet successes]], especially [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the [[Third World]]. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.

Advances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.

[[File:Apollo Landings by Nasa.jpg|thumb|350px|Apollo landing sites]]
Johnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, [[James E. Webb]], who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.

The Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V [[launch vehicle]], which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.

For the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.

=== Soviet strategy ===
{{Main|Soviet manned lunar programs{{!}}Soviet Moonshot}}

Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in October 1963 that the USSR was "not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon," while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.

At the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. [[Sergey Korolev]], the [[Soviet space program]]'s chief designer, had started promoting his [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] craft and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.

Khrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.

With Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed [[Aleksei Leonov]] on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.

A program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks.  This had several failures.  It eventually succeeded with [[Luna 16]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna16.php |The Mission of Luna 16]&lt;/ref&gt;  But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.

In total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of [[free return trajectory]]; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut [[Alan Bean]] is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=In the Shadow of the Moon|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=37065|publisher=comingsoon.net|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other aspects of the Apollo Moon successful landings ===
Unlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.

President Richard Nixon had speechwriter [[William Safire]] prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=White House 'Lost In Space' Scenarios|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0808051apollo1.html|publisher=thesmokinggun.com|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2006, the [[Associated Press]] reported that NASA is [[Apollo 11 missing tapes|missing the original]] [[Slow-scan television]] tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package|Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apollo TV Tapes: The Search Continues|url=http://www.space.com/news/061103_apollo_tapes.html|publisher=space.com|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landings on moons of other Solar System bodies ==
Progress in [[space exploration]] has recently broadened the phrase ''moon landing'' to include other moons in the [[Solar System]] as well. The [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]] of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission to [[Saturn]] performed a successful unmanned moon landing on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe [[Phobos 2]] came within {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} of performing an unmanned moon landing on [[Mars]]' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called [[Fobos-Grunt]] ("grunt" means "soil" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on [[Jupiter]]'s [[Europa (moon)|Europa moon]] to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.

== Proposed future missions ==

[[ISRO]], the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named [[Chandrayaan 2]]. According to former ISRO Chairman [[G. Madhavan Nair]], "The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers – one Indian and another Russian – on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second [[Chandrayaan-2|Chandrayaan]] mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth."

In addition, in August 2009 NASA's [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html | title = LRO Sees Apollo Landing Sites | accessdate =2 July 2011 | date = 17 July 2009 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' '''Mérope''' ''  (full title '' '''La Mérope Française''' '') is a tragedy in five acts by [[Voltaire]]. The text is a reworking by Voltaire of the Italian tragedy ''Merope'' (1713) by [[Scipione Maffei]], dating from 1736/1737.&lt;ref name="DawsonMorere2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deidre Dawson|author2=Pierre Morere|author3=Pierre Morère|title=Scotland and France in the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIhe9Tp4lLsC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5526-6|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play premiered in 1743 and first appeared in print in 1744.


==Background==
[[Scipione Maffei]] worked the classical story into his tragedy (it) ''[[:it:Merope (Maffei)|Merope]]'' in 1713. Voltaire met Maffei in Paris in 1733 and secured his agreement that it should be adapted into a French tragedy.&lt;ref name="DeTemple"&gt;Siegfried Detemple: ''Die Französische Merope, in: Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag.'' Reichert, Wiesbaden 1994, S. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire decided to premiere it only after the staging of his tragedy [[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]], although he had completed work on it in 1737.

==Action==
The action takes place at the court of [[Messene]]. The queen dowager Merope, mourning her murdered husband  [[Cresphontes|Cresphonte]] regards the newcomer Egisthe as responsible for the murder of her son, when in fact he is her long-lost son. He presents himself at court and eventually deposes and kills the tyrannical usurper Polyphonte, who had killed his father. Egisthe then installs Mérope as queen.&lt;ref name="DeTemple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochman1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Hochman|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama: An International Reference Work in 5 Volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88xIQiXVMCQC&amp;pg=PA116|year=1984|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and critical reception==
The play was put on at the [[Comédie-Française]]. After the premiere the audience called Voltaire onto the stage in front of the curtain - the first time this had ever happened in the history of French theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DuMont |first1=E.R. |title=The Dramatic Works of Voltaire |date=1901 |publisher=The St. Hubert Guild |page=4 |edition=Vol 8 Part 1 |url=http://lf-oll.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/2187/Voltaire_0060-08_Bk.pdf |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 29 subsequent performances the play was a great success. It was also a commercial success, with receipts exceeding those of any previous play by Voltaire. ''Merope'' was revived in February and March the following year, attracting even larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Besterman: Herr und Gelehrter (1742-1746), in: Voltaire, Winkler, München, 1971, S. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed editions==
The first printed edition of the play was ''La Mérope Française, avec quelques petites pièces de Litterature'', Paris, Chez Prault fils, Libraire, Quai de Conty, vis-à-vis la descente du Pont-Neuf, à la Charitè, M. DCC. XLIV, 8°, XXIV (II), 116 (II), 16 S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Mérope française, avec quelques petites pièces de littérature Voltaire |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8618428r/f9.image.r=merope%20voltaire |website=gallica.bnf.fr |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale Française |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the play was printed Voltaire added a preface, ''Avis au lecteur'', in which he warned against pirate editions, and a letter of dedication to Scipione Maffei. The subtitle ''Pièces fugitives de littérature'' indicated that a number of other works were published together with the tragedy: ''Lettre sur l'esprit'', ''Nouvelles considérations sur l'histoire'' and ''Lettre à M. Norberg, chapelain du roy de Suède Charles XII, auteur de l`histoire de ce monarque''.

''Mérope'' was translated into English by [[Aaron Hill (writer)|Aaron Hill]], who also translated other works by Voltaire, ''Zara'' (''Zaire'') and ''Alzira '' (''Alzire'') for the London stage.&lt;ref name="Gerrard2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Gerrard|title=Aaron Hill: The Muses' Projector, 1685-1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQi7TiXuo28C&amp;pg=PA246|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-818388-4|pages=246–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter]] translated the play into German in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Freimüthige für Deutschland: Zeitblatt der Belehrung u.

'''''Rocket Mania!''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] by Belgian studio Nuclide Games, published by [[PopCap Games]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Rocket Mania.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Rotate fuse segments to launch fireworks.]]
In ''Rocket Mania'', players earn points by quickly and skillfully launching [[fireworks]].  This is done by rotating [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]] segments on a grid in order to form a path between sources of flame on the left and firework rockets on the right.  As the two are connected, the rockets launch, earning points.  Bonus points can be earned by launching multiple rockets at once, which is possible since the fuse segments often contain 3-way or 4-way junction pieces, effectively splitting the path of the flame.  After a rocket launch, all fuse segments which were touched by the flames are eliminated and replaced by new random fuse segments (with existing pieces falling downward to fill any gaps).

Connections are helpfully color-coded in order to easily identify fuse segments which are connected to a source of fire or to one or more rockets.  Players often find it helpful to work backwards (from the rockets), allowing setup of a multiple rocket launch before making connection with fuse segments already connected to flames.

===Items and coins===
The game features bonus items which randomly appear on various fuse segments. These include gems (worth extra points), bombs (which blow up all nearby fuses, but also any items), and clocks (which temporarily freeze the game countdown timer). These items are earned when the fuse segment they are placed upon is burned.

Coins can be collected in the same fashion, and after each level, the coins are automatically spent to upgrade the point-value of some of the rockets, making future launches of these rockets more valuable.  5 coins upgrade one rocket, to a maximum of 1000 points, and for every upgrade the rockets take on new appearances, ultimately ending up as "Dragon Rockets".  After all rockets have been fully upgraded (to level 10), every additional coin which is collected is converted into points.

New items are placed onto the existing fuse segments at a faster rate if the player successfully performs large, multi-rocket launches. Larger launches increase the number of coins that drop onto the fuses as well.

===Modes===
In addition to the ''classic'' mode, the game also includes an arcade mode, and a strategy mode.  In the arcade mode, there is no time limit, but new fuse segments continuously fall from the top of the screen, filling up the available play area.  Players can somewhat shift the position of falling pieces, but must otherwise quickly launch rockets to consume existing fuse segments.  If any column of the board completely fills up, the game ends.

In the strategy mode, the player has only a limited number of [[matches]], and the game ends when all of them have been used.  New matches appear on the field whenever the player launches three or more rockets; these must be picked up within three moves by burning the fuse segments on which they appear. Since a single match can launch more than one rocket if the fuses are set up properly, it is to the player's advantage to launch as many as possible at the same time.  This mode encourages slower, more deliberate play, with careful planning required in order to extend play time.

==Availability==
The online version of ''Rocket Mania'' can be played for free at [[MSN Games]] and various other websites, but is limited in levels and extras.  The Windows version, ''Rocket Mania Deluxe'', is available as a trial download, with the full version able to be unlocked for a nominal fee.

[[Palm OS]] and [[Pocket PC]] versions are also available.

==Reception==
GameZone awarded the Windows version of the title a 9.2 (out of 10) and an "Editor's Choice" award, concluding that it is easy to pick up, addictive, and able to keep one entertained for hours.  While the reviewer at GameZone enjoyed the way the difficulty level slowly ramped up, [[GameSpot]] felt that the game was a little too simple and that there wasn't any real challenge until the later levels.  As such, GameSpot scored the title as only 6.7 (out of 10), although some positives aspects which were noted included an easy control scheme and a decent variety of modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/puzzle/rocketmania/review.html?sid=6158794 | title=Rocket Mania! for PC Review | publisher=GameSpot.com | date=2005-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' nominated ''Rocket Mania'' for their 2003 "Puzzle Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Bookworm (video game)|Bookworm]]''. They wrote, "From ''Bejeweled'' to ''Rocket Mania'' to ''Zuma'', PopCap has constantly found new ways to spell 'addiction.' "&lt;ref name=cgwpremier2003&gt;{{cite journal | author=Editors of ''CGW'' | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s 2003 Games of the Year |date=March 2004 | issue=236 | pages=57-60, 62-69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slipgate Studios''' (formerly Interceptor Entertainment) is a Danish [[video game developer]] headquartered in [[Aalborg, Denmark]]. The company's policy encourages its staff to work from home. This has led to the development team becoming international in its composition, employing developers from ten different countries. The distribution of work tasks and discussion of progress is done virtually, through a private company forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Udviklerprofil: Interceptor Entertainment|author=Jesper Krogh Kristiansen|url= |newspaper=gameplay|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2010, the company assembled a development team to begin work on their first title, ''[[Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded]]''. The work done on the fan project that became the officially licensed remake of [[Duke Nukem 3D]] led to Interceptor being contracted to work on titles for multiple platforms including [[personal computer|PC]], [[XBLA]], [[PSN]] and [[iOS]].

In September 2011, after ''Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded'' was halted, [[Apogee Software]] contacted Interceptor Entertainment and the two companies conversed over the following months. In that time, the idea and contract for rebooting ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' was made a reality and production started shortly afterwards. Development of their first major project, [[Rise of the Triad (2013 video game)|a remake of ''Rise of the Triad'']] began in early 2012 and the game was released in July 2013.

In September and October 2013, Interceptor Entertainment moved its headquarters from Herning to Aalborg. The Interceptor virtual team had roughly 35 employees spread across 10 countries and several employees based at their headquarters in Aalborg. On March 3, 2014 it was announced that Interceptor Entertainment's part-owner Mike Nielsen's company SDN Invest had bought [[3D Realms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-03-interceptor-buys-3d-realms-amid-gearbox-lawsuit|title=Interceptor buys 3D Realms amid Gearbox lawsuit|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=3 March 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interceptor began work on a game called ''Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction''. However, due to a lawsuit by [[Gearbox Software]], the game's name was changed to ''[[Bombshell (video game)|Bombshell]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/14/5719040/bombshell-is-3d-realms-and-interceptor-entertainments-action-rpg-for|title= Bombshell is 3D Realms and Interceptor Entertainment's action RPG for PC, PS4|author= Jenna Pitcher|work= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= May 14, 2014|accessdate= September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on January 29, 2016.

On September 6, 2016, Interceptor and 3D Realms announced ''[[Rad Rodgers]]'', an action platformer game running on [[Unreal Engine 4]] and starring the title character and his console-come-to-life friend Dusty (voiced by [[Jon St. John]]). The game was inspired by 1990s-era platformers. The studio started a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign with an aim of $50,000. The studio raised $81,861 in 30 days. The game is scheduled to release in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rad Rodgers - The return of the 90's era Apogee platformer!|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1093001909/rad-rodgers-the-return-of-the-90s-era-apogee-platf/description|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rad Rogers is the modern version of Commander Keen you secretly wanted|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/96645/rad-rogers-is-the-modern-version-of-commander-keen-you-secretly-wanted|website=Shacknews|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2017, an update to Kickstarter backers was uploaded, titled "The Future of Rad Rodgers" explaining that the company was going to be restructured and renamed within the upcoming months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Future of Rad Rodgers" |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1093001909/rad-rodgers-the-return-of-the-90s-era-apogee-platf/posts/1825557|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, they officially announced the new name as Slipgate Studios. On March 31, the company announced that [[THQ Nordic]] acquired the Rad Rodgers IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thqnordic.com/article/thq-nordic-acquires-rad-rodgers-ip|title=THQ Nordic acquires Rad Rodgers IP {{!}} THQ Nordic GmbH|website=www.thqnordic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grudge Match''''' is a 1991 syndicated television game show that invited feuding people to settle their issues in a boxing ring using various implements of revenge.

The show was presided over by [[Steve Albert]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], with Albert calling the action and Ventura as the colour commentator. [[Michael Buffer]] was the ring announcer and comedian [[John Pinette]] refereed the bouts. Then-''Entertainment Tonight'' correspondent Paula McClure served as a reporter.

''The Grudge Match'' later was revived for British television, with [[Nick Weir]] and [[Lisa Rogers]] hosting and boxer [[Barry McGuigan]] as the referee.

==US version==

===Format===
Each Grudge Match featured two people with a grievance to air out. A short video explaining the beef was played before each match. Each participant wore a uniform consisting of a helmet, T-shirt, shorts, and [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] of the same colour. One contestant wore red while the other blue. Prior to the bout, the competitors chose which of the implements they wanted to use during the three round match.

Each Grudge Match had a title attached to it, relating to the grudge being carried. Both fighters were introduced with a nickname by Buffer, and Pinette explained the rules before each bout.

Since the match took place in a boxing ring, it was treated as a boxing match. Each round was three minutes long.  Only the referee could stop the fight, and the standard 8-count rule in boxing applied.  After three rounds, the audience voted for the winner, which was announced by Buffer.

===Examples of challenges===

====Batakas====
The two opponents try to get as many hits on each other's heads as possible with batakas.  In some cases, to level the playing field due to the strength differences in the opponents, one opponent may have his or her shoes tied together and/or only have one bataka, while the other would have his or her shoes tied individually and have two batakas.

====Baker's dozen====
The two opponents have 3 minutes to throw as many stale [[doughnuts]] as possible and try to get the most hits.

====Salad bar====
The two opponents have 3 minutes to pelt each other with food items used in a salad bar.

====Cavemen====
The two contestants are dressed as cavemen and have 3 minutes to pelt one another with clubs.

===Ending===
The two opponents after the match (and sometimes interviews from Ventura) would hug or give a handshake to one another, and the winner got a bonus prize.

==British version==
Circa 2000, [[London Weekend Television]] made a British version of ''Grudge Match'' (which did not have the word ''the'' in its title), hosted by [[Nick Weir]] and [[Lisa Rogers]], and featured former boxing champion [[Barry McGuigan]] as the referee.  Instead of the typical challenges as seen on the US version, the challenges were more made in the style of ''[[Gladiators]]'', the show which ''Grudge Match'' replaced.  The winner got a bonus prize, as in the US version, but the loser had to pay a forfeit.  The prizes and forfeits were based on the storylines of the grudge.  Occasionally Lisa would talk to audience members who were relatives and/or friends of the contenders prior to hearing about it from the contenders' perspectives.  This show also ran just one series on weekends on [[ITV Network|ITV]] prime time.

All matches were best two out of three, and all rounds began and ended with a bell unless otherwise specified.  Sometimes an [[airhorn]] signalled the end.  Male contenders wore red and blue, and female contenders wore green and orange. [[UKGameshows.com]] reacted negatively to the version in their review, comparing it negatively in comparison to ''Gladiators''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Grudge_Match&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of challenges===

====Dueling Giants====
The two contenders are strapped to giant inflatable sumo wrestlers and try to knock each other down.  Barry decides the winner.

====Glass Mountain====
The two contenders climb up a wall made of glass with rock climbing supports for the feet and try to grab a ball and attach it to a velcro wall.  The first to grab 2 balls, attach them, and then ring the bell wins.

====Tarzan Swing====
The two contenders swing across a pool on a rope and grab a ball to place in a smaller wading pool or container.  The first to get 3 balls in the pool wins, and the loser gets dunked in the pool.

====Sumo Blitz====
The contenders, both wearing specially designed sumo suits so that when they fall, people will have to help them back up, race to be the first to score 5 balls in the correct colour bucket.  The contenders are allowed to impede the opponent by pushing or bumping them.

====Twango====
The two players have a rope attached to their back and must pull on another rope to make their way through the soapy sudded floor to grab a block and then toss it inside a basket to score.  When letting go of the rope whether or not they have a block, they get "twangoed" (rapidly pulled) back to the start.  If they drop a block onto the soapy floor, it doesn't count.  The first one to score 4 blocks, or whoever has the most blocks when all are exhausted, wins.

====Mexican Bean====
The two players are placed inside what Barry describes as a "giant, inflatable sausage," which is placed in the pool.  They must run back and forth transporting balls from one end to the other, depositing them in an envelope.  The trouble is that running back and forth in the inflatable sausage may cause contenders to lose their footing and struggle to keep it.  The first to 5 balls wins.

====Tightrope Trouble====
The players must balance themselves using two tightropes above the pool, holding a ball in their mouths while going back to the other side.  The first to transfer 2 balls across to the opposite velcro post wins, and the loser's rope becomes a lot less tight, getting them dunked into the pool (unless they fell into the pool already).

====Murderball====
Barry tosses a medicine ball into the air and the players wrestle for it, but they cannot bite, punch, or kick, or Barry may disqualify them.  Their goal is to place the ball in the scoring pod, and the first to do it twice wins.

====Summit====
The two players begin in the pool and each have to climb a slide of their corresponding colour, using blocks scattered in the pool to get there.  The blocks must stack up neatly to count, although the players can toss the blocks up to the ramp.  The first to press the buzzer wins, and when doing so, activates a tank that dumps water onto the loser's slide and flushes away all the losing contender's blocks.

The contenders need not place blocks all the way to the top if they can reach the buzzer.

====Dodgem Football====
This was only used in a group grudge pitting teams of four against each other.  Two players drive bumper cars around while trying to grab a huge ball that Barry throws into the middle of the arena to start to the game.  The winner is the team with the most points when time is called, or the team that scores three points first.

====Thrash &amp; Splash====
The best two of three wins the game.  Barry throws a large ball into the pool and the players have to throw it through a hula hoop.

====Arena Relay====
This game involves the whole team and the whole arena, where the first to complete all four obstacles of the course is the winner, with each player taking on one obstacle.  The first players do a swing on a rope over the pool from one net to another, and then cross a section of lily pads without falling in the water to the net.  Falling in the water means the player has to go back and start from the second net again.  When either player touches the net, the second section begins.  A teammate cannot start their job, however, until the previous player finishes theirs.

The second section involves two players dressed in sumo gear (borrowed from the game ''Sumo Blitz''), and the object is to pop five balloons first.  The third section starts when one player pops all five.

The third section is crossing on the ''Twango'' rope.  The players need to grab as many tiles as they can, so the fourth player can climb up the ramp and hit the buzzer to win.

As in ''Summit,'' the fourth player uses the tiles to climb up the ramp and hit the buzzer.  When they hit the buzzer, their opponent's tiles are all washed away.  Completing all four obstacles first wins the point.

===Catchphrase===
The show began, ended, and led into every commercial break with either Nick or Lisa yelling, "Don't get mad...", and the audience yelling, "GET EVEN!"  These words are also the chorus lyrics of the show's theme tune, composed by prolific UK TV composer [[Paul Farrer]], whose other game show music compositions include ''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]'' and ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|Weakest Link]]''.

===Ending===
Tradition, like in the US version, states each match must end with a handshake (or sometimes a hug).

'''''The Last of Us Part II''''' is an upcoming &lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE GENRES - as per consensus we only need one genre for the first sentence, more is excess --&gt;[[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Naughty Dog]] and published by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] for [[PlayStation 4]]. It is the sequel to 2013's ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013). It was announced at the [[PlayStation Experience]] event in December 2016. Set five years after ''The Last of Us'', players control an older [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], who comes into conflict with a mysterious cult in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] United States.

==Development==

While the second trailer was mostly well received,&lt;ref name="VG247 Trailer 2" /&gt; it drew some criticism for its violence.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Trailer 2" /&gt; Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe president Jim Ryan defended the trailer, saying the game is "made by adults to be played by adults".&lt;ref name="Telegraph Violence" /&gt; Druckmann explained: "We’re making a game about the cycle of violence and we’re making a statement about violent actions and the impact they have ... [the idea] was for the player to feel repulsed by some of the violence they are committing themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-s-violence-is-designed-to-be-rep-1826781044|title=We Talked To The Last Of Us Part II's Director About The Game's Violence (And More Treacherous Stealth)|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|work=Kotaku|accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zulu Dawn''''' is a 1979 American [[war film]] about the historical [[Battle of Isandlwana]] between [[British Empire|British]] and [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] forces in 1879 in [[South Africa]]. The screenplay was by [[Cy Endfield]], from his book, and [[Anthony Storey]].  The film was directed by [[Douglas Hickox]]. The score was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]].

''Zulu Dawn'' is a [[prequel]] to ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'', released in 1964, which depicts the historical [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]] later the same day, and was co-written and directed by Cy Endfield.

==Plot==
The film is set in British South Africa, in the province of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], in January 1879. The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], notably the supremely arrogant [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] and the scheming [[Henry Bartle Frere|Sir Henry Bartle Frere]], who both wish to crush the neighbouring [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu Empire]], which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's [[Mineral Revolution|emerging industrial economy]]. Bartle Frere issues an impossible [[ultimatum]] to the Zulu king, [[Cetshwayo]], demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a [[pretext]] to invade [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from [[Great Britain]] itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.

The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of [[Ulundi]], the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin [[torture|torturing]] captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of [[Isandlwana|Mount Isandhlwana]], ignoring the advice of [[Boer]] attendants to entrench the camp and [[Laager#Laager|laager]] the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted [[Basuto]]s approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine. Lt. Vereker should join Durnford as [[aide-de-camp]].

Reacting to false intelligence, Chelmsford leads half of the British army, including the best [[infantry]], [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]] units, on a [[wikt:wild-goose chase|wild goose chase]] far from the camp, in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle, Durnford and his troops arrive at 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile, the Zulu captives escape from their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army, informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker, Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too, and scout the iNyoni heights.

The entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts.  Chasing a number of Zulu herdsmen trying to hurry away their cattle, they discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked.

As Zulu [[impis]] descend upon the camp, Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back, the British take heavy casualties, including the battery of [[William Hale (British inventor)|Hale rocket]]s, which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially, the British infantry succeed in defending the camp, and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out, and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move. As British infantrymen begin to run out of [[ammunition]] due to the Quartermaster's incompetent distribution and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp, Zulu warriors charge the British troops ''en masse'', sustaining horrific casualties, but succeed in breaking the British lines.

As British troops break and flee towards the camp, the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, amongst the débris of tents, fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors, British soldiers and their Afrikaner allies are slaughtered in the camp, some being cut down as they attempt to flee towards Natal. During the last minutes of the battle, the camp's commander, Colonel Pulleine, entrusts the [[Colours, standards and guidons|Queen's Colours]] of the 2nd battalion, [[24th Regiment of Foot]] to two junior officers, Lts. Melvill and Coghill, who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal, passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and Afrikaner infantrymen attempting to flee across the river.

While crossing the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]], the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus and the Colours (a [[Union Flag]] embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. Lying wounded, perhaps mortally, Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours, and the Colours fall gracefully into the river, where they are carried out of reach.

In the evening, Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana, to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades, and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a [[silhouette]]d victory procession, dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi.

==Cast==

===British===
* [[Peter O'Toole]]: '''[[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lt. General]] [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]]'''. The arrogant commander of British forces in South Africa, Chelmsford is eager to advance his military career by crushing neighbouring Zululand, believing that ''"for the savage as for the child, chastisement is sometimes a blessing"''. During the invasion, Chelmsford refuses to listen to advice from his British and [[Boer]] advisers, and from the comfort of his tent and personal [[carriage|coach]], authorises his troops to torture Zulu captives. On the day of the battle, Chelmsford commits a cardinal error in splitting his forces. While the troops at Isandlwana fight for their lives, Chelmsford and his equally arrogant officers, a few miles away, enjoy a silver-service [[luncheon]]. Chelmsford is last seen arriving at the site of the battle several hours later, mortified by the defeat of his soldiers, absorbing the news that the victorious Zulu army has invaded Natal. Chelmsford's arrogance was mixed with incompetence as he left unclear instructions to those left behind at Isandlwana including which officer was in charge, Durnford or Pulleine. Chelmsford would later lay the blame for the disaster on Colonel Durnford.
* [[Burt Lancaster]]: '''[[Anthony Durnford|Colonel Durnford]]'''. Commander of a large force of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), Britain's African allies, Durnford is a humane officer who expresses concern for the lives and welfare of his African troops. When war breaks out, Durnford, much to his chagrin, is ordered to remain in Natal and defend the border rather than accompany the invasion force. His troops are ultimately called to reinforce the invasion army, and on the day of battle, Durnford and his African cavalrymen are driven into the camp at Isandlwana. As the British forces break apart, the one-armed Durnford becomes trapped in the camp. Hoping to save his men, Durnford orders his African cavalrymen to retreat. Remaining on foot at the battlefield, Durnford is killed alongside his infantrymen. Durnford would later be painted by Chelmsford as the scape-goat for the disaster.
* [[Denholm Elliott]]: '''[[Henry Pulleine|Colonel Pulleine]]'''. A mild-mannered man, Pulleine is a military [[bureaucrat]] who accompanies the army into Zululand, and finds himself left in command of the camp at Isandlwana after Chelmsford leaves on a [[sortie]]. News of the approaching Zulu army unnerves Pulleine, and his overstretched troops are unable to defend the camp. After having entrusted the Union Flag to Lts. Melvill and Coghill, Pulleine returns to his tent to pen a last letter to his wife. He is discovered by an escaped Zulu prisoner and, unwilling to shoot the young soldier, the elderly Pulleine is killed in his tent.
* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]]: '''Lieutenant [[Teignmouth Melvill|Melvill]]'''. Portrayed as an arrogant and overconfident man, when a lone Zulu warrior calls from the mountain asking why British forces are invading, Melvill replies, "we come here by the order of the great [[Queen Victoria]], Queen of all Africa!" Towards the end of the battle, Melvill carries the Queen's Colours back towards Natal, bypassing British infantrymen being killed as they flee towards the river. Melvill reaches the river border between Zululand and Natal, but is speared by Zulu warriors while defending the flag.
* [[Christopher Cazenove]]: '''Lieutenant [[Nevill Josiah Aylmer Coghill|Coghill]]'''. A polite and humorous young officer, Coghill is temporarily attached to Colonel Pulleine's staff, due to an injured leg which requires him to ride on horseback. Coghill has a close friendship with Lt. Melvill, and during the invasion he expresses dissatisfaction at Chelmsford's strategy. Towards the end of the battle, Coghill accompanies Melvill in his attempt to escort the Queen's Colours back to Natal. When Melvill nearly drowns while trying to cross the Buffalo River, Coghill turns to help him, but they are ambushed by Zulu warriors. Coghill tries to defend the flag with his revolver, but is killed.
* [[Simon Ward]]: '''Lt. William Vereker'''. A young officer who has recently attached to Durnford's command, Vereker is a light-hearted cavalry officer eager to see war. Vereker's enthusiasm, though, evaporates as he sees Zulu warriors tortured and slain by British troops. Vereker and his men discover the main Zulu army on the morning of the battle, and as British lines collapse, Vereker accompanies Lts. Melvill and Coghill in an effort to return the Queen's Colours to Natal. Zulu warriors attack and kill Melvill and Coghill, and seize the Colours. Vereker, despite his injuries, takes aim with his rifle and shoots the Zulu wielding the Colours, ensuring that they fall into the Buffalo River, where they float downstream. Vereker's fate remains unknown.
* [[Bob Hoskins]]: '''Colour Sergeant Williams'''. The loud, aggressive Williams, a high-ranking [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]], is both feared and respected by his troops, but displays genuine concern, taking the young Private Williams under his wing. During the battle, Williams loses many of his infantrymen during hand-to-hand fighting, and is injured while defending a group of unarmed artillerymen. Williams is stabbed in the back while attempting to rescue Private Williams, and having killed several warriors with his [[bayonet]], dies amid a large wave of Zulus.
* [[Peter Vaughan]]: '''Quartermaster Bloomfield'''. An elderly and jovial war veteran who claims, somewhat dubiously, to have been the bugler for the Duke of Wellington. Bloomfield is a military administrator responsible for overseeing the invasion force's supply network. Bloomfield takes a young bugler, Boy Pullen ([[Phil Daniels]]) under his wing, but his compassion does not extend to the NNC's black soldiers, who he sees as little more than savage animals. During the battle, Bloomfield refuses to bypass regulations requiring that ammunition be dispensed in small, properly recorded quantities, causing an ammunition shortage that forces British troops to retreat. Bloomfield is injured when his ammunition wagon explodes, which kills Boy Pullen, and is himself killed when a Zulu warrior impales him from behind.
* [[Michael Jayston]]: '''[[Henry Hope Crealock|Colonel Crealock]]'''. An officer of the [[Royal Artillery]] and [[lickspittle]] to his commander, Colonel Crealock acts as Lord Chelmsford's secretary, constantly expressing his agreement with Chelmsford's decisions. He accompanies Chelmsford's expedition away from Isandhlwana, and is seen idly sketching the landscape. When questioned by Newman on the logic of splitting the British army, Crealock acidly replies that the Zulus' primitive weaponry does not pose any real threat. When Lieutenant Harford relays news from Isandhlwana with an urgent request for reinforcements, Crealock lectures Harford on military etiquette, and does nothing to facilitate the request. Crealock is last seen with Chelmsford after returning to the devastated camp, bringing news of an ongoing battle at [[Rorke's Drift]] and a Zulu invasion of Natal.
* [[Ronald Pickup]]: '''Lieutenant Harford'''. A well-meaning officer of the NNC, Harford distinguishes himself from his colleagues through his concern for his African soldiers, and is appalled by his superior's lack of concern for the lives of native workers, and by Chelmsford's casual attitude to the torture of Zulu captives. On the day of the battle, Harford accompanies Chelmsford's column. During the early stages of the battle, a rider dispatched by Colonel Pulleine to catch up with Chelmsford's army brings an urgent request for reinforcements. His message is ignored, and Harford is denied permission to return to Isandhlwana. He is last seen in the evening, weeping at the bodies of young soldiers.
* [[Ronald Lacey]]: '''Norris "Noggs" Newman'''. A [[war correspondent]] for ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'', Norris-Newman accompanies the army into Zululand to report on the war. Newman is deeply critical of Chelmsford, frequently pointing out his tactical errors, making no effort to conceal his contempt for the general. Newman appears to have more knowledge of the Zulus than the officers, and expresses sympathy for the tribe, who stand little chance against Western warfare. Newman accompanies Chelmsford's expedition and is last seen with Chelmsford, staring at the devastation of the battlefield.
* [[John Mills]]: '''[[Henry Bartle Frere|Sir Henry Bartle Frere]]'''. The British [[High Commissioner]] for South Africa who provokes the war by issuing King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum. Viewing the Zulus as savage barbarians, Bartle Frere believes that the war will provide "a final solution to the Zulu problem." Frere is last seen on the night of the British invasion, and is not seen again after this.

===Zulu===
* [[Simon Sabela]]: '''[[Cetshwayo|King Cetshwayo]]'''. King of Zululand, Cetshwayo is depicted as a peaceful and effective ruler, eager to avoid war but unwilling to compromise Zululand's security by agreeing to Bartle Frere's ultimatum. Cetshwayo is concerned that mobilising his armies will leave a chronic labour shortage, and is eager to defeat the British army in time for his soldiers to return and gather the [[harvest]]. Cetshwayo is last seen in his [[kraal]] at Ulundi, reluctantly announcing a state of war between Zululand and Cape Colony.
*[[Ken Gampu]]: '''Mantshonga'''. A Zulu regarded as a traitor by Cetshwayo because of his support for a rival claimant to the Zulu throne, Mantshonga delivers him the British ultimatum to Cetshwayo and returns his response.
* [[Abe Temba]]: '''Uhama'''. A leading general and strongman in the Zulu army, Uhama masterminds various schemes to confuse British forces, using scouts to gain intelligence on the British army, and small raiding parties to confuse their scouts on the whereabouts of Zulu impis. Uhama realises he must overwhelm the British while they are exposed and vulnerable; and that an open battle would result in a crushing Zulu defeat. He keeps his impis hidden, allowing the invaders to progress deep into Zululand, waiting for them to commit an error that will give the impis the opportunity to overwhelm the British before they have time to commit their technology to the battle. While chasing a Boer scout, Uhama instructs three of his warriors to allow themselves to be captured by the British, who eventually escape and advise Uhama on British weaknesses. In contrast to the British commanders, Uhama displays immense bravery, and is last seen leading his warriors into the débâcle of the British camp, where he is shot and presumably killed.
* [[Gilbert Tiabane]]: '''Bayele'''. The son of King Cetshwayo, he leads several scouting missions to gain intelligence on British forces. Under orders from Uhama, Bayele allows himself to be captured by cavalrymen of the NNC, and with two other warriors, is taken to the camp at Isandhlwana. While lashed to wagon wheels, Bayele and his two comrades are beaten but only reveal false information. Bayele later uses a distraction in the camp to kill the sentry guarding them and release his two comrades, and the three escape and return to Uhama. Bayele takes part in the assault on the camp, and by chance finds himself face-to-face with Colonel Pulleine in the command tent. Pulleine, recognising Bayele as the tortured prisoner, is unwilling to shoot the young soldier, and Bayele seizes the opportunity to kill him.

The Lamitas Property Investment Corporation raised money for the film. They financed a series of films, including several in South Africa, such as ''[[The Wild Geese]]'' (1978). The company committed about £5 million to ''Zulu Dawn'', most of it raised from a Swiss bank, the Banque de Paris et des Pay Bas.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; HBO helped guarantee finance.&lt;ref&gt;BUSY BUYING FOR TELEVISION

[[John Hurt]] was cast in a lead role but was refused entry to South Africa. This confused Hurt who was not particularly political. It was thought South African Intelligence may have confused him with the actor John Hurd, who was a draft dodger.&lt;ref&gt;London Diary

===Shooting===
Filming was difficult. Black extras received less than £3 a day. Norma Foster was a liaison between the South African government (notably the Minister of Information, Dr [[Connie Mulder]]) and the filmmakers; she later claimed the producers owed her £20,000. The co producers, James Faulkner and Barry St Clare, claimed they were owed £100,000 in deferred fees. Over 100 creditors in South Africa claimed they were owed £250,000. The producers sought an injunction to block screening of the film until they were paid. Lamitas denied liability for the money, claiming expenses exceeded the agreed budget. The offered to settle for 25p in the pound.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Beresford, D. (1979, Aug 10). Zulu victory starts a second battle..

There was further controversy when it was discovered the Zulu extras were being paid $2.70 a day but the dog was being paid $4.50 a day.&lt;ref&gt;A High Shine for Olivier's Star

==Reception==
Despite having a large budget and being designed to complement the hugely successful film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'', the film was not well received and did not fare particularly well at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zulu_dawn/ |title=Zulu Dawn |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
