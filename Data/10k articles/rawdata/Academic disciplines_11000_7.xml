      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">The '''ASPRO chronology''' is a nine-period dating system of the ancient [[Near East]] used by the [[Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée]] for [[archaeological]] sites aged between 14,000 and 5,700 BP.&lt;ref name="Hours1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Hours|title=Atlas des sites du proche orient (14000 - 5700 BP)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 July 2011|year=1994|publisher=Maison de l'Orient méditerranéen|isbn=978-2-903264-53-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASPRO : Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient|url=http://www.mom.fr/ressources-numeriques/bases-de-donnees/ASPRO|website=MAISON DE L'ORIENT ET DE LA MÉDITERRANÉE JEAN POUILLOUX|accessdate=25 September 2016|ref=MOM.FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASPRO stands for the "Atlas des sites du Proche-Orient" (Atlas of Near East archaeological sites), a French publication pioneered by [[Francis Hours]] and developed by other scholars such as [[Olivier Aurenche]].

The periods, [[archaeological culture|cultures]], features and date ranges of the original ASPRO chronology are shown below:

In 2001, the institute revised the chronology of the first six periods based on newer carbon data and calibration curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auranche | first=O | title=Proto-neolithic and Neolithic Cultures in the Middle East — the Birth of Agriculture, Livestock Raining, and Ceramics: a Calibrated 14C Chronology 12,500–5500 cal BC | journal=Radiocarbon | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=1191–1202 | year=2001 | url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/PDF/RadioCarbon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Period 3 an early and late phase could be distinguished, but Periods 4 and 5 were merged. Overall they found more overlap in time between different cultural phases between different sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24546">An '''alternative mating strategy''' is a strategy used by male or female animals, often with distinct phenotypes, that differs from the prevailing mating strategy of their sex. Such strategies are diverse and variable both across and within species. [[Animal sexual behaviour]] and [[mate choice]] directly affect social structure and relationships in many different [[mating systems]], whether [[Monogamy|monogamous]], [[Polygamy|polygamous]], [[Polyandry|polyandrous]], or [[Polygyny|polygynous]]. Though males and females in a given population typically employ a predominant reproductive strategy based on the overarching mating system, there is still significant variation in behavior among individuals of the same sex.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gross |first=Mart R. |title=Alternative reproductive strategies and tactics: diversity within sexes|journal=Tree |year=1996 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=92–98 |pmid=21237769 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies and selection ==

Alternative mating strategies have been observed among both male and female animals.&lt;ref name=Pagel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pagel |first=Mark D. |title=Mating Strategies, Alternative |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Evolution |publisher=Oxford University press |date= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most typically, alternative strategies will be adopted in the face of competition within a sex, especially in species that mate multiply. In these scenarios, some individuals will adopt very different mating strategies to achieve reproductive success.&lt;ref name=Dominey&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dominey| first=Wallace J. |title=Alternative mating tactics and evolutionarily stable strategies |journal=American Zoology |year=1984 |volume=24 |pages=385–396 |doi=10.1093/icb/24.2.385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result over time will be a variety of [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] and [[phenotype]]s, consisting of both conventional individuals and unconventional individuals who mate through alternative means. Successful strategies are maintained through [[sexual selection]].

In many cases, the coexistence of alternative and traditional mating strategies will both maximize the average [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the sex in question and be evolutionarily stable for a population.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt; However, the utilization of alternative mating strategies may oscillate as a result of varying reproductive conditions, such as the availability of potential mates. Under changing circumstances, the existence of a variety of strategies allows individuals to choose the conditional behavior that will currently maximize their fitness.&lt;ref name=Gross /&gt;

=== Selection ===

Conventional and alternative mating behaviors arise through sexual selection. More specifically, varying levels of reproductive success will select for phenotypes and strategies that maximize an animal's chance of obtaining a mate. As a result, certain animals successfully use a conventional mating strategy while others employing this strategy fail to obtain mates. Over time, phenotypic variance arises both between and within the sexes , with males exhibiting greater diversity in phenotype.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt; The resulting variance in male fitness creates a niche in which alternative strategies may develop, such as sneaking to obtain a mate. The alternative behaviors persist as part of this [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], or variety of phenotypes, because the average fitness of unconventional males equals the average reproductive success of conventional males.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt;

Alternative behaviors are maintained through [[frequency-dependent selection]] because of their equal fitness benefits and functional equivalence.&lt;ref name=Dominey /&gt; Under frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a given phenotype is determined by its frequency relative to other phenotypes within a population. Similarly, negative frequency-dependent selection describes a scenario in which rarer phenotypes experience greater fitness.&lt;ref name=Shuster&gt;{{cite book |last=Shuster |first=Stephen M. |title=Mating Systems and Strategies |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691049311 |pages=434–450 |author2=Wade, Michael J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the utilization of alternative mating strategies has been shown to fluctuate over time, it has been suggested that frequency or negative frequency-dependent selection is the mechanism through which alternative mating strategies are maintained in animal populations.&lt;ref name=Shuster /&gt;

[[File:Status-Dependent Selection.pdf|thumb|upright=1.3|Fitness payoffs of varying mating strategies in relation to status. At s, A and B have equal fitness, and either phenotype may be expressed. Individuals of higher status above point s do better with phenotype A, while those of lower status do better with B.]]

A second proposed model for the maintenance of alternative mating behaviors is status-dependent selection. This describes a conditional strategy in which the fitness of alternative phenotypes depend on the status, or competitive ability, of an individual. Status includes environmental and genetic factors as well as age and size, and determines the level of fitness that may be obtained from a given phenotype. As shown in Figure 1, the fitness benefits of a given phenotype vary based on whether an individual is of high or low status. In a case where two phenotypes and strategies are possible, such as mate guarding or sneaking, there will be an intermediate point of intersection where the fitness gained from these alternative behaviors will be equivalent. At this point (s), the fitness gained from these strategies will be equal, and the particular strategy employed at a given time will depend on an individual’s status.&lt;ref name=Gross /&gt; A low status individual below the switch point will obtain higher fitness with phenotype B, while an individual of high status above the switch point will benefit from higher fitness with phenotype A. Such a model shows how individuals of lesser status or competitive ability may maximize their fitness by exhibiting an alternative phenotype. In this manner, these selective forces will maintain the phenotypic diversity observed among animals with respect to mating behavior, though strategies utilized will depend on a variety of circumstances.

=== Strategy ===

Most of the organisms in question do not have the cognitive capacity to “strategize” in the human sense of the word, so what is a strategy? Here, a strategy is an underlying rule for making decisions about a certain behavior. A strategy provides an organism with a set of tactics that are adaptive in various circumstances.  A tactic is an action taken to achieve a specific goal.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt; For example, a wolf encounters a fallen tree and its strategy is defined by two tactics that may allow the wolf to pass the obstacle: jump over it or crawl under it. Considering the current environmental conditions, the surroundings, and the size of the tree, the wolf will decide between the tactics dictated by its strategy. In the context of a mating system, this means that individuals in a given population have strategies that allow them to obtain mates in different ways to maximize their reproductive success given their phenotypic, environmental, or social circumstances.

It is important to recognize that organisms within a population may not always have the same strategy, and different strategies may offer individuals either a range of tactical options or just one tactic. Furthermore, given strategy may be considered Mendelian, developmental, conditional, or a combination of the above.  A Mendelian strategy depends on a genetically determined phenotypic difference, such as body size.  This is the case in marine isopods, described below. Developmentally driven strategies are associated with phenotypic differences caused by varying conditions during the course of development that affect body size or overall adult health. Individuals may also have a conditional behavior strategy that depends not on the genetic or developmental impact on one's life circumstance, but on external factors.  These may include the number of available mates, or the number of nearby competitors and their employed tactics. Additionally, some mating strategies will be impacted by the interaction of multiple factors, so these categorizations of Mendelian, developmental, and conditional are not mutually exclusive. They simply offer ways to think about alternative mating strategies and their root causes.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt;

In any case, the mating strategies employed by organisms in various situations will ultimately depend on the strength of selection acting to maintain or eliminate certain reproductive strategies. If sexual selection strongly favors one mating strategy over a potential alternative, individuals not conforming to the successful strategy will fail to reproduce, thus preventing future generations from inheriting the unsuccessful strategy.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt;

=== Evolutionarily stable strategy ===

The diversity of mating strategies within animal populations may be understood through [[evolutionary game theory]]  concepts that assess the costs and benefits of reproductive decision-making. The [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|Evolutionarily Stable Strategy]] (ESS) concept provides a particularly useful framework for considering alternative behaviors as they relate to fitness. Given that a strategy describes a set of pre-programmed rules that specify particular behaviors, an evolutionarily stable strategy is one that persists in a population due to its benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name=Dominey /&gt;  An ESS will be maintained in a population if it accords higher average fitness than other strategies, or a level of average individual fitness equivalent to all other strategies within the population.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt;

Within an evolutionarily stable strategy, several scenarios are possible, including pure and mixed strategies. A pure strategy is one not affected by chance, in which an individual only expresses one strategic behavior.&lt;ref name=Gross /&gt;  In contrast, a mixed strategy describes a scenario involving the probabilistic expression of behaviors among individuals. For example, an individual under a mixed strategy could express one mating tactic, such as sneaking, with a certain frequency and another tactic, such as mate guarding, at all other times.&lt;ref name=Dominey /&gt;  Though a mixed strategy is theoretically possible, it has not been documented in the context of alternative mating behaviors. Instead, a conditional strategy involving alternative behaviors may best characterize alternative mating strategies.&lt;ref name=Gross /&gt;

Condition-dependent behavior in the context of mating may result from changes in resource availability and intrasexual competition for mates. When competition decreases, the expression of alternative behaviors also decreases. Changes in mating behaviors, especially among alternative males, have been documented in insects, fish, and amphibians upon removal of dominant males. Additionally, the availability of mates and resources also affects the expression of alternative strategies within a sex. The gain or loss of territory has been shown to affect mating approaches among insect species, while the receptivity and spatial distribution of mates impacts tactics used among insects, fish, and mammals.  Mating behaviors are also affected by an individual’s size and age, as smaller or younger individuals are more likely to attempt reproduction through alternative means, including mimicry or sneak tactics.&lt;ref name=Dominey /&gt;  As a result, the ability to choose a behavior that maximizes fitness under certain circumstances evolves.&lt;ref name=Gross /&gt;

== Alternative male strategies ==

It has long been known that males in a wide variety of animal populations practice alternative mating strategies in order to maximize their [[reproductive fitness]].  This is especially common when there is male-male competition for access to mates.  In cases where such alternative strategies are as successful at obtaining mates as the predominant strategy, a coexistence of different mating strategies will evolve.  Below are a few common examples of male alternative mating strategies.

{{anchor|Sneaking}}
=== Sneaking behavior in males ===

"Sneaking" is any strategy that allows a male to access a female partner, avoiding more dominant males, for example those guarding a [[harem (zoology)|harem]], as in the [[red deer]] and [[elephant seal]].&lt;ref name=Cherfas&gt;{{cite news |last=Cherfas |first=Jeremy |title=The games animals play |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIXrEXl3MuMC&amp;pg=PA673 |date=15 September 1977 |work=New Scientist |pages=672–673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankenhuis Fraley 2017 pp. 141–150"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frankenhuis | first=Willem E. | last2=Fraley | first2=R.

==== Horned beetles (''Onthophagus acuminatus'') ====

Horned beetles demonstrate alternative mating strategies due to different nutritious conditions during development that affect adult body size. In this species, males who receive high levels of nutrition during development will surpass a size threshold above which they develop large horns. Males who do not pass the threshold will develop either small or nonexistent horns. These varying phenotypes will lead individual males to adopt different mating strategies. Those who develop long horns will practice mate guarding, protecting the entrance to the tunnel in which a female is resting or feeding. These males will fight any male that attempts to enter. This is a common strategy observed in populations in which females are dispersed and have synchronized periods of fertility, as well as those in which females are found in clusters that can be guarded to maintain access to more than one female.

Smaller males with little or no horns have little chance of beating larger males in altercations and will thus adopt an alternative sneaking strategy, digging a new tunnel that will allow them to intercept the female’s tunnel without being noticed by the guarding male. Both of these strategies have proven, thus far, to be reproductively effective for the males practicing them, and adoption of these alternative mating strategies has contributed to the maintenance of a dimorphic male population.&lt;ref name=Pagel /&gt;

==== High-backed pygmy swordtail  ====

Pygmy swordtail ''[[Xiphophorus multilineatus]]'' males offer another example of alternative mating strategies. Some males mature later at a larger size and always use courtship behavior, while other males mature early at a smaller size, sometimes using courtship behavior when alone with a female, but more often using sneaky behavior. This behavior is not preferred by the female, and is therefore not as successful as courtship in gaining matings, however the higher probability of surviving to reach sexual maturity due to maturing early is enough to maintain the smaller, sneakier males in the population.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Molly R. Morris, Oscar Rios-Cardenas, Jason Brewer. Variation in mating preference within a wild population influences the mating success of alternative mating strategies, Animal Behaviour, Volume 79, Issue 3, March 2010, Pages 673-678&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Red paper wasps ====
Male red paper wasps, ''[[Polistes canadensis]]'', engage in the role of the patroller as an alternative mating tactic to the role of the territorial male (who chases away intruders). Patrollers have a smaller body size than territorial males. There is significant competition over the possession of territories. Although these territories do not necessarily hold any resources or nesting sites, owning a territory tends to lead to a greater number of mating opportunities. Males attract females to these territories by rubbing their abdomens across the territories to apply pheromones. Because of their inability to successfully compete against the larger territorial males for territories, smaller males resort to patrolling. But patrollers do not just wait around for territories to be vacated; they will sneak matings with females in territories when the territorial males are temporarily away or distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Polak, Michal. "Competition for Landmark Territories among Male Polistes canadensis (L.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae): Large-size Advantage and Alternative Mate-acquisition Tactics." Behavioral Ecology 4.4 (1993): 325–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female mimicry by males ===

Males practicing female mimicry may do so in order to gain access to mates in areas of where only females congregate.

==== Marine isopod ====
[[File:Paracerceis sculpta illustration.png|thumb|''Paracerceis sculpta'']]
In the isopod ''[[Paracerceis sculpta]]'' there are three genetically distinct male morphs. Alpha males, which represent the largest and most common male morph, tend to defend harems in order to monopolize access to a large number of females.  This is the predominant mating strategy in this species.  Beta males are about the same size as female isopods, and they take advantage of that fact by mimicking female behavior in order to enter harems and gain access to fertile females.  Gamma males are the smallest morph. These individuals adopt a sneaking strategy and rely on their small body size to enter harems undetected and remain in them while they seek mating opportunities. These distinct strategies, all determined by a single genetic locus, give equivalent lifetime mating success to each of the three morphs, indicating that natural selection is not acting on one morph more strongly than another.  All three alleles expressed in the population will continue to contribute to male morphology as long as the reproductive success granted by each one continues to be as beneficial as the others.&lt;ref name=Shuster2&gt;Equal Mating Success among Male Reproductive Strategies in a Marine Isopod. Shuster, Stephen M; Wade, Michael J. Nature; Apr 18, 1991; 350, 6319; ProQuest Research Library pg. 608&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative female strategies ==

Historically, while male alternative strategies have been well documented, alternative female strategies have not been studied extensively. This large discrepancy in information is mostly due to two factors. First, male mating behavior is typically driven by competition for mates, such as physical competition, [[territoriality]], or [[Parental care|parental care investment]]. Thus, male alternative behaviors arise as a direct result of these various forms of competition. However, females typically do not compete directly for these resources or mates. Instead, females indirectly compete through differences in premating, mating and post-mating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neff |first=B. D. |author2=Svensson, E. I. |title=Polyandry and alternative mating tactics|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=2013 |issue=B368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtle nature of female competition makes alternative behaviors very difficult to study relative to males. Second, males are more likely to experience sexual selection than females. Due to this increased selection, it is statistically more likely for alternative strategies to evolve in males than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=S. A. |author2=Warner, R. R. |title=Male and female alternative reproductive behaviors in fishes: a new approach using intersexual dynamics |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |year=1997 |volume=28 |pages=571–592 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.571}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though subtle and slightly less commonly, females can experience limitations in access to males and male parental care. Thus, alternative female strategies have evolved to circumvent these limitations. Below are some examples of alternative female strategies seen in nature.

=== Copying mate choice ===

In the guppy, ''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'', females will copy another female’s mate choice if given the opportunity to watch the other female choose. While older females do not copy younger females, younger females will copy older females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dugatkin|first=L. A. |author2=Godin, J.-G. J. |title=Reversal of female mate choice by copying in the guppy ''Poecilia reticulata''|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B|year=1992|volume=249|pages=179–84|doi=10.1098/rspb.1992.0101|issue=1325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dugatkin|first=L. A. |title=Sexual selection and imitation: females copy the mate choice of others |journal=Am Nat |year=1992|volume=139 |pages=1384–1389 |doi=10.1086/285392|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This copying behavior arises from a difference in ability to assess males. Since this behavior only arises when in the presence of another female, it is a behavioral alternative to the norm of just choosing a male mate based on personal assessment.

=== Sneaking behavior in females ===

In the [[damselfish]], ''Chromis multilineata'', females can often become infected with the parasite ''Anilocra chromis''. In the event of infection, males do not allow infected females into the nest and do not mate with them. Thus, to bypass this limitation to mating, infected females will often sneak into male nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=B. A. |title=The pathological and ecological consequences of parasitism by a cymothoid isopod (''Anilocra chromis'') for its damselfish host (''Chromis multilineata'') |journal=MS thesis. Univ Calif Santa Barbar a|year=1996|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the female is often immediately chased out, this behavior serves as evidence that sneaking is not just an alternative male strategy. In fact, sneaking is just a common strategy for any sex that is denied mating to a certain class of animals. The strategy of these infected females is therefore another behavioral alternative strategy.

=== Male mimicry by females ===

In damselflies, ''[[Ischnura]]'', females are frequently harassed by males that wish to mate. There is significant variation in the females’ physical abilities to tolerate male mating harassment. In this species, there is a [[Sexual dimorphism|physical dimorphism]]: one type is cryptic (heteromorphic) and the other type looks like a male (andromorph). In many cases the andromorph even behaves like a male when among other males. Studies have found that the andromorph only mates half as often as the heteromorph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincke |first=O. M. |title=Polymorphic signals of harassed female odonates and the males that learn them support a novel frequency-dependent model |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=2004 |volume=67 |pages=833–845 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.017 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a decrease in mating would be devastating for males, it is often an advantage in females. For females, excessive mating is a waste of time and energy and it increases exposure to predators. Thus, the ability to ward off extra mating gives the andromorphs a frequency dependent selective advantage. This is example of a traditionally male characterized Mendelian alternative strategy that has now been observed in females.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1985 pp. 805–809"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Robertson | first=Hugh M. | title=Female dimorphism and mating behaviour in a damselfly, Ischnura ramburi: females mimicking males | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=33 | issue=3 | year=1985| doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80013-0 | pages=805–809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Chinese''' encompasses the diverse set of cultural beliefs, social and economic structures, and technological capacities that historically influenced urban design in the early period of Chinese civilization.  Factors that have shaped the development of Chinese urbanism include: ''[[Feng shui|fengshui]]'' [[geomancy]] and [[astronomy]]; the well-field system; the [[cosmology|cosmological]] belief that Heaven is round and the Earth is square, the concept of ''[[qi]]''; political power shared between a ruling house and educated advisers; the holy place ''bo''; a three-tiered economic system under state control; early writing; and the walled capital city as a diagram of political power.

== Early development of China ==

[[Urban planning]] originated during the urbanization of the [[Yellow River]] valley in the [[Neolithic]] Age, which began in China around 10,000 B.C. and concluded with the introduction of metallurgy about 8,000 years later, was characterized by the development of settled communities that relied primarily on farming and domesticated animals rather than hunting and gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cneo/hd_cneo.htm|title=Neolithic Period in China |website=metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process in [[China]], as elsewhere in the world, is related to the process of centralizing power in a political [[Sovereign state|state]]. Although several cultures formed competing states, the direct ancestor of the Chinese state was [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] culture. Therefore, the earliest Chinese urban planning was a synthesis of Longshan traditional [[cosmology]], [[geomancy]], [[astrology]], and [[numerology]]. This synthesis generated a diagram of the cosmos, which placed man, state, nature, and heaven in harmony. The city was planned in the context of this cosmic diagram to maintain harmony and balance.

=== Neolithic Age urbanization ===
[[File:Yangshao china.svg|thumb|300px|Yangshao and Longshan Culture]]
Urbanization begins at [[Banpo]] (4,800-3,750 BC) on the [[Central Plain (China)|Zhongyuan]] plain of the Yellow River. Banpo grew from a typical [[Yangshao]] village in both size and organization until the construction of the Great Hall ca. 4000 BC. Like [[Eridu]] in [[Mesopotamia]], Banpo in [[East Asia]] was the first instance of specialized architecture, something other than a house. Physically, Banpo was composed of 200 round pit houses and the Great Hall across 5 hectares and surrounded by a ditch. These pit houses were sited for [[solar gain]] by aligning the door to the ''Yingshi'' [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] just after the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankenier, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Already, at this early stage the principle of south-facing entry was firmly established.

As in other Neolithic communities, life at Banpo was synchronized to the agricultural year, which was timed by the movement of the [[Big Dipper]], which functioned as a celestial clock. The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' describes this annual cycle. Beginning in spring, adolescents swam through the flood waters at the triangular confluence of two rivers. They emerged shivering, and in this state they were infused with the souls of ancestors buried in the earth who had reemerged at the springs of the Yellow River.&lt;ref name="Schinz, 1996"&gt;Schinz, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In this energized state they procreated in a location deemed to possess magical earth energy. These locations were unsuitable for agriculture, usually a hill, and therefore were uncleared primeval forests. Consecrated procreation was essential to maintaining the cycle of life. When the flood waters receded, the triangle was divided into fields between the families. In autumn there was a large festival at the completion of the harvest. In winter, the men left their homes and retired to the Great Hall, where they were led by the village elders in drinking and singing to repel the cold.

The needs and beliefs of Banpo society created the prototype Chinese urban form. The springtime sacred procreation sites became, in time, the Holy Place called ''bo'' &lt;!-- (Chinese: ?; Pinyin: bo) --&gt;. Moreover, the connection between ancestors, earth, and fertility developed into a theory of ''qi'' energy and ''fengshui'' geomancy. The ''Book of Burial'' elaborates this theory. Man is considered concentrated ''qi'', when his bones are returned to the earth they become re-energized by ''qi''. The living descendants are affected by the ''qi'' generated from the bones of their ancestors, "as a lute string will pick of the vibration of another lute string near it."&lt;ref name="Schinz, 1996"/&gt; In this theory, the world was an active matrix of ''qi'' into which graves, houses, and cities must be carefully inserted by fengshui principals to maintain harmony. The shape of this world was described by a parallel cosmology of a round heaven revolving around a square earth. This ''gaitian'' &lt;!-- (Chinese:??; Pinyin:??) --&gt; cosmology originated from [[Chinese astronomy|neolithic astronomy]]. This cosmic diagram is depicted on jade ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'' and ''[[Cong (jade)|cong]]'' used to talk to sky and earth spirits, respectively. In particular, Yangshao pottery decorated with Big Dipper inscribed on a nine-in-one square (earth) surrounded by a circle (heaven) already depicts a cosmic diagram of earth divided into nine parts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This nine-in-square, in time, became basis of the [[well-field system]], which was the basic geometric and legal module of urban-regional planning. Likewise, the Great Hall became the prototype of later palaces and imperial cities.

[[Longshan Culture]] (3000-2000 BC) arrived from the east one thousand years after Banpo in the same area. This arrival is mythologized by the story of the [[Yellow Emperor]], a man of vigorous energy who dispensed law, standardized measures, invented writing, and conquered. The Longshan tribes formed a superstratum over Yangshao culture. As they fused ideologically and socially, all the elements of a new [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[civilization]] appeared. Culturally, [[History of writing|protowriting]] in the form of the Longshan Script was used on oracle bones. Politically, a Longshan warlord ruled with the help of a Yangshao adviser. Both the use of oracle bones, and the rule of a king with adviser had continuity into the [[Shang Dynasty]]. The first capital was [[Chengziya]] in 2500 BC followed by [[Taosi]] in 2300 BC and finally by [[Erlitou]] in 2000 BC. Longshan Culture developed directly into the Xia and Shang Dynasties.

The hierarchical and militaristic aspects of Longshan culture are evident in their cities. Their shape is a walled square filled with square houses. The transition from round to square homes is always accompanied by centralizing power in history.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The square shaped city, itself a product of centralized power, historically arises a from a military encampment. It is the city as a diagram of political power. The new order made its mark on the Urban-Regional context. Three levels of settlement emerged in the early Longshan state, village called Jū (0-1 ha), city Yi (1-5 ha), and capital called Dū (&lt;5 ha). These three tiers of settlements are the physical realization of [[central place theory]]. The original Yangshao Jū villages formed a matrix of production that channeled goods upward to larger Longshan Yi and ultimately to the Dū. Political power was therefore defined as the amount of the highly productive matrix of agriculture and villages under control. The greater the area, the more wealth passed upwards to the capital. Other cities were economically unnecessary as there were neither long distance trade nor markets.

The final Longshan capital, Erlitou is the physical manifestation of massive social change in China c 2000 BC. Erlitou began in the Neolithic as a Yangshao bo, with later additions of altars and temples. It was a sacred city, even when absorbed by the Longshan tribes, and thus was never walled. Erlitou was the site of transition into the [[Bronze Age]]. The legendary [[Xia Dynasty]] may have been the ruling class of Erlitou.

=== Bronze Age urbanization ===
{{kml|section=Bronze Age urbanization}}
Erlitou is sited at the confluence of the Luo and Yi rivers, a sacred place known as the Waste of Xia. Geographically, the Waste of Xia marked the center of the nine-in-one square earth. During the transitional [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou Culture]], diverse Neolithic traditions were woven into one coherent harmonious philosophical and political system. In this system earth was the mirror of heaven ruled by the [[Jade Emperor]]. Residing in [[Polaris]], he sent the heavenly breath of ''qi'' down to earth through meridians. The ''qi'' concentrated in mountains and rivers, and by informed site planning a building and even a city could fit into this energized matrix. Politically, ''qi'' flowed from heaven through earth into and the through the divine emperor, through his city, and out of the gates into his realm. The emperor kept heaven and earth in harmonious balance through his absolute power. An adviser class interpreted the omens of heaven to inform his actions. 
[[File:The nine zhou.svg|thumb|300px|The nine zhou]]Geographically, the state was believed to be square shaped and centered on the ruler. As described in the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', China is a square of 45,000 ''li'' with five nested squares spaced at 500 ''li'' to create five zones. Beginning at the center, Royal Domain (500 x 500 ''li''), Noble Domain, Domain of Peace-Securing, Domain of Restraint, and Wild Domain. Outside the fifth zone, the barbarian tribes lived.&lt;ref name="Schintz, 1996"&gt;Schintz, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The Xia and early Shang palace was a miniature diagram of this cosmos. It had a traditional Longshan square shape oriented strictly north-south since ''qi'' flows that direction. This square was further subdivided into nine parts based on the now ancient nine-in-one square, which had become a prosperity symbol. A rectilinear walled settlement for servants and craftsmen formed around this palace.

The nine-in-one square was transformed into the [[Lo Shu Square|Holy Field symbol]], sometime during the Shang Dynasty. In a myth the founder of the Xia Dynasty, [[Yu the Great]], received the Holy Field symbol from a magical turtle sent by heaven. Its importance cannot be underestimated as it is the geometric basis of ancient Chinese architecture, urban planning, and geography. By the time of the Xia Dynasty, the nine-in-one square territory of earth was divided into [[Jiuzhou|nine state]]s (九州; Jiǔzhōu).

Although an important stage in urbanization, Erlitou was not a true city. It was a palace complex surrounded by an oversized Neolithic village. During the Bronze Age, expensive bronze artifacts belonged exclusively to the aristocracy, and the peasants still lived at a neolithic level of development. There was a succession of these palatial ''du'' capitals during the Xia and into the [[Shang Dynasty|Early Shang Dynasties]]. Each successive capital had a higher level of development until the Late Shang capital [[Yin (city)|Yin]]. Yin was the first true city and represented the culmination of Longshan Culture. The design of the palace at Yin was copied by the [[Zhou Dynasty]] to create the palace at Zhouyuan, which consolidated all the addition and experimentation of Yin over centuries. Although a copy, Zhouyuan was innovative for its high level of planning. This feature of Zhou urbanism would later be implemented on a national scale. Politically, the Zhou tribe, a vassal of the Shang dynasty, moved through a series of three capitals, Fan, Bo, and Shen, before settling at their ancestral capital, Zhouyuan on the Weishui River.

=== Iron Age urbanization ===
As China moved into the [[Iron Age]] the control of the Zhou over their empire dissolved into multiple states. This period, called the [[Warring States period|Eastern Zhou Dynasty]], was a time of great urbanization in China. Chengzhou became the political capital of the Eastern Zhou in 510 BC (its fortification tripled in width). The cities lost the  rank to size hierarchy imposed by Zhou authority and grew according to their economic and military functions. This period, although politically chaotic, was a great period of urbanization and experimentation with architecture and urban planning.

Along with the growth of cities there was a parallel growth of urban society; independent merchants, artisans, scholars, and the like all emerged as a new social class at this time. In addition to the growth in the Yellow River Valley, the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River Valley]] began to urbanize under the cultural model of the Zhou Dynasty. The cities of states such as [[Wu (state)|Wu]], [[Yue (state)|Yue]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had regional variations. By the time of the Qin Dynasty conquest there was a great diversity of wealthy cities across China, excluding the [[Lingnan]] region.

The city marketplace with tower was a new feature of this era that marked the beginning of an integrated economic function of cities. The architecture of the warring states featured high walls, large gates, and towers. The development of the tower as a symbol of power and social order especially defined this era. The tower usually projected outward at the top to create an image of strength and intimidation. The new marketplace was always overlooked by a tower.

During the Warring States and Han, the beginnings of a classical textual tradition of city planning developed.  Although there is little direct evidence that any classical text exerted an important influence on urban design until the late imperial period, the texts themselves have a much longer history.  While some important literary evidence concerning Zhou urban construction can be found in the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', during the Han dynasty a text emerged that would later become the ''locus classicus'' of the ideal imperial capital.[[File:Holy city of chengzhou.svg|thumb|300px|Plan of Chengzhou (supergrid in red)]]

This text, ''[[Kao Gong Ji|The Artificer’s Record]]'', is a description of craftsmen’s techniques that includes two sections on city construction.  It is a late addition to the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' (''Zhouli'' 周禮) one of three ritual classics canonized during the Han.  The ''Rites of Zhou'' is a blueprint for governmental administration divided into six offices representing Heaven, Earth, and each of the four seasons.  The section for the ''Offices of Winter'', a bureau charged with the oversight of public works, was lost sometime before or during the Qin to Han transition.  During the Western Han, ''The Artificer’s Record'' was added as a replacement.

The first section on urban construction in ''The Artificer’s Record'' describes ancient techniques for siting a city, including methods for precisely orienting the site to the cardinal directions and determining the levelness of the land.  The second section describes the basic the features of the ideal capital city:

“The carpenters construct the capital city, which is a square of nine ''li'' on each side. On each side there are three gates.  Within the city there are nine north-south and nine east-west roads; the north-south roads are as wide as nine carriages side by side.  The ancestral temple of the ruling house is to the left of the palace, the temple to god of the soil is to the right.  The palace faces the court in front and the market is behind it.  The court and the market are both one ''fu'' in area.”&lt;ref&gt;Additional translations may be found in Steinhardt (1999) and Wheatley (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

This section goes on to describe the structure and dimensions of important buildings (as well as their historical precedents), and the heights of the towers surmounting the palace, inner city wall, and outer city wall.

There are several cosmologically significant features of this basic urban outline, including cardinal orientation, square shape, (implied) centrality of the ruler’s palace, grid structure, and the prominence of the number nine. The nine-by-nine grid has led some scholars to suggest that the plan is based on the cosmological belief that the Earth is a square divided into nine sections.  This structure is reproduced by the magic square, a tool for divination.

Although the “Kaogongji” does not explicitly identify this model with any historical city, it has been traditionally associated with Chengzhou, a city built by the Duke of Zhou soon after the Zhou conquest of the Shang.  The “Proclamation at Luo,” a chapter of the ''Book of Documents'', describes how the Duke of Zhou traveled to Luo (near the site of present-day Luoyang) to establish a secondary capital for the new Zhou dynasty, further solidify the Zhou receipt of the Mandate of Heaven, and relocate the former subjects of the defeated Shang.

== Imperial Era ==
The imperial era of urban planning was marked by an attempt to extend imperial authority uniformly across China by creating an economic and political urban hierarchy.&lt;!-- wording here was obscure --&gt; In the Han, this integration was imagined as the resurrection of an idealized memory of the golden age of the Zhou dynasty.  Each province was divided into prefectures and each prefecture into counties. The network of imperial administrative cities was overlaid on an existing network of unwalled villages and townships. One county therefore ruled over several townships and many more villages. At the apex of this administrative hierarchy was a new creation, the imperial capital.

=== Formation ===
Historically, the cities of the [[Seven Warring States]] were combined into one unified regional system under the [[Qin Dynasty]] unification of China. Also under the Qin dynasty Chengzhou lost its status  and was renamed Luoyang in 236 BC. The Qin dynasty destroyed most of the Eastern Zhou urbanization to concentrate its collected wealth at the capital [[Xianyang]]. Colonization of the [[Lingnan]] and [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] regions began at this time, using a modified version of the Zhou classical standard of urban design. The Qin created a national system of military garrisons on a three-tier administrative hierarchy as a practical measure to control the population according to strict legalistic principles.  The Qin soon lost power in a revolt and were replaced by the Han dynasty, who continued many aspects the Qin system of imperial administration, including its system of laws.

At its inception the Han dynasty was immediately faced with the task of rebuilding the urban infrastructure which had been destroyed by Qin dynasty purges and the war of succession after its downfall.  According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]],'' [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]], the Han founder, initially desired to establish the new capital at Luoyang, the former site of Chengzhou, in order to associate the Han with the illustrious early Zhou.  However, it was ultimately decided that the new capital, [[Chang'an]], should be built near the old Qin capital at [[Xianyang]].

=== The County ===
During the Han Dynasty [[History of the administrative divisions of China|official administration]] extended only to the county level. The county (县; xiàn) was the primary unit of government control which harnessed the productive power of the villages in its area of control to concentrate wealth. The county was thus a city-state in function with two parts; a walled settlement 1×1''li'' at the geographical center of territory. The city had no name of its own, it was named by adding the suffix -''cheng'' to the county's name. The territory of the county was divided into districts called townships (乡; xiāng) which were subdivided into villages (村; cūn). Villages generally had a population of 100. Currently the village level is the lowest level of administration in China. These local units, counties, were collected in groups of 8-10 called prefectures, and the prefectures were gathered in groups of 12-16 to form provinces. Economically, the county was a market for productive countryside, which consisted not only of agriculture, but also townships and villages of people to work the land and produce goods by [[cottage industry]]. The county extended military control over a segment of this productive matrix and was the entry point for goods to channel upward to the Imperial City. There were approximately 1500 counties in [[China proper]]. This economic structure was later modified by commercial towns in the Middle Ages.

A county was controlled by a magistrate in a walled complex in the walled county center. He was responsible for tax collection, justice, postal service, police, granaries, salt stores, social welfare, education, and religious ceremony. The magistrate's complex (yamen) was sited at the center of this the city at the point where the main east-west street crossed the main north-south street. The main entrance was in the south and axially aligned along the main north south street connecting to the south gate of the walls. Two arches on the east west street marked the entry forming a small plaza. The south side of the plaza was a dragon wall and the north was the main gate of the compound. This gate lead to a courtyard passing through this courtyard to another gate, called the gate of righteousness, lead to the main courtyard of the complex. The north side of this courtyard was the central hall where the magistrate worked the two side halls contained the six offices. Behind the central hall was another courtyard and hall where the magistrate met with higher-ranking officials. The three courtyard compound formed the center of the complex to the east west of it were other halls, offices, granaries, stables, libraries, official residences, and prisons.

=== Imperial city ===
The imperial capital was meant to exist outside of any one region, even the one it was physically located in. To achieve this it used a text based plan, a cult of heaven, forced migration, and symbolization of the city as the Emperor. The evolution of the imperial capital occurred in three stages, first the super-regional capital on Xianyang,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-11-01|title=How ancient Chinese constellations are applied in the city planning? An example on the planning principles employed in Xianyang, the capital city of Qin Dynasty|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927316305539|journal=Science Bulletin|language=en|volume=61|issue=21|pages=1634–1636|doi=10.1007/s11434-016-1188-6|issn=2095-9273}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the semi-regional and semi-textual capital of Chang'an, and finally fully realized in the fully textual capital of Luoyang. The capital city of the Western Han Dynasty, [[Chang'an]], was built to exceed its predecessor, Xianyang. Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Han Dynasty, would in turn become the model of all future imperial cities.

== Neoclassical Standard ==
It is uncertain to what extent the planners of early and medieval Chinese cities consciously took the "Kaogongji" as a model.  Very little textual evidence preserves the motives and debates surrounding the construction of China's great pre-modern capitals.  However, during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1346-1644) there was a close formal correspondence between the capital at [[Beijing]] and the "Kaogongji" model.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

An '''astrolabe''' ({{lang-gr|ἀστρολάβος}} ''astrolabos''; {{lang-ar|ٱلأَسْطُرلاب}} ''al-Asturlāb''; {{lang-persian|اَختِرِیاب}} ''Akhtaryab'') is an elaborate [[inclinometer]], historically used by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[navigators]] to measure the [[orbital inclination|inclined position]] in the sky of a [[Astronomical object|celestial body]], day or night. The word astrolabe means "the one that catches the heavenly bodies."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Trade: From Ancient Times to the Present|last=Northrup|first=Cynthia Clark|last2=Bentley|first2=Jerry H.|last3=Eckes Jr.|first3=Alfred E.|publisher=Taylor and Francis, 2015|year=2015|isbn=9781317471530|location=|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can thus be used to identify stars or planets, to determine local latitude given local time (and vice versa), to survey, or to [[triangulation|triangulate]]. It was used in [[classical antiquity]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Islamic world, it was used to navigate deserts, then oceans, and to calculate the [[Qibla|direction to Mecca]].&lt;/ref&gt; the European [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Age of Discovery]] for all these purposes.

The astrolabe's importance not only comes from the early development of [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but is also effective for determining latitude on land or calm seas. Although it is less reliable on the heaving deck of a ship in rough seas, the [[mariner's astrolabe]] was developed to solve that problem.

==Etymology==
[[OED]] gives the translation "star-taker" for the English word ''astrolabe'' and traces it through medieval Latin to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''astrolabos'',&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50013806 |title=Astrolabe |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/astrolabe?q=astrolabe |title=Astrolabe |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''astron'' "star" and ''lambanein'' "to take".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astrolabe |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval Islamic world the [[Arabic]] word ''"al-Asturlāb"'' (i.e. astrolabe) was given various etymologies. In Arabic texts, the word is translated as ''"ākhdhu al-Nujuum"'' ({{lang-ar|آخِذُ ٱلنُّجُومْ}}, lit. "star-taker"), a direct translation of the Greek word.{{sfn|King|1981|p=44}}

[[Al-Biruni]] quotes and criticizes medieval scientist Hamzah al-Isfahani who stated:{{sfn|King| 1981|p= 44}} "asturlab is an arabization of this Persian phrase" (''sitara yab'', meaning "taker of the stars").{{sfn|King|1981|p=51}} In medieval Islamic sources, there is also a [[folk etymology]] of the word as "lines of lab", where "Lab" refers to a certain son of Idris (Enoch). This etymology is mentioned by a 10th-century scientist named [[Ali Ibn Ibrahim Qomi|al-Qummi]] but rejected by [[al-Khwarizmi]].{{sfn|King|1981|p=45}}

==History==

===Ancient world===
An early astrolabe was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization]] by [[Apollonius of Perga]] between 220 and 150&amp;nbsp;BC, often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. The astrolabe was a marriage of the [[planisphere]] and [[dioptra]], effectively an analog calculator capable of working out several different kinds of problems in astronomy. [[Theon of Alexandria]] (c. 335 – c. 405) wrote a detailed treatise on the astrolabe, and Lewis{{sfn|Lewis|2001}} argues that [[Ptolemy]] used an astrolabe to make the astronomical observations recorded in the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''. The invention of the plane astrolabe is sometimes wrongly attributed to Theon's daughter [[Hypatia]] ({{circa}} 350–370; died 415 AD),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Deakin (August 3, 1997).&amp;nbsp;"Ockham's Razor: Hypatia of Alexandria".

Astrolabes continued in use in the Greek-speaking world throughout the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.  About 550 AD, Christian philosopher [[John Philoponus]] wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.{{efn|Modern editions of [[John Philoponus]]' treatise on the astrolabe are ''De usu astrolabii eiusque constructione libellus'' (On the Use and Construction of the Astrolabe), ed.

Nau (Paris, 1899)." &lt;br /&gt;Severus' treatise was translated by Jessie Payne Smith Margoliouth in R.T. Gunther, ''Astrolabes of the World'', Oxford, 1932, pp. 82–103.}} Sebokht refers to the astrolabe as being made of brass in the introduction of his treatise, indicating that metal astrolabes were known in the Christian East well before they were developed in the Islamic world or in the Latin West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Severus |last=Sebokht |title=Description of the astrolabe |url=  http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/severus_sebokht_astrolabe_01_trans.htm |publisher=Tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical background was established by Muslim astronomer [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|Albatenius]] in his treatise ''Kitab az-Zij'' (c. 920 AD), which was translated into Latin by [[Plato Tiburtinus]] (''De Motu Stellarum'').

The [[spherical astrolabe]] was a variation of both the astrolabe and the [[armillary sphere]], invented during the [[Middle Ages]] by astronomers and [[Inventions in the Muslim world|inventors]] in the Islamic world.{{efn|{{cite journal|first=Emilie|last=Savage-Smith|year=1993|title=Book Reviews|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=296–299|doi=10.1093/jis/4.2.296|quote=There is no evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the spherical astrolabe, but rather evidence so far available suggests that it may have been an early but distinctly Islamic development with no Greek antecedents.}}}}
The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to [[Al-Nayrizi]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 892–902). In the 12th century, [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] invented the ''linear astrolabe'', sometimes called the "staff of al-Tusi", which was "a simple wooden rod with graduated markings but without sights. It was furnished with a plumb line and a double chord for making angular measurements and bore a perforated pointer".&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Tusi_Sharaf|title=Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geared mechanical astrolabe was invented by Abi Bakr of [[Isfahan]] in 1235.&lt;ref name=Bedini&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Silvio Bedini|first1=Silvio A.|last1=Bedini|authorlink2=Francis Maddison|first2=Francis R.|last2=Maddison|year=1966|title=Mechanical Universe: The Astrarium of Giovanni de' Dondi|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1–69|jstor=1006002|doi=10.2307/1006002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Contractus, the abbot of Reichman Abbey, examined the use of the astrolabe in ''Mensura Astrolai'' during the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889717964|title=Encyclopedia of world trade : from ancient times to the present|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|others=Northrup, Cynthia Clark, 1959–|year=2015|isbn=0765680580|edition=[Enhanced Credo edition]|location=Armonk, NY|pages=72|oclc=889717964}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter of Maricourt]] wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe in the last half of the 13th century entitled ''Nova compositio astrolabii particularis''. Universal astrolabes can be found at the History of Science Museum in Oxford.

English author [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343–1400) compiled ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' for his son, mainly based on [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Messahalla]]. The same source was translated by French astronomer and astrologer Pélerin de Prusse and others. The first printed book on the astrolabe was ''Composition and Use of Astrolabe'' by [[Christian of Prachatice]], also using Messahalla, but relatively original.

In 1370, the first Indian treatise on the astrolabe was written by the [[Jainism|Jain]] astronomer [[Mahendra Suri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first=Thomas|editor1-last=Glick|editor2-first=Steven J.|editor2-last=Livesey|editor3-first=Faith|editor3-last=Wallis | title = Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia | date = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-96930-1 | page = 464 | display-editors = 1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;pg=PA464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified astrolabe, known as a ''balesilha'', was used by sailors to get an accurate reading of latitude while out to sea. The use of the ''balesilha'' was promoted by [[Prince Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]] (1394–1460) while out navigating for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889717964|title=Encyclopedia of world trade : from ancient times to the present|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|others=Northrup, Cynthia Clark, 1959–|year=2015|isbn=0765680580|edition=[Enhanced Credo edition]|location=Armonk, NY|pages=460|oclc=889717964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 140.  Basic Books.  {{ISBN|978-0-465-00950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal astrolabes avoided the warping that large wooden ones were prone to, allowing the construction of larger and therefore more accurate instruments. Metal astrolabes were heavier than wooden instruments of the same size, making it difficult to use them in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward the Setting Sun: Columbus, Cabot, Vespucci, and the Race for America|first=David|last=Boyle|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|date=2011|isbn=9780802779786|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x92SNeDpKqsC&amp;pg=PA253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The astrolabe was almost certainly first brought north of the Pyrenees by Gerbert of Aurillac (future [[Pope Sylvester II]]), where it was integrated into the [[quadrivium]] at the school in Reims, France sometime before the turn of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Marie Brown (2010), "The Abacus and the Cross".  Page 143. basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, French instrument maker Jean Fusoris (c. 1365–1436) also started remaking and selling astrolabes in his shop in [[Paris]], along with portable sundials and other popular scientific devices of the day.  Thirteen of his astrolabes survive to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58493.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One more special example of craftsmanship in early 15th-century Europe is the astrolabe designed by Antonius de Pacento and made by Dominicus de Lanzano, dated 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern (2010), ''Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit''. Band 1: Vom Astrolab zum mathematischen Besteck. Cologne, S. 204. {{ISBN|978-3-86560-865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Johannes Stöffler]] published ''Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii'', a manual of the construction and use of the astrolabe. Four identical 16th-century astrolabes made by [[Georg Hartmann]] provide some of the earliest evidence for [[batch production]] by [[division of labor]].

===Astrolabes and clocks===

Mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, [[Richard of Wallingford]]'s clock (c. 1330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.{{sfn|North| 2005}}

Many astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous [[Prague Orloj|clock at Prague]], adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker Dr. Ludwig Oechslin designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with [[Ulysse Nardin]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024043/http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |archive-date=2 January 2011 |title=Astrolabium G.

An astrolabe consists of a disk, called the ''mater'' (mother), which is deep enough to hold one or more flat plates called ''tympans'', or ''[[Clime|climates]]''. A [[tympan]] is made for a specific [[latitude]] and is engraved with a [[stereographic projection]] of [[circle]]s denoting [[azimuth]] and [[altitude]] and representing the portion of the [[celestial sphere]] above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into [[hour|hours of time]], [[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the mater and tympan, the ''rete'', a framework bearing a projection of the [[ecliptic]] plane and several [[Pointer (rod)|pointers]] indicating the positions of the brightest [[star]]s, is free to rotate.  These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/astrolabe.htm|title=Star Names on Astrolabes|publisher=Ian Ridpath|accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astrolabes have a narrow ''[[ruler|rule]]'' or ''label'' which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of [[declination]]s.

The rete, representing the [[sky]], functions as a [[star chart]]. When it is rotated, the stars and the [[ecliptic]] move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is therefore a predecessor of the modern [[planisphere]].

On the back of the mater there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and a graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge.  The ''[[alhidade|alidade]]'' is attached to the back face.  An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above.  When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read ("taken") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: "astron" (ἄστρον) = star + "lab-" (λαβ-) = to take.

A '''catena''' (from Latin ''catena'', a chain) is a form of biblical commentary, verse by verse, made up entirely of excerpts from earlier [[Biblical commentator]]s, each introduced with the name of the author, and with such minor adjustments of words to allow the whole to form a continuous commentary.

The texts are mainly compiled from mainstream authors, but they often contain fragments of certain [[patristic]] writings now otherwise lost.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). [[Cf.]] Holl, Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter, Leipzig, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been asserted by [[Faulhaber]] that half of all the commentaries on scripture composed by the church Fathers are now extant only in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). See Catholic Encyclopedia article's bibliography listed in the reference section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest Greek catena is ascribed to [[Procopius of Gaza]], in the first part of the sixth century.  Between the seventh and the tenth centuries [[Andreas Presbyter]] and [[Johannes Drungarius]] are the compilers of catenas to various Books of Scripture.  Towards the end of the eleventh century [[Nicetas of Heraclea]] produces a great number of catenae. Both before and after, however, the makers of catenae were numerous in the Greek Orient, mostly anonymous, and offering no other indication of their personality than the manuscripts of their excerpts. Similar compilations were also made in the Syriac and Coptic Churches.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Wright, de Lagarde, Martin, in Krumbacher, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, [[Primasius of Adrumentum]] in the former Roman province of Africa in the sixth century compiled the first catena from Latin commentators. He was imitated by [[Rhabanus Maurus]] (d. 865), [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Walafrid Strabo]], later by [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (d. 900), and by [[Lanfranc of Canterbury]] (d. 1089). The Western catenae have had less importance attached to them. The most famous of the medieval Latin compilations of this kind is that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], generally known as the ''Catena aurea'' (Golden chain) and containing excerpts from some eighty Greek and Latin commentators on the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Ed. J. Nicolai, Paris, 1869, 3 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas composed the parts of his ''Catena aurea'' treating the gospels of Mark, Luke, and John while directing the Roman ''studium'' of the [[Dominican Order]] at the convent of [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].&lt;ref&gt;Torrell, 161 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar collections of Greek patristic utterances were constructed for dogmatic purposes. They were used at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth General Council]] in 553, also apropos of [[Iconoclasm]] in the [[Seventh General Council]] in 787; and among the Greeks such compilations, like the exegetical catenae, did not cease until late in the Middle Ages. The oldest of these dogmatic compilations, attributed to the latter part of the seventh century, is the "Antiquorum Patrum doctrina de Verbi incarnatione".&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by [[Cardinal Mai]] in Scriptor. Vet. nova collectio, Rome, 1833, VII, i, 1-73; cf. [[Loofs]], Leontius von Byzanz, Leipzig, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, in response to homiletic and practical needs, there appeared, previous to the tenth century, a number of collections of moral sentences and paraenetic fragments, partly from Scripture and partly from the more famous ecclesiastical writers; sometimes one writer (e.g. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil the Great]], especially [[John Chrysostom]] whom all the catenae-makers pillage freely) furnishes the material. Such collections are not so numerous as the Scriptural or even the dogmatic catenae. They seem all to depend on an ancient Christian "Florilegium" of the sixth century, that treated, in three books, of God, Man, the Virtues and Vices, and was known as τα ιερά (Sacred Things). Before long its material was recast in strict alphabetical order; took the name of τα ιερά parállela, "Sacra Parallela" (because in the third book a virtue and a vice had been regularly opposed to one another); and was attributed widely to [[John Damascene]],&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Migne, ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XCV, 1040-1586; XCVI, 9-544.&lt;/ref&gt; whose authority was defended (against Loofs, [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]], and Cohn) by [[K. Holl]] in the above-mentioned "Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter" (Leipzig, 1899), though the Damascene probably based his work on the "Capita theologica" of [[Maximus Confessor]]. The text of these ancient compilations is often in a dubious state, and the authors of most of them are unknown; one of the principal difficulties in their use is the uncertainty concerning the correctness of the names to which the excerpts are attributed. The carelessness of copyists, the use of "[[sigla]]", contractions for proper names, and the frequency of transcription, led naturally to much confusion.

==Printed editions==

From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, various catenas were published.  However no modern editions exist, and there are severe textual problems in editing them.

Among the editors of Greek catenae was the Jesuit [[Balthasar Cordier]], who published (1628–47) collections of Greek patristic commentaries on St. John and St. Luke and, in conjunction with his confrère [[Possin]], on St. Matthew; the latter scholar edited also (1673) similar collections of patristic excerpts on St. Mark and Job. The voluminous catenae known as ''Biblia Magna'' (Paris, 1643) and ''Biblia Maxima'' (Paris, 1660), edited by [[J. de la Haye]], were followed by the nine volumes of ''[[Critici Sacri|Critici Sacri, sive clarissimorum virorum annotationes atque tractatus in biblia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by Pearson, London, 1660; Amsterdam, 1695-1701&lt;/ref&gt; containing selections, not only from Catholic but also from Protestant commentators. 

An important collection of the Greek catenae on the New Testament is that of [[J. A. Cramer]] (Oxford, 1838–44), online at archive.org. See also the twenty-eight volumes of the [[Migne]] commentary in his "Scripturae sacrae cursus completus" (Paris, 1840–45).

For the Byzantine collections of ethical sentences and proverbs of ([[Stobaeus]] Maximus Confessor, [[Antonius Melissa]], [[Johannes Georgides]], [[Macarius]], [[Michael Apostolios]]) partly from Christian and partly from pagan sources, see [[Krumbacher]], pp.&amp;nbsp;600–4, also {{cite|last=[[Anton Elter|Elter]]|first=E.|title=De Gnomologiorum Graecorum historii atque origine|place=Bonn|year=1893}}.

'''Charles S. Liebman''' ([[Hebrew]]: ישעיהו ליבמן) (New York City October 20, 1934 &amp;ndash; September 3, 2003) was a [[political scientist]] and prolific author on [[Judaism|Jewish life]] and [[Israel]]. A professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]], he previously served on university faculties in the United States.

==Biography==
In 1965, Liebman published a pioneering essay, “[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=1924 Orthodoxy in American Jewish Life],” in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]''. His 14 books include ''Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, Religion, and Family in American Jewish Life''. According to Cohen (2003), Liebman "argued that [[American Jews]] struggle to integrate into the larger society while trying to maintain a distinctive [[Identity (social science)|group identity]]." According to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi [[Reuven Bulka]], "Liebman's exhaustive study was an eye-opener for many who had dismissed Orthodoxy as a negligible force on the American Jewish scene and also was a partial harbinger of much more literature on Orthodoxy which has proliferated ever since."

In a provocative paper, "[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3085 Extremism as a Religious Norm]," Liebman (1983) analyzes [[Fundamentalism|religious]] [[extremism]] in Israel and argues that "religious extremism is the norm and that it is not religious extremism but religious moderation that requires explanation." A critical respondent appreciated the description of Israel but rejected Liebman's generalization as [[begging the question]] of whether "extremism should be regarded as "normal religion or even religion at all" (Cumpsty 1985:217).

In a 1990 study of American and Israeli Judaism (“Two Worlds of Judaism”), Liebman articulated a concept of "Jewish [[personalism]]" which, writes his co-author, is "the tendency of American Jews to pick those parts of Judaism they find personally meaningful, rather than complying with external requirements of religious law, [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideology or ethnic obligation" (Cohen 2003).

He was born in [[New York City]] and attended secondary school at the [[Herzliya Hebrew High School|Gymnasia Herzliya]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. He earned degrees from the [[University of Miami]] (B.A.) and [[University of Illinois]] (M.A., Ph.D.). He moved to Israel in 1969. With his wife Carol, he had three children. He was an observant Jew, concerned about [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]], served in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] on an education unit, and was politically a dove regarding Israel. (Cohen 2003)

Personally, Liebman is said to have had a "fierce devotion to [[honesty]], even at the risk of unpopularity" (Cohen 2003). For example, in a book review, he writes: "If a [reviewer] can't be kind he must be fair. I find it impossible to be kind to an author who writes.... a statement comparable to saying that an American state is located somewhere between New York and California. ... Since I cannot be kind I will try very hard to be fair. The book does have redeeming features" (Liebman 1984:137f.).

In November 2007, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] published a memorial volume, ''Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, Religion, and Family in American Jewish Life'' (Stuart Cohen and Bernard Susser, editors). According to an obituary in ''[[The Forward]]'', "Liebman was widely regarded as the pre-eminent social scientist of Jews and Judaism in the latter third of the 20th century" (Cohen 2003).

==Awards==
* In 2000, Liebman was awarded the [[Marshall Sklare Award]].
* In 2003, Liebman was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for government studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Recipient’s C.V. | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsag/YeshayahuLibman/KorotHaimYeshayahuLibman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Judges' Rationale for Grant to Recipient | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsag/YeshayahuLibman/NimokyHsoftim.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2009}}
In [[programming languages]], [[scientific calculator]]s and similar '''common operator notation''' or '''operator grammar''' is a way to define and analyse mathematical and other formal expressions. In this model a linear sequence of tokens are divided into two classes: [[operator (programming)|operator]]s and operands.

Operands are objects upon which the operators operate. These include literal [[number]]s and other constants as well as identifiers (names) which may represent anything from simple scalar variables to complex aggregated structures and objects, depending on the complexity and capability of the language at hand as well as usage context. One special type of operand is the parenthesis group.  An expression enclosed in parentheses is typically recursively evaluated to be treated as a single operand on the next evaluation level.

Each operator is given a position, precedence, and an associativity. The '''operator precedence''' is a number (from high to low or vice versa) that defines which operator that takes an operand surrounded by two operators of different precedence (or priority). Multiplication normally has higher precedence than addition,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Mathematik |title-link=Bronstein and Semendjajew |author-first1=Ilja Nikolaevič&lt;!-- Nikolajewitsch --&gt; |author-last1=Bronstein&lt;!-- 1903–1976 --&gt; |author-first2=Konstantin Adolfovič&lt;!-- Adolfowitsch --&gt; |author-last2=Semendjajew&lt;!-- 1908–1988 --&gt; |editor-first1=Günter |editor-last1=Grosche |editor-first2=Viktor |editor-last2=Ziegler&lt;!-- 1922–1980--&gt; |editor-first3=Dorothea |editor-last3=Ziegler |others=Weiß, Jürgen&lt;!-- lector --&gt; |translator-first=Viktor |translator-last=Ziegler |volume=1 |date=1987 |edition=23 |orig-year=1945 |publisher=[[Verlag Harri Deutsch]] (and [[B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft]], Leipzig) |location=Thun and Frankfurt am Main |language=German |chapter=2.4.1.1. |pages=115–120 |isbn=3-87144-492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, so 3+4×5 = 3+(4×5) ≠ (3+4)×5.

In terms of operator position, an operator may be prefix, postfix, or infix.  A [[prefix operator]] immediately precedes its operand, as in −x.  A [[postfix operator]] immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance.  An [[infix operator]] is positioned in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, most notably the C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of ''[[ternary operator|ternary]]'' infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.

== Operator associativity ==
{{Main|Operator associativity}}
Operator associativity determines what happens when an operand is surrounded by operators of the same precedence, as in 1-2-3: An operator can be [[left-associative]], [[right-associative]], or [[non-associative]]. Left-associative operators are applied to operands in left-to-right order while right-associative operators are the other way round. The basic arithmetic operators are normally all left-associative,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987" /&gt; which means that 1-2-3 = (1-2)-3 ≠ 1-(2-3), for instance. This does not hold true for higher operators. For example, [[exponentiation]] is normally right-associative in mathematics,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987" /&gt; but is implemented as left-associative in some computer applications like Excel. In programming languages where assignment is implemented as an operator, that operator is often right-associative. If so, a statement like {{mono|1=a := b := c}} would be equivalent to {{mono|1=a := (b := c)}}, which means that the value of c is copied to b which is then copied to a.  An operator which is non-associative cannot compete for operands with operators of equal precedence.  In [[Prolog]] for example, the infix operator {{mono|1=:-}} is non-associative, so constructs such as {{mono|1=a :- b :- c}} are syntax errors. 
Unary prefix operators such as − (negation) or sin (trigonometric function) are typically associative prefix operators. When more than one associative prefix or postfix operator of equal precedence precedes or succeeds an operand, the operators closest to the operand goes first. So −sin x = −(sin x), and sin -x = sin(-x).

Mathematically oriented languages (such as on [[scientific calculator]]s) sometimes allow implicit multiplication with higher priority than prefix operators (such as sin), so that sin 2x+1 = (sin(2x))+1, for instance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=While this may be correct for some languages, it is not correct mathematically. This needs to be discussed in much better details. See also [[Order of operations]].}}

However, prefix (and postfix) operators do not ''necessarily'' have higher precedence than all infix operators. Some (hypothetical) programming language may well have an operator called sin with a precedence lower than × but higher than + for instance. In such a language, sin 2·x+1 = sin(2·x)+1 would be true, instead of (sin 2)·x+1, as would normally be the case.

The rules for expression evaluation are usually three-fold:
# Treat any sub-expression in parentheses as a single recursively-evaluated operand (there may be different kinds of parentheses though, with different semantics).
# Bind operands to operators of higher precedence before those of lower precedence.
# For equal precedence, bind operands to operators according to the associativity of the operators.

Some more examples:

: {{mono|1= 1-2+3/4*5+6+7 = (((1-2)+((3/4)*5))+6)+7}}

: {{mono|1= 4 + -x + 3 = (4 + (-x)) + 3}}

==Generalizations of Common Operator Notation==
The use of operator precedence classes and associativities is just one way.  However, it is not the most general way: this model cannot give an operator more precedence when competing with '−' than it can when competing with '+', while still giving '+' and '−' equivalent precedences and associativities. &lt;!-- speculation... Can it be demonstrated that this is the only sensible way?  I do not know, but any such demonstration would be welcome. --&gt; A generalized version of this model (in which each operator can be given independent left and right precedences) can be found at [http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/01-07-068].

The '''Dioxin Reassessment Report''' refers to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s scientific reassessment of the health effects of exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]]. It began in April 1991, and in 1994 was published for public review. In 1995 the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed it, concluding that three chapters (eight, nine and a new chapter) be subject to independent peer review. This involved a 2003 review of the reassessment by the Interagency Working Group on Dioxin (Dioxin IWG), who recommended a further review by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS). This review by the NAS began in November 2004, and was expected to end by June 2006. As of 2012, the review is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/CFM/nceaQFind.cfm?keyword=Dioxin EPA Environmental Assessment: Dioxin] Retrieved 2012-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social science]], '''disenchantment''' ({{lang-de|Entzauberung}}) is the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and devaluation of [[religion]] apparent in modern society. The term was borrowed from [[Friedrich Schiller]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jenkins, [http://maxweberstudies.org/kcfinder/upload/files/MWSJournal/1.1pdfs/1.1%2011-32.pdf Disenchantment, Enchantment and Re-Enchantment] (2000) 1 ''Max Weber Studies'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Weber]] to describe the character of [[modernized]], [[bureaucratic]], [[secularized]] [[Western World|Western society]], where scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and where processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to [[traditional society]], where for Weber, "the world remains a great enchanted garden".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment ambivalence==

Weber's ambivalent appraisal of the process of disenchantment as both positive ''and'' negative&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Cascardi, ''The Subject of Modernity'' (1992) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the [[Frankfurt school]] in their examination of the self-destructive elements in [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Borradori, ''Philosophy in an Age of Terror'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for [[modernity]] in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still "haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Murray E. G. Smith, ''Early Modern Social Theory'' (1998) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for [[Existentialism|existentialist]] commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.&lt;ref&gt;L. Embree ed., ''Schutzian Social Science'' (1999) p. 110-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacralization==

Disenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The first process endows a profane offering with sacred properties—consecration—which provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Disenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level described above. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Thereby disenchantment can be related to Durkheim's concept of [[anomie]]: an un-mooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bell&lt;/ref&gt;{{RefImprove|section|date=December 2016}}

==Reenchantment==

In recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of "reenchantment" operating alongside that of disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Landy]] and Michael Saler, eds., ''The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age'', Stanford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low paid service work is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2015). Enchanting Work: New Spirits of Service Work in an Organic Supermarket. Organization Studies, 36(11), 1555–1576. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615593588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jung]] considered [[Symbol#Psychoanalysis and archetypes|symbols]] to provide a means for the [[numinous]] to return from the unconscious to the desacralized world&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; - a means for the recovery of [[myth]], and the sense of wholeness it once provided, by a disenchanted modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Jung?'' (2007) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Gellner]] argued that though disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various "re-enchantment creeds" (as he called them) such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[Marxism]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinianism]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hall]], ''Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography'', Verso, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Ruickbie]] showed on the basis of research in the [[Neopagan]] community that modern magical practitioners demonstrated re-enchantment. Using both qualitative participant research and quantitative survey analysis he was able to demonstrate a range of re-enchanted characteristics conforming to those extrapolated from Weber's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'The Re-Enchanters: Theorising Re-Enchantment and Testing for its Presence in Modern Witchcraft', unpublished PhD thesis, King's College, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'Weber and the Witches: Sociological Theory and Modern Witchcraft', Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2006, 116-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disenchantment as Myth===

American [[historian of religion]] Jason Josesphson-Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of the ideas of both disenchantment and reenchantment, labeling disenchantment as a "myth." Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm has further argued that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the [[Frankfurt School]], were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements but consciously engaged with them.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 215, 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational theorists of disenchantment such as Weber and [[James George Frazer]] did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking and did not describe a process of "reenchantment" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 277-8, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earthworks''' are [[engineering]] works created through the processing of parts of the earth's surface involving quantities of [[soil]] or unformed [[rock (geology)|rock]].

==Types of excavation==
[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14569641579).jpg|thumb|300px|Earth moving equipment (circa 1922)]]
[[File:Construction site near Yass site cleared and bull dozed cleared steam roller in background.JPG|thumb|Flattened and leveled construction site. [[Road roller]] in the background.]]
'''Excavation''' may be classified by type of material:&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Frederick S. Merritt, M. Kent Loftin, Jonathan T. Ricketts, ''Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, Fourth Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13.1}}
* [[Topsoil]] excavation
* Earth excavation
* Rock excavation
* Muck excavation – this usually contains excess water and unsuitable soil
* Unclassified excavation – this is any combination of material types
Excavation may be classified by the purpose:&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;{{rp|13.1, 13.2}}
* [[wikt:strip#Verb|Stripping]]
* [[road construction|Roadway]] excavation
* [[Drainage]] or structure excavation
* [[bridge building|Bridge]] excavation
* Channel excavation
* Footing excavation
* Borrow excavation
* [[Dredge]] excavation
* Underground excavation

==Civil engineering use==
Typical earthworks include [[road#Construction|roads]], [[railway]] beds, [[causeways]], [[dam#Earth dams|dams]], [[levee]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[berm]]s. Other common earthworks are [[land grading]] to reconfigure the topography of a site, or to stabilize slopes.

[[File:Geofoam bridge overpass.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Geofoam]] is a new lightweight earthworks technique used to build a bridge overpass on weak soil near [[Montreal]]]]

==Military use==
[[File:Ipf Wall.jpg|thumb|Earthworks ditch and rampart in Germany - age prehistorical prior to 300 BC]]
In [[military engineer]]ing, earthworks are, more specifically, types of [[fortification]]s constructed from soil. Although soil is not very strong, it is cheap enough that huge quantities can be used, generating formidable structures. Examples of older earthwork fortifications include  [[moat]]s, [[sod]] [[defensive wall|walls]], [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and [[hill fort]]s. Modern examples include [[trench warfare|trenches]] and [[berm]]s.

==Equipment==
[[Heavy equipment (construction)|Heavy construction equipment]] is usually used due to the amounts of material to be moved — up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionized by the development of the ([[Fresno Scraper|Fresno]]) [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other [[engineering vehicle|earth-moving machines]] such as the [[loader (equipment)|loader]], the [[dump truck]], the [[grader]], the [[bulldozer]], the [[backhoe]], and the [[dragline excavator]].

==Mass haul planning==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Excavation of over 76 million cubic metres (23 million cubic metres of which was additional to the planned amount due to landslides) for the Culebra Cut, Panama canal construction photo taken circa 1907]]
Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of [[geotechnical engineering]] (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in the [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] match those of the [[Fill dirt|fills]], while minimizing the distance of movement. In the past, these calculations were done by hand using a [[slide rule]] and with methods such as [[Simpson's rule]]. Earthworks cost is a function of hauled amount x hauled distance. The goal of mass haul planning is to determine these amounts and the goal of mass haul optimization is to minimize either or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthworks cost optimization through mass haul planning|url=http://topconplanning.com/kb/article/125/earthworks-cost-optimization-through-mass-haul-planning|publisher=www.topconplanning.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now they can be performed with a [[computer]] and specialized [[Civil engineering software|software]], including optimisation on haul cost and not haul distance (as haul cost is not proportional to haul distance).

'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander. (2004). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Flor/publication/276930253_Environmental_Communication_Principles_Approaches_and_Strategies_of_Communication_Applied_to_Environmental_Management/links/555c380908ae6aea081734c5/Environmental-Communication-Principles-Approaches-and-Strategies-of-Communication-Applied-to-Environmental-Management.pdf Environmental Communication]''. Diliman, Quezon City: University of the Philippines-Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic field ==
As an academic field, environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving [[communication studies|communication]], [[environmental studies]], [[environmental science]], [[risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and management, [[sociology]], and [[political ecology]].

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]
# [[Risk communication]]
# Representations of Nature in [[popular culture]] and [[green marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. Robert. (2010). ''Environmental Communication And The Public Sphere''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, pp.??{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conventional [[finite state machine]], the transition is associated with a set of input [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an '''extended finite state machine (EFSM) model''', the transition can be expressed by an “[[if statement]]” consisting of a set of [[trigger condition]]s. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified [[data operation]]s.

==Definition==
An EFSM is defined&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; as a 7-tuple &lt;math&gt;M=(I,O,S,D,F,U,T)&lt;/math&gt;  where
* S is a set of symbolic states,
* I is a set of input symbols,
* O is a set of output symbols,
* D is an n-dimensional [[Vector space|linear space]] &lt;math&gt;D_1 \times \ldots \times D_n&lt;/math&gt;,
* F is a set of ''enabling functions'' &lt;math&gt;f_i : D \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
* U is a set of ''update functions'' &lt;math&gt;u_i : D \rightarrow D&lt;/math&gt;,
* T is a transition relation, &lt;math&gt;T : S \times F \times I \rightarrow S \times U \times O&lt;/math&gt;

==Structure==

EFSM Architecture: An EFSM model consists of the following three major combinational blocks (and a few registers).

* FSM-block: A conventional finite state machine realizing the state transition graphs of the EFSM model.
* A-block: an arithmetic block for performing the data operation associated with each transition. The operation of this block is regulated by the output signals of the FSM block.
* E-block: A block for evaluating the trigger conditions associated with each transition. The input signals to this block are the data variables, while the output is a set of [[binary numeral system|binary]] signals taken for input by the FSM-block. Information about redundant computation is extracted by analyzing the interactions among the three basic blocks. Using this information, certain input operands of the [[arithmetic]] block and [[evaluation]] block can be frozen through input gating under specific run time conditions to reduce the unnecessary switching in the design. At the architecture level, if each trigger evaluation &amp; data operation is regarded as an atomic action, then the EFSM implies an almost lowest-power implementation.

The cycle behavior of an EFSM can be divided into three steps: 
# In E-block, evaluate all trigger conditions.
# In FSM-block, compute the next state &amp; the signals controlling A-block.
# In A-block, perform the necessary data operations and data movements.

The '''Festival of Muslim Cultures''', a national celebration of Muslim cultures held in the United Kingdom, began in January 2006 and ended July 2007. It imitated an earlier event in 1976.  

From official site;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=home Festival of Muslim Cultures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=September 2008}}
''The festival was created out of the need to encourage a better understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims (as a two-way process), to promote respect for Muslim cultures and to demonstrate how culture creates the pathways that connect us all together.''  Organizers say that festival events were chosen because they represent the best of the Muslim arts world and they "portray diversity and plurality".

The festival, a [[registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1106292&amp;submit=Run+Search charity number 1106292]&lt;/ref&gt; receives government funding from; [[Arts Council England]], City of London, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)]], [[Home Office]] and [[British Council]].&lt;ref&gt; Other sponsors were listed at http://www.muslimcultures.org/index2.php?option=sponsors&lt;/ref&gt; It has a provisional budget of £6,000,000 which is around $10,500,000 USD.&lt;ref name="10000115FestivalofMuslimCultures2005.pdf"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In August 2005, [[The Observer]] reported that the [[Muslim Council of Britain|Muslim Council of Britain (MCB)]] used its influence in [[Whitehall]] to gain a place on the festival's board of trustees. Festival organisers were instructed to comply with Islamic [[sharia law]] to gain the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB's]] full support. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The organisers are now concerned that the festival will lose political backing if they invite performers who are seen to be 'un-Islamic'. Festival organisers already hope to invite the Uzbek singer, Sevara Nezarkhan, who does not wear the headscarf or '[[hijab]]' and has worked with [[Jewish]] '[[klezmer]]' musicians. It also intends to exhibit the 14th-century world history of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], which represents the human form and the prophet [[Mohammed]] himself, thought by some strict Muslims to be forbidden. Other performers could include the [[Senegalese]] musician [[Youssou N'dour]] and the [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]]-British dancer Akram Khan. The Observer understands that the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] insisted that the festival organisers involved the [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] before they would give them their full backing. As a result, an [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] nominee has been taken on to the festival's board of trustees. One source close to the festival organisers said, "We constantly found our efforts were being blocked and it kept coming back to the MCB and its sympathisers within Whitehall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1548786,00.html| title=Radical links of UK's 'moderate' Muslim group| date=14 August 2005| publisher=The Observer| accessdate=2006-09-21 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] responded with, "The MCB believes that the Festival will need to be broad-based, inclusive and mindful of the teachings of Islam if it is to have the support of British Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| date=14 August 2005| title=MCB Responds to The Observer's 'Investigation'| publisher=The Muslim Council of Britain| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209071852/http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=159| archivedate=9 February 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days after the controversy surrounding [[Muslim Council of Britain|MCB]] Secretary General [[Iqbal Sacranie]]'s [[Muslim Council of Britain#Support and criticism|comments on homosexuality]], the conservative British Muslim establishment became embroiled in another [[homophobia]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060123sacranie.shtml Sacranie charge dropped, but Muslim gay row continues – news from ekklesia | Ekklesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2006 Sandra Laville reported in [[The Guardian]], 'Promotional publicity states that the festival will feature the 'diversity and plurality' of Muslim cultures, but gay Muslims say they have been refused permission to present an event.’
[[Aaron Saeed]], Muslim affairs spokesman for the gay rights group [[OutRage!]], wrote to festival director [[Isabel Carlisle]], offering to stage an event celebrating the lives and experiences of gay Muslims in Britain and abroad but his offer was refused.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1692804,00.html?gusrc=rss| title=Festival of Muslim cultures refuses to allow gay event| first=Sandra | last=Laville| date=23 January 2006| publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Isabel Carlisle]]'s reply, she justifies the exclusion of gay Muslims on the grounds 'we are not prepared to present works that will give offence to significant numbers.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/muslimcultures.htm Blasphemy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed for [[The Guardian]] she claimed that gay Muslim participation was rejected because the festival does not want to feature 'political' themes.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

“This is not what her rejection letter states," said [[Aaron Saeed]]. "It says we have been turned down because gay Muslims would give offence. Our proposal was not political. It was for a series of cultural events about the lives and experiences of lesbian and gay Muslims. We planned to organise these events in conjunction with gay Muslim individuals and organisations beyond [[OutRage!]]. These were never envisaged as [[OutRage!]] events. We made that clear. This ban is straightforward homophobia. It is deeply offensive to suggest that gay Muslim people are not a valid part of the Muslim community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outrage.org.uk/pressrelease.asp?ID=333 |title=OutRage! press release – Muslim Festival bans gay Muslims |accessdate=2006-09-21 |df=dmy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (404 error as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saeed concludes, "It is appalling that a registered charity is allowed to discriminate against gay people ... It is time the conservative leadership of the Muslim community got used to the fact that gay Muslims are here to stay and here to fight."
Muhammad Yusuf, a member of the [[Inter-religious Organisations|Interfaith Alliance]], said it was a "matter of regret" that a festival aiming to reflect the diversity of Muslim culture was not prepared to take on board a facet that was different by reason of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="0,2763,1692804,00.html"/&gt;

==Events of the Festival==
Initial events included

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Forensic Economics''' as defined by the National Association of Forensic Economics is the scientific discipline that applies economic theories and methods to matters within a legal framework. Forensic economics covers, but is not limited to:
* The calculation of pecuniary damages in personal and commercial litigation.
* The analysis of liability, such as the statistical analysis of discrimination, the analysis of market power in antitrust disputes, and fraud detection.
* Other matters subject to legal review, such as public policy analysis, and business, property, and asset valuation.

In a 2012 paper by Eric Zitzewitz entitled “Forensic Economics,” ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 2012, 50(3), 731–769, published by the American Economic Association, "Forensic Economics" was defined as the application of economics to the detection and quantification of harm from behavior that has become the subject of litigation.

The only difference between these two definitions is that one suggests the application of science is itself a scientific discipline.  Notwithstanding this distinction, both definitions refer to the application of [[economics]].  While courts may dictate what economic issues are to be addressed, the economic science that is applied must be that which is taught and practiced in the world at large.

==Examples of applications of economics in litigation==
* Economic damages in injury and death
* Antitrust liability and economic damages
* Unfair practices in international trade
* Economic damages in copyright violation and patent infringement
* Contract violations
* Discrimination
* [[Economic damages]] related to physical and emotional abuse

'''GNS Science''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: '''Te Pū Ao''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[Crown Research Institutes|Crown Research Institute]]. It focuses on [[geology]], [[geophysics]] (including [[seismology]] and [[volcanology]]), and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear science]] (particularly [[ion beam|ion-beam technologies]], [[isotope|isotope science]] and [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]]).

GNS Science was known as the '''Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences''' (IGNS) from 1992 to 2005. Originally part of the New Zealand Government's [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR), it was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were set up in 1992.&lt;ref name="CRIact" &gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0047/latest/DLM264292.html], Crown Research Institutes Act 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that process, GNS Science became semi-commercial, and {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} operates as a government-owned company rather than as a government department. This change led to greater autonomy, accompanied by greater emphasis on financial viability. This is essential in the [[corporation | corporate environment]], especially for the purchase and maintenance of research equipment and infrastructure, because the New Zealand public science funding system doesn't normally provide grants for these purposes. 

As well as undertaking basic research, and operating the national geological hazards monitoring network (GeoNet)&lt;ref name="geonet"&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/], GeoNet Hazards Monitoring Network.&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Isotope Centre (NIC),&lt;ref&gt;

GNS Science contracts its services to various private groups (notably energy companies) both in New Zealand and overseas, as well as to central and local government agencies, to provide scientific advice and information.&lt;ref name="Annual Report"&gt;

[[File:Moss flowers.jpg|thumb|right|Moss plants with gynoecia, clusters of archegonia at the apex of each shoot.]]
'''Gynoecium''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γυνή#Ancient Greek|γυνή]]}}, ''gyne'', meaning ''woman'', and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος#Ancient Greek|οἶκος]]}}, ''oikos'', meaning ''house'') is most commonly used as a collective term for the parts of a [[flower]] that produce [[ovule]]s and ultimately develop into the [[fruit]] and [[seed]]s. The gynoecium is the innermost [[whorl (botany)|whorl]] of a flower, it consists of (one or more) '''[[#Pistils|pistils]]''' and is typically surrounded by the [[pollen]]-producing [[Plant reproductive morphology|reproductive organs]], the [[stamen]]s, collectively called the [[androecium]]. The gynoecium is often referred to as the "[[female]]" portion of the flower, although rather than directly producing female [[gamete]]s (i.e. [[egg cell]]s), the gynoecium produces [[megaspore]]s, each of which develops into a female [[gametophyte]] which then produces egg cells.

The term gynoecium is also used by botanists to refer to a cluster of [[archegonia]] and any associated modified leaves or stems present on a [[gametophyte]] shoot in [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] and [[hornwort]]s. The corresponding terms for the male parts of those plants are clusters of [[antheridium|antheridia]] within the androecium.

Flowers that bear a gynoecium but no stamens are called '''pistillate''' or '''carpellate'''. Flowers lacking a gynoecium are called [[stamen|staminate]].

The gynoecium is often referred to as [[female]] because it gives rise to female (egg-producing) gametophytes, however, strictly speaking [[sporophyte]]s do not have a sex, only gametophytes do.&lt;ref name=Judd07/&gt;

Gynoecium development and arrangement is important in systematic research and identification of angiosperms, but can be the most challenging of the floral parts to interpret.&lt;ref name=Satt74/&gt;

==Pistils==
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|A monocarpous (single carpel) gynoecium in context. The gynoecium (whether composed of a single carpel or multiple "fused" carpels) is typically made up of an [[ovary (plant)|ovary]], style, and [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] as in the center of the flower.]]
The gynoecium may consist of one or more separate pistils. A pistil typically consists of an expanded basal portion called the [[ovary (botany)|ovary]], an elongated section called a '''style''' and an apical structure that receives pollen called a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]].
*The ovary (from Latin ''ovum'' meaning egg), is the enlarged basal portion which contains '''placentas''', ridges of tissue bearing one or more [[ovules]] (integumented [[megasporangium|megasporangia]]). The placentas and/or ovule(s) may be born on the gynoecial appendages or less frequently on the floral apex.&lt;ref name=Macd73/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt73/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt82/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=130}} The chamber in which the ovules develop is called a '''[[locule]]''' (or sometimes cell).
*The style (from Ancient Greek [[Wikt:στῦλος#Ancient Greek|''στῦλος'']], ''stylos'' meaning a pillar), is a pillar-like stalk through which pollen tubes grow to reach the ovary. Some flowers such as ''[[Tulipa]]'' do not have a distinct style, and the stigma sits directly on the ovary. The style is a hollow tube in some plants such as [[Lilium|lilies]], or has transmitting tissue through which the pollen tubes grow.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;{{Cite book |last=Esau |first=K. |year=1965 |title=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |publication-place=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |oclc=263092258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The stigma (from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:στίγμα#Ancient Greek|στίγμα]]}}, ''stigma'' meaning mark, or puncture), is usually found at the tip of the style, the portion of the carpel(s) that receives [[pollen]] (male [[gametophyte]]s). It is commonly sticky or feathery to capture pollen.

The word "pistil" comes from [[Latin]] ''pistillum'' meaning [[pestle]]. A sterile pistil in a male flower is referred to as a '''pistillode'''.

== Carpels ==
&lt;!--[[Carpel]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
The pistils of a flower are considered to be composed of '''carpels'''.{{Refn|carpel (also carpophyl) —Gr. καρπός (karpós, “fruit”) + Gr. φύλλον (phúllon, “leaf”) [L. folium].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Century Dictionary: The Century dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0dFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA832|year=1914|publisher=Century Company|page=832|chapter=Carpophyl}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=Carpel.name|group=note}} A carpel is the female reproductive part of the flower, interpreted as modified leaves bearing structures called [[ovule]]s, inside which the egg cells ultimately form. A pistil may consist of one carpel, with its ovary, style and stigma, or several carpels may be joined together with a single ovary, the whole unit called a pistil. The gynoecium may consist of one or more uni-carpellate (with one carpel) pistils, or of one multi-carpellate pistil. The number of carpels is described by terms such as '''tricarpellate''' (three carpels).

Carpels are thought to be [[phylogenetically]] derived from ovule-bearing leaves or leaf homologues ([[megasporophyll]]s), which evolved to form a closed structure containing the ovules. This structure is typically rolled and fused along the margin.

Although many flowers satisfy the above definition of a carpel, there are also flowers that do not have carpels according to this definition because in these flowers the ovule(s), although enclosed, are borne directly on the shoot apex, and only later become enclosed by the carpel.&lt;ref name=Satt88/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D'Arcy, W.G. |author2=Keating, R.C. |year=1996  |title=The Anther: Form, Function, and Phylogeny |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=9780521480635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuUVYOFCTwYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different remedies have been suggested for this problem. An easy remedy that applies to most cases is to redefine the carpel as an appendage that encloses ovule(s) and may or may not bear them.&lt;ref name=Satt82/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=130}}&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt;

[[File:RanunculusRepens-FoxRoost-Newfoundland - stamens and pistils closeup.jpg|thumb|Centre of a ''[[Ranunculus repens]]'' (creeping buttercup) showing multiple unfused carpels surrounded by longer stamens]]

== Types ==

If a gynoecium has a single carpel, it is called '''monocarpous'''. If a gynoecium has multiple, distinct (free, unfused) carpels, it is '''apocarpous'''. If a gynoecium has multiple carpels "fused" into a single structure, it is '''syncarpous'''. A syncarpous gynoecium can sometimes appear very much like a monocarpous gynoecium.

The degree of connation ("fusion") in a syncarpous gynoecium can vary. The carpels may be "fused" only at their bases, but retain separate styles and stigmas. The carpels may be "fused" entirely, except for retaining separate stigmas. Sometimes (e.g., [[Apocynaceae]]) carpels are fused by their styles or stigmas but possess distinct ovaries. In a syncarpous gynoecium, the "fused" ovaries of the constituent carpels may be referred to collectively as a single compound ovary. It can be a challenge to determine how many carpels fused to form a syncarpous gynoecium. If the styles and stigmas are distinct, they can usually be counted to determine the number of carpels. Within the compound ovary, the carpels may have distinct '''locules''' divided by walls called '''septa'''. If a syncarpous gynoecium has a single style and stigma and a single locule in the ovary, it may be necessary to examine how the ovules are attached. Each carpel will usually have a distinct line of placentation where the ovules are attached.

Pistils begin as small primordia on a floral apical meristem, forming later than, and closer to the (floral) apex than sepal, petal and stamen primordia. [[morphology (biology)|Morphological]] and [[molecular]] studies of pistil ontogeny reveal that carpels are most likely homologous to leaves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A carpel has a similar function to a [[megasporophyll]], but typically includes a stigma, and is fused, with ovules enclosed in the enlarged lower portion, the ovary.&lt;ref name=GiffFost89/&gt;

In some [[basal angiosperm]] lineages, [[Degeneriaceae]] and [[Winteraceae]], a carpel begins as a shallow cup where the ovules develop with laminar placentation, on the upper surface of the carpel. The carpel eventually forms a folded, leaf-like structure, not fully sealed at its margins. No style exists, but a broad stigmatic crest along the margin allows pollen tubes access along the surface and between hairs at the margins.&lt;ref name=GiffFost89/&gt;

Two kinds of fusion have been distinguished: postgenital fusion that can be observed during the development of flowers, and congenital fusion that cannot be observed i.e., fusions that occurred during phylogeny. But it is very difficult to distinguish fusion and non-fusion processes in the evolution of flowering plants. Some processes that have been considered congenital (phylogenetic) fusions appear to be non-fusion processes such as, for example, the de novo formation of intercalary growth in a ring zone at or below the base of primordia.&lt;ref name=Satt78/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=67–69, 142–145}}&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt; Therefore, "it is now increasingly acknowledged that the term 'fusion,' as applied to phylogeny (as in 'congenital fusion') is ill-advised."{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=142}}

== Gynoecium position ==
[[Image:Spathoglottis flwrs reduced.jpg|thumb|200px|Flowers and fruit (capsules) of the ground orchid, ''[[Spathoglottis]] plicata'', illustrating an '''inferior''' ovary.]]
Basal angiosperm groups tend to have carpels arranged spirally around a conical or dome-shaped [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]. In later lineages, carpels tend to be in [[whorl (botany)|whorl]]s.

[[Image:Hegi ovary.png|250px|thumb|Illustration showing longitudinal sections through hypogynous (a), perigynous (b), and epigynous (c) flowers]]

The relationship of the other flower parts to the gynoecium can be an important systematic and taxonomic character. In some flowers, the stamens, petals, and sepals are often said to be "fused" into a "floral tube" or '''[[hypanthium]]'''. However, as Leins &amp; Erbar (2010) pointed out, "the classical view that the wall of the inferior ovary results from the "congenital" fusion of dorsal carpel flanks and the [[floral axis]] does not correspond to the ontogenetic processes that can actually be observed. All that can be seen is an intercalary growth in a broad circular zone that changes the shape of the floral axis (receptacle)."&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt; And what happened during evolution is not a phylogenetic fusion but the formation of a unitary intercalary meristem. Evolutionary developmental biology investigates such developmental processes that arise or change during evolution.

If the hypanthium is absent, the flower is ''hypogynous'', and the stamens, petals, and sepals are all attached to the receptacle below the gynoecium. Hypogynous flowers are often referred to as having a ''superior ovary''. This is the typical arrangement in most flowers.

If the hypanthium is present up to the base of the style(s), the flower is ''epigynous''. In an epigynous flower, the stamens, petals, and sepals are attached to the hypanthium at the top of the ovary or, occasionally, the hypanthium may extend beyond the top of the ovary. Epigynous flowers are often referred to as having an ''inferior ovary''. Plant families with epigynous flowers include [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], [[Asteraceae|asters]], and [[Onagraceae|evening primroses]].

Between these two extremes are ''perigynous'' flowers, in which a hypanthium is present, but is either free from the gynoecium (in which case it may appear to be a cup or tube surrounding the gynoecium) or connected partly to the gynoecium (with the stamens, petals, and sepals attached to the hypanthium part of the way up the ovary). Perigynous flowers are often referred to as having a ''half-inferior ovary'' (or, sometimes, ''partially inferior'' or ''half-superior''). This arrangement is particularly frequent in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] and [[Saxifragaceae|saxifrages]].

Occasionally, the gynoecium is born on a stalk, called the [[gynophore]], as in ''Isomeris arborea''.

== Placentation ==
{{Main|Ovule}}
Within the ovary, each ovule is born by a placenta or arises as a continuation of the floral apex. The placentas often occur in distinct lines called lines of [[placentation#Placentation in plants|placentation]]. In monocarpous or apocarpous gynoecia, there is typically a single line of placentation in each ovary. In syncarpous gynoecia, the lines of placentation can be regularly spaced along the wall of the ovary ('''parietal placentation'''), or near the center of the ovary. In the latter case, separate terms are used depending on whether or not the ovary is divided into separate locules. If the ovary is divided, with the ovules born on a line of placentation at the inner angle of each locule, this is '''axile placentation'''. An ovary with '''free central placentation''', on the other hand, consists of a single compartment without septae and the ovules are attached to a central column that arises directly from the floral apex (axis). In some cases a single ovule is attached to the bottom or top of the locule ('''basal''' or '''apical placentation''', respectively).

== The ovule ==
{{Main|Ovule}}
[[Image:Femalesquash3747.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Longitudinal section of carpellate flower of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] showing ovary, ovules, stigma, style, and petals]]
In flowering plants, the ''ovule'' (from Latin ''ovulum'' meaning small egg) is a complex structure born inside ovaries. The ovule initially consists of a stalked, integumented ''megasporangium'' (also called the ''nucellus''). Typically, one cell in the megasporangium undergoes [[meiosis]] resulting in one to four megaspores. These develop into a megagametophyte (often called the embryo sac) within the ovule. The megagametophyte typically develops a small number of cells, including two special cells, an egg cell and a binucleate central cell, which are the [[gamete]]s involved in [[double fertilization]]. The central cell, once fertilized by a sperm cell from the pollen becomes the first cell of the [[endosperm]], and the egg cell once fertilized become the [[zygote]] that develops into the [[embryo]]. The gap in the integuments through which the pollen tube enters to deliver sperm to the egg is called the [[micropyle (botany)|micropyle]]. The stalk attaching the ovule to the placenta is called the funiculus.

== Role of the stigma and style ==
{{anchor|StyleBotany}}
[[Image:Marijuana Pistil.jpg|thumb|Stigmas and style of ''Cannabis sativa'' held in a pair of forceps]]
[[File:Crocus macro crop.jpg|thumb|Stigma of a ''[[Crocus]]'' flower.]]
{{Main|Stigma (botany)}}

Stigmas can vary from long and slender to globe-shaped to feathery. The stigma is the receptive tip of the carpel(s), which receives pollen at [[pollination]] and on which the pollen grain [[germination|germinates]]. The stigma is adapted to catch and trap pollen, either by combining pollen of visiting insects or by various hairs, flaps, or sculpturings.&lt;ref name=BlacToot84/&gt;

The style and stigma of the flower are involved in most types of [[self incompatibility in plants|self incompatibility]] reactions. Self-incompatibility, if present, prevents [[fertilisation|fertilization]] by pollen from the same plant or from genetically similar plants, and ensures outcrossing.

A '''hand boiler''' or (less commonly) '''love meter''' is a [[glass sculpture]] used as an [[experimental]] tool to demonstrate [[vapour-liquid equilibrium]], or as a [[collector's item]] to whimsically "measure love." It consists of a lower [[bulb]] containing a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid and a mixture of gases that is connected usually by a twisting [[glass tube]] that connects to an upper or "receiving" glass bulb.
[[File:Pen Finger Boiler.jpg|thumb|Hand boiler toy, built into a ballpoint pen. The warmth from the fingertips vaporizes some of the red liquid inside the tube, causing it to rise and bubble up into the top chamber as if the liquid was boiling.  ]]
==Mechanics==
A hand boiler functions similar to the "[[drinking bird]]" toy:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  {{cite journal|last1=Ucke|first1=Christian|last2=Schlichting|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=Der Kaffeekugelschreiber oder das Liebesthermometer|journal=Physik in unserer Zeit|date=1995|volume=26|issue=4|pages=192–193|trans-title=The coffee-percolator pen or the love thermometer|language=German}}  Available at: [http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/fachbereich_physik/didaktik_physik/publikationen/kaffeekugelschreiber_liebesthermometer.pdf University of Münster (Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany)]

Since the lower bulb is warmer, the vapor pressure in it is higher.  The difference in vapor pressure forces the liquid from the lower bulb to the upper bulb.  Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;

where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; = the height of the column of fluid above the fluid's level in the lower bulb&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; = the difference in vapor pressure between the two bulbs (which can be determined via the [[Antoine equation]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = the density of the liquid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = the acceleration of gravity at the Earth's surface

The liquid inside a hand boiler does not actually boil. The "boiling" is caused by the relationship between the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] of a gas. As the temperature of a gas in a closed container rises, the pressure also rises. There must be a temperature (and pressure) difference between the two large chambers for the liquid to move. When held upright (with the smaller bulb on top), the liquid will move from the bulb with the higher pressure to the bulb with lower pressure. As the gas continues to expand, the gas will then bubble through the liquid, making it appear to boil. The fact that the liquid is volatile (easily vaporized) makes the hand boiler more effective. Adding heat to the liquid produces more gas, also increasing pressure in the closed container.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/hand-boiler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a hand boiler is used to show properties of [[distillation]]. Since the liquid both [[evaporates]] and [[condenses]] at relatively cool temperatures while in an enclosed system, the boiler can be turned upside down, and the top end can be placed in ice water. The gaseous form of the liquid will condense in the cooled chamber. Since the liquid is often colored with dye, but the dye does not evaporate or condense at the same temperature, the liquid that condenses in the cooled chamber is colorless, leaving the [[pigment]] behind.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, hand boilers used to be sometimes known as "love meters" because the tube that separates the upper and lower bulbs is twisted into a heart shape and the volatile liquid is colored red. Love meters were a common collector's item or a souvenir. Depending on how the item was packaged, one would grasp the lower bulb to "prove" how passionate one was, or a couple would each grasp one end to see who would force the liquid into the other's bulb.

Hand boilers are much more commonly used as a scientific novelty today.

== History ==

Hand boilers date back at least as early as 1767, when the American polymath [[Benjamin Franklin]] encountered them in Germany.  He developed an improved version in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''Hibernaculum''' (plural ''hibernacula'') is the term often applied to a winter bud of certain [[aquatic plant]]s, such as the [[bladderwort]]s (''[[Bladderwort|Utricularia]]'').  The buds are heavier than water, and, being developed at the approach of cold weather, they become detached, sink to the bottom of the pond, and thus survive the winter.  In the spring, they enlarge, developing [[buoyancy|air space]]s, rise to the surface, and reproduce their species.&lt;ref&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terrestrial plants also form hibernacula. These include some temperate sundews (''[[Drosera]]'') such as ''[[Drosera anglica|D.&amp;nbsp;anglica]]'', ''[[Drosera filiformis|D.&amp;nbsp;filiformis]]'', ''[[Drosera intermedia|D.&amp;nbsp;intermedia]]'', ''[[Drosera rotundifolia|D.&amp;nbsp;rotundifolia]]''; and some temperate butterworts (''[[Pinguicula]]'') such as ''[[Pinguicula balcanica|P.&amp;nbsp;balcanica]]'', ''[[Pinguicula grandiflora|P.&amp;nbsp;grandiflora]]'',  ''[[Pinguicula longifolia|P.&amp;nbsp;longifolia]]'', and ''[[Pinguicula vulgaris|P.&amp;nbsp;vulgaris]]''.

In [[astrometry]], an '''International Celestial Reference Frame''' ('''ICRF''') is a realization of the [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) using reference celestial sources observed at radio wavelengths.  In the context of the ICRS, a [[frame of reference|reference ''frame'']] is the ''physical realization'' of a reference ''system,'' i.e., the reference frame is the set of reported coordinates of the reference sources, with the coordinates derived using the procedures spelled out by the ICRS.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRF creates a quasi-[[inertial frame of reference]] centered at the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of the [[Solar System]], whose axes are defined by the measured positions of [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic sources]] (mainly [[quasar]]s) observed using [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Although [[general relativity]] implies that there are no true inertial frames around [[gravitation|gravitating]] bodies, the ICRF is important because it does not exhibit any measurable [[angular motion]] since the extragalactic sources used to define the ICRF are so far away. The ICRF is now the standard reference frame used to define the positions of the planets (including the [[Earth]]) and other [[astronomical object]]s.

==ICRF1==

The ICRF, now called ICRF1, was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] on 1 January 1998.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35&gt;{{cite web|title=IERS Technical Note No. 35: The Second Realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame by Very Long Baseline Interferometry|url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1|publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)|accessdate=5 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725164148/http://ww2.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf%2Ftn35.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF1 had an angular [[noise floor]] of approximately 250 [[microarcsecond]]s (µas) and a reference axis stability of approximately 20 µas; this was an order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous reference frame derived from [[Fifth Fundamental Catalog]] (FK5).&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35 /&gt; The ICRF1 contains 212 defining sources and also contains positions of 396 additional non-defining sources for reference. The positions of these sources have been adjusted in later extensions to the catalogue. The ICRF1 agrees with the orientation of the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) "[[J2000.0]]" frame to within the (lower) precision of the latter.

==ICRF2==

An updated reference frame ICRF2 was created in 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigerwald2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steigerwald |first1=Bell |title=NASA - New Celestial Map Gives Directions for GPS |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/icrf2.html |website=www.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was a joint collaboration of the [[International Astronomical Union]], the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]], and the [[International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry]].&lt;ref name="Fey2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fey |first1=Alan L. |title=The International Celestial Reference Frame |url=http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/ICRF2/ |website=rorf.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Naval Office (USNO) |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF2 is defined by the position of 295 compact radio sources (97 of which also define ICRF1).  Alignment of ICRF2 with ICRF1-Ext2, the second extension of ICRF1, was made with 138 sources common to both reference frames. Including non-defining sources, it comprises 3414 sources measured using [[very-long-baseline interferometry]]. The ICRF2 has a noise floor of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;µas and an axis stability of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;µas. Maintenance of the ICRF2 will be accomplished by a set of 295 sources that have especially good positional stability and unambiguous spatial structure. 

The data used to derive the reference frame come from approximately 30 years of VLBI observations, from 1979 to 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt; Radio observations in both the S-band (2.3GHz) and X-band (8.4GHz) were recorded simultaneously to allow correction for [[ionospheric]] effects. The observations resulted in about 6.5 million group-delay measurements among pairs of telescopes. The group delays were processed with software that takes into account atmospheric and geophysical processes. The positions of the reference sources were treated as unknowns to be solved for by minimizing the [[mean squared error]] across group-delay measurements. The solution was constrained to be consistent with the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF2008) and [[earth orientation parameters]] (EOP) systems. 

ICRF3 is in development with a planned release date of August 2018.&lt;ref name="Gaume2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gaume USNO |first1=Ralph |last2=Ma, GSFC |first2=Chopo |title=ICRF-3 Overview |url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Workshops/Retreat2013/2_Gaume.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1 |publisher=IERS DB Retreat, Paris, France, 23 May 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-power broadcasting''' refers to a [[radio station|broadcast station]] operating at a low [[electrical power]] to a smaller service area than "full power" stations within the same region, but often distinguished from "micropower broadcasting" (more commonly "[[microbroadcasting]]") and [[broadcast translator]]s. '''LPAM''', '''LPFM''' and '''LPTV''' are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the [[law]]s and their [[enforcement]].

==Canada==
Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of [[Industry Canada]], in conjunction with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.

LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. {{as of|2000}}, 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.

Stations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same [[call signs in Canada|call sign]] format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.

The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), [[pirate broadcasting|pirate radio]] regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Industry Canada. Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, Spectrum and Telecommunications Management.|date = 2000|title = Frequently asked questions on low power FM broadcasting (RIC-40) |location = Ottawa, Canada|publisher =  Spectrum Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20&amp;nbsp;km from the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title = Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt [[EIRP]] in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7&amp;nbsp;MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio [[Spectrum management|Spectrum Management]], managed by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.&lt;ref name=NZRSM/&gt;

Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services.  Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rsm.govt.nz/about-rsm/pdf-and-documents-library/spectrum-policy/official-information-notices-gazette/gurl-notices/low-power-fm-broadcasting/radiocommunications-regulations-general-user-radio-licence-for-low-power-fm-broadcasting-notice-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively.

There exists a 25&amp;nbsp;km [[broadcast translator]] rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25&amp;nbsp;km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.&lt;ref name=NZRSM&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/licensees/types-of-licence/general-user-licences/low-power-fm-broadcasting|title = Radiocommunications Regulations (General User Licence for Low Power FM Broadcasting) Notice 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.

==United Kingdom==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including [[military base]]s, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==United States==

===FM radio===
Low Power FM (LPFM) is a [[non-commercial educational]] broadcast service. LPFM licenses may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, and public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible to hold an LPFM license.

====LPFM classes====
* Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 [[watt]]s [[effective radiated power]] (ERP). ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})
* Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})

In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.

====Legislation====

=====Origins of LPFM=====
In January 2000, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|211}}). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups and figures associated with [[Progressivism in the United States|American progressivism]]; music artists (such as [[Bonnie Raitt]]); religious leaders/churches (such as the [[United Church of Christ]]); and educators (for example, [[American Library Association]], the [[Communication Workers of America]] [[trade union|labor union]], the [[National League of Cities]].

The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to "[[radio homogenization]]", as described in the ''J&amp;MC Quarterly Journal'', as "... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming."&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Alan G. Stavisky|author2 = Robert K. Avery|author3 =  Helena Vanhala|title = From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio|journal =  Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume = 78|date = 2001|pages = 340–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main opposition to LPFMs came from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to "maintain spectrum integrity" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"/&gt;

=====Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000=====&lt;!-- linked from "National Association of Broadcasters" --&gt;
Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged [[United States Congress|Congress]] to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill in December 2000, albeit reluctantly{{Weasel inline|date=November 2018}}. The actual bill that went through Congress [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp106&amp;sid=cp106nfZjS&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr567.106&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_12219&amp; ] was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions:
# The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 1999|title = H.R. 3439 [106th]: Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-3439&amp;tab=summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz from all other stations with the intent of preventing signal interference.
# Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses.
# The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference effects and economic impact of LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the ''[[MITRE Corporation]] Report'', suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Radio Magazine|date = March 1, 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = March 3, 2008|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100247/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = April 9, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act basically shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. "From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio." Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.)

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2005=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators [[John McCain]], [[Maria Cantwell]] and [[Patrick Leahy]]. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning [http://www.recnet.net/mitre/2.pdf the MITRE Report] to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html Current.org|title = Mitre study on LPFM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090155/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html|archivedate = 2011-05-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sen. Leahy, "This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8904246a-cd92-489c-81b1-48d8eddc4298&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=|title = United States Senator John McCain :: Press Office :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2007=====
Sponsored in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by Congressmen [[Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania politician)|Mike Doyle]] and [[Lee Terry]] and in the [[United States Senate]] by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007|title = H.R. 2802: Local Community Radio Act of 2007|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as ''Never Passed''.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2009=====
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2009|title = H.R. 1147, The Local Community Radio Act of 2009|access-date =  May 23, 2009|url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_HR_1147.html#toc2|publisher = Washington Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = RADIO magazine - The Radio Technology Leader|date = 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = May 24, 2009|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012040159/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = October 12, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a [[radio reading service]] (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = KPBS Radio Reading Service|title = About|access-date = May 23, 2009|url = http://kpbsreadingservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"/&gt; The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4TC9Aqjfc|title=FCC: Unanimous, bipartisan support for LPFM|date=September 18, 2009|author=[[United States Congress]]|publisher=[[Free Press (organization)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2010=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011 as {{USPL|111|371}}, after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] said, "Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country." The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.

In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

====Arguments for LPFM====
*[[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, specifically in promoting "diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = Free Press|date = 2008|title = Local Radio Now|access-date =  February 12, 2008|url = http://www.freepress.net/lpfm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons:
** It strengthens community identity.
** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to get their music heard.
** It creates diversity on the air because women and racial minorities are represented.
** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business.
** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information.
*[[Prometheus Radio Project]], a non-profit organization that "builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project|date = 2009|title = About Prometheus Radio Project|access-date = February 10, 2011|url = http://www.prometheusradio.org/about_us}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported LPFM, citing these reasons:
** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves
** Public airwaves shouldn't be concentrated in private/corporate hands
** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities
** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters

A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = B. Stelter|date = January 11, 2011|title = Low-Power FM Radio to Gain Space on the Dial|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25radio.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on a LPFM station called KOCZ highlights a number of key arguments for LPFM:
* "In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciate how LPFM plays a genre of music called [[zydeco]], a potent blend of [[Cajun music|Cajun]], [[rhythm and blues]] and, among a younger generation, [[hip-hop]], often features accordion and washboard.“
* LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. “Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. 'They know that we make them better,' an advocate said.”
* Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many community service-related projects that help better the local neighborhood. "KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. "
* LPFM promotes a very close community. "A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... 'She was able to get her dog back the next day’”
* LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.”

Former President Bill Clinton is a known advocate of LPFM saying it is "giving voice to the voiceless", including schools, community groups, churches, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Mike Janssen|date = January 15, 2001|title = Intervention by Congress slashes LPFM licensing 80%|newspaper = Current|access-date = February 11, 2008|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0101lpfm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, "We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Brown Paper Tickets|date = September 13, 2011|title = Brown Paper Tickets CEO Makes Voice Heard for Low Power FM|access-date = September 13, 2011|url = http://www.brownpapertickets.com/pressrelease/100008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = HowStuffWorks|date = 2000|title = What is low-power FM LPFM?|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question330.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against LPFM====
* Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPFM Report Fatally Flawed |work=Radio TechCheck |publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters]] |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101516/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to [[Ionospheric reflection|ionospheric refraction]], are required to emit weaker signals during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ron Whittaker|date = June 14, 2007|title = Elements of Mass Communication: AM FM Waves and Sound|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/frtv017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; FM translators are low-power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves.
* In some states, the local [[Department of Transportation]] operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as [[highway advisory radio]] stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the [[amplitude modulation|AM]] band – restricting the number of available channels{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies).

====LPFM vs. broadcast translators====
{{See also|Broadcast relay station#Great Translator Invasion of 2003}}
Unlike the former [[list of broadcast station classes#FM|FM class D]] license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for [[broadcast translator]]s exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band.  Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station.  Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called "Satellators", was never a factor in the 2003 window.

The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/translator-39flood39-causes-concern/16974 |title=Translator 'Flood' Causes Concern |date=10 September 2003 |author=Naina Narayana Chernoff |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters.  However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b),&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz). ({{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231(b)}}) As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by {{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(g)}}.  Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.

In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the [[Local Community Radio Act]], accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - "a spectrum grab" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashworth|first1=Susan|title=LPFM Advocates File Objections to Nearly 1,000 Applications|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lpfm-advocates-file-objections-to-nearly-1000-applications|website=Radio World|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobson|first1=Adam|title=Are Hundreds Of Pending FM Translators In Jeopardy? {{!}} Radio &amp; Television Business Report|url=https://www.rbr.com/local-comm-radio-act/|website=www.rbr.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prometheus May 2018 translator objections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-power FM radio advocates file 1,000 Objections with FCC {{!}} Prometheus Radio Project|url=https://www.prometheusradio.org/InformalObjections20180516|website=www.prometheusradio.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AM radio===
{{see also|AM broadcasting#Microbroadcasting}}
The acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define "LPAM" nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.

Any "low power AM" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category ''Class&amp;nbsp;D'' for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class&amp;nbsp;D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.

Other LPAM operations are known as [[Travelers' Information Stations]] (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as [[national park]]s. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.

Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, "[[High fidelity|low-fidelity audio]]" as well, compared to the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15&amp;nbsp;kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz down to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/5-khz-audio-bandwidth-on-am|title=5 kHz Audio Bandwidth on AM|author=|date=|website=radioworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Travelers' Information Stations|TIS]] transmissions are normally authorized for 10&amp;nbsp;Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60&amp;nbsp;Watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680&amp;nbsp;kHz at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/letterPdf/LetterPdfController?licId=1236825&amp;letterVersionId=52&amp;autoLetterId=0&amp;letterCode=AZ&amp;radioServiceCode=PW&amp;op=LetterPdf&amp;licSide=Y&amp;letterTo=L%20%20%20%20&amp;archive=nul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from [[New York City]] (five stations, though more exist in the market from other [[city of license|cities of license]]) down to [[Junction City, Kansas]] (two stations).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the [[Americas]], where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as [[broadcast relay station#translator stations|translator]]s (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called [[Class A television service|Class A]] (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3&amp;nbsp;kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/afcce.ppt|title = FCC Slideshow, slide 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be "harmful"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital]]. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license.

====Class A LPTV stations====
The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.

====Must-carry====
One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is [[cable television]] and [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local [[media market|television market]] through "[[must-carry]]" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners.

====Network affiliates====
Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]] or [[MyNetworkTV]]. Examples include in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with [[NBC]] on [[WBTS-LD]], [[Youngstown, Ohio]], where a pair of LPTV stations based at [[WYFX-LD]] broadcast Fox programming, along with the [[digital subchannel]] of the co-owned [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WKBN-TV]], or in the [[Lima, Ohio]] area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

====Digital transition====
On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016.

Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The [[amateur television]] channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some [[repeater]]s airing [[NASA TV]] during [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space exploration|mission]]s when they are not in local use.

The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the "restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor]]s refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, "some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/327560-Community_Broadcasters_Association_to_Shutter.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Community Broadcasters Association to Shutter|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.

In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project, Initials|date = February 12, 2006|title =  Review of fcc proposed rules for digital radio and impact for lpfm|url = http://prometheusradio.org/node/139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Michelle Eyre|date = September 21, 2008|title =  A Comparitive[sic] overview of digital audio broadcasting (dab) systems|url = http://home.recnet.com/dab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8869">In [[computer science]] and [[recursion theory]] the '''McCarthy Formalism''' (1963) of [[computer]] scientist [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] clarifies the notion of [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] by use of the IF-THEN-ELSE construction common to computer science, together with four of the operators of [[primitive recursive function]]s: zero, successor, equality of numbers and composition. The conditional operator replaces both [[primitive recursion]] and the [[mu-operator]].

== Introduction ==

=== McCarthy's notion of ''conditional expression'' ===
McCarthy (1960) described his formalism this way:
:"In this article, we first describe a formalism for defining functions recursively. We believe this formalism has advantages both as a programming language and as a vehicle for developing a theory of computation....
:" We shall need a number of mathematical ideas and notations concerning functions in general. Most of the ideas are well known, but the notion of ''conditional expression'' is believed to be new, and the use of ''conditional expressions'' permits functions to be defined recursively in a new and convenient way."

=== Minsky's explanation of the "formalism" ===
In his 1967 ''Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines'', [[Marvin Minsky]] in his §&amp;nbsp;10.6 '''Conditional Expressions: The McCarthy Formalism''' describes the "formalism" as follows:
: "Practical computer languages do not lend themselves to formal mathematical treatment--they are not designed to make it easy to prove theorems about the procedures they describe. In a paper by McCarthy [1963] we find a formalism that enhances the practical aspect of the recursive-function concept, while preserving and improving its mathematical clarity. ¶ McCarthy introduces "conditional expressions" of the form
:: f = ('''if''' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''then''' ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''else''' ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
: where the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are expressions and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a statement (or equation) that may be true or false. ¶ This expression means
:: See if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is true; if so the value of ''f'' is given by ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:: IF ''p1'' is false, the value of ''f'' is given by ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:This conditional expression . . . has also the power of the minimization operator. . ..
:The McCarthy formalism is like the general recursive (Kleene) system, in being based on some basic functions, composition, and equality, but with the conditional expression alone replacing both the primitive-recursive scheme and the minimization operator." (Minsky 1967:192-193)

Minsky uses the following operators in his demonstrations:&lt;ref&gt;Minsky (1967) does not include the identity operator in his description of [[primitive recursive function]]s. Why this is the case is not known.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zero
* Successor
* Equality of numbers
* Composition (substitution, replacement, assignment)&lt;ref&gt;Various authors use various names for this operation. Kleene calls it: "the schema of ''definition by substitution''. The expression for the ambiguous value of φ is obtained by substitution of expressions for the ambiguous values of χ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for the variables of ψ . . .. the function φ defined by an application of this schema we sometimes write ast '''S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'''(ψ, &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;." (Kleene 1952:220). Knuth names it the "all-important ''replacement'' operation (sometimes called ''assignment'' or ''substitution'')", and he symbolizes it with the " ← " arrow, e.g. "m ← n" means the value of variable ''m'' is to be replaced by the current value of variable ''n''" (cf Knuth 1973:3).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conditional expression
From these he shows how to derive the ''predecessor'' function (i.e. DECREMENT); with this tool he derives the minimization operator necessary for "general" [[recursion]], as well as primitive-recursive definitions.

=== Expansion of IF-THEN-ELSE to the CASE operator ===
In his 1952 ''Introduction of Meta-Mathematics'' [[Stephen Kleene]] provides a definition of what it means to be a primitive recursive function:
:"A function {{math|φ}} is ''primitive recursive in'' {{math|ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (briefly '''Ψ'''), if there is a finite sequence {{math|φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., φ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of (occurrences of) functions ... such that each function of the sequence is either one of the functions '''Ψ''' (the assumed functions), or an initial function, or an immediate dependent of preceding functions, and the last function {{math|φ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|φ}}." (Kleene 1952:224)
In other words, given a "basis" function (it can be a constant such as 0), primitive recursion uses either the base or the previous value of the function to produce the value of the function; primitive recursion is sometimes called [[mathematical induction]]

Minsky (above) is describing a two-CASE operator. A demonstration that the ''nested'' IF-THEN-ELSE—the "[[case statement]]" (or "switch statement")--is [[primitive recursive]] can be found in Kleene 1952:229&lt;ref&gt;Kleene's 5 primitive recursion "schema" include the following:
{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
| zero constant: 0 or may be 0()
| successor: {{math|''S''(0) {{=}} "1", ''S''(1) {{=}} "2",}} etc.
| projection: {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}'s are "parameters" fixed throughout the calculation, and {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} project one of them out, the notation {{math|&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also used.
| substitution {{math|φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ψ(χ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., χ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;))}}
| primitive recursion; cf Kleene 1952:219.}}&lt;/ref&gt; at "#F ('mutually-exclusive predicates')". The CASE operator behaves like a logical [[multiplexer]] and is simply an extension of the simpler two-case logical operator sometimes called AND-OR-SELECT (see more at [[Propositional formula]]). The CASE operator for three cases would be verbally described as: "If X is CASE 1 then DO "p" else if X is CASE 2 then do "q" else if X is CASE "3" then do "r" else do "default".

Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 observe that in a particular instance the CASE operator, or a sequence of nested IF-THEN-ELSE statements, must be both [[mutually exclusive]], meaning that only one "case" holds (is true), and [[collectively exhaustive]], meaning ''every'' possible situation or "case" is "covered". These requirements are a consequence of the determinacy of [[Propositional logic]]; the correct implementation requires the use of [[truth table]]s and [[Karnaugh map]]s to specify and simplify the cases; see more at [[Propositional formula]]. The authors point out the power of "definition by cases":
:"...in more complicated examples, definition by cases makes it far easier to establish the (primitive) recursiveness of important functions. This is mainly because there are a variety of processes for defining new relations from old that can be shown to produce new (primitive) recursive relations when applied to (primitive) recursive relations." (Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74)
They prove, in particular, that the processes of [[substitution of variables|substitution]], [[graph relation]] (similar to the [[identity relation]] that plucks out (the value of) a particular variable from a list of variables), [[negation]] (logical NOT), [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] (logical AND), [[disjunction]] (logical OR), bounded [[universal quantification]], or bounded [[existential quantification]] can be used together with definition by cases to create new primitive recursive functions (cf Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74-77).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">'''Model-based systems engineering''' ('''MBSE''') is a [[systems engineering]] methodology that focuses on creating and exploiting [[domain model]]s as the primary means of information exchange between engineers, rather than on document-based information exchange.

More recently, the focus has also started to cover aspects related to the model execution in computer simulation experiment, to further overcome the gap between the system model specification and the respective simulation software. As a consequence, the term '''modeling and simulation-based systems engineering''' ('''M&amp;SBSE''') has also been used along with MBSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gianni|editor1-first=Daniele|editor2-last=D'Ambrogio|editor2-first=Andrea|editor3-last=Tolk|editor3-first=Andreas|title=Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook|date=December 2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=USA|isbn=9781466571457|edition=1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MBSE approach was popularized by [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] when it kicked off its MBSE Initiative in January 2007.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Goals included increased productivity, by minimizing unnecessary manual transcription of concepts when coordinating the work of large teams.  The MBSE approach is outlined in INCOSE's "MBSE 2020 Vision", with a methodology focusing on distributed but integrated model management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4379">[[Image:Necrophoresis.jpg|thumb|A ''[[black garden ant]]'' (''Lasius niger'') engaging in necrophoresis.]]

'''Necrophoresis''' is a behavior found in [[social insects]] – such as [[ants]], [[bees]], [[wasps]], and [[termites]] – in which they carry the dead bodies of members of their colony from the nest or hive area.&lt;ref&gt;López-Riquelme, G. O., Fanjul-Moles, M. L., "The Funeral Ways of Social Insects. Social Strategies for Corpse Disposal" Trends in Entomology, Volume 9 (2013), pp 71-129.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260715254_The_funeral_ways_of_social_insects._Social_strategies_for_corpse_disposal]&lt;/ref&gt; This acts as a sanitary measure to prevent disease or infection from spreading throughout the colony. Although any member of a colony can carry the bodies, it is usually done by designated 'undertakers'. Ant undertakers have a slightly altered development cycle, and are much more likely than other ants to handle corpse removal. They are not restricted to performing only this task, but they do exhibit different behavioral and movement patterns than other members of the colony, which assist them in this task.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbo, Stephen T., Huang, Zhi-Yong, Robinson, Gene E., "Division of Labor Between Undertaker Specialists and Other Middle-aged Workers in Honey Bee Colonies" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, Vol. 41 No. 3 (1997), pp. 151-163&lt;/ref&gt; Non-undertaker ants may also remove dead bodies, but do so with much less consistency. Differentiating between dead and living insects is accomplished by detecting their chemical signature. Depending on the species, this can be communicated by either the absence of chemicals that are present when they are alive,&lt;ref&gt;Choe, Dong-Hwan, Millar, Jocelyn G., Rust, Michael K., Hildebrand, John G., "Chemical Signals Associated with Life Inhibit Necrophoresis in Aegentine Ants", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 106 No. 20 (May 10, 2009), pp. 8251-8255.&lt;/ref&gt; or by those released in decaying corpses. &lt;ref&gt;López-Riuelme, G.O., Malo, E., Cruz-López, L., Fanjul-Moles, M.L., " Antennal olfactory sensitivity in response to task-related odours of three castes of the ant Atta mexicana (hymenoptera: formicidae), Physiological Entomology, Vol. 31 No. 4, pp. 353-360. doi=10.1111/j.1365-3032.2006.00526.x &lt;/ref&gt; Corpses will either be taken to a random point a certain distance away from the nest, or placed in a refuse pile closer to the nest, along with other waste. 

The removal of corpses carrying infectious disease is crucial to the health of a colony.  Efforts to eliminate colonies of [[fire ants]], for instance, include introducing [[pathogens]] into the population, but this has limited efficacy where the infected insects are quickly separated from the population. However, certain infections have been shown to delay the removal of dead bodies or alter where they are placed.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Yanhua, Pereira, Roberto M., Kilic, Engin, CAsella, George, Keyhani, Nemat O., "Pyrokinin b-Neuropeptide Affects Necrophoretic Behavior in Fire Ants (S. invicta), and Expression of b-NP in a Mycoinsecticide Increases Its Virulence" PLoS ONE, Vol. 7 Issue 1, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Although placing corpses farther away reduces the risk of infection, it also requires more energy. Burial and [[cannibalism]] are other recorded methods of corpse disposal among social insects. Termites have been shown to use burial when they cannot afford to devote workers to necrophoresis, especially when forming a new colony.&lt;ref&gt;Chouvenc T., Robert A., Semon E., Bordereau C., "Burial behavior by dealates of the termite Pseudacanthotermes spiniger (Termitidae, Macrotermitinae) induced by chemical signals from termite corpses", Published online: International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI) 17 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in mature ant colonies only workers feature undertaking behaviours, the queen ants from the ''[[Lasius niger]]'' species undertake deceased co-founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pull|first1=Christopher D.|last2=Cremer|first2=Sylvia|title=Co-founding ant queens prevent disease by performing prophylactic undertaking behaviour|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=13 October 2017|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s12862-017-1062-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter James Clayton''' (25 June 1927, [[Sydenham]], London – 10 August 1991, [[Sydenham]], London)&lt;ref name="Eng &amp; Wales death index" /&gt; was an English jazz presenter on BBC radio, jazz critic, and author. From October 1968 until his death in August 1991, Clayton presented jazz recordings, interviews, studio performances, and live performances on [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|2]], and [[BBC Radio 3|3]], as well as the [[BBC World Service]].  He co-authored several books about music and jazz with [[Peter Gammond]] and was a frequent contributor to jazz magazines.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford Press obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayton photo" /&gt;

==Early life==
After leaving school in 1945, Clayton served three years in the [[RAF]], serving mainly in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. After [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] in 1948, Clayton was employed for a short while as a catering assistant with a hydroelectric scheme in the [[Scottish Highlands]] – "a [[porridge]] stirrer" was his job description – before joining the staff of [[Greenwich]] Public Library, where he remained for seven years. In the 1950s he worked for [[Decca Records]] as a music editor.

==Broadcast career==
After leaving [[Decca Records|Decca]], Clayton began presenting or hosting jazz music on [[BBC]] Radio in October 1968, with a programme called ''Jazz on One'' which was broadcast on 247 metres (1215&amp;nbsp;kHz) [[medium wave]] on Sunday evenings.

In 1970, the BBC reorganised the four national networks, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].  Programmes from [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] were moved to [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], which included ''[[Family Favourites]],'' ''Late Night Extra,'' ''Night Ride'' and the Sunday night jazz shows.  [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] used [[VHF]] [[transmitters]] and was broadcast on 88–91 [[MHz]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]].

Clayton went on in 1970 to present ''Jazz Notes.'' In October 1973, the BBC added back [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] as a carrier for jazz and other shows, while continuing to carry those shows on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]].  That same month, the BBC launched Clayton's best remembered programme, ''Sounds of Jazz,'' Sundays at 10 {{smallcaps|pm}}, with its own theme music composed by [[Laurie Johnson]]:
* [http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/sounds/theme_clayton_sounds_jazz.mp3 "Theme to ''Sounds of Jazz"'']

According to [[Alyn Shipton]] in 2012, "Throughout the 70s and 80s, Peter [Clayton] became synonymous with jazz on BBC Radio."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt; In addition to playing jazz records, Clayton organised and presented live jazz recordings with studio audiences, with sets lasting about 30 minutes recorded at [[Maida Vale Studios|BBC's Maida Vale Studios]] in London during the week. Frequent artists included clarinetist [[Dave Shepherd]] and his quintet, pianist [[Colin Purbrook]] (1936–1999), pianist [[Brian Lemon]] and his octet, tenor saxophonist [[Danny Moss]] and his wife, vocalist [[Jeanie Lambe]] (born 1940), and trumpeter [[Kenny Baker (trumpeter)|Kenny Baker]].  The [[Mike Westbrook Orchestra]] made several broadcasts and filled the studio.

===Broadcast interviews===
On 12 April 1974, Clayton interviewed the jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]] on [[BBC Radio 3]].  During the programme, Peterson performed and played some of his records.&lt;ref name="BBC Clayton/Peterson 1974" /&gt; Clayton interviewed [[Sarah Vaughan]] on his ''Sounds of Jazz'' programme on 11 July 1977, when Vaughan sang a tribute to the music of [[George Gershwin]].

===''Sounds of Jazz'' and ''Jazz Record Requests''===
On [[BBC Radio 3]], he succeeded [[Steve Race]] as the presenter of the Saturday afternoon programme ''[[BBC Radio 3#Jazz Record Requests|Jazz Record Requests]]'', and played requests from an international audience on ''Jazz for the Asking'' on the [[BBC World Service]].  In a 2005 ''Jazz UK'' article about the BBC's influence on jazz in the UK, authors Brian Blain and [[John Fordham]] stated:

{{quote|Informed presenters like the late Peter Clayton and [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Charles Fox]] served jazz superbly, and were looked on with real affection.  For many years a long procession of bands, in all styles, made their way to the [[Maida Vale Studios|BBC's Maida Vale studios]] to record jazz, often in a near gig setting in front of enthusiastic audiences.&lt;ref name="Jazz UK 2005 Jan"/&gt;}}

When Clayton became ill from cancer, [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Charles Fox]] took his place in 1990. Then Fox died on 9 May 1991, and Clayton resumed the show, recording segments at home from a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt; His show ''Sounds of Jazz'' continued to be heard on [[BBC Radio 2]] until his death. When Clayton died, {{cardinal to word|{{age in days|1991|5|9|1991|8|10}}}} days after [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Fox]] died, [[Geoffrey Smith (radio presenter)|Geoffrey Smith]] took over.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt;

===Writing===
Throughout his broadcasting career, Clayton wrote several books with a colleague, Peter Gammond (born 1925).&lt;ref name="Gammond" group=lower-alpha /&gt;

The '''quantum concentration''' {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[particle density (particle count)|particle concentration]] (i.e. the number of particles per unit volume) of a system where the [[mean inter-particle distance|interparticle distance]] is equal to the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]].

Quantum effects become appreciable when the particle concentration is greater than or equal to the quantum concentration, which is defined as:&lt;ref name="Kittel"&gt;{{cite book|title= Thermal Physics|edition=2|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=1980|pages=73–77|author=[[Charles Kittel]]|author2=[[Herbert Kroemer]]|isbn=978-0716710882}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_{\rm Q}=\left(\frac{M k T}{2 \pi \hbar^2}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:where:
:{{mvar|M}} is the mass of the particles in the system
:{{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
:{{mvar|T}} is the temperature as measured in [[kelvin]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]

The quantum concentration for room temperature protons is about 1/cubic-Angstrom.

As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, high temperatures will put most systems in the classical limit unless they have a very high density e.g. a [[White dwarf]].

For an ideal gas the [[Sackur–Tetrode equation]] can be written in terms of the quantum concentration as&lt;ref name="Kittel"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T,V,N)=N k_{\rm B}\left[\frac{5}{2}+\ln\left(\frac{n_{\rm Q}}{n}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

It was used by the [[Apollo PGNCS|Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS)]] as a reference to which the gimbal-mounted platform at its core should be oriented. Every operation within the spacecraft that required knowledge of direction was carried out with respect to the orientation of the guidance platform, itself aligned according to a particular REFSMMAT.

During an Apollo flight, the REFSMMAT being used, and therefore the orientation of the guidance platform, would change as operational needs required it, but never during a guidance process—that is, one REFSMMAT might be in use from launch through Trans-Lunar Injection, another from TLI to Midpoint, but would not change during the middle of a burn or set of maneuvers.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|150}}

For example, it was considered good practice to have the spacecraft displays show some meaningful attitude value that would be easy to monitor during an important engine burn. Flight controllers at mission control in Houston would calculate what attitude the spacecraft had to be at for that burn and would devise a REFSMMAT that matched it in some way. Then, when it came time for the burn, if the spacecraft was in its correct attitude, the crew would see their 8-ball display a simple attitude that would be easy to interpret, allowing errors to be easily tracked and corrected.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|197}}

'''Roadway air dispersion modeling''' is the study of [[air pollutant]] transport from a roadway or other linear emitter. [[Computer model]]s  are required to conduct this analysis, because of the complex variables involved, including vehicle [[motor vehicle emissions|emissions]], vehicle speed, [[meteorology]], and [[terrain]] geometry.  [[Line source]] dispersion has been studied since at least the 1960s, when the regulatory framework in the [[United States]] began requiring quantitative analysis of the air pollution consequences of major roadway and airport projects.  By the early 1970s this subset of [[atmospheric dispersion model]]s were being applied to real world cases of highway planning, even including some controversial court cases.

==How the model works==
The basic concept of the roadway air dispersion model is to calculate air pollutant levels in the vicinity of a highway or [[arterial]] roadway by considering them as line sources.  The model takes into account source characteristics such as  traffic volume, vehicle speeds, truck mix, and fleet emission controls; in addition, the roadway geometry, surrounding terrain and local meteorology are addressed.  For example, many [[air quality]] standards require that certain near worst case meteorological conditions be applied.

The calculations are sufficiently complex that a [[computer model]] is essential to arrive at authoritative results, although workbook type manuals have been developed as screening techniques.  In some cases where results must be refereed (such as legal cases), model validation may be needed with field test data in the local setting; this step is not usually warranted, because the best models have been extensively validated over a wide spectrum of input data variables.

The product of the calculations is usually a set of isopleths or mapped [[contour lines]] either in [[plan view]] or [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] view.  Typically these might be stated as concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]], total reactive [[hydrocarbons]], [[oxides of nitrogen]], [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] or [[benzene]].  The air quality scientist  can run the model successively to study techniques of reducing adverse [[air pollutant concentrations]] (for example, by redesigning roadway geometry, altering speed controls or limiting certain types of trucks).  The model is frequently utilized in an [[Environmental Impact Statement]] involving a major new roadway or land use change which will induce new vehicular traffic.

==History==
The logical building block for this theory was the use of the [[Gaussian]] [[Air pollution|air pollutant]] dispersion equation for [[point source (pollution)|point sources]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of [[atmospheric]] dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216185943/http://air-dispersion.com/ |date=December 16, 2014 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the early point source air pollutant [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Bosanquet  and J.L. Pearson, "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936.  Their equation did not include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.  Sir Graham Sutton derived a point source air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947&lt;ref&gt;O.G. Sutton,  "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", QJRMS, 73:426, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which included the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and [[crosswind]] dispersion of the plume and also addressed the effect of ground reflection of the plume.  Further advances were made by G. A. Briggs&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Briggs, ''A plume rise model compared with observations'', JAPCA, 15:433-438, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in model refinement and validation and by D.B. Turner&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;  for his user-friendly workbook that included screening calculations which do not require a computer.

In seeing the need to develop a line source model to approach the study of roadway air pollution,
Michael Hogan and Richard Venti developed a closed form solution to integrating the point source equation in a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, ''Theoretical basis for atmospheric diffusion from a linear source'', [[ESL Inc.]], Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication IR-29, Sunnyvale, Ca.,  May 4, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Venti, ''Atmospheric diffusion models for roadway sources'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication ET-22, Sunnyvale, Ca., October 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tailpipecov.jpg|thumb|The source of virtually all roadway air pollution emissions is exhaust]]

While the [[ESL Inc.|ESL]] [[mathematical model]]  was  completed for a line source by 1970,  model refinement resulted in a “strip source”, emulating the horizontal extent of the roadway surface.  This theory would be the precursor of [[Area source (pollution)|area source]] dispersion models.  But their focus was roadway simulation, so they proceeded with the development of a [[computer model]] by adding to the team Leda Patmore, a computer programmer in the field of atmospheric physics and satellite trajectory calculations.  A working computer model was produced by late 1970; then the model was calibrated with carbon monoxide field measurements targeting from traffic on [[U.S. Route 101]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]].

The ESL model received endorsement from the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in the form of a major grant to validate the model using actual roadway tests of [[tracer gas]] sulfur hexafluoride dispersion.  That gas was chosen since it does not occur naturally or in vehicular emissions and provides a unique tracer for such dispersion studies.  Part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s motives may have been to bring the model into [[public domain]].  After a successful validation through the EPA research, the model was soon put to use in a variety of settings to forecast air pollution levels in the vicinity of roadways.  The ESL group applied the model to the [[U.S. Route 101]] bypass  project in [[Cloverdale, California]], the extension of [[Interstate 66]] through [[Arlington, Virginia]], the widening of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] through [[Raritan, New Jersey|Raritan]] and [[East Brunswick, New Jersey]], and several transportation projects in [[Boston]] for the Boston Transportation Planning Review.

By the early 1970s at least two other research groups were known to be actively developing some type to roadway air dispersion model: the Environmental Research and Technology group of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] and [[Caltrans]] headquarters in [[Sacramento, California]].  The Caline model of Caltrans borrowed some of the technology from the ESL Inc. group, since Caltrans funded some of the early model application work in Cloverdale and other locations and was given rights to use parts of their model.

==The theory==

The resulting solution for an infinite line source is:

&lt;math&gt;\chi\ = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{q}{\pi\left(u c d x^2\right)\left(cos \alpha\ \right)}\left(\exp\frac{y^2}{2c^2x^2}\right) dx&lt;/math&gt;
      
where:

''x'' is the distance from the observer to the roadway

''y'' is the height of the observer

''u'' is the mean wind speed

''α'' is the angle of tilt of the line source relative to the reference frame

''c'' and ''d'' are the standard deviation of horizontal and vertical  wind directions (measured in radians) respectively.

This equation was integrated into a closed form solution using the error function (erf), and variations in geometry can be performed to include the full infinite line, line segment, elevated line, or arc made from segments.  In any case one can calculate three-dimensional contours of resulting air pollutant concentrations and use the [[mathematical model]] to study alternative roadway designs, various assumptions of worst case meteorology or varying traffic conditions (for example, variations in truck mix, fleet emission controls, or vehicle speed).

The ESL research group also  extended their model by  introducing the area source concept of a vertical strip to simulate the mixing zone on the highway produced by vehicle [[turbulence]].  This model too was validated in 1971 and showed good correlation with field test data.

==Example applications of the model==

[[Image:NorthSouth-Expressway.jpg|thumb|Roadway air dispersion modeling is also done for curved roadways-North-South Express Highway, Malaysia]]

There were several early applications of the model in somewhat dramatic cases.   In 1971 the [[Arlington Coalition on Transportation]] (ACT)  was the [[plaintiff]] in an action against the Virginia Highway Commission over the extension of [[Interstate 66]] through [[Arlington, Virginia]], having filed a suit in the [[United States district court|federal district court]].  The ESL model was used to produce calculations of air quality in the vicinity of the proposed highway.  ACT won this case after a decision by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court paid special attention to the plaintiff's expert calculations and testimony projecting that air quality levels would violate Federal ambient air quality standards as set forth in the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].

A second contentious case took place in [[East Brunswick, New Jersey]] where the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]] planned a major widening of the Turnpike.  Again the roadway air dispersion model was employed to predict levels of air pollution for residences, schools and parks  near the Turnpike.  After an initial hearing in Superior Court where the ESL model results were set forth, the judge ordered the Turnpike Authority to negotiate with the plaintiff, Concerned Citizens of East Brunswick and develop air quality mitigation for the adverse effects.  The Turnpike Authority hired ERT as its expert, and the two research teams negotiated a settlement to this case using the newly created roadway air dispersion models.

==More recent model refinements==

The CALINE3 model is a steady-state Gaussian dispersion model designed to determine air pollution concentrations at receptor locations downwind of  highways located in relatively uncomplicated terrain. CALINE3 is incorporated into the more elaborate CAL3QHC and CAL3QHCR models. CALINE3 is in widespread use due to its user friendly nature and promotion in governmental circles, but it falls short of analyzing the complexity of cases addressed by the original Hogan-Venti model. CAL3QHC and CAL3QHCR models are available in the [[Fortran]] programming language.  They have options to model either particulate matter or [[carbon monoxide]], and include algorithms to simulate queued traffic at signalized intersections [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_prefrec.htm#cal3qhc].

In addition, several more recent models have been developed that employ non-steady state Lagrangian puff algorithms.  The [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_alt.htm#hyroad HYROAD] dispersion model has been developed through the [[National Cooperative Highway Research Program]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20070218211057/http://www.trb.org/trb/crp.nsf/All+Projects/NCHRP+25-06 Project 25-06], incorporating ROADWAY-2 model puff and steady-state plume algorithms [http://www.springerlink.com/(0dvrvwmrr4530lrppvosjvns)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,19,54;journal,13,20;linkingpublicationresults,1:106613,1 (Rao et al., 2002)]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160306/http://www.volpe.dot.gov/air/docs/6757fbea9c9c.pdf TRAQSIM] model was developed in 2004 as part of a Ph.D dissertation with support by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]'s [http://www.volpe.dot.gov/ Volpe National Transportation Systems Center] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060514204655/http://www.volpe.dot.gov/air/index.html Air Quality Facility]. The model incorporates dynamic vehicle behavior with a non-steady state Gaussian puff algorithm. Unlike HYROAD, TRAQSIM combines traffic simulation, second-by-second modal emissions, and Gaussian puff dispersion into a fully integrated system (a true simulation) that models individual vehicles as discrete moving sources.  TRAQSIM was developed as a next generation model to be the successor to the current CALINE3 and CAL3QHC regulatory models.  The next step in the development of TRAQSIM is to incorporate methods to model the dispersion of particulate matter (PM) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).

Several models have been developed that handle complex urban [[meteorology]] resulting from [[urban canyon]]s and highway configurations. The earliest such model development (1968-1970) was by the Air Pollution Control Office of the U.S. EPA in conjunction with New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Fensterstock, J.C. et al, "Reduction of air pollution potential through environmental planning", JAPCA, Vol.21,No.7, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The model was successfully applied to the [[Spadina Expressway]] in Toronto by Jack Fensterstock of the New York City Department of Air Resources,.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, 1971-01-21, James MacKenzie, “Pollution Predicted to be worse than New York’s”, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, 1971-01-22, James MacKenzie, “Monoxide level safe on present Spadina, expert tells OMB”, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the [[Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfhrc.gov/ Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218094317/http://www.tfhrc.gov/ |date=December 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canyon Plume Box model,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfhrc.gov/structur/pubs/02036/intro.htm Canyon Plume Box model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527110011/http://www.tfhrc.gov/structur/pubs/02036/intro.htm |date=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now in version 3 (CPB-3), the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060427072645/http://www.dmu.dk/International/ National Environmental Research Institute] of Denmark's [http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Miljoe-tilstand/3_luft/4_spredningsmodeller/5_ospm/default_en.asp Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM)], and the [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH3-43HK0FJ-K&amp;_user=14684&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2001&amp;_alid=392204409&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=6055&amp;_sort=d&amp;_st=4&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_acct=C000001678&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=14684&amp;md5=f7b2b5a19a190b51ac9930efe57e5442 MICRO-CALGRID] model, which includes photochemistry, allowing for both primary and secondary species to be modeled.

==Recent applications in legal cases==

Recent health literature indicating that residents near major roads face elevated rates of several adverse health outcomes has prompted legal dispute over the responsibility of transportation agencies to use roadway air dispersion models to characterize the impacts of new and expanded roadways, bus terminals, truck stops, and other sources.

Recently, the [[Sierra Club]] of Nevada sued the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] and the [[Federal Highway Administration]] over its failure to assess the impact of the expansion of [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95 in Las Vegas]] on neighborhood air quality.[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm]  The Sierra Club asserted that a supplemental [[Environmental Impact Statement]] should be issued to address emissions of hazardous air pollutants and particulate matter from new motor vehicle traffic.  The plaintiffs asserted that modeling tools were available, including the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s MOBILE6.2 model, the CALINE3 dispersion model, and other relevant models.  The defendants won in the U.S. District Court under Judge Philip Pro, who ruled that the transportation agencies had acted in a manner that was not "arbitrary and capricious," despite the agencies' technical arguments regarding the lack of available modeling tools being contradicted by a number of peer-reviewed studies published in scientific journals (e.g. Korenstein and Piazza, Journal of Environmental Health, 2002). On appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit]], the Appeals Court stayed new construction on the highway pending the court's final decision.  The Sierra Club and the defendants settled out of court, setting up a research program on the air quality impacts of U.S. Route 95 on nearby schools.

A number of other high-profile cases have prompted environmental groups to call for dispersion modeling to be used to assess the air quality impacts of new transportation projects on nearby communities, but to date state transportation agencies and the Federal Highways Administration has claimed that no tools are available, despite models and guidance available through EPA's Support Center for Regulatory Air Models (SCRAM).[http://www.epa.gov/scram001]

Among the more contentious of cases  the Detroit Intermodal Freight Terminal and [[Detroit River International Crossing]] (Michigan, USA), and the expansion of [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70 East in Denver]] (Colorado, USA).

In all of these cases, community-based organizations have asserted that modeling tools are available, but transportation planning agencies have asserted that too much uncertainty exists in all of the steps.  A major concern for community-based organizations has been  transportation agencies' unwillingness to define the level of uncertainty that they are willing to tolerate in air quality analyses, how that compares to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s guideline on air quality models, which addresses uncertainty and accuracy in model use.[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/guide/appw_05.pdf]

The '''Royal College of Chemistry''' ('''RCC''') was a college originally based on [[Oxford Street]] in central [[London]], [[England]]. It operated between 1845 and 1872.

The College was set up to teach practical [[chemistry]]. Many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and [[Robert Peel]]. It was also supported by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]].

The first director was [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]]. [[Frederick Augustus Abel]] studied under von Hofmann. Sir [[William Crookes]], [[Edward Divers]] and [[J. A. R. Newlands]] also attended the college.

The young [[William Henry Perkin]] studied and worked at the college under von Hofmann, but resigned his position after discovering the first [[synthetic dye]], [[mauveine]], in 1856. Perkin's discovery was prompted by his work with von Hofmann on the substance [[aniline]], derived from [[coal tar]], and it was this breakthrough which sparked the synthetic dye industry, a boom which some historians have labelled 'the second [[chemical revolution]]'.

The college was merged into the [[Royal School of Mines]] in 1853. It was the first constituent college of [[Imperial College London]] and  eventually became the Imperial College Chemistry Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | title=Undergraduate Prospectus | work=Department of Chemistry | publisher=[[Imperial College London]] | location=UK | accessdate=30 March 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330221245/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | archivedate=30 March 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''seed orchard''' is an intensively-managed [[plantation]] of specifically arranged trees for the mass production of genetically improved seeds to create plants, or seeds for the establishment of new forests.

==General==
Seed orchards are a common method of mass-multiplication for transferring genetically improved material from breeding populations to production populations (forests) and in this sense are often referred to as "multiplication" populations. A seed orchard is often composed of grafts (vegetative copies) of selected [[genotype]]s, but seedling seed orchards also occur mainly to combine orchard with progeny testing.
Seed orchards are the strong link between breeding programs and plantation establishment. They are designed and managed to produce seeds of superior genetic quality compared to those obtained from seed production areas, seed stands, or unimproved stands.

==Material and connection with breeding population==
In first generation seed orchards, the parents usually are phenotypically-selected trees. In advanced generation seed orchards, the seed orchards are harvesting the benefits generated by [[tree breeding]] and the parents may be selected among the tested clones or families. It is efficient to synchronise the productive live cycle of the seed orchards with the cycle time of the breeding population. In the seed orchard, the trees can be arranged in a design to keep the related individuals or cloned copies apart from each other.
Seed orchards are the delivery vehicle for genetic improvement programs where the trade-off between genetic gain and diversity is the most important concern. The genetic gain of seed orchard crops depends primarily on the genetic superiority of the orchard parents, the gametic contribution to the resultant seed crops, and pollen contamination from outside seed orchards.

==Genetic diversity of seed orchard crops==
[[Seed production and gene diversity]] is an important aspect when using improved materials like seed orchard crops. Seed orchards crops derive generally from a limited number of trees. But if it is a common [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] species much pollen will come from outside the seed orchard and widen the [[genetic diversity]]. The genetic gain of the first generation seed orchards is not great and the seed orchard progenies overlap with unimproved material. Gene diversity of the seed crops is greatly influenced by the relatedness (kinship) among orchard parents, the parental fertility variation, and the pollen contamination.

==Management and practical examples==
Seed orchards are usually managed to obtain sustainable and large crops of seeds of good quality. To achieve this, the following methods are commonly applied: orchards are established on flat surface sites with southern exposure (better conditions for orchard maintenance and for seed production), no stands of the same species in close proximity (avoid strong pollen contamination), sufficient area to produce and be mainly pollinated with their own pollen cloud, cleaning the corridors between the rows, fertilising, and supplemental pollination. The genetic quality of seed orchards can be improved by genetic thinning and selective harvesting.&lt;ref name=prescher2008&gt;Prescher F., Lindgren D. and Karlsson B. 2008. [https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/719822 Genetic thinning of clonal seed orchards using linear deployment may improve both gain and diversity.] ''Forest Ecology and Management'' 254: 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In plantation forestry with [[southern yellow pine]]s in the United States, almost all plants originate from seed orchards and most plantations are planted in family blocks, thus the harvest from each clone is kept separate during seed processing, plant production and plantation.&lt;ref name=mckeand&gt;McKeand, S., et al. 2003. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/jof/2003/00000101/00000003/art00009 Deployment of genetically improved loblolly and slash pine in the South.] ''Journal of Forestry'' 101(3): 32–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent seed orchard research==
* The optimal balance between the effective number of clones (diversity, status number, gene diversity) and genetic gain is achieved by making clonal contributions (number of [[ramet]]s) proportional (linearly dependent) to the genetic value ("linear deployment"). This is dependent on several assumptions, one of them that the contribution to the seed orchard crop is proportional to the number of ramets. But the more ramets the larger the share of the pollen is lost depending on ineffective [[self-pollination]]. But even considering this, the linear deployment is a very good approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Prescher F., Lindgren D. and El-Kassaby Y. 2006. [https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2070630 Is linear deployment of clones optimal under different clonal outcrossing contributions in seed orchards?] ''Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes'' 2:25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that increasing the gain is always accompanied by a loss in effective number of clones, but it has shown that both can be obtained in the same time by genetic thinning using the linear deployment algorithm if applied to some rather unbalanced seed orchards.&lt;ref name=prescher2008/&gt; Relatedness among clones is more critical for diversity than inbreeding.
* The clonal variation in expected seed set has been compiled for 12 adult clonal seed orchards of [[Scots pine]].&lt;ref&gt;Prescher F., et al. 2007.  [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827580701419259 Variation in female fertility in mature ''Pinus sylvestris'' clonal seed orchards.] ''Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research'' 22:280–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The seed set ability is not that drastic among clones as has been shown in other investigations which are probably less relevant for actual seed production of Scots pine.
* The correlations of cone set for Scots pine in a clonal archive was not well correlated with that of the same clones in seed orchards.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren D., Tellalov Y. and Prescher F. 2007. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Meetings/Antalya06/Turkey06LindgrenTellalov.pdf Seed set for Scots pine grafts is difficult to predict.] ''In'': Isik, F. (Ed.) Proceedings of the IUFRO Division 2 Joint Conference: Low Input Breeding and Conservation of Forest Genetic Resources: Antalya, Turkey, 9–13 October 2006. pp. 139–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it does not seem meaningful to increase seed set by choosing clones with a good seed set.
*  As supporting tree breeding make advances, new seed orchards will be genetically better than old ones. This is a relevant factor for the economic lifetime of a seed orchard. Considerations for Swedish Scots pine suggested an economic lifetime of 30 years, which is less than the current lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;El-Kassaby Y., Prescher F. and Lindgren D. 2007. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827580701217752 Advanced generation seed orchards’ turnover as affected by breeding advance, time to sexual maturity, and costs, with special reference to ''Pinus sylvestris'' in Sweden.] ''Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research'' 22:88–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seed orchards for important wind pollinated species start to produce seeds before the seed orchard trees start to produce much pollen. Thus all or most of the pollen parents are outside the seed orchard. Calculations indicates that seed orchard seeds are still to be expected to a superior alternative to older and more mature seed orchards or stand seeds. Advantage of early seeds like absence of selfing or related matings and high diversity are positive factors in the early seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson J. &amp; Lindgren D. 2005. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Meetings/Komi05/proceedings.pdf Using seed orchard seeds with unknown fathers.] ''In'': Fedorkov A. (Ed.) Status, monitoring and targets for breeding programs. Proceedings of the meeting of Nordic forest tree breeders and forest geneticists, Syktyvkar 2005, {{ISBN|5-89606-249-4}}, pp. 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish conifers orchards with tested clones could have 20–25 clones with more ramets from the better and less from the worse so effective ramet number is 15–18. Higher clone number results in unneeded loss of genetic gain. Lower clone numbers can still be better than existing alternatives. For southern pines in United States it may be optimal with half as many clones.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren D. and Prescher F. 2005. [http://daglindgren.upsc.se/Papers/Articles2004-2005/CloneNumberSG05.pdf Optimal clone number for seed orchards with tested clones.] ''Silvae Genetica'' 54: 80–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When forest tree breeding proceeds to advanced generations the candidates to seed orchards will be related and the question to what degree related clones can be tolerated in seed orchards become urgent. Gene diversity seems to be a more important consideration than inbreeding. If the number of candidates have at least eight times as much diversity (status number) as required for the seed orchard relations are not limiting and clones can be deployed as usual but restricting for half and full sibs, but if the candidate population has a lower diversity more sophisticated algorithms are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Danusevicius D. &amp; Lindgren D. 2008.

In [[electronics]], a '''shunt''' is a device which allows [[electric current]] to pass around another point in the [[electrical network|circuit]] by creating a low resistance path.&lt;ref name=Graf68 &gt; Rudolf F. Graf, ''Modern dictionary of Electronics'', Mc-Graw Hill, 1968 Library of Congress 68-13873  ''Shunt'' page 454. &lt;/ref&gt; The term is also widely used in [[photovoltaics]] to describe an unwanted short circuit between the front and back surface contacts of a [[solar cell]], usually caused by [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] damage. The origin of the term is in the verb 'to shunt' meaning to turn away or follow a different path.

{{Wiktionary|shunt}}

==Defective device bypass==

One example is in miniature [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] which are [[series circuit|wired in series]].  When the [[Electrical filament|filament]] burns out in one of the [[incandescent light bulb]]s,  the full line voltage appears across the burnt out bulb. A shunt across the burnt out filament will then short out to bypass the burnt filament and allow the rest of the string to light.  If too many lights burn out however, a shunt will also burn out, requiring the use of a [[multimeter]] to find the point of failure.

==Lightning arrestor==

A [[gas]]-filled tube can also be used as a shunt, particularly in a [[lightning arrestor]].  [[Neon]] and other [[noble gas]]es have a high [[breakdown voltage]], so that normally current will not flow across it.  However, a direct [[lightning]] strike (such as on a [[radio masts and towers|radio tower]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]) will cause the shunt to [[electric arc|arc]] and conduct the massive amount of electricity to [[ground (electricity)|ground]], protecting [[transmitter]]s and other equipment.

Another older form of lightning arrestor employs a simple narrow spark gap, over which an arc will jump when a high voltage is present. While this is a low cost solution, its high triggering voltage offers almost no protection for modern solid-state electronic devices powered by the protected circuit.

==Electrical noise bypass==

[[Capacitor]]s are used as shunts to redirect high-frequency noise to ground before it can propagate to the load or other circuit components.

==Use in electronic filter circuits==
The term shunt is used in [[Electronic filter|filter]] and similar circuits with a [[Ladder network|ladder topology]] to refer to the components connected between the line and common. The term is used in this context to distinguish the shunt components connected between the signal and return lines from the components connected in series along the signal line.  More generally, the term shunt can be used for a component connected in parallel with another. For instance, ''shunt [[M-derived filters|m-derived]] half section'' is a common filter section from the [[image impedance]] method of filter design.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', p66, McGraw-Hill 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diodes as shunts==
Where devices are especially sensitive to reverse polarity of signal or power supply, a [[diode]] may be used to protect the circuit. If connected in series with the circuit it simply prevents reversed current, but if connected in parallel it can shunt the reversed supply, causing a fuse or other current limiting circuit to open.

All semiconductor diodes have a threshold voltage &amp;ndash; typically between ½&amp;nbsp;Volt and 1&amp;nbsp;Volt &amp;ndash; that must be exceeded before significant current will flow through the diode in the normally allowed direction. Two anti-parallel shunt diodes (one to conduct current in each direction) can be used to limit the signal flowing past them to no more than their threshold voltages, in order to protect later components from overload.

==Shunts as circuit protection==

When a circuit must be protected from overvoltage and there are failure modes in the power supply that can produce such overvoltages, the circuit may be protected by a device commonly called a [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar circuit]]. When this device detects an overvoltage it causes a short circuit between the power supply and its return. This will cause both an immediate drop in voltage (protecting the device) and an instantaneous high current which is expected to open a current sensitive device (such as a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]]). This device is called a ''crowbar'' as it is likened to dropping an actual [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] across a set of [[bus bar]]s (exposed electrical conductors).

==Use in current measuring==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ammeter]] --&gt;
[[Image:Shuntresistor50A.jpg|right|thumb|200px|50&amp;nbsp;A shunt resistor]]
An [[ammeter]] shunt allows the measurement of [[electrical current|current]] values too large to be directly measured by a particular ammeter. In this case the '''shunt''', a [[manganin]] [[resistor]] of accurately known [[electrical resistance|resistance]], is placed in parallel with the moving coil [[galvanometer]], thus all of the current to be measured will flow through it. In order not to disrupt the [[electrical circuit|circuit]], the resistance of the shunt is normally very low. The [[voltage]] drop across the shunt is proportional to the current flowing through it and as its resistance is known, a [[voltmeter]] connected across the shunt can be scaled to directly display the current value.&lt;ref name=GE49&gt;''Manual of Electric Instruments'', General Electric, 1949, pages 8-9 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Croft48&gt; Terrell Croft, ''American Electricians' Handbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1948 p. 70 &lt;/ref&gt;

Shunts are rated by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500&amp;nbsp;A, 75&amp;nbsp;mV shunt would have a resistance of 0.15 [[ohm|milliohm]]s, a maximum allowable current of 500 [[ampere|amp]]s and at that current the [[voltage]] drop would be 75 [[millivolt]]s. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50&amp;nbsp;mV, 75&amp;nbsp;mV or 100&amp;nbsp;mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100&amp;nbsp;mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, at which point the derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly.  At 80&amp;nbsp;°C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120&amp;nbsp;°C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140&amp;nbsp;°C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. {{cn|date=April 2018}}
 
If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself.&lt;ref name=GE49/&gt; Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg ([[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are [[Hall effect]] current sensors and [[current transformer]]s (see [[clamp meter]]s). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of such devices are ±0.1% &amp; 0.25% and 0.5%. 

The Thomas-type double manganin walled shunt and MI type (improved Thomas-type design) were used until the 1990s by NIST and other government labs as the legal reference of an ohm until the advent of the [[quantum Hall effect]].  Thomas-type shunts are still used by government and private labs to take very accurate current measurements, as using quantum Hall effect is a time consuming process.  The accuracy of these types of shunts is measured in the ppm and sub-ppm scale of drift per year of set resistance. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Current measurement techniques===

Where the circuit is grounded (earthed) on one side, a current measuring shunt can be inserted either in the ungrounded conductor or in the grounded conductor. A shunt in the ungrounded conductor must be insulated for the full circuit voltage to ground; the measuring instrument must be inherently isolated from ground or must include a resistive voltage divider or an [[isolation amplifier]]  between the relatively high common-mode voltage and lower voltages inside the instrument. A shunt in the grounded conductor may not detect leakage current that bypasses the shunt, but it will not experience high common-mode voltage to ground.  The load is removed from a direct path to ground, which may create problems for control circuitry, result in unwanted emissions, or both.

The '''Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute''' ('''STRI''', {{lang-es|Instituto Smithsonian de Investigaciones Tropicales}}) is the only bureau of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] based outside of the United States, in [[Panama]]. It is dedicated to understanding the past, present and future of tropical ecosystems and their relevance to human welfare. STRI grew out of a small field station established in 1923 on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to become one of the world's leading tropical research organizations. STRI's facilities provide for long-term ecological studies in the tropics and are used by some 1,200 visiting scientists from academic and research institutions around the world every year.

==History==
[[File:Barro Colorado Research.JPG|thumb|right|Barro Colorado Research Station]]
Smithsonian scientists first came to Panama during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] from 1904 to 1914. 
The Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], reached an agreement with [[Federico Boyd]] to conduct a biological inventory of the new Canal Zone in 1910, and this survey was subsequently extended to include all of Panama. Thanks largely to their efforts, the governor of the Canal Zone declared Barro Colorado Island (BCI) a biological reserve in 1923,&lt;ref name="SIA1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=1975 | title=Oral history interview with Charles F. Bennett, Jr., and Anna Carole Bennett, 1975 | work= | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]] | url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217731 | accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the earliest biological reserves in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | title=100 years of the Smithsonian's relationship with Panama | author=Eric Jackson | work=The Panama News | date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=August 8, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060302/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | archivedate=June 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s BCI, in [[Gatun Lake]], became an outdoor laboratory for scientists from U.S. universities and the Smithsonian Institution. By 1940, when BCI was designated the Canal Zone Biological Area (CZBA), more than 300 scientific publications had described the biota of BCI. In the Government Reorganization Act of 1946, BCI became a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) was created in 1966.&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt;

With the establishment of STRI, permanent staff scientists were hired and fellowship programs were initiated to support aspiring tropical biologists. The first director after the name change was [[Martin Humphrey Moynihan]].&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt; A strong relationship with the Republic of Panama was formalized in the [[Panama Canal Treaties]] of 1977, which gradually transferred control of the Canal Zone to Panama. The treaties created the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which included BCI and five surrounding peninsulas, and granted STRI custody of the monument. Panama granted STRI International Mission status in 1985 and, in 1997, the nation extended STRI's custodianship of facilities beyond the culmination of the Panama Canal Treaties in 1999.

STRI's first director after the institute's establishment in 1966 was Martin Humphrey Moynihan. Geographer and scientist Charles F. Bennett, along with his wife, Anna Carole Bennett, participated in STRI during the 1960s, assisting in the organizing of the library, researching and collecting [[microclimate]] data, and studying [[neotropical]] forests. In 1966, Bennett became an honorary Research Associate of STRI.&lt;ref name="SIA1" /&gt; A large collection of papers by STRI researchers at Barro Colorado Island was published as an anthology in 1982, ''The Ecology of a Tropical Rainforest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.

STRI has an average of 350 ongoing research projects and publishes more than 400 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=2016-12-19|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
STRI's research facilities allow staff scientists, fellows and visiting scientists to achieve their research objectives. Most of STRI's staff scientists reside in the tropics and are encouraged to pursue their own research priorities without geographic limitations. The continuity of their long-term programs enables in-depth investigations that attract an elite group of fellows and visitors. Active support for fellows and visitors leverages resources further and attracts more than 1,200 scientists to STRI each year.

==Academic programs==
STRI hosts 10-15 university field courses every year. Participating universities include Princeton, McGill, Northeastern, Wisconsin Green Bay, Yale, Harvard, Ohio State, Arizona State, Marquette, Texas A&amp;M Butler, Cambridge, Dartmouth College and University of Vermont. STRI also runs an intensive field course for Panamanian and Central American undergraduates. Since 1965, STRI has supported some 5,500 fellows and interns of various academic levels, from undergraduate, master and PhD students, to postdoctoral and senior researchers.

==Barro Colorado Nature Monument==
The Barro Colorado Nature Monument includes the 16&amp;nbsp;km² [[Barro Colorado Island]], which is covered with tropical forest and boasts a nearly intact mammal fauna. It also includes 40&amp;nbsp;km² of surrounding mainland peninsulas covered by forests in various stages of succession, serving as a site for manipulative field experiments. The monument adjoins Panama's 220&amp;nbsp;km² [[Soberania National Park]].

With an unparalleled store of background information reflecting almost a century of research in a protected setting, Barro Colorado Island has become a major global center for tropical research.

Barro Colorado is open for public day visits, but advance reservations must be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stri.si.edu/visit/barro-colorado|title=Visit Us at Barro Colorado|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=stri.si.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/panama/the-canal-and-central-panama/review-453607.html|title=Isla Barro Colorado Review &amp;#124; The Canal and Central Panama &amp;#124; Fodor's Travel Guides|date=|publisher=Fodors.com|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other research sites==
Although STRI is based in Panama, research is conducted throughout the tropics. The Smithsonian's Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) network uses standard study protocols to monitor 66 tree plots in 27 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The protocols were developed on BCI in the early 1980s. More than six million individual trees representing 10,000 species are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forestgeo.si.edu|title=ForestGEO|website=ForestGEO|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI's Biological Diversity of Forest Fragments project created experimental forest fragments of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0&amp;nbsp;km² to study the consequences of landscape transformation on forest integrity in the central Amazon region. STRI marine scientists are conducting a global survey of levels of genetic isolation in coral reef organisms.

=== Facilities in Panama City ===

When two [[probability distribution]]s overlap, '''statistical interference''' exists.  Knowledge of the distributions can be used to determine the likelihood that one parameter exceeds another, and by how much.

This technique can be used for dimensioning of mechanical parts, determining when an applied load exceeds the strength of a structure, and in many other situations.   This type of analysis can also be used to estimate the ''probability of failure'' or the ''frequency of failure''.

==Dimensional interference==
[[File:Interference.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Interference of measurement distributions to determine fit of parts]]

Mechanical parts are usually designed to fit precisely together. For example, if a shaft is designed to have a "sliding fit" in a hole, the shaft must be a little smaller than the hole. (Traditional [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] may suggest that all dimensions fall within those intended tolerances.  A [[process capability]] study of actual production, however, may reveal [[normal distribution]]s with long tails.) Both the shaft and hole sizes will usually form normal distributions with some average ([[arithmetic mean]]) and [[standard deviation]].

With two such normal distributions, a distribution of interference can be calculated.  The derived distribution will also be normal, and its average will be equal to the difference between the means of the two base distributions.  The [[variance]] of the derived distribution will be the sum of the variances of the two base distributions.

This derived distribution can be used to determine how often the difference in dimensions will be less than zero (i.e., the shaft cannot fit in the hole), how often the difference will be less than the required sliding gap (the shaft fits, but too tightly), and how often the difference will be greater than the maximum acceptable gap (the shaft fits, but not tightly enough).

==Physical property interference==
[[File:Interference Forces.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Interference of distributions of applied load and strength]]

Physical properties and the conditions of use are also inherently variable.  For example, the applied load (stress) on a mechanical part may vary.  The measured strength of that part (tensile strength, etc.) may also be variable.  The part will break when the stress exceeds the strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

With two normal distributions, the statistical interference may be calculated as above. (This problem is also workable for transformed units such as the [[log-normal distribution]]).  With other distributions, or combinations of different distributions, a [[Monte Carlo method]] or simulation is often the most practical way to quantify the effects of statistical interference.

'''Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor''' ('''THESEUS''') is a [[space telescope]] mission proposal by the [[European Space Agency]] that would study [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[X-ray]]s for investigating the [[early universe]].&lt;ref name='Amati 2018'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04638.pdf The THESEUS space mission concept: science case, design and expected performances].

== Overview ==

THESEUS is a mission concept that would monitor transient events in the high-energy Universe across the whole sky and over the entirety of [[Chronology of the universe|cosmic history]]. In particular, it expects to make a complete census of [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) from the Universe's first billion years, to help understand the life cycle of the first stars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-05-esa-mission-concepts.html#jCp ESA selects three new mission concepts for study]. European Space Agency. Published by ''PhysOrg''. 8 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; THESEUS would provide real-time triggers and accurate locations of the sources, which could also be followed up by other space- or ground-based telescopes operating at complementary wavelengths.

The concept was selected in May 2018 as a finalist to become the fifth Medium-class mission (M5) of the [[Cosmic Vision]] programme by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). The other two finalists are [[SPICA (spacecraft)|SPICA]], an infrared space telescope, and [[EnVision (spacecraft)|''EnVision'']], a Venus orbiter. The winner will be selected in 2021 and it would launch in 2032.&lt;ref name='N Atlas'&gt;[https://newatlas.com/esa-new-space-missions-three/54518/ ESA names space mission concepts in running for Cosmic Vision mission slot]. David Szondy, ''New Atlas''. 7 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Forbes 2018'&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/05/09/new-esa-orbiter-could-explain-why-venus-went-so-wrong/#71e5a6cd5b01 New ESA Orbiter Might Explain Why Venus Went So Wrong]. Bruce Dorminey, ''Forbes''. 8 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The space observatory would study [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) and [[X-ray]]s and their association with the explosive death of massive stars, [[supernova]] shock break-outs, [[black hole]] [[tidal disruption event]]s, and [[magnetar]] flares. This can provide fundamental information on the cosmic star formation rate, the number density and properties of low-mass galaxies, the [[Hydrogen line|neutral hydrogen]] fraction, and the escape fraction of [[ultraviolet]] [[photons]] from galaxies.&lt;ref name='Amati 2018'/&gt;

== Science payload ==

The conceptual payload of THESEUS includes:&lt;ref name='Amati 2018'/&gt;
* Soft X-ray Imager ('''SXI'''), sensitive to 0.3-6 keV is a set of 4 lobster-eye telescopes units, covering a total [[field of view]] (FOV) of 1 sr with source location accuracy &lt;1-2 arcmin.

[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Artist's conception of a [[Terraforming|terraformed]] [[Venus]]. The cloud formations are depicted assuming the planet's rotation has not been accelerated.]]
The '''terraforming of Venus''' is the [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] process of [[Planetary engineering|engineering the global environment]] of the planet [[Venus]] in such a way as to make it suitable for human habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adelman | first1 = Saul | year = 1982 | title = Can Venus Be Transformed into an Earth-Like Planet? | url = | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 3–8 | bibcode = 1982JBIS...35....3A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landis2011" /&gt; [[Terraforming]] Venus was first scholarly proposed by the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] in 1961,&lt;ref name="The Planet Venus"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science| date=1961| title=The Planet Venus| first=Carl| last=Sagan| doi=10.1126/science.133.3456.849| bibcode=1961Sci...133..849S |pmid=17789744| volume=133|issue=3456| pages=849–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Venus in fiction|fictional treatments]], such as ''The Big Rain'' of [[The Psychotechnic League]] by novelist [[Poul Anderson]], preceded it. Adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require at least three major changes to the planet's atmosphere:&lt;ref name="Landis2011" /&gt; Reducing Venus' surface temperature of {{convert|462|C|K F}}, eliminating most of the planet's dense {{convert|9.2|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] [[Atmosphere of Venus|atmosphere]] via removal or conversion to some other form, and the addition of breathable [[oxygen]] to the atmosphere. These three changes are closely interrelated, because Venus' extreme temperature is due to the high pressure of its dense atmosphere, and the [[greenhouse effect]].

==History==
Prior to the early 1960s, the [[atmosphere of Venus]] was believed by astronomers to have an Earth-like temperature. When Venus was understood to have a thick [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with a consequence of a very large [[greenhouse effect]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Venus_Express/Greenhouse_effect_clouds_and_winds Greenhouse effect, clouds and winds]. ''Venus express'' mission, European Space Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; some scientists began to contemplate the idea of altering the atmosphere to make the surface more Earth-like. This hypothetical prospect, known as [[terraforming]], was first proposed by [[Carl Sagan]] in 1961, as a final section of his classic article in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' discussing the atmosphere and greenhouse effect of Venus.&lt;ref name="The Planet Venus"/&gt; Sagan proposed injecting [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria into the Venus atmosphere, which would convert the carbon dioxide into reduced carbon in organic form, thus reducing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the knowledge of Venus' atmosphere was still inexact in 1961, when Sagan made his original proposal for terraforming. Thirty-three years after his original proposal, in his 1994 book ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', Sagan conceded his original proposal for terraforming would not work because the atmosphere of Venus is far denser than was known in 1961:&lt;ref name="PaleBlueDot"&gt;{{cite book| first=Carl| last=Sagan| title=[[Pale Blue Dot (book)]]| date=1994| isbn=0-345-37659-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Here's the fatal flaw: In 1961, I thought the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus was a few bars&amp;nbsp;... We now know it to be 90 bars, so if the scheme worked, the result would be a surface buried in hundreds of meters of fine graphite, and an atmosphere made of 65 bars of almost pure molecular oxygen.  Whether we would first implode under the atmospheric pressure or spontaneously burst into flames in all that oxygen is open to question.  However, long before so much oxygen could build up, the graphite would spontaneously burn back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, short-circuiting the process."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following Sagan's paper, there was little scientific discussion of the concept until a resurgence of interest in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Oberg|Oberg, James E.]] (1981).

==Proposed approaches to terraforming==
A number of approaches to terraforming are reviewed by [[Martyn J. Fogg]] (1995)&lt;ref name="EPE"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| date=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International, Warrendale, PA| isbn=1-56091-609-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Geoffrey A., [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/book.htm "Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments (review)"] (also available [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/universo/terraforming/terraforming05.htm here]) (accessed 25 Dec, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] (2011).&lt;ref name="Landis2011" /&gt;

===Eliminating the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere===

The main problem with Venus today, from a terraformation standpoint, is the very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. The ground level pressure of Venus is {{convert|9.2|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=April 2018}} This also, through the greenhouse effect, causes the temperature on the surface to be several hundred degrees too warm for any known lifeforms. Basically, all approaches to the terraforming of Venus include somehow getting rid of practically all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 

====Biological approaches====
The method proposed in 1961 by Carl Sagan involves the use of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] bacteria to [[Carbon fixation|fix carbon]] into [[organic compound]]s.&lt;ref name="The Planet Venus"/&gt; Although this method is still proposed&lt;ref name="berry1984" /&gt; in discussions of Venus terraforming, later discoveries showed that biological means alone would not be successful.&lt;ref name="fogg1987"&gt;Fogg, M. J. (1987). "The Terraforming of Venus," ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 40'', pp. 551–564. ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987JBIS...40..551F abstract]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties include the fact that the production of organic molecules from carbon dioxide requires  hydrogen, which is very rare on Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Beatty, J (ed.) (1999) ''The New Solar System'', p176, CUP, {{ISBN|0-933346-86-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Venus lacks a protective [[magnetosphere]], the upper atmosphere is exposed to direct erosion by the [[solar wind]] and has lost most of its original hydrogen to space. And, as Sagan noted, any carbon that was bound up in organic molecules would quickly be converted to carbon dioxide again by the hot surface environment. Venus would not begin to cool down until after most of the carbon dioxide has already been removed.

Although it is generally conceded that Venus could not be terraformed by introduction of photosynthetic biota alone, use of photosynthetic organisms to produce oxygen in the atmosphere continues to be a component of other proposed methods of terraforming.{{CN|date=April 2018}}

====Capture in carbonates====

On Earth nearly all carbon is sequestered in the form of [[carbonate minerals]] or in different stages of the [[carbon cycle]], while very little is present in the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. On Venus, the situation is the opposite. Practically all of the carbon is present in the atmosphere, while very little is sequestered in the lithosphere.{{CN|date=April 2018}} Many approaches to terraforming therefore focus on getting rid of carbon dioxide by chemical reactions trapping and stabilising it in the form of carbonate minerals.

Modelling by astrobiologists Mark Bullock and [[David Grinspoon]] &lt;ref name="The Stability of Climate on Venus"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Grinspoon | first2 = D.G. | year = 1996 | title = The Stability of Climate on Venus | url = http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bullock/Homedocs/JGR1996.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040920145614/http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bullock/Homedocs/JGR1996.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2004-09-20 | format = PDF | journal = J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 101 | issue =  | pages = 7521–7529 | bibcode = 1996JGR...101.7521B | doi = 10.1029/95JE03862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Venus' atmospheric evolution suggests that the [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the current 92 bar atmosphere and existing surface minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium oxides is quite unstable, and that the latter could serve as a sink of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide through conversion to carbonates. If these surface minerals were fully converted and saturated, then the atmospheric pressure would decline and the planet would cool somewhat. One of the possible end states modelled by Bullock and Grinspoon was a {{convert|43|bar|psi}} atmosphere and {{convert|400|K|C}} surface temperature. To convert the rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a larger portion of the crust would have to be artificially exposed to the atmosphere to allow more extensive carbonate conversion. In 1989, Alexander G. Smith proposed that Venus could be terraformed by lithosphere overturn, allowing crust to be converted into carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Alexander G | year = 1989 | title = Transforming Venus by Induced Overturn | url = | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 571–576 | bibcode = 1989JBIS...42..571S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Landis 2011 calculated that it would require the involvement of the entire surface crust down to a depth of over 1&amp;nbsp;km to produce enough rock surface area to convert enough of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Landis2011" /&gt;

Natural formation of [[carbonate rock]] from minerals and carbon dioxide is a very slow process. Recent research into sequestering carbon dioxide into carbonate minerals in the context of mitigating global warming on Earth however points out that this process can be considerably accelerated (from hundreds or thousands of years to just 75 days) through the use of catalysts such as [[polystyrene]] [[microspheres]].&lt;ref&gt;https://phys.org/news/2018-08-scientists-mineral-co2-atmosphere.html&lt;/ref&gt; It could therefore be theorised that similar technologies might also be used in the context of terraformation on Venus. It can also be noted that the chemical reaction that converts minerals and carbon dioxide into carbonates is [[exothermic]], in essence producing more energy than is consumed by the reaction. This opens up the possibility of creating self-reinforcing conversion processes with potential for exponential growth of the conversion rate until most of the atmospheric carbon dioxide can be converted.

Bombardment of Venus with refined [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] from off-world could also [[Carbon sink|sequester carbon dioxide]] in the form of [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] and [[magnesium carbonate]]s. About 8{{e|20}} kg of calcium or 5{{e|20}} kg of magnesium would be required to convert all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which would entail a great deal of mining and mineral refining (perhaps on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] which is notably mineral rich).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space]]|first=Stephen L.|last= Gillett|chapter=Inward Ho!|pages=78–84|editor=Stanley Schmidt|editor2=Robert Zubrin|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=1996|isbn=0-471-13561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8{{e|20}} kg is a few times the mass of the asteroid [[4 Vesta]] (more than {{convert|500|km}} in diameter).

====Injection into volcanic basalt rock====
Research projects in [[Iceland]] and [[Washington (state)]] have recently shown that potentially large amounts of carbon dioxide could be removed from the atmosphere by high-pressure injection into subsurface porous basalt formations, where carbon dioxide is rapidly transformed into solid inert minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gislason |first1=Sigurdur |title=A brief history of CarbFix: Challenges and victories of the project's pilot phase |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610218301462 |publisher=Energy Procedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/uh-research/here/2018-here-program/2018heredocuments/zeliskoseminarmaterials/carbonstorage_5_16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

predict that one cubic meter of porous basalt has the potential to sequester 47 kilograms of injected carbon dioxide. According to these estimates a volume of about 9.86 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of basalt rock would be needed to sequester all the carbon dioxide in the Venusian atmosphere. This is equal to the entire crust of Venus down to a depth of about 21.4 kilometers. Another study&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69ee/deaa5f8171918db6bab0eb46494e4516c257.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that under optimal conditions, on average, 1 cubic meter of basalt rock can sequester 260 kg of carbon dioxide. Venus's crust appears to be {{convert|70|km|mi}} thick and the planet is dominated by volcanic features. The surface is about 90% [[basalt]], and about 65% consists of a mosaic of volcanic [[lava]] plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=D.L. Bindschadler | year = 1995 | url = http://www.agu.org/journals/rg/rg9504S/95RG00281/index.html | title = Magellan: A new view of Venus' geology and geophysics | publisher = American Geophysical Union | accessdate = 2007-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There should therefore be ample volumes of basalt rock strata on the planet with very promising potential for carbon dioxide sequestration.

Recent research has also demonstrated that under the high temperature and high pressure conditions in the [[mantle]], [[silicon dioxide]], the most abundant mineral in the mantle (on Earth and probably also on Venus) can form carbonates that are stable under these conditions. This opens up the possibility of carbon dioxide sequestration in the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=M.

====Introduction of hydrogen====
According to Birch,&lt;ref name="Terraforming Venus Quickly"/&gt; bombarding Venus with hydrogen and reacting it with carbon dioxide could produce elemental carbon ([[graphite]]) and water by the [[Bosch reaction]]. It would take about 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; kg of [[hydrogen]] to convert the whole Venusian atmosphere,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} and such a large amount of hydrogen could be obtained from the [[gas giant]]s or their moons' ice. Another possible source of hydrogen could be somehow extracting it from possible reservoirs in the interior of the planet itself. According to some researchers, the Earth's mantle and/or core might hold large quantities of hydrogen left there since the original formation of Earth from the [[Nebular hypothesis|nebular cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500802|title=Constraints on Earth’s inner core composition inferred from measurements of the sound velocity of hcp-iron in extreme conditions|first1=Tatsuya|last1=Sakamaki|first2=Eiji|last2=Ohtani|first3=Hiroshi|last3=Fukui|first4=Seiji|last4=Kamada|first5=Suguru|last5=Takahashi|first6=Takanori|last6=Sakairi|first7=Akihiro|last7=Takahata|first8=Takeshi|last8=Sakai|first9=Satoshi|last9=Tsutsui|first10=Daisuke|last10=Ishikawa|first11=Rei|last11=Shiraishi|first12=Yusuke|last12=Seto|first13=Taku|last13=Tsuchiya|first14=Alfred Q. R.|last14=Baron|date=1 February 2016|publisher=|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1500802|via=advances.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500802|bibcode=2016SciA....2E0802S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2014/028845.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the original formation and inner structure of Earth and Venus are generally believed to be somewhat similar, the same might be true for Venus.

Iron aerosol in the atmosphere will also be required for the reaction to work, and iron can come from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], asteroids, or the [[Moon]]. (Loss of hydrogen due to the [[solar wind]] is unlikely to be significant on the timescale of terraforming.) Due to the planet's relatively flat surface, this water would cover about 80% of the surface, compared to 70% for Earth, even though it would amount to only roughly 10% of the water found on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The remaining atmosphere, at around 3 bars (about three times that of Earth), would mainly be composed of nitrogen, some of which will dissolve into the new oceans of water, reducing atmospheric pressure further, in accordance with [[Henry's law]]. To bring down the pressure even more, hydrogen could also be fixated into [[nitrates]].

===Direct removal of atmosphere===
The thinning of the Venerian atmosphere could be attempted by a variety of methods, possibly in combination. Directly lifting atmospheric gas from Venus into space would probably prove difficult. Venus has sufficiently high escape velocity to make blasting it away with asteroid impacts impractical. [[James B. Pollack|Pollack]] and [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] calculated in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pollack, J.B.|author2=Sagan, C.|authorlink1=Planetary Engineering|editor1-last=Lewis|editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Matthews|editor2-first=M.|title=Resources of Near-Earth Space|date=1994|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|location=Tucson|pages=921–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; that an impactor of 700&amp;nbsp;km diameter striking Venus at greater than 20&amp;nbsp;km/s, would eject all the atmosphere above the horizon as seen from the point of impact, but because this is less than a thousandth of the total atmosphere and there would be diminishing returns as the atmosphere's density decreases, a very great number of such giant impactors would be required. Landis calculated&lt;ref name="Landis2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landis|first1=Geoffrey|title=Terraforming Venus: A Challenging Project for Future Colonization|year=2011|URL= https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SCTC/Shared%20Documents/Terraforming-Venus_AIAA_Space2011.pdf|doi=10.2514/6.2011-7215}} Paper AIAA-2011-7215, AIAA Space 2011 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach CA, Sept. 26–29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that to lower the pressure from 92 bar to 1 bar would require a minimum of 2,000 impacts, even if the efficiency of atmosphere removal was perfect. Smaller objects would not work, either, because more would be required. The violence of the bombardment could well result in significant outgassing that would replace removed atmosphere. Most of the ejected atmosphere would go into solar orbit near Venus, and, without further intervention, could be captured by the Venerian gravitational field and become part of the atmosphere once again.

Removal of atmospheric gas in a more controlled manner could also prove difficult. Venus' extremely slow rotation means that [[space elevator]]s would be very difficult to construct because the planet's [[geostationary orbit]] lies an impractical distance above the surface, and the very thick atmosphere to be removed makes [[mass driver]]s useless for removing payloads from the planet's surface. Possible workarounds include placing [[mass driver]]s on high-altitude balloons or balloon-supported towers extending above the bulk of the atmosphere, using [[space fountain]]s, or [[Tether propulsion|rotovators]].

In addition, if the density of the atmosphere (and corresponding greenhouse effect) were dramatically reduced, the surface temperature (now effectively constant) would probably vary widely between day side and night side. Another side effect to atmospheric-density reduction could be the creation of zones of dramatic weather activity or storms at the terminator because large volumes of atmosphere would undergo rapid heating or cooling.

===Cooling planet by solar shades===
Venus receives about twice the sunlight that Earth does, which is thought to have contributed to its [[runaway greenhouse effect]]. One means of terraforming Venus could involve reducing the [[insolation]] at Venus' surface to prevent the planet from heating up again.

====Space-based====
[[Solar shade]]s could be used to reduce the total insolation&lt;!--This is spelled correctly, so don't change it--&gt; received by Venus, cooling the planet somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization|date=1999| first=Robert|last=Zubrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shade placed in the Sun–Venus {{L1}} [[Lagrangian point]] also would serve to block the [[solar wind]], removing the radiation exposure problem on Venus.

A suitably large solar shade would be four times the diameter of Venus itself if at the {{L1}} point. This would necessitate construction in space. There would also be the difficulty of balancing a thin-film shade perpendicular to the Sun's rays at the Sun–Venus Lagrangian point with the incoming [[radiation pressure]], which would tend to turn the shade into a huge [[solar sail]]. If the shade were simply left at the {{L1}} point, the pressure would add force to the sunward side and the shade would accelerate and drift out of orbit. The shade could instead be positioned nearer to the sun, using the solar pressure to balance the gravitational forces, in practice becoming a [[statite]].

Other modifications to the {{L1}} solar shade design have also been suggested to solve the solar-sail problem. One suggested method is to use [[polar orbit|polar-orbiting]], solar-synchronous mirrors that reflect light toward the back of the sunshade, from the non-sunward side of Venus. Photon pressure would push the support mirrors to an angle of 30 degrees away from the sunward side.&lt;ref name="EPE"/&gt;

[[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] proposed&lt;ref name="Terraforming Venus Quickly"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]| date=1991| title=Terraforming Venus Quickly| first=Paul| last=Birch| url=http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/TerraformingVenusQuickly.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a slatted system of mirrors near the {{L1}} point between Venus and the Sun. The shade's panels would not be perpendicular to the Sun's rays, but instead at an angle of 30 degrees, such that the reflected light would strike the next panel, negating the photon pressure. Each successive row of panels would be +/- 1 degree off the 30-degree deflection angle, causing the reflected light to be skewed 4 degrees from striking Venus.

Solar shades could also serve as solar power generators. Space-based solar shade techniques, and thin-film solar sails in general, are only in an early stage of development. The vast sizes require a quantity of material that is many orders of magnitude greater than any human-made object that has ever been brought into space or constructed in space.

====Atmospheric or surface-based====
{{see also|Colonization of Venus#Aerostat habitats and floating cities}}
Venus could also be cooled by placing reflectors in the atmosphere. Reflective balloons floating in the upper atmosphere could create shade. The number and/or size of the balloons would necessarily be great. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] has suggested&lt;ref name="Landis2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landis |first=Geoffrey A. |date=Feb 2–6, 2003 |title=Colonization of Venus |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APCPCS000654000001001193000001 |journal=Conference on Human Space Exploration, Space Technology &amp; Applications International Forum, Albuquerque NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if enough floating cities were built, they could form a solar shield around the planet, and could simultaneously be used to process the atmosphere into a more desirable form, thus combining the solar shield theory and the atmospheric processing theory with a scalable technology that would immediately provide living space in the Venusian atmosphere. If made from [[carbon nanotube]]s or [[graphene]] (a sheet-like carbon [[allotrope]]), then the major structural materials can be produced using carbon dioxide gathered ''in situ'' from the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The recently synthesised [[amorphous carbonia]] might prove a useful structural material if it can be quenched to Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) conditions, perhaps in a mixture with regular [[silica]] glass. According to Birch's analysis, such colonies and materials would provide an immediate economic return from colonizing Venus, funding further terraforming efforts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Increasing the planet's [[albedo]] by deploying light-colored or reflective material on the surface (or at any level below the cloud tops) would not be useful, because the Venerian surface is already completely enshrouded by clouds, and almost no sunlight reaches the surface. Thus, it would be unlikely to be able to reflect more light than Venus' already-reflective clouds, with [[Bond albedo]] of 0.77.&lt;ref&gt;National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html Venus Fact Sheet] (retrieved 25 April 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination of solar shades and atmospheric condensation===
Birch proposed that solar shades could be used to not merely cool the planet but that this could be used to reduce atmospheric pressure as well, by the process of freezing of the carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="Terraforming Venus Quickly"/&gt; This requires Venus's temperature to be reduced, first to the [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefaction]] point, requiring a temperature less than {{convert|304|K|C F}} and partial pressures of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to bring the atmospheric pressure down to 73.8 bar ([[carbon dioxide]]'s [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]); and from there reducing the temperature below {{convert|217|K|C F}} (carbon dioxide's [[triple point]]). Below that temperature, freezing of atmospheric carbon dioxide into [[dry ice]] will cause it to [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposit]] onto the surface. He then proposed that the frozen CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be buried and maintained in that condition by pressure, or even shipped off-world (perhaps to provide greenhouse gas needed for [[Terraforming of Mars|terraforming]] of [[Mars]] or the moons of [[Jupiter]]). After this process was complete, the shades could be removed or [[solar mirror|solettas]] added, allowing the planet to partially warm again to temperatures comfortable for Earth life. A source of [[hydrogen]] or [[water]] would still be needed, and some of the remaining 3.5 bar of atmospheric [[nitrogen]] would need to be fixed into the soil. Birch suggests disrupting an icy moon of Saturn, for example [[Hyperion (moon)]] and bombarding Venus with its fragments.

===Cooling planet by heat pipes, atmospheric vortex engines or radiative cooling===

Paul Birch suggests that, in addition to cooling the planet with a sunshade in L1, "heat pipes" could be built on the planet to accelerate the cooling. The proposed mechanism would transport heat from the surface to colder regions higher up in the atmosphere, similar to a [[solar updraft tower]], thereby facilitating radiation of excess heat out into space.&lt;ref name="Terraforming Venus Quickly"/&gt; A newly proposed variation of this technology is the atmospheric [[vortex engine]], where in stead of physical chimney pipes, the atmospheric updraft is achieved through the creation of a vortex, similar to a stationary tornado. In addition to this method being less material intensive and potentially more cost effective, this process also produces a net surplus of energy, which could be utilised to power venusian colonies or other aspects of the terraforming effort, while simultaneously contributing to speeding up the cooling of the planet. Another method to cool down the planet could be with the use of [[radiative cooling]]. This technology could utilise the fact that in certain wavelenghts, [[thermal radiation]] from the lower atmosphere of Venus can "escape" to space through partially transparent atmospheric “windows” – spectral gaps between strong CO2 and H2O absorption bands in the near [[infrared]] range (0.8–2.4 μm). The outgoing thermal radiation is wavelength dependent and varies from the very surface at 1 μm to ~35 km at 2.3 μm.&lt;ref&gt;http://lasp.colorado.edu/~espoclass/ASTR_5835_2015_Readings_Notes/Titov_Et_Al-EVTP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanophotonics]] and construction of [[metamaterials]] opens up new possibilities to tailor the emittance spectrum of a surface via properly designing periodic nano/micro-structures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/nanoph.ahead-of-print/nanoph-2017-0020/www.degruyter.com/view/j/nanoph.ahead-of-print/nanoph-2017-0020/nanoph-2017-0020.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been proposals of a device named a "emissive energy harvester" that can transfer heat to space through radiative cooling and convert part of the heat flow into surplus energy&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes SJ, Blanchard R, Capasso F. Harvesting renewable energy from Earth’s mid-infrared emissions. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2014;111:3927–32.&lt;/ref&gt;, opening up possibilities of a self replicating system that could exponentially cool the planet.

===Artificial mountains===

As an alternative to changing the atmosphere of Venus, it has been proposed that a large artificial mountain, dubbed the "Venusian [[Tower of Babel]]", could be built on the surface of Venus that would reach up to {{convert|31|mi|km|0|disp=flip}} into the atmosphere where the temperature and pressure conditions are similar to Earth and where a colony could be built on the peak of this artificial mountain. Such a structure could be built using autonomous robotic [[bulldozer]]s and [[excavator]]s that have been hardened against the extreme temperature and pressure of the Venus atmosphere. Such robotic machines would be covered in a layer of heat and pressure shielding ceramics, with internal helium-based heat pumps inside of the machines to cool both an internal nuclear power plant and to keep the internal electronics and motor actuators of the machine cooled to with in operating temperature. Such a machine could be designed to operate for years without external intervention for the purpose of building colossal mountains on Venus to serve as islands of colonization in the skies of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Multiplanetary Society: A New Approach to Terraforming Venus, vol. 12. March 2018, Author WPM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of water==
Since Venus only has a fraction of the water on earth (less than half the earths water content in the atmosphere, and none on the surface)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.universetoday.com/36291/is-there-water-on-venus/&lt;/ref&gt;, water would have to be introduced either by the aforementioned method of introduction of hydrogen, or from some other extraplanetary source.

===Capture of ice moon===
Paul Birch suggests the possibility of colliding Venus with one of the ice moons from the outer solar systems&lt;ref&gt;https://orionsarm.com/fm_store/TerraformingVenusQuickly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, thereby bringing in all the water needed for terraformation in one go. This could be achieved through gravity assisted capture of for example Saturn's moons [[Enceladus (moon)]] and [[Hyperion (moon)]] or Uranus' moon [[Miranda (moon)]]. Simply changing the velocity enough of these moons to move them from their current orbit and enable gravity assisted transport to Venus would require large amounts of energy. However, through complex [[gravity assist]]ed chain reactions the propulsion requirements could be reduced by several orders of magnitude. As Birch puts it "Theoretically one could flick a pebble in to the asteroid belt and end up dumping Mars into the Sun"&lt;ref&gt;https://orionsarm.com/fm_store/TerraformingVenusQuickly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Altering day–night cycle==
Venus rotates once every 243 Earth days—by far the slowest rotation period of any known object in the Solar System. A Venusian sidereal day thus lasts more than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). However, the length of a [[solar day]] on Venus is significantly shorter than the [[sidereal day]]; to an observer on the surface of Venus, the time from one sunrise to the next would be 116.75 days. Therefore, the slow Venerian rotation rate would result in extremely long days and nights, similar to the day-night cycles in the polar regions of earth, only shorter. The slow rotation might also account for the lack of a significant magnetic field.

===Arguments for keeping the current day-night cycle unchanged===
It has until recently been assumed that the rotation rate or day-night cycle of Venus would have to be increased for successful terraformation to be achieved. More recent research has, however, shown that the current slow rotation rate of Venus is not at all detrimental to the planet's capability to support an Earth-like climate. Rather, the slow rotation rate would, given an Earth-like atmosphere, enable the formation of thick cloud layers on the side of the planet facing the sun. This in turn would raise planetary albedo and act to cool the global temperature to Earth-like levels, despite the greater proximity to the Sun. According to calculations, maximum temperatures would be just around 35&amp;nbsp;°C, given an Earth-like atmosphere.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4992], 
STRONG DEPENDENCE OF THE INNER EDGE OF THE HABITABLE ZONE ON PLANETARY ROTATION RATE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/2016GL069790 | volume=43 | title=Was Venus the first habitable world of our solar system? | year=2016 | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=8376–8383 | last1 = Way | first1 = M. J.| arxiv=1608.00706 | bibcode=2016GeoRL..43.8376W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speeding up the rotation rate would therefore be both impractical and detrimental to the terraforming effort. A terraformed Venus with the current slow rotation would result in a global climate with "day" and "night" periods each about 58 days long, resembling the seasons at higher latitudes on Earth. The "day" would resemble a short summer with a warm, humid climate, a heavy overcast sky and ample rainfall. The "night" would resemble a short winter with quite cold temperature and snowfall. There would be periods with more temperate climate and clear weather at sunrise and sunset resembling a "spring" and "autumn".&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt;

===Space mirrors===
One proposal to compensate for the rotation rate is a system of orbiting solar mirrors which might be used to provide sunlight to the nightside of Venus and possibly shade to the dayside surface. In addition to his suggestion of slatted system of mirrors near the {{L1}} point between Venus and the Sun, [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] has proposed a rotating soletta mirror in a [[polar orbit]], which would produce a 24-hour light cycle.&lt;ref name="Terraforming Venus Quickly"/&gt;

===Changing rotation speed===
If increasing the rotation speed of the planet would be desired (despite the above-mentioned potentially positive climatic effects of the current rotational speed), it would require energy of a magnitude many orders greater than the construction of orbiting solar mirrors, or even than the removal of the Venerian atmosphere. Birch calculates that increasing the rotation of Venus to an Earth-like solar cycle would require about 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; Joules&lt;ref name="Birch_1993" /&gt; (50 billion petawatt-hours).

Scientific research suggests that close flybys of asteroids or cometary bodies larger than 100 kilometres (60 mi) across could be used to move a planet in its orbit, or increase the speed of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/02/05/earth.move/ Astronomers hatch plan to move Earth's orbit from warming sun], CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt; The energy required to do this is large. In his book on terraforming, one of the concepts Fogg discusses is to increase the spin of Venus using three quadrillion objects circulating between Venus and the Sun every 2 hours, each traveling at 10% of the speed of light.&lt;ref name="EPE"/&gt;

[[G. David Nordley]] has suggested, in fiction,&lt;ref name="The Snows of Venus"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact|date=May 1991|title=The Snows of Venus|first=Gerald David|last=Nordley}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Venus might be spun up to a day length of 30 Earth days by exporting the atmosphere of Venus into space via [[mass driver]]s. A proposal by Birch involves the use of dynamic compression members to transfer energy and momentum via high-velocity mass streams to a band around the equator of Venus. He calculated that a sufficiently high-velocity mass stream, at about 10% of the speed of light, could give Venus a day of 24 hours in 30 years.&lt;ref name="Birch_1993"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=1993|title=How to Spin a Planet|url=http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/SpinAPlanet.pdf|first=Paul|last=Birch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating an artificial magnetosphere==
One key aspect of terraforming Venus is to protect the new atmosphere from the solar wind, so as to avoid the loss of hydrogen which likely created the current runaway greenhouse effect. Since Venus (like Mars, but unlike Earth) lacks a magnetic field some scientists hypothesize (in the context of terraforming on Mars) that creating a planet-wide artificial magnetosphere would be helpful in resolving this issue. According to two NIFS Japanese scientists, it is feasible to do that with current technology by building a system of refrigerated latitudinal superconducting rings, each carrying a sufficient amount of [[direct current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/NIFS-886.pdf |format=PDF |title=Feasibility of Artificial Geomagnetic Field Generation by a Superconducting Ring Network |last= Motojima |first=Osamu |last2= Yanagi |first2=Nagato |work=National Institute for Fusion Science (Japan) |date=May 2008 |accessdate=2016-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same report, it is claimed that the economic impact of the system can be minimized by using it also as a planetary energy transfer and storage system (SMES).
Another study proposes the possibility of deployment of a [[magnetic dipole]] shield at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] [[Lagrange point]], thereby creating an artificial magnetosphere that would protect the whole planet from solar wind and radiation.&lt;ref name="green2017"&gt;{{cite conference |url = http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/V2050/pdf/8250.pdf |title = A Future Mars Environment for Science and Exploration |last1 = Green |first1 = J.L. |last2 = Hollingsworth |first2 = J. |conference = Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Railway Educational Bureau can trace its roots back to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. Union Pacific's president, [[Edward Henry Harriman]] hired D. C. Buell to develop training materials for the railroad. Buell was later appointed the Director of Union Pacific's Educational Bureau of Information. Within a few years Buell and the Union Pacific realized other railroads could benefit by the training programs it developed. The division was spun off as The Railway Educational Bureau and Buell later became the owner. The Railway Educational Bureau was purchased from the Buell estate by [[Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation]] in 1968.

'''''The Wealthy Barber''''', full title (''The Wealthy Barber: The Common Sense Guide to Successful Financial Planning'') is a [[financial planning]] book franchise by [[Canadian]] author [[David Barr Chilton|David Chilton]].  The first book in the series was in the [[business fable]] genre, using the story of fictional characters to convey financial advice.

==Plot summary==

The book is structured around a story of three people in their late 20s visiting Roy, the title character, for lessons in financial planning. Each chapter of the book describes a different visit and a different element of financial planning. Each month along with their lessons the three students are required to start carrying out the actions prescribed by Roy. In addition to these individuals, Roy also shares his financial knowledge with the customers of his barber shop.

The story is set primarily in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], where Roy has been operating a barber shop for several decades. As a young man, Roy had planned to become a lawyer, but those plans are derailed.  He ends up taking over his father's barber shop. Worried about money, Roy visits Mr. White, one of the town's wealthiest men, and asks for advice on financial planning. This advice paves the way for Roy's accumulating wealth.

The basis of the book is Roy's advice to "save 10 per cent of all that you earn and invest it for long-term growth."  In that, it draws from the advice first set forth in [[The Richest Man in Babylon (book)|The Richest Man in Babylon]].  Subsequent chapters discuss wills and life insurance, [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan|RRSP]]s, buying a home, income tax and saving and spending.

Roy (and thus Chilton) is not as harshly anti-debt as some other authors, like [[Dave Ramsey]].  However Roy does advise that extra money should go to pay off debt, and that credit cards are "[[anathema]]" to well-run personal finances.  Roy does believe that if you are investing 10% and maxing out your RRSP, day-to-day spending doesn't matter too much to your overall financial picture.

==Main characters==

Dave is an expecting father who realizes he is not financially prepared. His worries lead him to seek financial advice from the local barber.

Cathy is already rich but relates to the audience members who don’t necessarily understand the market and how it works, thus do not generally invest their earnings.

Roy, the barber, poses as the financial expert who has become wealthy simply by being wary of his money and intelligently spending, saving and investing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/01/20/review-the-wealthy-barber/ |title= Review: The Wealthy Barber |date= January 20, 2007 |publisher= The Simple Dollar |first= Trent |last= Hamm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Wealthy Barber Returns''==

===Summary===

In the sequel, '''''The Wealthy Barber Returns''''' (full title ''The Wealthy Barber Returns: Significantly Older and Marginally Wiser, David Chilton Offers His Unique Perspectives on the World of Money''), Chilton dispenses with the device of characters, representing his advice this time in his own voice.  The book is divided into 54 short chapters,  dispensing advice on miscellaneous topics in savings and investments, with a particular focus on avoiding reckless spending behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/the-wealthy-barber-returns/article1362752/ |title= The Wealthy Barber Returns |first= Rob |last= Carrick |publisher= The Globe and Mail |date= September 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea is to accept that one cannot have everything and avoid impulse buying by removing temptations which trigger overspending. This may be achieved through analysis and modification of one's personal behaviour (if you overspend on clothes, stop going to the mall and reading fashion blogs), and avoiding bad debt in the form of credit cards which carry very high interest charges, though some debt may be necessary (mortgages for example).  Ultimately, wealth depends more on savings than income. Chilton's bottom line, which is emphasized in his first book as well, is that we should all save 10-15% of our earnings.

A '''thermal blanket''' is a device used in thermal desorption to clean soil contamination. The primary function of a thermal blanket is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325&amp;nbsp;°C and as high as 900 °C&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contaminants in the Subsurface: Source Zone Assessment and Remediation|last=National Research council|first=|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2004|isbn=0309546648|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so that they break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with volatilized contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants. Aside from evaporation and volatilization, the contaminants may also be removed from the soil through other mechanisms such as [[steam distillation]], [[pyrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], and other [[Chemical reaction|chemical reactions]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wiley's Remediation Technologies Handbook: Major Contaminant Chemicals and Chemical Groups|last=Lehr|first=Jay|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0471455998 |doi=10.1002/0471655473 |location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=1042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their placement, the thermal blanket can only be used in shallow areas, which is around 1 meter. The process can take more than 24 hours to treat 6 inches of soil and up to 4 days for contaminated areas with depths of 12 to 18 inches.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analysis of selected enhancements for soil vapor extraction|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|first=|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1997|isbn=9781428903609|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=7-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep contamination (contamination at depths greater than 1 meter) is handled using a similar method but with a deep penetrating heat source.  This is commonly referred to as an [[in situ thermal desorption]] (ISTD) thermal well and it uses heater elements that consist of nichrome wires in a ceramic insulator. Like the thermal blankets, the heating temperature could reach as high as 900 °C, heating adjacent regions through heat conduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vacuum is also applied to withdraw broken contaminants.

==Concerns==
It is reported that the application of the thermal blanket is limited&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and this could be attributed to a number of concerns. For example, as a contaminant becomes heated, it may leak outside of the area of the thermal blanket.  Therefore, the blanket must completely cover the contaminated area and have a strong enough vacuum to prohibit the spread of contamination. Incomplete destruction of contaminants may also lead to the introduction of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[furans]] into the air.

The thermal blanket method has not been effectively tested on organic contaminants. The technology is presently commercially available. [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Technology Ventures, Inc., for instance, has developed its own ISTD thermal blanket solution that can treat or remove contaminants on near-surface soil or pavements without excavation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;!--By English typography, the letter "v" in "von" should never be in uppercase except in titles or at the beginning of a sentence. See the disambiguation page [[Von Neumann]] and you will see that every article uses a lowercase "v".--&gt;
[[File:Von Neumann Architecture.svg|thumb|Von Neumann architecture scheme]]

The '''von Neumann architecture'''—also known as the '''von Neumann model''' or '''Princeton architecture'''—is a [[computer architecture]] based on a 1945 description by the mathematician and physicist [[John von Neumann]] and others in the ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''.&lt;ref name ="FirstDraftReport" /&gt; That document describes a design architecture for an electronic [[digital computer]] with
* A [[Central processing unit|processing unit]] that contains an [[arithmetic logic unit]] and [[processor register]]s
* A [[control unit]] that contains an [[instruction register]] and [[program counter]]
* [[Computer memory|Memory]] that stores [[Data (computing)|data]] and [[Instruction set|instructions]]
* External [[mass storage]]
* [[Input and output]] mechanisms&lt;ref name="FirstDraftReport"&gt;{{Citation |author-last=von Neumann |author-first=John |author-link=John von Neumann |title=First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC |date=1945 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf |access-date=2011-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314123032/http://qss.stanford.edu/~godfrey/vonNeumann/vnedvac.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GanesanCh4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganesan|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word has evolved to mean any [[stored-program computer]] in which an [[instruction fetch]] and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common [[Bus (computing)|bus]]. This is referred to as the [[#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] and often limits the performance of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Markgraf |author-first=Joey D. |title=The Von Neumann Bottleneck |date=2007 |url=http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212205159/http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a [[Harvard architecture]] machine—which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and [[Memory bus|data buses]] to fetch [[instruction fetch|instructions]].

A stored-program digital computer keeps both [[Computer program|program instructions]] and data in [[Read-write memory|read-write]], [[random-access memory]] (RAM).  Stored-program computers were an advancement over the program-controlled computers of the 1940s, such as the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] and the [[ENIAC]]. Those were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units. The vast majority of modern computers use the same memory for both data and program instructions. The von Neumann vs. Harvard distinction applies to the [[CPU cache|cache]] architecture, not the main memory ([[Modified Harvard architecture#Split-cache (or_Almost-von-Neumann) architecture|split cache architecture]]).

==History==
The earliest computing machines had fixed programs.  Some very simple computers still use this design, either for simplicity or training purposes.  For example, a desk [[calculator]] (in principle) is a fixed program computer.  It can do basic [[mathematics]], but it cannot run a [[word processor]] or games.  Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires rewiring, restructuring, or redesigning the machine.  The earliest computers were not so much "programmed" as  "designed" for a particular task.  "Reprogramming"—when possible at all—was a laborious process that started with [[flowchart]]s and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically rewiring and rebuilding the machine. It could take three weeks to set up and debug a program on [[ENIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the proposal of the stored-program computer, this changed. A stored-program computer includes, by design, an [[instruction set]], and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]].

A stored-program design also allows for [[self-modifying code]]. One early motivation for such a facility was the need for a program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which operators had to do manually in early designs. This became less important when [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]] became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using [[Addressing mode|immediate addressing]]. Self-modifying code has largely fallen out of favor, since it is usually hard to understand and [[debugging|debug]], as well as being inefficient under modern processor [[pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] and caching schemes.

==Capabilities==
On a large scale, the ability to treat instructions as data is what makes [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[compiler]]s, [[Linker (computing)|linkers]], [[Loader (computing)|loaders]], and other automated programming tools possible. It makes "programs that write programs" possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MFTL.html |title=''MFTL'' (My Favorite Toy Language) entry Jargon File 4.4.7 |access-date=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has made a sophisticated self-hosting computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.

Some high level languages such as [[LISP]] leverage the von Neumann architecture by providing an abstract, machine-independent way to manipulate executable code at runtime, or by using runtime information to tune [[just-in-time compilation]] (e.g. in the case of languages hosted on the [[Java virtual machine]], or languages embedded in [[web browsers]]).

On a smaller scale, some repetitive operations such as  [[Bit blit|BITBLT]] or [[High-level shader language|pixel and vertex shaders]] can be accelerated on general purpose processors with just-in-time compilation techniques. This is one use of self-modifying code that has remained popular.

==Development of the stored-program concept==
The mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who had been alerted to a problem of mathematical logic by the lectures of [[Max Newman]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a paper in 1936 entitled ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', which was published in the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society''.&lt;ref name="Turing1936"&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M. Turing |publication-date=1937 |date=1936 |title=On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem |periodical=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |series=2 |volume=42 |pages=230–265 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230}} (and {{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M.

The hypothetical machine had an infinite store (memory in today's terminology) that contained both instructions and data. [[John von Neumann]] became acquainted with Turing while he was a visiting professor at Cambridge in 1935, and also during Turing's PhD year at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] during 1936 – 1937. Whether he knew of Turing's paper of 1936 at that time is not clear.

In 1936, [[Konrad Zuse]] also anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Electronic Digital Computers |journal=Nature |date=September 25, 1948 |volume=162 |page=487 |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |access-date=2009-04-10 |doi=10.1038/162487a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406014626/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |archivedate=April 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently, [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]], who were developing the [[ENIAC]] at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], wrote about the stored-program concept in December 1943.
&lt;ref name="Lukoff_1979"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Lukoff |author-first=Herman |author-link=Herman Lukoff |title=From Dits to Bits: A personal history of the electronic computer |date=1979 |publisher=Robotics Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=0-89661-002-0 |lccn=79-90567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ENIAC project administrator Grist Brainerd's December 1943 progress report for the first period of the ENIAC's development implicitly proposed the stored program concept (while simultaneously rejecting its implementation in the ENIAC) by stating that "in order to have the simplest project and not to complicate matters," the ENIAC would be constructed without any "automatic regulation.".&lt;/ref&gt; In planning a new machine, [[EDVAC]], Eckert wrote in January 1944 that they would store data and programs in a new addressable memory device, a mercury metal [[delay line memory]]. This was the first time the construction of a practical stored-program machine was proposed.  At that time, he and Mauchly were not aware of Turing's work.

Von Neumann was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], which required huge amounts of calculation. This drew him to the ENIAC project, during the summer of 1944. There he joined the ongoing discussions on the design of this stored-program computer, the EDVAC. As part of that group, he wrote up a description titled ''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC''&lt;ref name ="FirstDraftReport"/&gt; based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly. It was unfinished when his colleague [[Herman Goldstine]] circulated it with only von Neumann's name on it, to the consternation of Eckert and Mauchly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was read by dozens of von Neumann's colleagues in America and Europe, and influenced the next round of computer designs.

[[Jack Copeland]] considers that it is "historically inappropriate, to refer to electronic stored-program digital computers as 'von Neumann machines'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Copeland |author-first=Jack |author-link=Jack Copeland |title=A Brief History of Computing: ENIAC and EDVAC |date=2000 |url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#ACE |access-date=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Los Alamos colleague [[Stan Frankel]] said of von Neumann's regard for Turing's ideas:
{{quote|
I know that in or about 1943 or '44 von Neumann was well aware of the fundamental importance of Turing's paper of 1936… Von Neumann introduced me to that paper and at his urging I studied it with care. Many people have acclaimed von Neumann as the "father of the computer" (in a modern sense of the term) but I am sure that he would never have made that mistake himself. He might well be called the midwife, perhaps, but he firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing— in so far as not anticipated by Babbage… Both Turing and von Neumann, of course, also made substantial contributions to the "reduction to practice" of these concepts but I would not regard these as comparable in importance with the introduction and explication of the concept of a computer able to store in its memory its program of activities and of modifying that program in the course of these activities.

}}

At the time that the "First Draft" report was circulated, Turing was producing a report entitled ''Proposed Electronic Calculator''. It described in engineering and programming detail, his idea of a machine he called the ''[[Automatic Computing Engine|Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this to the Executive Committee of the British [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] on February 19, 1946. Although Turing knew from his wartime experience at Bletchley Park that what he proposed was feasible, the secrecy surrounding [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], that was subsequently maintained for several decades, prevented him from saying so. Various successful implementations of the ACE design were produced.

Both von Neumann's and Turing's papers described stored-program computers, but von Neumann's earlier paper achieved greater circulation and the computer architecture it outlined became known as the "von Neumann architecture". In the 1953 publication ''Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'' (edited by B. V. Bowden), a section in the chapter on ''Computers in America'' reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|pp=176,177}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''The Machine of the Institute For Advanced Studies, Princeton'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1945, Professor J. von Neumann, who was then working at the Moore School of Engineering in Philadelphia, where the E.N.I.A.C. had been built, issued on behalf of a group of his co-workers, a report on the logical design of digital computers. The report contained a detailed proposal for the design of the machine that has since become known as the E.D.V.A.C. (electronic discrete variable automatic computer). This machine has only recently been completed in America, but the von Neumann report inspired the construction of the E.D.S.A.C. (electronic delay-storage automatic calculator) in Cambridge (see page 130).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1947, Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann published another report that outlined the design of another type of machine (a parallel machine this time) that would be exceedingly fast, capable perhaps of 20,000 operations per second. They pointed out that the outstanding problem in constructing such a machine was the development of suitable memory with instantaneously accessible contents. At first they suggested using a special [[vacuum tube]]—called the "[[Selectron tube|Selectron]]"—which the Princeton Laboratories of RCA had invented. These tubes were expensive and difficult to make, so von Neumann subsequently decided to build a machine based on the [[Williams tube|Williams memory]]. This machine—completed in June, 1952 in Princeton—has become popularly known as the Maniac. The design of this machine inspired at least half a dozen machines now being built in America, all known affectionately as "Johniacs."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same book, the first two paragraphs of a chapter on ACE read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Automatic Computation at the National Physical Laboratory'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the most modern digital computers which embodies developments and improvements in the technique of automatic electronic computing was recently demonstrated at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where it has been designed and built by a small team of mathematicians and electronics research engineers on the staff of the Laboratory, assisted by a number of production engineers from the English Electric Company, Limited. The equipment so far erected at the Laboratory is only the pilot model of a much larger installation which will be known as the Automatic Computing Engine, but although comparatively small in bulk and containing only about 800 thermionic valves, as can be judged from Plates XII, XIII and XIV, it is an extremely rapid and versatile calculating machine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic concepts and abstract principles of computation by a machine were formulated by Dr. A. M. Turing, F.R.S., in a paper&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. read before the London Mathematical Society in 1936, but work on such machines in Britain was delayed by the war. In 1945, however, an examination of the problems was made at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr. J. R. Womersley, then superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the Laboratory. He was joined by Dr. Turing and a small staff of specialists, and, by 1947, the preliminary planning was sufficiently advanced to warrant the establishment of the special group already mentioned. In April, 1948, the latter became the Electronics Section of the Laboratory, under the charge of Mr. F. M. Colebrook.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evolution==
[[File:Computer system bus.svg|thumb|uprigt=1.8|Single [[system bus]] evolution of the architecture]]

Through the decades of the 1960s and 1970s computers generally became both smaller and faster, which led to evolutions in their architecture. For example, [[memory-mapped I/O]] lets input and output devices be treated the same as memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A New Architecture for Mini-Computers—The DEC PDP-11 |author-first1=C.

In subsequent decades, simple [[microcontrollers]] would sometimes omit features of the model to lower cost and size.
Larger computers added features for higher performance.

==Design limitations==
===Von Neumann bottleneck===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Random-access memory]] --&gt;
The shared bus between the program memory and data memory leads to the ''von Neumann bottleneck'', the limited [[throughput]] (data transfer rate) between the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and memory compared to the amount of memory.  Because the single bus can only access one of the two classes of memory at a time, throughput is lower than the rate at which the CPU can work.  This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data.  The CPU is continually&lt;!-- http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continual#Usage_notes --&gt; [[Wait state|forced to wait]] for needed data to move to or from memory.  Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.

The von Neumann bottleneck was described by [[John Backus]] in his 1977 ACM [[Turing Award]] lecture.  According to Backus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of [[Word (data type)|words]] back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.&lt;ref name="backus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/359576.359579 |title=Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs |author-last=Backus |author-first=John W. |author-link=John Backus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD692.html |title=E. W. Dijkstra Archive: A review of the 1977 Turing Award Lecture |access-date=2008-07-11 |author-first=Edsger W. |author-last=Dijkstra |author-link=Edsger W. Dijkstra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Mitigations====
There are several known methods for mitigating the Von Neumann performance bottleneck.  For example, the following all can improve performance{{why|date=November 2015}}:
*Providing a [[CPU cache|cache]] between the CPU and the [[main memory]]
*providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called [[Modified Harvard architecture]])
*using [[branch predictor]] algorithms and logic
*providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip [[scratchpad memory]] to reduce memory access
*Implementing the CPU and the [[memory hierarchy]] as a [[System on a chip|system on chip]], providing greater [[locality of reference]] and thus reducing latency and increasing throughput between [[Processor register|processor registers]] and [[main memory]]

The problem can also be sidestepped somewhat by using [[parallel computing]], using for example the [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) architecture—this approach is commonly employed by supercomputers. It is less clear whether the ''intellectual bottleneck'' that Backus criticized has changed much since 1977. Backus's proposed solution has not had a major influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Modern [[functional programming]] and [[object-oriented programming]] are much less geared towards "pushing vast numbers of words back and forth" than earlier languages like [[FORTRAN]] were, but internally, that is still what computers spend much of their time doing, even highly parallel supercomputers.

As of 1996, a database benchmark study found that three out of four CPU cycles were spent waiting for memory. Researchers expect that increasing the number of simultaneous instruction streams with [[multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] or single-chip [[multiprocessing]] will make this bottleneck even worse.&lt;ref&gt;Sites, Richard L.; Patt, Yale. [http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/architects_look_to_future.pdf "Architects Look to Processors of Future"]. Microprocessor report. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[Multi-core processor|multi-core processors]], additional [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] is required to maintain [[cache coherence]] between processors and threads. 

===Self-modifying code===
Aside from the von Neumann bottleneck, program modifications can be quite harmful, either by accident or design.  In some simple stored-program computer designs, a malfunctioning program can damage itself, other programs, or the [[operating system]], possibly leading to a computer [[crash (computing)|crash]]. [[Memory protection]] and other forms of [[access control]] can usually protect against both accidental and malicious program modification.
