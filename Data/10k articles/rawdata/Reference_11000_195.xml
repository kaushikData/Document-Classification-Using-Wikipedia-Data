'''''A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Indonesia''''' is the first and so far the only photographic guide to the birds of the [[Republic of Indonesia]]. In fact, amazingly it is the only bird book covering this vast nation as one entity, a country with more than 250 million people and more endemic and globally threatened bird species than any other in the world. 

==History==
The book was first published in 2001 by Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd. Production and editorial work was done by Berkeley Books Pte Ltd in [[Singapore]]. Publisher was Eric Oey; Julia Walkden and Rod Ritchie were the editors. Dr. Bas van Balen provided advice as scientific editor. The binding in the first edition was a normal paperback cover with a collage of six different birds. 

The first edition was 190 mm high and 125 mm wide, weighing 575 grams. In this edition Morten Strange was credited with both text and photos. It covered 686 species; most were illustrated by the author; some 30 other bird photographers provided additional images. In both the first and the second edition of the book there are two bird species featured per page, each with one or more photographs as well as a distribution map. The taxonomy and nomenclature in the first edition followed ''The Birds of Indonesia: a Checklist'' by Peter Andrew from 1992; this was the most used checklist at the time, using the so-called ‘crows-last’ sequence. The book was a companion to ''[[A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia]]'' which was published the previous year, in 2000. However, this volume used a different checklist as a reference with a ‘buntings last’ sequence.   

''A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Indonesia'' was reprinted several times during the following years, but without corrections or updates. In 2003, it was co-published in a deal with Princeton University Press for the US market and Christopher Helm (an imprint of A&amp;C Black Publishers Ltd) for the UK market; some of these imprints might still appear as used copies on internet book sites. Periplus distributed the book in Asia and in Indonesia, where it sold well. 
By 2012 a lot of new information and photographic material on the birds of Indonesia had emerged, and work on a second edition was started. The editorial work was again done in Singapore under supervision of Nancy Goh at Berkeley Books Pte Ltd. The second edition involved a total revamp of the material; a new checklist was used on the basis of ''The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World 6th Edition'' from 2007. This list has 1,605 bird species for Indonesia, while the 1992 list had 1,534. It also uses the ‘buntings last’ sequence which means that the Indonesian book now uses the same sequence as the companion volume ''A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia''. However, while ''Southeast Asia'' came out in 2012 with just a new cover and imprint, ''Indonesia'' came out that year in a second edition and was dramatically changed. 
   
The new cover is flexibound vinyl extending out over the content pages. There is a single cover photo; the book is published using the Tuttle Publishing imprint. Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd is now the sole distributor of the book. In this edition, Morten Strange is credited as the author but not with text and photos, as only some 50% of the photographs are now his. In the second edition, new photographers such as James Eaton, Robert Hutchinson, Pete Morris and Bram Demeulemeester are the main contributors of new, rare and endemic species. Filip Verbelen, who also contributed to the first edition, is now next to the author as the main contributor. A total of more than 40 bird photographer participated in the project, including new Indonesian field researchers. The second edition was expanded from 416 to 544 pages and now weighs 780 grams and illustrates 912 species, out of which 213 are endemic (found only in Indonesia). As such, it is the most comprehensive photographic bird guide to any country in the world. In the second edition the opening chapters have been totally re-written and updated; the book now also includes an annotated checklist to all the species in Indonesia, the ones covered in the photographic section are highlighted in the full checklist at the back of the book. 

In 2014, the book was reprinted with corrections and updates. An additional 37 photos were replaced with new and better ones; a misidentified bird (the Flores hawk-eagle) was renamed, and another species (Sumatran laughingthrush) was split out as endemic following the latest taxonomy. Threat status and icons for all globally threatened species were revised, and the annotations in the checklist were updated for each subregion using the latest information available.{{citationneeded|date=January 2015}}

In 2015, the book was reprinted again. In this reprint, two photographs were replaced and all nomenclature, taxonomy, distribution data and global threat status was updated throughout the book. The total number of species in the checklist was revised upwards to 1608 species.

'''AbeBooks''' is an [[e-commerce]] global [[online marketplace]] with seven national domains that offers [[book]]s, [[fine art]], and [[collectable]]s from sellers in 50+ countries.

On August 1, 2008, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] acquired AbeBooks.&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/amazon-to-acquire-abebooks/|title=Amazon To Acquire AbeBooks, And With It A Stake In LibraryThing|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1995, AbeBooks was founded by Rick and Vivian Pura, and Keith and Cathy Waters. It was incorporated in 1995 and launched its websites in 1996, initially including listings for only four bookstores.  The company name "Abebooks" is derived from their original name, "Advanced Book Exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, Lawrence &amp; Nancy ''Slightly Chipped* *Footnotes in Booklore'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1990s to 2005, AbeBooks had reseller agreements with [[eBay]], [[Half.com]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble.com]], [[BibliOZ.com]] and [[Amazon.com]], allowing AbeBooks to market and sell booksellers' books through those channels; these agreements were dissolved in 2005. AbeBooks currently only has a reseller agreement with Amazon.com.

In 2001, AbeBooks acquired Germany's [[JustBooks|JustBooks GmbH]] online book marketplace, which helped the company expand into the German, French and British online bookselling markets.

In 2002, the founding partners were bought out by German media company [[Hubert Burda Media]].

In 2004, AbeBooks expanded its model to include new books, and acquired the Spanish company [[IberLibro]], to better serve [[Spanish language]] markets.

In 2004, AbeBooks purchased IberLibro.com in October and its inventory was integrated into the AbeBooks' database in December 2006.

In 2005, AbeBooks acquired [[BookFinder.com]] in November, an American book price comparison "metasearch" shopping service site.&lt;ref name="internetnews-bookfinder-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, AbeBooks acquired [[Fillz]] in February, a book-inventory and order-management company,&lt;ref name="auctionbytes-fillz-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''purchased'' a 40% stake in [[LibraryThing]] in May, a social networking and book cataloging website for bibliophiles.&lt;ref name="auctionbytes-librarything-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, AbeBooks acquired Chrislands in April, a company that hosts websites for over 1000 booksellers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Also in 2008, AbeBooks was awarded the [[British Columbia Technology Industry Association]] Impact Award&lt;ref name="BCTIA"&gt;[http://www.bctia.org/awards/past_winners/tia-past_winners_08.aspx 2008 TIA Award Winners. BCTIA. Retrieved on 07-11-08.]&lt;/ref&gt; in June for Leadership in Social Responsibility for its charitable activities, literacy initiatives, and commitment to environmental friendliness in its business practices.

In December, 2008, AbeBooks was sold to Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=https://www.abebooks.com/docs/CompanyInformation/factSheet.shtml|website=AbeBooks|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AbeBooks has been named one of [[BC's Top Employers]] every year since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-abebooks|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 BC's Top Employers competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, AbeBooks launched the AbeBooks Channel Program in May to provide its booksellers with the opportunity to list their books for sale on Amazon.com. The Channel Program was permanently closed on June 16, 2014.

In 2011, AbeBooks acquired {{Interlanguage link multi|ZVAB.com|de|3=Zentrales Verzeichnis Antiquarischer Bücher}} - a worldwide marketplace for German rare books with professional booksellers in 27 countries offering customers millions of used, antiquarian and out-of-print books.

As of October 2016, AbeBooks is headquartered in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], with its European office in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]]. The company manages regional websites for North America, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain. Millions of items are listed for sale. Most books listed are [[used book|used]], many are [[rare book|rare]], signed, 1st editions or [[out of print book|out of print]], and a growing number are new.

Also in 2016, Arkady Vitrouk was appointed CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/arkady-vitrouk-144358|title=Arkady Vitrouk's Linkedin profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously the Director of Kindle Content in Amazon's European headquarters in Luxembourg. Prior to joining Amazon, he was the CEO of the Azbooka-Atticus Publishing Group in Russia.

In November 2018, without advance notice, AbeBooks announced it would no longer support sellers from a number of countries, including [[South Korea]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Russia]], claiming that “it is no longer viable for us to operate in these countries due to increasing costs and complexities.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/technology/abebooks-amazon-protest-booksellers.html "Booksellers Protest Amazon Site’s Move to Drop Stores From Certain Countries," New York Times, 5 Nov 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Several hundred other sellers pulled their inventories from the AbeBooks site in protest.

AbeBooks maintains a blog and also has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and launched a podcast in 2018.

==Most expensive sales==

AbeBooks is also known as an online marketplace where rare and collectible items changed hands. In February 2015, AbeBooks recorded the most expensive sales ever at the time: a rare ornithology book was sold online in AbeBooks for $191,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/rare-books/most-expensive-sales/ever.shtml|title=AbeBooks' Most Expensive Sales of All Time|website=www.abebooks.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website periodically reports their recent high value sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/rare-books/most-expensive-sales/jan-feb-mar-2016.shtml|title=AbeBooks' Most Expensive Sales in January, February &amp; March 2016|website=www.abebooks.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searchable inventory==

AbeBooks' users can search across the listings of many [[independent bookstore]]s, thereby allowing small, independent players to compete with bookselling superstores. Some of the member bookstores offer their books online only, while others also maintain a regular storefront.

Booksellers upload their inventory data to the AbeBooks database, specifying information about each book including condition and price. Prices are fixed (with US$1 being the minimum) and there are no auctions. Items available range from the extremely common, where there might be hundreds of copies listed, to truly unique manuscript material worth thousands of dollars. In addition to books, magazines, audio books, journals, illustration art, vintage photographs and paper ephemera are offered.

==Sellers==

Sellers pay a monthly subscription to list their books on the site, ranging from [[USD|$]]25 to $500, depending on how many books they list. This subscription fee has been in place since at least April 2008.  In addition, sellers pay a percentage fee for each book sold via the websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.abebooks.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-abebooks/|title=How Much Does it Cost to Sell on AbeBooks and How Does AbeBooks Pay Me?|date=4 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AbeBooks initially offered its services for a flat listings fee, based on the number of titles listed for sale. The model was changed in the early 2000s to include a commission on sales. In April 2006, AbeBooks started mandatory processing of MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions on behalf of its sellers and added a 5.5%  charge for the provision of this service: previously this service had been optional. In 2008, AbeBooks started charging a commission of 13.5% on the cost of postage as well as the book price. Currently (2013) the commission charge is set at 8% of postage and book price.

Sellers can, within limits, set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers. Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site's interface.  Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller's location. Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers. While AbeBooks is arguably the largest such site, most booksellers who list on AbeBooks also list their books on multiple similar marketplaces such as [[Amazon.com]], [[Biblio.com]], [[Half.com]], etc.

==Websites==

AbeBooks's [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by [[top-level domain]] and [[country code]]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">A '''biographical dictionary''' is a type of [[encyclopedic dictionary]] limited to [[biographical]] information. Many attempt to cover the major personalities of a country (with limitations, such as living persons only, in ''[[Who's Who]]'', or deceased people only, in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''). Others are specialized, in that they cover important names in a subject field, such as architecture or engineering.

==History==
The genre of biographical  dictionaries is  a "unique  product  of  Arab  Muslim  culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalidi|first1=Tarif|title=ISLAMIC BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARIES: A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT|journal=The Muslim World|date=January 1973|volume=63|issue=1|pages=53–65|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1973.tb03104.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  earliest extant example of the biographical dictionary dates from 9th-century [[Iraq]], and by the 16th-century it was a firmly established and well-respected form of historical writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scalenghe|first1=Sara|title=Disability in the Ottoman Arab World, 1500-1800|date=2014|publisher=Loyola University Maryland|isbn=1107622794|page=16|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain more social data for a large segment of the population than that found in any other pre-industrial society. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of the earliest examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]], and then began documenting the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia|volume=2|author=Josef W.

'''''Carousel''''' is an [[internet marketing|online advertisement]] launched in April 2009 by [[Philips]] to promote [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] [[LCD television]]s. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured van]] heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding ''Carousel'' was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by  [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]]. It was directed by [[Adam Berg (director)|Adam Berg]], with production contracted to [[London]]-based [[production company]] [[Stinkdigital]]. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]]. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'s ''[[Evolution (advertisement)|Evolution]]'' in 2007. Scenes from ''Carousel'' were used in the [[music video]] for [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[50 Cent]]'s [[single (music)|single]] "[[Ok, You're Right]]".

==Sequence==
After a credit sequence, ''Carousel'' opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked [[police car]]. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a [[station wagon]]. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|number 219]]) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.

==Production==

===Background and filming===
In January 2009, Philips announced its new [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] line of [[LCD television]]s, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a [[Movie theater|cinema]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;"Philips premieres the ultimate home cinematic viewing experience with the Cinema 21:9 LCD TV", [[Philips]] ([[Press release]]), January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a request to create an [[advertising campaign]] based around an educational website&lt;ref name="Boards3"&gt;Clarke, Christine; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html Nobody Move] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916011605/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html |date=September 16, 2011 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', June 1, 2009.

Retrieved September 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly came up with the idea of a piece composed of a single [[tracking shot]].&lt;ref name="Camp4"/&gt; The team proposed the idea to several production companies, eventually settling on London-based production house [[Stinkdigital]].

Several hospitals in [[Prague]] were looked at, but with a recent outbreak of [[influenza]] in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] capital, most were unavailable.&lt;ref name="Boards5"/&gt; To speed up the location scouting, [[director of photography]] Fredrik Backar and [[post-production|post supervisor]] Richard Lyons accompanied the [[reconnaissance|recce]] teams.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt; Eventually, the team discovered an old [[communism|Communist]] university&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; which had been converted into a sports college, and gained permission to dress the location as a hospital.&lt;ref name="Boards5"/&gt;

Even with 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the final footage and stunts captured in-camera,&lt;ref name="Shots"/&gt; the post-production work required for ''Carousel'' was extensive.&lt;ref name="Camp4"/&gt; An initial [[telecine]] transfer was performed by colourist Jean-Clement Soret at [[Moving Picture Company|The Moving Picture Company]] in London.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; The palette for each room was slightly altered to give the illusion of separate spaces,&lt;ref name="MPC"&gt;"[http://www.moving-picture.com/index.php/commercials/593.html Philips, Carousel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714121952/http://www.moving-picture.com/index.php/commercials/593.html |date=July 14, 2011 }}", [[Moving Picture Company]] website, 2009.

At certain points during ''Carousel'', viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot.&lt;ref name="Redrum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in ''Carousel''. In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;

The [[soundtrack]] to ''Carousel'' was composed by [[Michael Fakesch]]. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match.&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; Other features of the microsite included an [[Ambilight]] feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

==Release and reception==
The release of ''Carousel'' was a huge success. In just over two weeks, it had been viewed over half a million times, with visitors to the minisite spending an average of 5m20s watching the film. Of these, 50 percent used one or more of the interactive features of the site.&lt;ref name="NMA"/&gt; A number of celebrities commented on the quality of the ad; actor [[Ashton Kutcher]] pointed followers of his [[Twitter]] account to it,&lt;ref name="Boards5"/&gt; and [[Hip hop music|hip hop artist]] [[Kanye West]] referred to it as "hands down the best video of the year",&lt;ref name="Boards1"/&gt; Media publications made comparisons between ''Carousel'' and the opening scenes of the 2008 film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', in which criminals wearing clown masks rob a bank under instructions from [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]].&lt;ref name="Boards4"&gt;"[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090501/topspots.html Top Spots] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217020153/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090501/topspots.html# |date=2012-02-17 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', May 1, 2009.

'''Clarence Lewis Barnhart''' (1900&amp;ndash;1993) was an American lexicographer best known for editing the ''Thorndike-Barnhart'' series of graded dictionaries, published by Scott Foresman &amp; Co. which were based on word lists and concepts of definition developed by [[Psychology|psychological]] theorist [[Edward Lee Thorndike|Edward Thorndike]].  Barnhart subsequently revised and expanded the series and with the assistance of his sons, maintaining them through the 1980s.

==Early years==
Barnhart attended the University of Chicago and studied under noted linguist and primary founder of the [[Linguistic Society of America]], Leonard Bloomberg. Barnhart was influenced by Bloomfield's approach to learning which included developing word lists based on frequency of use and citation files based on real-world examples. In 1929 Barnhart joined book publisher [[Scott Foresman|Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.]] eventually becoming an editor. Scott, Foresman paid for portions of his education in exchange for a promise of employment when his studies were complete. Barnhart graduated in 1930 and further undertook graduate studies from 1934-1937. Noted child psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] approached Scott Foresman with his ideas for a children's dictionary based on his ''Teacher’s Word Book'' (1921) and upcoming ''Teacher’s Word Book of the Twenty Thousand Words Found Most Frequently and Widely in General Reading for Children and Young People'' (1932.) The Scott Foresman editors brought Barnhart in to explain Thorndike's proposal after which the project was approved. Together Thorndike and Barnhart co-created the ''Thorndike-Century Junior Dictionary'' in 1935 followed by the ''Thorndike-Century Senior Dictionary'' in 1941. A revised edition of the Junior Dictionary came out in 1942, followed by the ''Thorndike-Century Beginning Dictionary'' in 1945.

During [[World War II]] the United States Army approached the Linguistic Society of America seeking assistance to write a dictionary of military terms. Barnhart and Jess Stein (who would later go on to become the editor for the Random House Dictionary) were sent to New York and undertook the editing of the ''[[Dictionary of U.S. Army Terms]]'' (TM-20-205) for the War Department in 1944.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following ''[[The American College Dictionary]]'' published in 1947, Barnhart contracted with Scott, Foresman to produce the Thorndike-Barnhart dictionary series.  Barnhart's other projects included ''[[The New Century Cyclopedia of Names]]'', ''[[Century Handbook of English Literature]]'', and three dictionaries of new words.  He spent the last twenty years of his life working on ''[[The Barnhart Dictionary Companion]]''—a quarterly devoted to new words.

==Post-war years==
While in New York, Barnhart found out that [[Random House]] had plans to produce an “Americanized” version of the ''[[Oxford Concise Dictionary]]''. Random House had acquired the rights to the [[Century Dictionary|''Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'']] in the late 1930s and the [[Dictionary of American English]] in the early 1940s. Barnhart approached Random House and convinced them to let him take complete control of the project, from concept to design to implementation. This resulted in the [[American College Dictionary]]'', published in 1947. This work was later used as the basis of the ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.

While at Random House he produced the [[Century Dictionary|''New Century Cyclopedia of Names'']] in 1954, a three volume expansion of the original 1894 volume of the Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia. From the New Century Cyclopedia of Names he further produced the ''[[New Century Handbook of English Literature]]''.

In the 1950s and 1960s he developed the linguistic approach to reading instruction begun by Leonard Bloomfield, entitled ''[[Let's Read]]'' which was published in 1961.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following the death of Thorndike in 1949, Barnhart, aided by his sons, further updated and revised the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These became the most popular school dictionaries in the United States. All dictionaries for schools were published by Scott Foresman and in the trade market by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} During the 1980s the dictionaries were published under two alternative titles. The advanced dictionary was published as either ''Thorndike-Barnhart Advanced Dictionary'' or ''Thorndike-Barnhart Student's Dictionary''. The middle dictionary was published as either ''Thorndike-Barnhart Intermediate Dictionary'' or ''Thorndike-Barnhart Advanced Junior Dictionary''. The junior dictionary was published as either ''Thorndike-Barnhart Beginning Dictionary'' or ''Thorndike-Barnhart Junior Dictionary''. In 1997 Scott Foresman was acquired by [[Pearson Education]] who retired the work in favour of their [[Longman]] brand dictionaries.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

His largest general dictionary was the ''[[World Book Dictionary]]'', a two-volume work created as a supplement to the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. It is essentially an expanded and more advanced version of the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries. It was first published in 1963 and was updated annually until 1976, whereupon it had a major revision, totaling approximately 225,000 individual entries.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Consistent with the encyclopedia's use by young people, Barnhart wrote definitions which were both simple and accurate, and most entries include sample sentences or phrases. Many definitions are the same, or almost the same, as those of the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries. Like [[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International'']], it included few proper names, leaving them to be covered by the companion volumes of the encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="SweetlandCheney2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James H. Sweetland|author2=Frances Neel Cheney|authorlink2=Frances Neel Cheney|title=Fundamental reference sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7qLtTAl2TIC|accessdate=25 January 2011|year=2001|publisher=ALA Editions|isbn=978-0-8389-0780-1|pages=273, 279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s up until the 1990s the work was periodically revised and updated with the last revision done by his son Robert and his wife Cynthia Barnhart in 1996.

He also co-edited of ''[[The Barnhart Dictionary of New English Since 1963]]'' (copyright 1973), ''[[The Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (copyright 1980), and ''[[The Third Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (copyright 1990).  These works were designed to cover new words, meanings, and changes in usage.  In 1982, with his son David, he began editing a quarterly publication devoted to thorough dictionary treatment of new words, new meanings and changes in usage entitled ''[[The Barnhart Dictionary Companion]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Nearly all of his dictionaries were based heavily upon the collection of evidence, the value of which he learned from work he did for Sir William Craigie on the ''[[Dictionary of American English]]'' at the University of Chicago.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Over his career of 64 years he and his staff accumulated a file of over 7 million quotations exhibiting contemporary usage of English words.  He was active in [[interlinguistics]], serving as a consultant to the [[International Auxiliary Language Association|research body]] that presented [[Interlingua]] in 1951.  In the late 20th century he and his son helped to pioneer the use of electronically retrievable evidence from computerized files of news publications.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

His sons, [[David Barnhart]] and [[Robert Barnhart]], worked with him on many of his later projects.

==Comparison between InnoDB and MyISAM==
#InnoDB recovers from a crash or other unexpected shutdown by replaying its logs. MyISAM must fully scan and repair or rebuild any indexes or possibly tables which had been updated but not fully flushed to disk. Since the InnoDB approach is approximately fixed time while the MyISAM time grows with the size of the data files, InnoDB offers greater availability as database sizes grow.
#InnoDB, with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 1, flushes the transaction log after each transaction, greatly improving reliability.&lt;ref name=trx_commit&gt;[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual - InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables]&lt;/ref&gt; MyISAM has to be run on top of a fully [[Journaling file system|journaled filesystem]], such as [[ext4]] mounted with data=journal, to provide the same resilience against data file corruption. (The journal can be put on an [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] device for improved MyISAM performance, similarly, the InnoDB log can be placed on a non-journaled filesystem such as [[ext2]] running on an SSD for a similar performance boost. Reliability is not sacrificed in either case.)
#InnoDB can be run in a mode where it has lower reliability but in some cases higher performance. Setting innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit to 0 switches to a mode where transactions are not committed to disk before control is returned to the caller. Instead, disk flushes happen on a timer.&lt;ref name=trx_commit/&gt;
#InnoDB automatically groups together multiple concurrent inserts and flushes them to disk at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-performance-group_commit.html MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual - InnoDB Group Commit]&lt;/ref&gt; MyISAM relies on the filesystem block cache for caching reads to the data rows and indexes, while InnoDB does this within the engine itself, combining the row caches with the index caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-storage-engine.html|title=MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual - The InnoDB Storage Engine|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#InnoDB will store rows in [[primary key]] order if present, else first [[unique key]] order. This can be significantly faster if the key is chosen to be good for common operations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} If there is no primary key or unique key InnoDB will use an internally generated unique integer key and will physically store records in roughly insert order, as MyISAM does. Alternatively, an autoincrementing primary key field can be used to achieve the same effect.
#InnoDB provides updatable [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch|LZW]] compressed page storage for both data and indexes. MyISAM compressed tables can't be updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/myisampack.html MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual - myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
#When operating in fully [[ACID]]-compliant modes, InnoDB must do a flush to disk at least once per transaction, though it will combine flushes for inserts from multiple connections.  For typical hard drives or arrays, this will impose a limit of about 200 update transactions per second.  For applications which require higher transaction rates, disk controllers with write caching and battery backup will be required in order to maintain transactional integrity. InnoDB also offers several modes which reduce this effect, naturally leading to a loss of transactional integrity guarantees, though still retaining greater reliability than MyISAM.  MyISAM has none of this overhead, but only because it does not support transactions.
#MyISAM uses table-level locking on updates and deletes to any existing row, with an option to append new rows instead of taking a lock and inserting them into free space. InnoDB uses row-level locking.  For large database applications where many rows are often updated, row-level locking is crucial because a single table-level lock significantly reduces concurrency in the database.
#Both InnoDB and MyISAM support [[Full text search|full-text search]], with InnoDB gaining full-text index support in MySQL 5.6.4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-4.html|title=Changes in MySQL 5.6.4 (2011-12-20, Milestone 7)|publisher=Oracle|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the results can be notably different&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/03/04/innodb-full-text-search-in-mysql-5-6-part-2-the-queries/|title=InnoDB Full-text Search in MySQL 5.6: Part 2, The Queries!|publisher=MySQL Performance Blog|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DHL International (NZ) Ltd v Richmond Ltd''''' [1993] 3 NZLR 10 Is a leading case in New Zealand case law allowing exclusion of liability clauses even for [[fundamental breach]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=98-99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It effectively incorporates the English case of [[Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd]] [1980] AC 827 into New Zealand case law.

==Background==
Richmond arranged for [[DHL]] to courier some shipping documents relating to the sale of leather worth US$57,460 to a company called Bini in Italy, for which they were charged the modest courier fee of $22.50. Richmond declined DHL’s offer to purchase insurance for direct loss, nor purchase similar insurance from elsewhere insurance consequential loss.

Richmond also accepted DHL’s standard terms of limiting its liability for direct losses to $100, and a total exclusion of liability for consequential loss.

In order to ensure that Richmond got paid for the leather, they arranged for the documents to couriered to a bank in Italy and not to Bini directly.

Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, these shipping documents were couriered directly to Bini. It was never ascertained just why this happened, but the judge suggested that as the delivery address was handwritten and hard to read, it was possible that the courier opened it and got Bini's address in error.

This unfortunately allowed Bini to uplift the leather shipment from the port without first paying. Bini subsequently went into liquidation without making payment.

Richmond sued DHL for the substantial consequential loss that resulted. DHL claimed they were not liable for damages due to their exclusion of liability clause.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that as Richmond had taken the business risk for such a loss by electing not to purchase insurance for consequential loss, and that the exemption clause here was perfectly valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9952">In [[computing]], '''directory service''' or '''name service''' maps the names of network resources to their respective [[network address]]es. It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A directory service is a critical component of a [[network operating system]]. A '''directory server''' or [[name server]] is a [[Server (computing)|server]] which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an [[Object (computer science)|object]] by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] associated with that resource or object. 

A directory service defines a [[namespace]] for the network. The namespace is used to assign a ''name'' (unique identifier) to each of the objects. Directories typically have a set of rules determining how network resources are named and identified, which usually includes a requirement that the identifiers be unique and unambiguous. When using a directory service, a user does not have to remember the physical address of a network resource; providing a name locates the resource. Some directory services include [[access control]] provisions, limiting the availability of directory information to authorized users.

== Comparison with relational databases ==
Several things distinguish a directory service from a [[relational database]]. Data can be redundant if it aids performance.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Directory schemas are object classes, attributes, name bindings and knowledge (namespaces) where an object class has:
* ''Must'' - attributes that each instances must have
* ''May'' - attributes which can be defined for an instance but can be omitted, with the absence similar to NULL in a relational database

Attributes are sometimes multi-valued, allowing multiple naming attributes at one level (such as machine type and serial number [[concatenation]], or multiple phone numbers for "work phone"). Attributes and object classes are standardized throughout the industry, and formally registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] for their object ID. Therefore, directory applications try to reuse standard classes and attributes to maximize the benefit of existing directory-server software.

Object instances are slotted into namespaces; each object class [[Inheritance (computer science)|inherits]] from its parent object class (and ultimately from the root of the hierarchy), adding attributes to the must-may list. Directory services are often central to the [[Computer security|security]] design of an IT system and have a correspondingly-fine [[Granularity (parallel computing)|granularity]] of access control.

== Replication and distribution ==
[[Replication (computing)|Replication]] and distribution have distinct meanings in the design and management of a directory service. Replication is used to indicate that the same directory namespace (the same objects) are copied to another directory server for redundancy and throughput reasons; the replicated namespace is governed by the same authority. Distribution is used to indicate that multiple directory servers in different namespaces are interconnected to form a distributed directory service; each namespace can be governed by a different authority.

== {{anchor|Implementations of directory services}}Implementations ==
Directory services were part of an [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) initiative for common network standards and multi-vendor interoperability. During the 1980s, the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] created a [[X.500|set of standards]] for directory services, initially to support the requirements of inter-carrier electronic messaging and network-name lookup. The [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) is based on the X.500 directory-information services, using the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP stack]] and an X.500 [[Directory Access Protocol]] (DAP) string-encoding scheme on the [[Internet]].

Systems developed before the X.500 include:
* ''[[Domain Name System]] (DNS):'' The first directory service on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt |title=RFC1034 |publisher=IETF.org |date=1978-11-01 |accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, still in use
* ''[[Hesiod (name service)|Hesiod]]:'' Based on DNS and used at MIT's [[Project Athena]]
* ''[[Network Information Service]] (NIS):'' Originally [[Yellow Pages (computing)|Yellow Pages]] (YP) [[Sun Microsystems]]' implementation of a directory service for [[Unix]] network environments. It played a role similar to Hesiod.
* ''[[NetInfo]]:'' Developed by NeXT during the late 1980s for [[NEXTSTEP]]. After its acquisition by Apple, it was released as open source and was the directory service for [[Mac OS X]] before it was deprecated for the LDAP-based Open Directory. Support for NetInfo was removed with the release of 10.5 Leopard.
* ''[[Banyan VINES]]:'' First [[Scalability|scalable]] directory service
* ''[[Windows domain|NT Domain]]s:'' Developed by Microsoft to provide directory services for Windows machines before the release of the LDAP-based Active Directory in Windows 2000. Windows Vista continues to support NT Domains after relaxing its minimum authentication protocols.

=== LDAP implementations ===
LDAP/X.500-based implementations include:
* [[389 Directory Server]]: Free Open Source server implementation by [[Red Hat]], with commercial support by Red Hat and [[SUSE]].
* [[Active Directory]]: [[Microsoft]]'s directory service for [[Windows]], originating from the X.500 directory, created for use in [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange Server]], first shipped with [[Windows 2000 Server]] and supported by successive versions of Windows
* [[Apache Directory Server]]: Directory service, written in Java, supporting LDAP, Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol; LDAPv3 certified
* [[NetIQ eDirectory|eDirectory:]] [[NetIQ]]'s implementation of directory services supports multiple architectures, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[NetWare]], [[Linux]] and several flavours of [[Unix]] and is used for user administration and configuration and software management; previously known as Novell Directory Services.
* [[Red Hat Directory Server]]: [[Red Hat]] released Red Hat Directory Server, acquired from AOL's Netscape Security Solutions unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=48800390 |title=Red Hat Spending $23 Million For Ex-Netscape Security Solutions Business |access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a commercial product running on top of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] as the community-supported [[389 Directory Server]] project.
* [[Oracle Internet Directory]]: (OID) is [[Oracle Corporation]]'s directory service, compatible with LDAP version 3.
* [[Sun Java System Directory Server]]: [[Sun Microsystems]]' directory service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/ |title=Oracle and Sun |publisher=Sun.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[OpenDS]]: [[Open-source model|Open-source]] directory service in Java, backed by [[Sun Microsystems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opends.dev.java.net/ |title=Java.net |publisher=Opends.dev.java.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704054648/https://opends.dev.java.net/ |archivedate=2007-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IBM Tivoli Directory Server]]: Custom build of an old OpenLDAP release
* Windows [[NT Directory Service]]s (NTDS), later renamed [[Active Directory]], replaced the former NT Domain system.
* [[Critical Path, Inc.|Critical Path Directory Server]]
* [[OpenLDAP]]: Derived from the original University of Michigan LDAP implementation (like Netscape, Red Hat, Fedora and Sun JSDS implementations), it supports all computer architectures (including Unix and Unix derivatives, Linux, Windows, z/OS and a number of embedded-realtime systems).
* [[Lotus Domino]]
* [[Nexor]] Directory
* [[OpenDJ]] - a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based LDAP server and directory client that runs in any operating environment, under license [[Common_Development_and_Distribution_License| CDDL]]. Developed by [[ForgeRock]], until 2016&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | title=ForgeRock has shuttered the open-source community, and no longer allows new development on their platform under a permissive license | website=timeforafork | date=June 1, 2017 | url=http://www.timeforafork.com/ | ref={{sfnref | ForgeRock | 2017}} | accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, now maintained by [https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ OpenDJ] Community

Open-source tools to create directory services include OpenLDAP, the [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos protocol]] and [[Samba software]], which can function as a Windows [[domain controller]] with Kerberos and LDAP [[Front and back ends|back ends]]. Administration is by GOsa or Samba SWAT.

== Using name services ==

=== Unix OSs ===
Name services on Unix systems are typically configured through [[nsswitch.conf]]. Information from name services can be retrieved with [[getent]].

'''Forbes Travel Guide''' (formerly known as '''Mobil Guide''' or '''Mobil Travel Guide''') is a [[star rating]] service and series of [[travel guide]]s for hotels, restaurants and spas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startle.com/about/forbes-travel-guide |title=About Forbes Travel Guide |publisher=Startle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Forbes Travel Guide published its last set of guidebooks and on November 15, 2011, launched its new online home, ForbesTravelGuide.com,&lt;ref name="[http://www.startle.com startle]"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://startle.com | title=Startle | accessdate=2011-12-22 | quote=The online home of Forbes Travel Guide, the creators of the original Five-Star ratings system and the leading travel authority since 1958.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers numerous international destinations, including Hong Kong, Macau, Beijing, Singapore, Shanghai, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, Japan, Thailand and London. ForbesTravelGuide.com combines Forbes Travel Guide’s Five-Star travel ratings system with insights and perspectives from Forbes Travel Guide’s own inspectors.

==History==

Founded by [[Mobil]] in 1958, Forbes Travel Guide is the oldest travel guide in the United States. Ratings are given by anonymous, paid staff members in stars (with no half-stars or zero stars), based on objective criteria. A Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rating is a considerable honor, with only 115 hotels and 55 restaurants receiving the top honor. The ratings serve as a [[Certification mark]], in that Mobil had registered trademarks for the phrases and designs indicating each star rating level, and allowed only rated establishments to display them.

Initially guides were regional and limited to the United States and Canada. The first, issued in 1958, covered five states in the Southwest and South Central United States. In 1960, this guide was revised and volumes covering the Northeastern States, the Great Lakes, and California and the West were introduced. Guides covering the Middle Atlantic States and the Northwestern states were introduced in 1962. In 1965, a guide for the Southeastern States was introduced, although only one state covered by this volume, Tennessee, had any Mobil service stations.

Later, the number of volumes was expanded, as regions covered by the guide shrank. For instance, California was covered by two volumes, one for the north and one for the south. City guides also followed. In 2008, Forbes Travel Guide launched the international star ratings program for hotels and spas with the release of the inaugural Forbes Travel Guide Beijing and Forbes Travel Guide Hong Kong and Macau. Published in print by ExxonMobil Travel Publications, until 2011, the guide was published online by [[HowStuffWorks.com]].

In October 2009, [[ExxonMobil]] licensed the brand to the Five Star Ratings Corporation, which is owned by internet entrepreneur and [[WebMD]] founder Jeff Arnold. Five Star Travel Corporation entered into a licensing agreement with Forbes Media, and renamed the Star Awards and guidebook series, Forbes Travel Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2009-08-05-mobil-forbes-guide_N.htm|title=Mobil Travel Guide to become Forbes Travel Guide|date=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel Rankings: Forbes Merges with Mobil|publisher=International Business Times|author=Carly Zinderman|date=2009-12-03|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20091203/hotel-rankings-forbes-merges-with-mobil.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes Travel Guide's new online home, ForbesTravelGuide.com, was launched in 2011, which marked the last year of publication of the traditional printed guidebook series.

==Star Ratings==
The Mobil Travel Guide Star Ratings provided ratings and reviews of hotels, restaurants and spas on a scale of one star (average to good) to five stars (one of the best in the country) starting in 1958. Forbes Travel Guide has continued the Five-Star ratings with ratings categories of Five-Star, Four-Star and Recommended, and has a team of inspectors who anonymously evaluate properties against proprietary standards.&lt;ref name="[http://www.startle.com startle]" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16444">The '''Gerstein Report''' was written in 1945 by [[Kurt Gerstein]], [[Obersturmführer]] of the [[Waffen-SS]], who served as Head of Technical Disinfection Services of the SS in World War II, and in that capacity supplied the [[hydrogen cyanide]]-based pesticide [[Zyklon B]] from [[Degesch]] (''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung'') to [[Rudolf Höss]] in [[Auschwitz]], and conducted the negotiations with the owners.&lt;ref name="Y357"&gt;Yahil 1991, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA351&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Kurt%20Gerstein&amp;f=false  pp. 356-357.]&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 August 1942, along with [[Rolf Günther]] and [[Wilhelm Pfannenstiel]], Gerstein witnessed the gassing of some 3,000 Jews in the [[extermination camp]] of [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]] in [[occupied Poland]]. The report features his eyewitness testimony. It was used as evidence in the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref name="Friedl112"&gt;[[Saul Friedländer|Friedländer, Saul]] (1969), ''Kurt Gerstein: The Ambiguity of Good.''

When Gerstein surrendered to the French Commandant in the occupied town of [[Reutlingen]] on 22 April 1945 he was sent to the town of [[Rottweil]] where he was placed under "honorable captivity" and given accommodation in the Hotel Mohren.  There he composed his report, first in French and then in German.&lt;ref name="Friedl211"&gt;Friedländer 1969, pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details==
{{main|Kurt Gerstein}}

Gerstein was born on 11 August 1905 in [[Münster]] where he lived until 1910, moving to [[Saarbrücken]], [[Halberstadt]], and [[Neuruppin]] near Berlin where he received his secondary school diploma in 1925.  He attended universities in [[Marburg]], [[Aachen]] and [[Berlin]], receiving an engineering degree in 1931.  During his studies he was active in the Protestant youth movements.&lt;ref name=dcgr&gt;[http://www.deathcamps.org/belzec/gerstein.html The Gerstein Report (in translation).] ARC 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in May 1933. As a committed Christian, Gerstein resisted attempts by the Nazi state to control the Christian youth movement, and ran afoul of state authorities.  He was expelled from the party in October 1936 after his arrest in September 1936 for circulating anti-Nazi pamphlets.  Released, he was arrested a second time in July 1938, spending two months in a concentration camp. Reportedly outraged by the [[euthanasia]] or [[Aktion T4]] programme, he decided to join the [[Waffen SS]]: "to look into the matter of these ovens and chambers in order to learn what happened there."&lt;ref name=dcgr/&gt; Because of his technical education, Gerstein was placed in the Waffen-SS technical disinfection services where he rose quickly to become its head.  It was in that capacity that he traveled to the extermination camps of Belzec and Treblinka offering the supply of hydrogen cyanide ([[Zyklon B]]).&lt;ref name="Y357"/&gt;

==Testimony regarding gas chambers==
[[File:WW2-Holocaust-Poland.PNG|222px|thumb|right|Location of [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] (lower centre) on the map of German extermination camps marked with black and white skulls, [[occupied Poland]] ]]
Gerstein stated that on 18 August 1942, he traveled to the extermination camp at [[Belzec]] where he witnessed the arrival of "45 wagons with 6,700 people of whom 1,450 were already dead on arrival."   He described the gassing operation as it happened directly in front of him:

{{quote|Then the procession starts moving. In front a very lovely young girl; so all of them go along the alley, all naked, men, women, children, without artificial limbs. I myself stand together with Hauptmann Wirth on top of the ramp between the gas chambers. Mothers with babies at their breast, they come onward, hesitate, enter the death chambers! At the corner a strong SS man stands who, with a voice like a pastor, says to the poor people: "There is not the least chance that something will happen to you! You must only take a deep breath in the chamber, that widens the lungs; this inhalation is necessary because of the illnesses and epidemics." On the question of what would happen to them he answered: "Yes, of course, the men have to work, building houses and roads but the women don't need to work. Only if they wish they can help in housekeeping or in the kitchen." 

For some of these poor people this gave a little glimmer of hope, enough to go the few steps to the chambers without resistance. The majority are aware, the smell tells them of their fate! So they climb the small staircase, and then they see everything. Mothers with little children at the breast, little naked children, adults, men, women, all naked - they hesitate but they enter the death chambers, pushed forward by those behind them or driven by the leather whips of the SS. The majority without saying a word. A Jewess of about 40 years of age, with flaming eyes, calls down vengeance on the head of the murderers for the blood which is shed here. She gets 5 or 6 slashes with the riding crop into her face from Hauptmann Wirth personally, then she also disappears into the chamber. Many people pray. I pray with them, I press myself in a corner and shout loudly to my and their God. How gladly I would have entered the chamber together with them, how gladly I would have died the same death as them. Then they would have found a uniformed SS man in their chambers - the case would have been understood and treated as an accident, one man quietly missing. Still I am not allowed to do this. First I must tell what I am experiencing here! 
The chambers fill. "Pack well!" - Hauptmann Wirth has ordered. The people stand on each other's feet. 700 - 800 on 25 square metres, in 45 cubic metres! The SS physically squeezes them together, as far as is possible. 

The doors close. At the same time the others are waiting outside in the open air, naked. Someone tells me: "The same in winter!" "Yes, but they could catch their death of cold," I say. "Yes, exactly what they are here for!" says an SS man to me in his Low German. Now I finally understand why the whole installation is called the Hackenholt-Foundation. Hackenholt is the driver of the diesel engine, a little technician, also the builder of the facility. The people are brought to death with the diesel exhaust fumes. But the diesel doesn't work! Hauptmann Wirth comes. One can see that he feels embarrassed that that happens just today, when I am here. That's right, I see everything! And I wait. My stop watch has honestly registered everything. 50 minutes, 70 minutes [?] - the diesel doesn't start! The people are waiting in their gas chambers. In vain! One can hear them crying, sobbing... Hauptmann Wirth hits the Ukrainian who is helping Unterscharführer Hackenholt 12, 13 times in the face. After two hours and 49 minutes - the stop watch has registered everything well - the diesel starts. Until this moment the people live in these 4 chambers, four times 750 people in 4 times 45 cubic metres! Again 25 minutes pass. Right, many are dead now. One can see that through the small window in which the electric light illuminates the chambers for a moment. After 28 minutes only a few are still alive. Finally, after 32 minutes, everyone is dead!|''Gerstein Report''}}

==Reporting==

The final part of the report describes Gerstein's attempts to circulate his eyewitness testimony.  He reports on his chance encounter with the secretary of the Swedish legation in Berlin, Baron [[Göran von Otter]], on the Warsaw-Berlin train  "Still under the immediate impression of the terrible events, I told him everything with the entreaty to inform his government and the Allies of all of this immediately because each day's delay must cost the lives of further thousands and tens of thousands." Von Otter did talk with high-ranking officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. However, the information was not passed on to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or to any other party.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul (1985) The Destruction Of The European Jews, Student Eds p241 Holmes &amp; Meier, Teaneck&lt;/ref&gt; He also reports on his unsuccessful attempts to see the [[Papal nuncio|Papal Nuncio]] [[Cesare Orsenigo]] in Berlin. Gerstein wished to notify the Vatican.&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2000, p. 46"&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Informed of the purpose of Gerstein's visit, Orenigo refused to meet with him.&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2000, p. 46"/&gt;  Gerstein's message was eventually sent to the Vatican, by the auxiliary bishop of Berlin, not the nuncio's office, where the information reached a "dead end".&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2000, p. 46"/&gt;  In addition to these attempts, Gerstein also stated he reported these eye witness accounts to "hundreds of personages."  Although not explicitly mentioned in the 1945 report, one of these attempts was via a Dutch industrialist, J.H. Ubbink.  In February 1943, Ubbink visited Gerstein in Berlin, wherein Gerstein 

{{quote|With great indignation he told me how the gassings took place using the exhaust gas from diesel engines. He gave me all the details and told me that at that time there were 9000 deaths per day in the three camps.|Letter from J.H. Ubbink to Erika Arajs, Department of Justice in Nuremberg, dated September 14, 1949}} 

Ubbink passed this information on to a member of the [[Dutch Resistance]], Cornelius Van der Hooft who, a few days later on March 23, 1943 wrote "Tötunsanstalten in Polen" (English translation: Killing Institutions in Poland), a four-page report in Dutch which apparently remained hidden in the chicken coop of another member of the Dutch Resistance and this version only came to light in 1996.  The March report however, does seem to have been sent to the [[Dutch government-in-exile]] as on April 24, 1943, one month after the meeting between Van der Hooft and Ubbink, another version of the report inspired by Gerstein was written. Typed on paper without an official heading, and with the simplified title of "Tötungsanstalten", this version circulated within the Dutch government-in-exile, via the [[British government]] and eventually to the attention of the United States Inter-Allied Information Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Brayard, Florent (2000) An Early Report by Kurt Gerstein, Bulletin du Centre de recherche français à Jérusalem [On Line], published on line 19 May 2008, Accessed 10 March 2018. URL : http://journals.openedition.org/bcrfj/3022&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as evidence in trials==
Gerstein's report has been used as evidence in a number of high-profile cases. It was used at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] against major Nazi [[war criminals]] such as [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Hans Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Gerstein, Nuremberg Trial Document PS-1553.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also later used in the prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] by an [[Israel]]i court. More recently in 2000 it was used by [[Christopher Browning]] in the [[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Holocaust libel trial]] between [[David Irving]] and [[Deborah Lipstadt]].&lt;ref name=browning&gt;[http://hdot.org/en/trial/defense/browning/541.html Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution: Electronic Edition, by Browning, Christopher R.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
N.B. 
Some aspects of Gerstein's report includes false statements attributed to [[Odilo Globocnik]], as well as inaccurate claims regarding the total number of Jews gassed at Holocaust locations where he was not an eyewitness. Gerstein's claim that gassing of Jews occurred at Belzec was not refuted by SS-[[Standartenführer]] [[Wilhelm Pfannenstiel|Wilhelm Pfannenstiel's]] testimony at the post-war Belzec trials,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdot.org/en/trial/defense/browning/540.html HDOT : Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution: Electronic Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/p/pfannenstiel.wilhelm/ Shofar FTP Archives: people/p/pfannenstiel.wilhelm/]&lt;/ref&gt; though Pfannenstiel refuted the account in the Gerstein report in later life in a letter to Paul Rassinier. &lt;ref&gt;Dr. W. Pfannenstiel, Professor of Medicine at Marburg, had been sent to Belzec and other camps as medical adviser to improve hygiene and health care in the camps. After the war, he was repeatedly interrogated regarding his visit to Belzec with Gerstein. He was charged in two cases but never convicted. In the court-room statements, which are available to us, he never directly disputed Gerstein's account, but in a private letter he described the Gerstein Statement as "highly dubious rubbish in which 'fantasy' far outweighs fact."
He also wrote that due to the persecution and slander to which he was exposed, he did not wish to comment further on the matter publicly. In other words, Pfannenstiel had clearly tried to avoid further trouble for himself. The 'whole truth' would have been too much for his prosecutors to bear.

- Letter from Pfannenstiel to P. Rassinier, dated Aug. 3, 1963, published in W. Stäglich, U. Walendy, "NS-Bewältigung", Historische Tatsachen no. 5, Historical Review Press, Southam (GB) 1979, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;.


Holocaust historian [[Christopher Browning]] has written: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many aspects of Gerstein's testimony are unquestionably problematic. [In making] statements, such as the height of the piles of shoes and clothing at Belzec and Treblinka, Gerstein himself is clearly the source of exaggeration. Gerstein also added grossly exaggerated claims about matters to which he was not an eyewitness, such as that a total of 25 million Jews and others were gassed. But in the essential issue, namely that he was in Belzec and witnessed the gassing of a transport of Jews from Lwow, his testimony is fully corroborated .... It is also corroborated by other categories of witnesses from Belzec.&lt;ref name=browning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Robin O'Neil]] noted that Gerstein's data presented at face value about the enormous capacity of the gas chambers i.e. "four times 750 persons" has no grounds in reality.&lt;ref name="Reder/O'Neil237"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Galicia3/gal212.html | title=Appendix 5:  Rudolf Reder's "Bełzec" with Introduction by M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13317">{{Other uses|Godman (disambiguation)}}
'''Godman''' is a [[colloquial]] term used in [[India]] for a type of [[charisma]]tic [[guru]]. They usually have a high-profile presence, and are capable of attracting attention and support from large sections of the society.&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;Mehta, Uday (1993), Modern Godmen in India: A Sociological Appraisal, Mumbai: Popular Prakashan, {{ISBN|81-7154-708-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Godmen also sometimes claim to possess [[paranormal]] powers, such as [[faith healing|the ability to heal]], [[clairvoyance|the ability to see or influence future events]], and [[Telepathy|the ability to read minds]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;vq=253&amp;pg=PA253#v=snippet&amp;q=253&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 March 2014|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The origin of godmen and their popularity today can be traced back to the [[guru–shishya tradition]] of [[Hinduism]]. Godmen are revered as special human beings and often worshipped by their followers.&lt;ref name="Woodhead2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Woodhead|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwqFGUKUb58C&amp;pg=PP5|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=January 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-21783-5|page=35|quote=By far the most famous Godman of today is Sathya Sai Baba.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some godmen come from established schools of spirituality, but often they don't belong to any religious order. In Hinduism, there is no centrally established religious authority, so people tend to follow such charismatic personalities. These gurus tend to live in their own ''[[ashram]]s''. Many of these godmen acknowledge having had a guru themselves, as per the guru-shishya tradition. In recent years, many godmen have gained followers outside of India, which has increased their fame and wealth.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"/&gt;

[[Sathya Sai Baba]] (1926–2011) was a notable godman with a very large following.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodhead2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quack2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Quack|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PR14|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-981260-8|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for alleged miracles like materialising sacred ash (''[[vibhuti]]''), and other objects like watches and jewels. He was also involved in charitable works, which include a hospital and a university.&lt;ref name="Woodhead2002"/&gt;

There are also female gurus who are considered divine and are revered by their followers. Some of them are spouses and collaborators of notable male gurus. Female gurus who are considered to be divine or saintly by their followers include [[Mirra Alfassa]] (1878–1973), [[Anandamayi Ma]] (1896–1982), [[Mata Amritanandamayi]] (1953–), and [[Mother Meera]] (1960–).&lt;ref name="Woodhead2002"/&gt;

Although few godmen have allowed their powers to be examined scientifically, [[Swami Rama]] became famous by participating in the [[biofeedback]] research conducted by Elmer Green at the [[Menninger Foundation]] around 1970.&lt;ref name="AnkerbergWeldon1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ankerberg|author2=John Weldon|title=Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SghdYBbMds0C&amp;pg=PA598|year=1996|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=978-1-56507-160-5|pages=598–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swingle2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul G.

==Political patronage==
Several godmen have found patronage among politicians and other high-ranking officials. Sathya Sai Baba had several devotees in the political field. They include [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] leader [[L. K. Advani]] .&lt;ref name=hocus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political leaders condole Sai Baba's death|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/political-leaders-condole-sai-babas-death/1/136188.html|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=24 April 2011|quote=I first came in contact with him shortly after my incarceration in the Bangalore Central Jail during the 1975-77 Emergency.

Later, [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) conducted surveys of the site on 12 October and announced an excavation on 15 October.

==Skepticism and debunking==
The [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]] has organised seminars showing how the so-called miracles are actually performed by [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name=TricksRevealed&gt;{{cite news|title=Tricks revealed|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/yw/2003/05/31/stories/2003053100110300.htm|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=31 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]] travel to villages across India and perform shows to debunk the miracles, educating villagers to prevent them from giving money to godmen.&lt;ref name=ExposeMiracle&gt;{{cite news|title=Rationalists expose miracle men to villagers|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10584228|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti]] and [[Mumbai Rationalist Association]] are also actively engaged in exposing false claims of spiritual gurus.  

===Common miracles and explanations===
* [[Levitation (paranormal)|Levitation]] of a person under a blanket: The trick is done by lying on the floor covered by a blanket and slowly raising oneself using two [[hockey stick]]s.&lt;ref name=GuruFraudsters&gt;{{cite news|title=Exposed: the tricks of India's 'guru' fraudsters|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/exposed-the-tricks-of-indias-guru-fraudsters#full|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |location=Abu Dhabi |date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Levitation (paranormal)|Levitation]] of a person holding a stick: In this trick, the person appears to be floating above a mat supported only by bamboo stick held in his hand. The hollow bamboo stick and performer's robes contain a [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]] which supports the person's weight and a rod runs through the bamboo and is anchored hidden under the mat.&lt;ref name=TwilightZone/&gt;
* Making rocks explode by sprinkling holy water: The rocks have sodium crystals embedded in them, which reacts to ordinary water and expands rapidly.&lt;ref name=GuruFraudsters/&gt;
* Creating fire by pouring [[ghee]] on wood: The wood pile contains potassium permanganate. It reacts to the glycerine, which is passed off as ghee and catches fire.&lt;ref name=GuruFraudsters/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwilightZone/&gt;
* [[Fire eating]] or carrying flames on palm: A cube of burning [[camphor]] can be held safely for a few seconds, by practice. It can also be held on the tongue. If the camphor becomes too hot, the performer exhales and closes the mouth, putting off the flame.&lt;ref name=TwilightZone&gt;{{cite news|title=Confrontation in the Twilight zone|url=http://www.sify.com/finance/confrontation-in-the-twilight-zone-news-default-ni5bUiigeagsi.html|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=[[Sify]]|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fire walking|Walking on burning coals]]: There is salt sprinkled on the coal which draws moisture; or the performer has wet his feet, forming a layer of dirt on them. If the performer walks quickly, he will not get burned.&lt;ref name=TwilightZone/&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
The Indian spiritual leader [[Ravi Shankar (spiritual leader)|Ravi Shankar]] has objected to the use of the word godman, preferring instead [[guru]] in reference to his activities.&lt;ref name=DiffFolks&gt;{{cite news|title=Different Folks, Different Strokes|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Different-Folks-Different-Strokes/226164|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=[[Outlook India]]|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Gautier]] has opposed the usage of the term godman to describe Shankar and [[Sathya Sai Baba]]. He has pointed out that Shankar's organisation, the [[Art of Living Foundation|Art of Living]],  has done much social work.&lt;ref name=Gautier&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the cynicism about Indian gurus?|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/mar/12franc.htm|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=[[Rediff]]|date=12 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gautier2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=François Gautier|title=A Western Journalist on India: The Ferengi's Columns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o56i5ymOIBkC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=24 January 2015|year=2001|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=978-81-241-0795-9|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Grande Enciclopédia Portuguesa e Brasileira''''' (''Great Portuguese and Brazilian Encyclopaedia'') is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] 40-volume encyclopedia, published between 1936 and 1960 by [[Editorial Enciclopédia]].

It is both a dictionary, focusing on the study and the presentation of the words of the [[Portuguese language]], and an encyclopaedia, covering all branches of knowledge. Articles are illustrated by drawings, photographs and maps. It is an especially rich resource for the [[History of Portugal|history]] and [[Culture of Portugal|culture]] of [[Portugal]], and for some decades it was considered as the standard encyclopedia in Portugal.

10 supplemental volumes were published between 1981 and 1987.

In 1998-1999 another six-volume supplement was published by a new company, [[Edições Zairol]].

The '''''Grito de Lares''''' (''Cry of Lares'')&amp;mdash;also referred to as the '''Lares uprising''', the '''Lares revolt''', the '''Lares rebellion''', or the '''Lares revolution'''&amp;mdash;was the first major revolt against [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Spanish rule]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. The short-lived revolt was planned by [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] and [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]]. It began on September 23, 1868, in the town of [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], for which it is named, and spread rapidly to various revolutionary cells throughout the island.

==Seeds for revolt==
&lt;!-- This part needs a good expansion, badly... [[User:Demf|DEMF]]--&gt;

In the 1860s, the government of Spain was involved in several conflicts across Latin America. It became involved in [[Chincha Islands War|a war]] with [[Peru]] and [[Chile]], and had to address slave revolts in [[Cuba]]. At the time, Puerto Rico and Cuba also suffered  a severe economic crisis, due to increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish central government on most import and export goods&amp;mdash;the Spanish crown needed these funds badly, to subsidize its troops in the [[Dominican Republic]].

In mid-19th century Puerto Rico, many supporters of independence from Spain, as well as others who did not support independence from Spain, but who simply called for liberal reforms, were jailed or exiled. However, in 1865, the central government in Madrid, finally attempted to appease the growing discontent in all its overseas provinces by setting up a "board of review" to receive complaints from provincial representatives. This board, the ''Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar'' (Informative Board on Overseas Reforms) would be formed by representatives of each overseas province, in proportion to their collective population. The board would meet in [[Madrid]], then report to the Minister of State (Ministro de Estado), [[Emilio Castelar]].&lt;ref name="JIRU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historiapr.wordpress.com/category/junta-informativa-de-reformas/|title=Junta Informativa de Reformas « Puerto Rico: su transformación en el tiempo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JU"&gt;"Junta Informativa de Ultramar"; Author	Spain. Ministerio de Ultramar; Publisher: Imp. de la Biblioteca Universal Economica, 1869&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puerto Rican delegation was freely elected by those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), in what was one of the first exercises of political openness in Spain. Separatist [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]] was elected to the Junta representing [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], something that horrified the governor of Puerto Rico as well as most of residents of the island, since the majority of Puerto Ricans did not support independence from the rest of Spain.&lt;ref name="JIRU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JU"/&gt; 
[[File:Dr. Ramon Betances.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Ramón Emeterio Betances]]
To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including their leader [[José Julián Acosta]], the Junta had a majority of mainland Spain-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested, including the measure on the abolition of slavery. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). [[Emilio Castelar y Ripoll]], once he became minister for foreign affairs in 1870, finally approved an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rican members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.&lt;ref name="JIRU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JU"/&gt;

Beyond abolition however, proposals for autonomy were voted down, as were other petitions to limit the governor general's power over virtually every aspect of life in Puerto Rico. Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico, they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], in early 1865.
 
[[Ramón Emeterio Betances]], who supported independence from Spain and had been exiled by the Spanish government twice by that time, was invited by Ruiz and did attend. After listening to the Junta members' list of voted-down measures, Betances stood up and retorted: ''"[[Nemo dat quod non habet|Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene]]"'' (You can't give away what you don't own),&lt;ref name="CAPR"&gt;''Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico''; Vol. 63, Num 1; January 2002;  "El Mito Americano"; pg. 1; by Alberto Medina Carrero&lt;/ref&gt;  a phrase he used throughout his entire life, when referring to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.

Betances then suggested an outright, island-wide rebellion, with a proclamation of independence as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="CAPR"/&gt; To Acosta's horror, many of the meeting's attendees sided with Betances.

Frustrated by the lack of political and [[economic freedom]], by the continuing repression on the island — all of this caused by the extreme centralism of the Spanish central government in Madrid — an armed rebellion was staged by the pro-independence movement soon after.

==Rebellion==

===Planning stage===
[[File:Casa de Manuel Rojas.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Manuel Rojas house in 1965]]
The Lares uprising, commonly known as the ''Grito de Lares,'' occurred on September 23, 1868, but was planned well before that date. A group led by Dr. [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] and [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]] founded the [[Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico]] ({{lang|es|Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico}}) on January 6, 1868 from their exile in the Dominican Republic.

Betances authored several ''Proclamas,'' or statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish centralist system and called for immediate insurrection. These statements soon circulated throughout the island as local dissident groups began to organize.&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/lhbpr.02727 |title=Historia de la Insurrección de Lares |language=Spanish |date=1872 |first1=José |last1=Pérez Morís |first2=Luis |last2=Cueto y González Quijano |publisher=Establecimiento Tipográfico de Narciso Ramírez y Compañía }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, ''Los Diez Mandamientos de los hombres libres'' (''The Ten Commandments of Free Men'') written in exile in Saint Thomas in November 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciudadseva.com/textos/otros/10manda.htm |title=Proclama de los Diez Mandamientos de los Hombres Libres |first=Ramón |last=Emeterio Betances |language=Spanish |date=November 1867 |accessdate={{date|2014-01-21|mdy}} |publisher=Biblioteca Digital Ciudad Seva }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ojeda Reyes, Félix, ''El Desterrado de París'', p. 103. The original manuscript is owned by the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], which bought it in 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; It is directly based on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted by France's National Assembly in 1789, which contained the principles that inspired the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Moscoso"&gt;Moscoso, Francisco, [http://www.vozdelcentro.org/mp3/prog_144.mp3 Betances, El Grito y St. Thomas].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LARESFLAG2.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The revolutionary flag of Lares, also known as the "First Puerto Rican Flag"]]
That same year, poet [[Lola Rodríguez de Tió]], inspired by Ramón Emeterio Betances's quest for Puerto Rico's independence, wrote the patriotic lyrics to the existing tune of [[La Borinqueña]], Puerto Rico's national anthem.

Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances, provided [[Mariana Bracetti]] with the materials for the [[Flags of Puerto Rico|Revolutionary Flag of Lares]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://familia.rootsweb.ancestry.com/articles/Beauchamp/Nuestra_Herencia.pdf |title=Beauchamp history |first=Kathy |last=Rodríguez |publisher=''Nuestra Herencia'' |volume=13.3 |accessdate={{date|2014-01-21|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner.&lt;ref name="Bracerri"&gt;The Women from Puerto Rico. [http://users.aol.com/boriken01/mariana.htm ''Mariana Bracetti'']. Retrieved on September 26, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708224516/http://users.aol.com/boriken01/mariana.htm |date=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Puerto Rican poet [[Luis Lloréns Torres]] the white cross stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.&lt;ref name="enciclo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=06101303|title=Grito de Lares 1868|work=Encyclopedia of Puerto Rico|publisher=Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secret cells of the Revolutionary Committee were established in Puerto Rico by [[Mathias Brugman]], Mariana Bracetti and [[Manuel Rojas (independence leader)|Manuel Rojas]] bringing together members from all sectors of society including landowners, merchants, professionals, peasants, and slaves. Most were ''criollos'' (Caucasians born on the island).
{{-}}
[[File:Manuel Rojas drawing.jpg|160px|thumb|General Manuel Rojas ]]
The Revolutionary Committee named twelve of their members as ''generales'' (generals).&lt;ref&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico, Coleccion Encuentros'' bBy Negroni, Hector Andres (1992) {{es icon}}; publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario. {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were:
*[[Manuel Rojas (independence leader)|Manuel Rojas]], Commander-in-Chief of the Liberation Army
*[[Andrés Pol]], General of Division
*[[Juan de Mata Terraforte]], General of Division
*[[Joaquín Parrilla]], General of Division
*[[Nicolás Rocafort]], General of Division
*[[Gabino Plumey]], General of Division
*[[Dorvid Beauchamp]], General of Division
*[[Mathias Brugman|Mathías Brugman]], General of Division
*[[Rafael Arroyo]], General of Division
*[[Francisco Arroyo]], General of Division
*[[Pablo Rivera]], Cavalry General 
*[[Abdón Pagán]], Artillery General

The critical state of the economy, slavery, and the increasing political repression from the Spanish central government, served as catalysts for the rebellion. &lt;br /&gt;
The stronghold of the movement were towns located in the mountains, on the western part of the island.

On September 20, [[Francisco Ramírez Medina]] held a meeting at his house in which the insurrection was planned and set to begin in [[Camuy, Puerto Rico|Camuy]] on September 29. The meeting was attended by [[Marcelino Vega]], [[Carlos Martínez (Puerto Rico)|Carlos Martínez]], [[Bonifacio Agüero]], José Antonio Hernández, Ramón Estrella, Bartolomé González, Cesilio López, Antonio Santiago, Manuel Ramírez, Ulises Cancela. Cancela  instructed Manuel María González to deliver all of the acts and important papers in regard to the meeting to Manuel Rojas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notihistoriadominicana.blogspot.com/2007_07_01_archive.html ''El Pueblo de Lares Antes de la Rebelion de 1868. Las Conspiraciones y Sus Causas''] by Francisco Modesto Berroa Ubiera, Professor of the Escuela de Historia, and former director of the institute of History of the Humanities Faculty of the Autonumous University of Santo Domingo {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Castañón, a captain stationed in [[Quebradillas, Puerto Rico|Quebradillas]], overheard two cell members commenting that on September 29 the troops at [[Camuy, Puerto Rico|Camuy]] would be neutralized by poisoning the bread rations. Given the fact that September 29 would be a holiday for most laborers, simultaneous uprisings would occur, beginning with the cell in Camuy, and following with the ones in various other points; reinforcements would arrive on a ship, ''El Telégrafo'', and the cells would be reinforced by more than 3,000 mercenaries. Castañón and his men then entered González's residence and confiscated the documents of Medina's meeting and alerted his commanding officer in Arecibo. The cell leaders at the ''Lanzador del Norte'' cell in Camuy were soon arrested.

On another front, the Dominican government had supported [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]]. They allowed him to recruit a small army, and gave him a ship containing weapons. However, when the ship was about to sail, the Spanish government made its move. It prohibited the ship's departure from Dominican territory. The authorities in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]], where the ship was anchored, boarded the vessel and confiscated its cargo.

Seeing their plans disrupted, the other leaders feared arrest. They decided to change the date of the revolution for an earlier one without consulting Betances.&lt;ref name="HL"/&gt;

===Proclamation of the Republic of Puerto Rico===
[[File:ChurchofLares.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Roman Catholic Church of Lares and Monument to the Grito at the Plaza de la Revolución]]
The leaders decided to start their revolution in the town of Lares on September 23. Some 400&amp;ndash;600 rebels gathered on that day in the hacienda of Manuel Rojas, located in the vicinity of Pezuela, on the outskirts of Lares. Led by Rojas and Juan de Mata Terraforte, the poorly trained and sparsely armed rebels reached the town by horse and foot around midnight. They looted local stores and offices owned by ''peninsulares'' (Spanish mainland-born men) and took over the city hall.  Spanish mainland-born merchants and Puerto Rican government authorities, considered by the rebels as enemies of the fatherland, were taken as prisoners.

The rebels then entered the town's church and placed the revolutionary flag of Lares on the High Altar. This was the sign that the revolution had begun. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed at (2:00 am local time) under the presidency of [[Francisco Ramírez Medina]] at the church and the revolutionaries offered freedom to the slaves who joined them. President Ramírez Medina appointed Government officials as follows:

*[[Francisco Ramírez Medina]], President
*[[Aurelio Méndez]], Minister of the Interior
*[[Manuel Ramírez (Puerto Rico)|Manuel Ramírez]], Minister of State
*[[Celedonio Abril]], Minister of the Treasury
*[[Federico Valencia]], Minister of War
*[[Clemente Millán]], Minister of Justice
*[[Bernabé Pol]], Secretary to the President
*[[Manuel Rojas (independence leader)|Manuel Rojas]], Commander in Chief of the Liberation Army

===Confrontation at San Sebastián===
The next day, on September 24, the rebel forces departed to take over the next town, [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico|San Sebastián del Pepino]]. The Puerto Rican militia surprised them with strong resistance, by moving troops from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], and several other towns. This caused confusion amongst the rebels, who were greatly disadvantaged without the weapons provided by Betances.

The insurgents retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, [[Julián Pavía]], the militia soon rounded them up, and the insurrection was over.

===Trials and amnesty===
[[File:General Juan Ríus Rivera.jpg|150px|left|thumb|General Juan Ríus Rivera]]
Some 475 rebels, among them Dr. [[José Gualberto Padilla]] (leader of the Arecibo cell), [[Manuel Rojas (independence leader)|Manuel Rojas]] and [[Mariana Bracetti]] were imprisoned in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], where they were tortured and humiliated.  On November 17, a military court imposed the death penalty, for treason and sedition, on all the prisoners.

Meanwhile, in Madrid, [[Eugenio María de Hostos]] and other prominent Puerto Ricans were successful in interceding with President Francisco Serrano, who had himself just led a revolution against the monarchy in Spain. In an effort to appease the already tense atmosphere on the island, the incoming governor, José Laureano Sanz, dictated a general amnesty early in 1869 and all prisoners were released. However Betances, Rojas, Lacroix, Aurelio Méndez, and many others were sent into exile.&lt;ref name="enciclo"/&gt;

As a young man, [[Juan Ríus Rivera]] met and befriended Betances, and joined the pro-independence movement in the island. He became a member of the Mayagüez revolutionary cell ''Capá Prieto'' under the command of  Brugman. Although he was studying law in Spain, and therefore had not participated in the Lares uprising, Ríus Rivera was an avid follower of Caribbean politics. When he learned about the failed revolt, he interrupted his law studies and traveled to the United States, where he immediately went to the Cuba Revolutionary ''Junta'' and offered his services. Juan Ríus Rivera went to Cuba and became the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the west after General Antonio Maceo's death.

Mariana Bracetti moved to the town of [[Añasco, Puerto Rico|Añasco]], where she died in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinavoz.com/ArticleArchive.php?ID=52 Madrinas to us all: Significant Latinas in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302061503/http://www.thelatinavoz.com/ArticleArchive.php?ID=52 |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Junta Revolucionaria.jpg|right|thumb|Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee&lt;br /&gt;(standing L-R) Manuel Besosa, Aurelio Méndez Martínez, and Sotero Figueroa (seated L-R) Juan de Mata Terreforte, Dr. Jose Julio Henna and Roberto H. Todd]]

Although the revolt failed to achieve its main objective, the Spanish government granted more political autonomy to the island.

During the years immediately following the Grito, there were minor pro-independence protests and skirmishes with the Spanish authorities in [[Las Marías, Puerto Rico|Las Marías]], [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico|Adjuntas]], [[Utuado, Puerto Rico|Utuado]], [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]], [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]], [[Ciales, Puerto Rico|Ciales]] and [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]] (Palo Seco).&lt;ref&gt;Moscoso, Francisco, as quoted by Collado Schwarz, Ángel, ''Voces de la Cultura'', Fundación La Voz del Centro, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan de Mata Terreforte, who fought alongside Manuel Rojas, was exiled to New York City. He joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee and was named its Vice-President.&lt;ref name="enciclo"/&gt; Terreforte and the members of the Revolutionary committee adopted the Flag of Lares as the flag of Puerto Rico until 1892, when the current design, modeled after the [[Cuban flag]], was unveiled and adopted by the committee.&lt;ref name="enciclo"/&gt;

=== The Grito de Lares as a holiday ===
Commemorating the Grito de Lares as a holiday was outlawed in Puerto Rico by both the Puerto Rican/Spanish and American administrations, during different time periods.

In the late 1920s members of the [[Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico]] staged minor celebrations in the town of Lares as both historical and fund-raising efforts. When [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] gained control over the party, "frivolous" activities related to the Grito (such as the yearly fundraising dance) were terminated, and a series of rituals to commemorate the event in a dignified manner were instituted. One of Albizu's better known quotes is: ''"Lares es Tierra Santa, y como tal, debe entrarse a ella de rodillas"'' ("Lares is Sacred Ground, and as such, it must be entered on your knees").

Key to the rituals associated with the Grito is the gift, given by Chilean writer [[Gabriela Mistral]] to Albizu's family, of a [[tamarind]] tree obtained from [[Simón Bolívar]]'s estate in [[Venezuela]]. The tree was planted at the Plaza de la Revolución with soil taken from the eighteen other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Albizu meant to give the Plaza a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]], promised to assist the Puerto Rico independence movement, but whose promise never materialized due to the simple fact that most Puerto Ricans did not want the island's independence from Spain), as well as a symbol of the bittersweet (as the trees' fruit) hardships needed to reach Puerto Rico's independence. As such, the ''Tamarindo de Don Pedro'' was meant to resemble the [[Gernikako Arbola]] in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] between Spain and France.

In 1969, under the administration of Governor [[Luis A. Ferré]] (not an independence supporter, he was a US statehood supporter), Lares was declared a Historic Site by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, and is known as the birthplace of Puerto Rican nationalism.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Jay Malcolm Kennedy''' (April 18, 1956 – March 15, 2007) was an American [[editing|editor]] and writer. The author of ''The Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide'', he was a long-time editor at [[King Features Syndicate]], eventually rising to the position of editor-in-chief.

Kennedy wrote articles about the history of cartooning, and he profiled cartoonists and contemporary comics for magazines, including ''[[New Age Journal]]'', ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]'', an English bi-monthly. His interest in cartooning, he once explained, was because:
:In the fine arts, artists generally comment on the world only obliquely; and sadly, only those people who have the leisure to study art history can fully appreciate their comments. By contrast, cartoons are an art form accessible to all people.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Steven. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/arts/19kennedy.html "Jay Kennedy, 50, an Editor and Scholar of Comic Strips, Is Dead,"] ''New York Times'' (MARCH 19, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; They can simply laugh at the jokes or look beyond them to see the artist's view of the world. Cartoons are multileveled art accessible to everyone at whatever level they choose to enjoy.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], Kennedy grew up in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], working in a picture frame store while he was in high school. After studying [[Sculpture|sculpting]] and [[conceptual art]] at New York's [[School of Visual Arts]],&lt;ref name=Heller /&gt; Kennedy graduated with a [[sociology]] degree from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. At the University he was an active member of the Pail &amp; Shovel Party, a student group dedicated to bringing humor to student government via absurdist and playful pranks. Kennedy drew posters and flyers for the group and took part in many activities, including the famous Pink Flamingo planting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/001660.asp''Wisconsin Historical Society'' "Bascom Hill Pink Flamingo"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was the author of ''The Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide'' (Boatner Norton Press, 1982), the first price guide to the [[underground comix]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Much of the information in that book was based on Kennedy's personal collection of more than 9,500 comix.

From 1983 to 1988, he served as [[cartoon]] editor of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' where he edited and co-wrote [[Lynda Barry]]'s ''Modern Romance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlysmagazine.com/load.html?content=http%3A//www.marlysmagazine.com/interviews/iris.htm''Iris: A Journal about Women, #20, Fall / Winter 1988'' "Dividing Them from Us Within Ourselves, A Conversation with Lynda Barry"]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Kennedy was a humor book agent as well as a cartoon consultant and editor for magazines and publishers, including ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and [[Chris Whittle|Whittle Communications]]. In 1985, he was a guest editor for the “European Humor” issue released by the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.

He joined [[King Features Syndicate]] in 1988 as deputy [[Comic strip|comics]] editor and became comics editor one year later. He began as King Features' editor-in-chief in 1997. He made a point of championing strips created by female cartoonists, including Hilary B. Price's ''[[Rhymes with Orange]]'', Sandra Bell-Lundy's ''[[Between Friends (comics)|Between Friends]]'', and [[Rina Piccolo]]'s ''[[Tina's Groove]]''; as well as Six Chex, a rotating series of female-made strips.&lt;ref name=Heller /&gt; In 2006, Kennedy introduced King Features' [[DailyINK]], an online service that costs $19.99 annually and makes available, on a web page and via email, more than 90 vintage and current comic strips, puzzles and editorial cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyink.com DailyINK]&lt;/ref&gt; The vintage strips have included ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', ''[[Buz Sawyer]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', ''[[The Little King]]'', ''[[The Phantom]]'' and ''[[Rip Kirby]]''.

== Death ==
Kennedy, who lived in New York City and [[Orient, New York|Orient Point, Long Island]], died March 15, 2007, while vacationing in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingfeatures.com/2007/01/jay-kennedy-editor-in-chief-of-king-features-syndicate-dead-at-50/ "Jay Kennedy, Editor in Chief of King Features Syndicate, Dead at 50,"] King Features Syndicate website (Jan. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; He drowned after having been caught in a riptide. His wife, Sarah Jewler, the managing editor of ''New York'' magazine, had died in 2005. King Features appointed associate editor Brendan Burford to the position of comics editor on April 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Departments/Syndicates/brendan-burford-appointed-comics-editor-of-king-features-24078-.aspx ''Editor &amp; Publisher'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's memorial service, held in Manhattan in mid-April 2007, was attended by notables from the world of cartooning and comics, including [[Bunny Hoest]], [[John Reiner]], [[Sam Gross]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Mort Gerberg]], [[Isabella Bannerman]], [[Rina Piccolo]], [[Irwin Hasen]], [[Jim Salicrup]], [[Maggie Thompson]] [[Chris Browne]], [[Arnie Roth]], [[Dan Piraro]], [[Jim Borgman]], [[Mike Lynch (cartoonist)|Mike Lynch]], [[Mort Walker]], [[Patrick McDonnell]], and [[Matt Groening]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Mike. [http://mikelynchcartoons.blogspot.pt/2007/04/jay-kennedy-memorial.html "Jay Kennedy Memorial,"] Mike Lynch Cartoons (April 17, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In memory of Kennedy, King Features established the Jay Kennedy Memorial Scholarship Fund, which is "designed to acknowledge excellence among college-aged aspiring cartoonists". Through the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Foundation, the Jay Kennedy Memorial Scholarship is awarded yearly to a deserving college student for their junior or senior year based on the judging of submitted work to the Foundation’s panel of professional cartoonists. The award is presented at the annual NCS [[Reuben Awards]] dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Departments/Syndicates/deadline-approaches-for-jay-kennedy-scholarship-for-college-cartoonists-22304-.aspx "Deadline Approaches for Jay Kennedy Scholarship for College Cartoonists,"] ''Editor &amp; Publisher''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's underground comix collection was later donated to the [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoons.osu.edu/?q=content/about-us "About Us,"] Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Königsberg City Archive''' ({{lang-de|Stadtarchiv Königsberg}}) was the municipal [[archive]] of [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]].

The towns of [[Altstadt (Königsberg)|Altstadt]], [[Kneiphof]], and [[Löbenicht]] were united to form the city of Königsberg in 1724. The city's archives were subsequently located in [[Altstadt Town Hall]], but moved to the original campus of the [[University of Königsberg]] in Kneiphof in 1911/12. Its directors included [[August Wittich]] (1875 to 1897), [[Ernst Seraphim]] (1911), [[Christian Krollmann]] (1924), and [[Fritz Gause]] (1938).

The [[Nazi Party]] did not take an interest in the archive during ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''. However, Gauleiter [[Erich Koch]] prevented the archive from being evacuated in 1944 during [[World War II]]. It was subsequently destroyed by the 1944 [[bombing of Königsberg]] and the 1945 [[Battle of Königsberg]].

'''LARES''' (acronym for '''Laser Relativity Satellite''') (COSPAR ID [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=2012-006A 2012-006A]) is an [[Italian Space Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/it/attivita/cosmologia/lares |title=LARES: Satellite per misure relativistiche |publisher=[[Agenzia Spaziale Italiana]] |accessdate=2009-03-12 |language=it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015073418/http://www.asi.it/it/attivita/cosmologia/lares |archivedate=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; scientific [[satellite]] launched from the [[ESA]] [[Guiana Space Centre]] of [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], by the maiden flight of the European launch vehicle [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] on 13 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Launchers_Access_to_Space/SEMH3E67ESD_0.html |title=Vega Launch Vehicle |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-vega/vega_overview.asp |title=Vega overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330165121/http://arianespace.com/launch-services-vega/vega_overview.asp |archivedate=2009-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/vega/vv01/111207lares/ |title=Prepping satellite to test Albert Einstein }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMK3RGXTWG_index_0.html |title=Overview of ESA activities in 2012 of interest to media. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved version called LARES 2 is scheduled for launch in late 2019, on the maiden flight of [[Vega-C]].&lt;ref name=gunter-lares2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/lares-2.htm |title=LARES 2 |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''LARES'' satellite is the densest known object orbiting in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="laresHome"/&gt;

==Mission==
The satellite, completely passive, is made of tungsten alloy and houses 92 cube corner [[retroreflectors]] that are used to track the satellite via laser from stations on Earth ([[satellite laser ranging]]). ''LARES'''s body has a diameter of about {{convert|36.4|cm|0}} and weighs about {{convert|400|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Peroni |first1=I. |display-authors=etal |date=2007 |title=The Design of LARES: A satellite for testing General Relativity |url=http://www.iafastro.net/iac/archive/browse/IAC-07/B4/2/7406/ |booktitle=Proceedings of the 58th International Astronautical Congress |bibcode= |id=IAC-07-B4.2.07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LARES was inserted in an [[orbit]] with {{convert|1450|km|0}} of [[perigee]], an inclination of 69.5 degrees and reduced eccentricity. The satellite is tracked by the [[International Laser Ranging Service]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |title=International Laser Ranging Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/satellite_missions/current_missions/lars_general.html#info |title=LARES page on the ILRS Site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific goals==
The main scientific target of the LARES mission is the measurement of the [[Lense–Thirring precession|Lense–Thirring effect]], also known as [[frame-dragging]], with an accuracy of about 1%, according to its proponent, [[Ignazio Ciufolini]] (Principal Investigator of the mission), and the LARES Scientific Team.&lt;ref name="Ciufolini2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ciufolini |first1=I. |author2=Paolozzi A. |author3=Pavlis E.

'''Les Pintades''' is a French thematic [[travel]] [[guide book]] series targeted towards women. It was created by [[Layla Demay]] and [[Laure Watrin]] two French [[journalists]]. It is currently published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] [[subsidiary Calmann-Levy]].

The series began in 2004 with the publication of [[Pintades in New York book]] ([[Les Pintades à New York]]). Les Pintades has expanded to include 9 guidebooks. 
As per the website www.edistat.com, more than 150.000 books have been sold since Les Pintades inception.

Les Pintades also produced a travel documentary series for French paid channel [[Canal+]].

On the Internet, Les Pintades are blogging about [[travel]].

==The concept and its origins==

In 2004, [[Layla Demay]] and [[Laure Watrin]] launched the book series Les Pintades. Each book, half [[travel guide]], half anthropological essay, provides hundreds of addresses, as well as chronicles about [[Fads and trends|trends]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]].

A '''letter of thanks''' or '''thank-you letter''' is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] that is used when one person/party wishes to express appreciation to another.  Personal thank-you letters are sometimes hand-written in cases in which the addressee is a friend, acquaintance or relative. Thank-you letters are also sometimes referred to as '''letters of gratitude'''. These types of thank-you letters are usually written as formal business letters.

Some psychological research indicates that expressing gratitude by writing such letters can have emotional benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toepfer|first=Steven M.|last2=Cichy|first2=Kelly|last3=Peters|first3=Patti|date=2011-04-07|title=Letters of Gratitude: Further Evidence for Author Benefits|journal=[[Journal of Happiness Studies]]|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=187–201|doi=10.1007/s10902-011-9257-7|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not apply to all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sansone|first=Randy A.|last2=Sansone|first2=Lori A.|date=November 2010|title=Gratitude and Well Being|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010965/|journal=[[Psychiatry MMC|Psychiatry (Edgmont)]]|volume=7|issue=11|pages=18–22|issn=1550-5952|pmc=3010965|pmid=21191529|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media have covered the tradition of handwritten letters of thanks from a cultural perspective, suggesting in particular that the extra effort represented by handwriting (as opposed to [[text messaging]], for example) makes these letters more emotionally significant for sender and recipient alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Trebay|first=Guy|title=The Found Art of Thank-You Notes|date=4 April 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/fashion/the-found-art-of-thank-you-notes.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/26/132263637/perfect-thank-you-notes-heartfelt-and-handwritten|title=Perfect Thank You Notes: Heartfelt And Handwritten|last=|first=|date=2010-12-22|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters to a Young Poet''''' (original title, in German: '''''Briefe an einen jungen Dichter''''') is a collection of ten letters written by Bohemian-Austrian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926) to [[Franz Xaver Kappus]] (1883–1966), a 19-year-old officer cadet at the [[Theresian Military Academy]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].  Rilke, the son of an Austrian army officer, had studied at the academy's lower school at [[Sankt Pölten]] in the 1890s.  Kappus corresponded with the popular poet and author from 1902 to 1908 seeking his advice as to the quality of his poetry, and in deciding between a literary career or a career as an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. Kappus compiled and published the letters in 1929—three years after Rilke's death from [[leukemia]].

In the first letter, Rilke respectfully declines to review or criticize Kappus' poetry, advising the younger Kappus that "Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself."&lt;ref name="1stLtrGoIntoYourselfquote"&gt;Rainer Maria Rilke to Franz Xaver Kappus (Paris, 17 February 1903), compiled as the first letter in Rilke, Rainer Maria. ''Letters to a Young Poet'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  Rilke, over the course of the ten letters proceeds to advise Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art.  These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process.  Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of ''[[The Book of Hours|Das Stunden-Buch]]'' (''The Book of Hours'') and ''[[The Book of Images|Das Buch der Bilder]]'' (''The Book of Images'').&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Ralph.

(Rochester, New York: Camden House Publishing, 2001), 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and publication==
[[File:Rilke, 1900.jpg|thumb|The author of the letters: Rainer Maria Rilke]]

===Correspondence with Rilke===
In 1929, Franz Xaver Kappus compiled ten letters that he received from Rainer Maria Rilke that were written from 1902 to 1908 and published them under the title ''Briefe an einen jungen Dichter'' (''Letters to a Young Poet'') through [[Insel Verlag]] in [[Leipzig]].  Rilke and Kappus never met in person.&lt;ref&gt;van den Leun, Justine. [http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/06/14/meeting-the-goose/ "Meeting the Goose,"] in ''The Paris Review Daily'' (blog belonging to the quarterly literary publication ''The Paris Review'') (14 June 2010). Retrieved 12 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to the collection, Kappus recounts how he came to write to Rainer Maria Rilke.  According to Kappus, in late 1902 while a student at the [[Theresian Military Academy]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]] in [[Lower Austria]], he was reading Rilke's poetry.&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro"&gt;Kappus, Franz Xaver. "Introduction" in ''Letters to a Young Poet.'' (Leipzig: Insel Verlag, 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was approached by the academy's chaplain, Horacek, who noted that Rilke had been a pupil years earlier at the academy's lower school at [[Sankt Pölten]].&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro" /&gt; Horacek expressed surprise that the former pupil had "become a poet" and described to Kappus the young Rilke as a "thin, pale boy" whose quiet demeanor proved unable to bear the strain of a military education and life.&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LYPNorton1993trans"&gt;Rilke, Rainer Maria and Kappus, Franz Xaver. ''Letters to a Young Poet'' in an edition by M.D. Herter Norton (translator). (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Rilke did not continue his military education.&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro" /&gt;  At the time that Kappus learned this he was inclined toward writing and was not very keen on the notion of dedicating his life to the military.&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro" /&gt;  Kappus then decided to write to Rilke for advice.&lt;ref name="Kappus1929Intro" /&gt;

When Kappus wrote his first letter to Rilke he asked for Rilke to provide a critique of his poetry.  Rilke provided the young Kappus very little in criticism or in suggestions for his improvement as a poet.  Instead, Rilke discouraged Kappus from reading criticism and advised him to trust his inner judgment, commenting that "Nobody can advise you and help you. Nobody. There is only one way—Go into yourself."&lt;ref name="1stLtrGoIntoYourselfquote" /&gt;  Rilke provided advice that inspired Kappus to search broader issues of intimacy and the nature of beauty and art, as well as probing philosophical and existential questions.  The letters address personal issues that Kappus had apparently revealed to Rilke; ranging from atheism, loneliness, and career choices.

The collection does not include Kappus' letters to Rilke, though the original German collection does include one sonnet of Kappus' own that Rilke sent back to him in Rilke's handwriting with the instruction to "Read the lines as if they were unknown to you, and you will feel in your inmost self how very much they are yours."

===Rilke's influence on Kappus===
{{See also|Franz Xaver Kappus}}
Aside from his role in writing to Rilke and later publishing these letters, Franz Xaver Kappus (1883–1966) is largely forgotten by history.  Kappus was descended from a [[Banat Swabians|Banat Swabian]] (ethnic German) family born in [[Timișoara]], in the [[Banat]] region, now divided between [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]].  Despite the hesitancy he expressed in his letters to Rilke about pursuing a military career, he continued his military studies and served for 15 years as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army.  During the course of his life, he worked as a newspaper editor and journalist, writing poems, humorous sketches, short-stories, novels, and adapted several works (including his own) into screenplays for films in the 1930s.  However, Kappus did not achieve lasting fame.&lt;ref&gt;Tullius, Nick and Leeb, Alex (editors). [http://www.dvhh.org/banat_biographies/kappus-franz-xaver.htm Banat Journalist, Writer &amp; Author: Franz Xaver Kappus]. Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands. Retrieved 27 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Letters==
===The first letter===
Written in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 17 February 1903 - Theme of letter: Criticism fails to "touch a work of art." Rilke urges his reader to eschew others' opinions of his poetry. Instead, the young poet should look inward and examine what truly motivates him to continue writing. Rilke expands on the theme of developing a rich inner life and offers an inspiring perspective on the process of creating art..

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) uses [[three-letter abbreviation]] country codes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Olympic_Solidarity/2011_report_Moving_Forward.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the [[Olympic Games]].  Each code usually identifies a [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation.

Several of the IOC codes are different from the standard [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] codes. Other sporting organisations, such as [[FIFA]], use similar country codes to refer to their respective teams, but with some differences. Still others, such as the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] or [[Association of Tennis Professionals]], use the IOC list verbatim.

==History==
The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics]] were the first Games to feature ''Initials of Nations'' to refer to each NOC in the published official reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=IOC and OCOG Abbreviations for NOCs |last=Mallon |first=Bill |author2=Ove Karlsson |authorlink2=Ove Karlsson (sports journalist)  |journal=[[Journal of Olympic History]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=25–28 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2l.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the codes used at the next few Games were often based on the host nation's language (e.g., GIA for [[Japan]] at the [[1956 Winter Olympics]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics]], both held in Italy, from Italian ''Giappone'') or based on the French name for the nation (e.g., COR for [[South Korea|Korea]], from ''Corée'').  By the [[1972 Winter Olympics]], most codes were standardized on the current usage, but several have changed in recent years.  Additionally, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[unification of Germany|division and unification of Germany]], [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], and several other instances of [[geographical renaming]] have all resulted in code changes.

In addition to this list of over 200 NOCs, the participation of [[National Paralympic Committee]]s (NPCs) at the [[Paralympic Games]] requires standardised IOC codes, such as [[Macau]] (or as "[[Macau, China]]" since 1999) and the [[Faroe Islands]], coded MAC and FRO respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/faroe-islands/ Faroe Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121204173352/www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/faroe-islands/ |date=2012-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/macao/ Macau, China] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130103161847/www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/macao/ |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current NOCs==
There are 206 current NOCs ([[National Olympic Committee]]s) within the Olympic Movement.  The following tables show the currently used code for each NOC and any different codes used in past Games, per the official reports from those Games.  Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections.  Codes used specifically for a Summer Games only or a Winter Games only, within the same year, are indicated by "S" and "W" respectively.

Two other significant code changes have occurred, both because of a change in the nation's designation as used by the IOC:
* '''HOL''' was changed to '''NED''' for the [[Netherlands]] for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation from ''Holland''.
* '''IRN''' was changed to '''IRI''' for [[Iran]] for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation to ''Islamic Republic of Iran''.

'''''Little Rural Riding Hood''''' is a 1949 [[animated cartoon]] [[short subject]] directed by [[Tex Avery]], conceived as a follow-up to his 1943 cartoon ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]''. In 1994, the cartoon was ranked in 23rd place of [[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/42337 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127114242/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/42337 |archivedate=2008-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially a retelling of the [[Aesop]] fable, "[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]".

==Plot==
The film opens with a [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] [[hillbilly]] version of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (voiced by Colleen Collins), telling the audience that she's taking "nourishment" (as she holds up a [[cliché]] [[moonshine]] [[Hip flask|bottle]]) to her grandma, who lives on a country farm. At the [[farmhouse]], a wolf (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]]) [[Fourth wall|reveals himself to the audience]], but confesses that he doesn't want to eat Red. He's actually [[Falling in love|in love with her]] and wishes to kiss her.

After a comical chase around the farmhouse, the wolf catches Red, and both prepare to kiss each other when a telegram arrives for the wolf from his city cousin (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]), inviting him to meet the city's equivalent of his Red (the [[Red (Tex Avery)|same version]] seen in ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]''). Upon seeing her photograph, the country wolf [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love with her]] and departs for the city.

Unlike his cousin, the city wolf is rich ''and'' more suave and sophisticated. The city wolf takes his cousin to the club where the city's Red performs her dance routine (this scene was borrowed from ''[[Swing Shift Cinderella]]''). The country wolf whistles and leers throughout the performance, becoming completely aroused by Red. However, before he can rush onto the stage to join her, his city cousin stops him (by grabbing his suspenders, placing a hammer in it, then letting go so it would snap back and knock him out), and takes him back to the country, feeling that city life is too much for him.

Upon their arrival at the farmhouse, they find the country's Red waiting for them. Upon seeing country-Red, the city wolf, surprisingly, becomes wildly attracted to her, and runs to her, but is stopped his country cousin the same way the city cousin had stopped him earlier. Seeing an opportunity to see the city's Red again, the country wolf promptly decides to take his city cousin back home, claiming that he feels the country life is too much for him, and drives off back to the city.

'''MXlo''' means [[Domain Name System|DNS]] resource records of the [[MX record|MX]] type that have a value of [[localhost]]. The name comes from combining the ''MX'' from ''Mail eXchange'' and the ''lo'' abbreviation for a [[loopback]] networking interface, and is an anti-[[E-mail spam|spam]] technique that is growing in popularity with [[network administrator]]s who manage a large number of unused legacy domain names.

==Overview==
MX records provide a resource for [[internet]] [[Host (network)|hosts]] to discover the designated [[SMTP]] service for a given [[Domain name|domain]]. By pointing MX records for unused domains to localhost/127.0.0.1, any SMTP traffic to these domains is sent back to the originating host. Under normal circumstances, this is undesirable behavior. In the case of unused domains, particularly those that have been actively used and receive large amounts of spam, this practice places the [[system load]] on the originating [[Server (computing)|server]]. This is desirable from multiple perspectives, as it decreases load on the target systems and networks, and motivates [[ISP|internet service providers]] to minimize the sending of spam through their systems.

==History==
MXlo was conceived by a lone network administrator for a large engineering corporation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} As the company acquired and subsequently retired domain names, the MX records for these domains were pointed to localhost to minimize system load from unwanted traffic. As admins and other technical people described this practice to each other, it picked up the nickname ''MXlo''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Practical Implications==
For systems and providers that transmit a large volume of spam, sufficient use of the MXlo practice can cause a self-inflicted [[Denial of service|DoS (denial of service)]] attack, motivating the affected provider to prevent the sending of spam through their systems.

==Implementation==
'''[[DJBDNS|DJBDNS (tinydns)]]'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;@''yourdomain.tld''::localhost:10&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[BIND]]'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''yourdomain.tld.''    IN    MX    10    localhost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Others'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Refer to your software documentation/manual''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Seeding==
A practice that has grown with the MXlo concept is ''seeding''. Once MXlo has been implemented for a given domain, and if there is no intention to use the domain anymore, some administrators seed spam lists by publishing fake e-mail addresses associated with the target domain in public forums—blogs, wiki sites, etc.—and entering them in web forms that spammers are known to harvest e-mail addresses from. This technique intentionally creates unnecessary traffic for high volume spam hosts and increases their operating costs—and, in some cases, assists the aforementioned self-inflicted DoS attacks.

==History==
''Martindale's Directory'' was first published in 1868 by [[James B. Martindale]], a lawyer and businessman.&lt;ref name="martindale"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.martindale.com/about-martindale-hubbell/ |title=About Martindale-Hubbell |publisher=Martindale.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the Preface:
:"The object of the work is to furnish to Lawyers, Bankers, Wholesale Merchants, Manufacturers, Real Estate Agents, and all others who may have need of business correspondents away from home, the address of one reliable law firm, one reliable bank, and one reliable real estate agent in each city and town in the United States; also to give the laws of the several States on subjects of a commercial character that are of interest or importance to business men, or have a bearing on mercantile transactions and the collection of debts. ...
:In view of constant and rapid changes occurring among Law firms, by reason of death, retirement, election of office, dissolution, and an occasional degeneracy, making the best list of necessity short-lived, and in view of the continual changes being made in the commercial laws of the several States, we will ''thoroughly revise'' this work once a year, and publish it annually, on the first of every January."&lt;ref name="martindale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Martindale |first=James B.  |year=1874 |title= Revised Annually, Martindale's United States Law Directory for 1874: Containing the Names of One or More of the Most Reliable Law Firms, Banks, and Real Estate Agents in Each of the Principal Cities and Towns of the United States and Canada; And Also, An Extensive Digest of the Commercial Laws of Each of the States and Territories and Canada, with the Times for Holding Courts; the Bankrupt Law in Full, With All the Forms and Rules of Court; Also, A Complete List of All the Money Order Post Offices in the United States |place=Indianopolis, Ind |publisher=J.B. Martindale &amp; Co., Managers of the Western Law and Collection Association  |page=  iii |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the first edition of ''Hubbell's Legal Directory'' appeared. As stated in the Introduction:

:"...The vast and extending relations of business, the immense territory over which this business must be transacted, and the difficulties that often occur in obtaining reliable correspondents and information respecting the collection of debts in the different States, seem to create a necessity for a work of this character..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=  |first=  |year=1870 |title= The National Legal Directory, Embracing the Names of One or More of the Leading and Most Reliable Attorneys In Over Three Thousand Cities and Towns in the United States and Territories.

By 1896,  ''Martindale's Directory'' included basic information that still appears in the modern "Practice Profile" listings, ratings and a section on foreign lawyers and firms. The Law Digests of  all the States and Provinces constituted a new and valuable feature, being the substance of the law adapted to the comprehension of business men, and not mere copies of statutes, as had been the case with most similar publications.&lt;ref name="martindale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Martindale |first=James B.  |year=1896 |title= Twenty-Eight Year, Martindale's American Law Directory (Annual) 1896.

United States Consular Service, Banks in the United States and Canada. Law Digests of all the States and Provinces, Court Calendars of all the States and Territories.

In 1916, ''Martindale's American Law Directory'' contained  the following: In Part I - tabulated laws, collection rates, lawyers of the U.S., of Canada, of Newfoundland, lawyers of fourteen largest cities, Canons of Professional Ethics. In Part II - foreign attorneys, diplomatic service of the U.S., Tariff of American Consular Fees, U.S. Consular Service. Part III - Law Digests of the U.S. and Canada, Law Digest of Newfoundland, Cuba Law Digest, English Law Digest, French Law Digest, German Law Digest, Mexico Law Digest, the Netherlands Law Digest, U.S. Bankruptcy Law Digest, U.S. Patent Law Digest, U.S. Trademark Law Digest, U.S. Court Calendar and Court Calendar of States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=  |first=  |year=1916 |title= Forty-Eight Year, Martindale's American Law Directory (Annual), January 1916; Established by J.B. Martindale in 1868 |place= New York |publisher= G.B. Martindale, Publisher |page=   |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the Martindale Company purchased the publishing rights to ''Hubbell's Legal Directory'', which consisted of a digest of the collected laws of each state; court calendars; and a selective list of lawyers and firms.&lt;ref name="martindale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=  |first=  |year=1930 |title= Sixtieth Year, Hubbbell's Legal Directory, 1930; for the Service of the Lawyer and Business Execituve; The Oldest Publication of Its Kind |place= New York |publisher= The Hubbell Publishing Company |page=   |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the combination of the ''Martindale's Directory'' and ''Hubbell's Legal Directory'', the first edition of the ''Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory'' was produced in 1931 as a two-volume set.&lt;ref name="martindale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=  |first=  |year=1931 |title= Sixty-Third Year, The Martindale-Hubbbell Law Directory (Annual); Martindale's American Law Directory 1868-1930; Hubbell's Legal Directory 1870-1930; The Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory 1931; January 1931 (In Two Volumes) |place= New York |publisher= Martindale Hubbell Law Directory Inc., Publishers  |page=   |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume I consisted of, other than lawyers listings, lawyers in America (complete list of the Bar of the USA), lawyers of the [[Dominion of Canada]] and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]] (complete list of the Bar), selected list of foreign lawyers, list of [[patent attorneys]] and a biographical section. Volume II contained the ''Law Digests'', which included a topical index, Digests of the Laws of the States, Territories and Possessions of the USA, Digests of the Laws of Canada, Digests of the Laws of 40 Foreign Countries, United States Patent, Tax and Trademark Law Digests, Court Calendars and [[Uniform Acts]], approved and recommended for adoption by the National Conference on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings. The Preface to the ''Law Digest'' commenced with the words:

: "No feature of the modern directory is of more value to the law office than the section which is devoted to the synopses of laws of the several states and foreign jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Joseph Walker |editor-last=Magrauth  |year=1931 |title= Sixty-Third Year, The Martindale-Hubbbell Law Directory (Annual); Martindale's American Law Directory 1868-1930; Hubbell's Legal Directory 1870-1930; The Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory 1931; January 1931  |place=New York |publisher= Martindale Hubbell Law Directory |volume=II |page= iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, a digest was added for the new country of [[Israeli law|Israel]]. Meanwhile, internal conditions as well as difficulties of communication with [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Rumania]] had made it necessary  to withdraw publication of law digests for these countries.  These law digests were revised and again published in the 1990s. Throughout the years ''Martindale Hubbell Law Digest'', which was revised and published annually, has been considered as an incomplete [[encyclopaedia]] of [[comparative law]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=David |first=Rene |last2=Brieley |first2=John E.C. |year=1968 |title= Major Legal Systems in the World Today, An Introduction to the Comparative Study of Law |publisher= The Free Press, Collier-Macmillan Limited |place=London |edition= 1 |page=  494 |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Knapp |editor-first= Viktor |year=1987 |last=Stoffel |first=Walter A.|contribution= National Reports, Switzerland |title= International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law |publisher= J.C.B.

In 1963, ''Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory'' was published in four volumes. Volumes I, II and III contained in the geographical section a roster as complete as possible of the Bar of the U.S. and Canada with ratings and other information, listings of the U.S. Government lawyers located at Washington, D.C., grouped by Departments, Agencies etc.  A special section contained names of lawyers registered before the United States Patent Office.  A similar section for Canada was included.  In another part of the Directory was presented a selected list of lawyers in other countries.  Volume IV contained digests of the laws and court calendars for the fifty states, the District of Columbia, [[Law of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[The Virgin Islands of the U S|the Virgin Islands]] and digests of the U.S. Copyright, Patent and Trademark laws. Some of the Uniform and Model Acts were also included as well as were digests of the laws of [[The Dominion of Canada|the Dominion  of Canada]], of the Canadian Provinces and of 53 countries or jurisdictions, including [[West Germany|Germany]], [[the USSR |the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics]], the [[Republic of China]], [[English law|England]], [[Scottish law|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]], [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=  |first=  |year=1963 |title=  Martindale-Hubbbell Law Directory in Four Volumes, Ninety-Fifth Annual Edition, 1963, Complete Legal Directory Service |place= Summit, New Jersey  |publisher= Martindale Hubbell Inc., Publishers  |page=   |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, ''Martindale-Hubbell'' was purchased by [[Reed International]] P.L.C.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/business/britain-s-low-profile-publishing-giant.html?scp=34&amp;sq=martindale-hubbell&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Britain's Low-Profile Publishing Giant |newspaper=New York Times |date=1992-02-09 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |first=Steven |last=Prokesch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/23/business/the-media-business-martindale-sold-to-british-publisher.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Media Business; Martindale Sold to British Publisher |date=1989-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed Elsevier came into being in 1992, following the merger of Reed International, a British trade book and magazine publisher, and [[Elsevier]], the Netherlands-based scientific publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7D6123DF935A35753C1A962958260 |work=New York Times |author=Edward A.

In case of Australia and Canada, digests of the states and provinces of these countries were included along with the digest of their federal laws, and a separate digest of [[European Union law|the European Union law]], because of its significance for a number of European countries. The digests were compiled and revised by distinguished lawyers and legal scholars of the respective states and countries. The second volume contained also the texts of ten [[international convention]]s, to which the United States of America was a party, the complete texts of many [[Uniform Act]]s including the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] and the [[Uniform Probate Code]] and four Model Acts including the Revised [[Model Business Corporation Act]].

The '''Moby Project''' is a collection of public-domain lexical resources. It was created by [[Grady Ward]]. The resources were dedicated to the public domain, and are now mirrored at [[Project Gutenberg]]. {{As of|2007}}, it contains the largest free phonetic database, with 177,267 words and corresponding pronunciations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Hyphenator ==
The '''Moby Hyphenator II''' contains [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenations]] of 187,175 words and phrases (including 9,752 entries where no hyphenations are given, such as ''through'' and ''avoir'').  The character encoding appears to be [[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]], and hyphenation is indicated by a bullet (character value 165 decimal, or A5 hexadecimal).  Some entries, however, have a combination of actual hyphens and character 165, such as "bar•ber-sur•geon".

There is little to no documentation of the hyphenation choices made; the following examples might give some flavour of the style of hyphenation used: at•mos•phere; at•tend•ant; ca•pac•i•ty; un•col•or•a•ble.

== Language ==
'''Moby Language II''' contains wordlists of five languages: [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Language
! Words
! Size (in [[byte]]s)
|-
! French
|align="right"| 138,257
|align="right"| 1,524,757
|-
! German
|align="right"| 159,809
|align="right"| 2,055,986
|-

|align="right"| 850,523
|-
! Total
|align="right"| 560,101
! 5,928,030
|}

However, some of the lists are contaminated, for example the Japanese list contains English words such as ''abnormal'' and non-words such as ''abcdefgh'' and ''m,./''.  There are also unusual peculiarities in the sorting of these lists, as the French list contains a straight alphabetical listing, while the German list contains the alphabetical listing of traditionally capitalized words and then the alphabetical listing of traditionally lower-cased words.  The list of Italian words, however, contains no capitalized words whatsoever.

The foreign languages list does not use accented characters, so "e^tre" is how a user would look up the French word ''être'' ("To Be").

== Part-of-Speech ==
'''Moby Part-of-Speech''' contains 233,356 words fully described by [[Lexical category|part(s) of speech]], listed in priority order. The format of the file is ''word\parts-of-speech'', with the following parts of speech being identified:

{| class="wikitable"

| [[Article (grammar)|Definite article]]
| D
|-
| [[Article (grammar)|Indefinite article]]
| I
|-
| [[Nominative]]
| o
|}

== Pronunciator ==
The '''Moby Pronunciator II''' contains 177,267 entries with corresponding pronunciations. Most of the entries describe a single word, but approximately 79,000&lt;ref&gt;Obtained by running the UNIX command ''grep '.*[-_].* .*' mobypron.unc | wc -l'' after converting the line endings and correcting some encoding errors.&lt;/ref&gt; contain hyphenated or multiple word phrases, names, or [[lexemes]]. The Project Gutenberg distribution also contains a copy of the [[cmudict]] v0.3. The file contains lines of the format ''word[/part-of-speech] pronunciation''. Each line is ended with the ASCII [[Carriage Return]] character (CR, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal).

The ''word'' field can include apostrophes (e.g. ''isn't''), hyphens (e.g. ''able-bodied''), and multiple words separated by underscores (e.g. ''monkey_wrench''). Non-English words are generally rendered, as stated in the documentation, without accents or other diacritical marks. However, in 36 entries (e.g. ''São_Miguel''), some non-ASCII accented characters remain, represented using [[Mac OS Roman]] encoding.

The part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example, for the words spelled ''close,'' the verb has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|z}}, whereas the adjective is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|s}}. The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part-of-speech
! Code
|-
| [[Noun]]
| n
|-
| [[Verb]]
| v
|-
| [[Adjective]]
| aj
|-
| [[Adverb]]
| av
|-
| [[Interjection]]
| interj
|}

Following this is the pronunciation. Several special symbols are present:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol
! Meaning
|-
| _
| Used to separate words
|-
| '
| [[Primary stress]] on the following syllable
|-
| ,
| [[Secondary stress]] on the following syllable
|}

The rest of the symbols are used to represent [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] characters. The pronunciations are generally consistent with a [[General American]] dialect of English, that exhibits [[father-bother merger]], [[hurry-furry merger]] and [[lot-cloth split]], but does not exhibit [[cot-caught merger]] or [[wine-whine merger]]. Each phoneme is represented by a sequence of one or more characters. Some of the sequences are delimited with a slash character "/", as shown in the following table, but note that the sequence for {{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} is delimited by ''two'' slash characters at either end:

To this collection are added a number of extra sequences representing phonemes found in several other languages. These are used to encode the non-English words, phrases and names that are included in the database. The following table contains these extra phonemes, but note that the extent to which some of these may exist due to encoding errors is not clear.

The following is a list of the '''Top 10 Films''' chosen annually by the [[National Board of Review|National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]], beginning in 1929. From 1968 till 2005, 29 times the NBR chose the film that would go on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] as Best Film. Twelve of these times, the film selected was number one on the NBR's list for that year.

'''NeighborCity''' is a [[residential real estate]] information and service company that rates [[real-estate agent]]s in the United States, offering a way for buyers and sellers of homes to compare and evaluate agents.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrns|first=Ann|title=New Battle on Providing Real Estate Agent Performance Data|url=http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/new-battle-on-providing-real-estate-agent-performance-data/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TD&gt;{{cite web|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=Fight Over Real Estate Listings Escalates As NeighborCity Counters Copyright Claims With Antitrust Accusations|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121004/18581320614/fight-over-real-estate-listings-escalates-as-neighborcity-counters-copyright-claims-with-antitrust-accusations.shtml|publisher=TechDirt|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NC&gt;{{cite web|title=About NeighborCity|url=http://www.neighborcity.com/about|publisher=NeighborCity|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite web|last=Slind-For|first=Victoria|title=Vuitton, Facebook, NeighborCity: Intellectual Property|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-23/vuitton-facebook-neighborcity-intellectual-property.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is based in San Francisco.

The company rates virtually every member of the [[National Association of Realtors]] in the United States, based on transaction and listing history.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt; NeighborCity analyzes agents’ performance based on closing rate, number of closings, number of active listings, geographic specialization, number of [[days on market]], rate of dual agency, sales price per square foot, and the difference between ask and sale price, for the homes they sell.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;&lt;ref name=B1&gt;{{cite web|last=Restuccia|first=Paul|title=Real estate agent ranking site rankles its neighbors|url=http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2012/05/real_estate_agent_ranking_site_rankles_its_neighbors|publisher=BostonHerald.com|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NeighborCity provides an evaluation of the quality of service delivered by agents, with respect to their clients’ interests and relative to competing real-estate agents.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;&lt;ref name="B1"/&gt;

The company also maintains a national database of real-estate listings.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;&lt;ref name=B1 /&gt; The site recommends corresponding independent buy-side real estate agents next to each for-sale listing along with a performance score and a link to a detailed professional profile for each recommended agent.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;&lt;ref name=B1 /&gt;

==History==

[[Jon_Cardella|Jonathan Cardella]] founded NeighborCity in 2007, and he served as the company’s [[Chief Executive Officer]]. Ali Vahabzadeh was the President and [[Chief Operating Officer]].&lt;ref name=AN&gt;{{cite web|title=NeighborCity|url=https://angel.co/neighborcity|publisher=AngelList|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is owned and operated by American Home Realty Network, Inc. (AHRN), a licensed California real estate brokerage.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=B /&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;{{cite web|title=MRIS injunction against NeighborCity applies only to photographs|url=http://homes.yahoo.com/news/mris-injunction-against-neighborcity-applies-only-photographs-000000723.html|publisher=Inman News|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{cite web|title=NeighborCity|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/neighborcity|publisher=CrunchBase|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Model==

NeighborCity uses real-estate transaction and listing database information from national sources to construct its [[rankings]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The company developed and uses AgentMatch, a system for matching private home buyers and sellers with agents based on the characteristics of the property for sale, including its location, price, and property type, and how they relate to the past experience and performance of the licensed real estate agents in that area.&lt;ref name=CB /&gt; NeighborCity receives a portion of the commission earned by [[brokers]] on closed transactions that result from referrals.&lt;ref name=TD /&gt;&lt;ref name=CB /&gt;

== Lawsuits over IP rights to listing data ==

=== NAR and MLS suits ===
In March 2012, shortly after NeighborCity provided the public performance rankings of National Association of Realtors members, [[Metropolitan Regional Information Systems]] filed a civil [[lawsuit]] against AHRN/NeighborCity claiming copyright violations by using MLS real estate listing information to craft its realtor-rating database.&lt;ref name=TD /&gt; Northstar MLS of [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], followed suit with similar litigation in April 2012.&lt;ref name=Y /&gt;&lt;ref name=IN&gt;{{cite web|last=Brambila|first=Andrea V.|title=NeighborCity hit with MLS copyright lawsuits|url=http://www.inman.com/news/2012/04/24/neighborcity-hit-with-mls-copyright-lawsuits|publisher=Inman News|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeighborCity alleged that the suit was brought to prevent buyers and sellers from getting accurate information about the performance of individual brokers.,&lt;ref name=Y /&gt; and asserted that the [[lawsuits]] had no merit, stating that because the [[plaintiffs]] had failed to comply with requirements of the Copyright Act for [[copyright registration]] and that information for which the plaintiffs claimed ownership was not subject to copyright.&lt;ref name=Y /&gt;&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Matt|title=Neighborcity.com alleges NAR, MRIS, NorthstarMLS violate anti-trust laws: op/ed|url=http://agbeat.com/editorials/neighborcity-com-alleges-nar-mris-northstarmls-violat-anti-trust-laws-oped|publisher=AGBeat|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial judicial opinions in both cases addressed the issue of what is subject to copyright protection.&lt;ref name=Y /&gt;&lt;ref name=AG /&gt; The court upheld NeighborCity’s claim in determining that the MLS listing data does not qualify for copyright protection because facts, including property features such as “main floor full bath” and “whirlpool,” are not protectable works to which the MRIS and Northstar MLS can claim ownership; however, the court found that photographs and property descriptive texts are likely to be copyrightable.&lt;ref name=Y /&gt;&lt;ref name=AG /&gt;

In November 2013, a Maryland Federal District court found that NeighborCity “adequately alleged” a conspiracy among multiple MLSs and the National Association of Realtors.&lt;ref name = antitrust&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inman.com/2013/11/18/neighborcity-com-to-have-its-day-in-court-in-nar-antitrust-suit/#sthash.HHnZgtkt.dpuf | title = Neighborcity.com to have its day in court in NAR antitrust suit |publisher = Inman|  accessdate = 10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berkshire Hathaway suit ===
In May 2013, [[Berkshire Hathaway]] filed a similar lawsuit against NeighborCity.com for reuse of photos from its (subsidiaries') listings without express permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://technorati.com/technology/article/berkshire-sues-neighborcitycom-in-ip-dispute/ |title=Berkshire Sues NeighborCity.com in IP Dispute |author=Mary Dumon |publisher=Technorati |accessdate=2013-10-17 |date=2013-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021063312/http://technorati.com/technology/article/berkshire-sues-neighborcitycom-in-ip-dispute/ |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NeighborCity filed a countersuit claiming anti-competitive practices.

==AgentMatch dispute==

In November 2013, NeighborCity sent to [[realtor.com]], operator of [[Move, Inc.]], a cease-and-desist letter alleging that Move’s AgentMatch tool infringed on NeighborCity’s trademark of the term “Agent Match” and that the tool potentially infringes on a 2010 patent application filed by NeighborCity.&lt;ref name = inmannovember&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.inman.com/2013/11/13/neighborcity-hits-move-with-cease-and-desist-letter-over-agentmatch-tool/#sthash.FhNny7zg.dpuf | title = NeighborCity hits Move with cease-and-desist letter over ‘AgentMatch’ tool | publisher = Inman News | accessdate = January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opposition to immigration''' exists in most states with [[immigration]], and has become a significant political issue in many countries. Immigration in the modern sense refers to movement of people from one state or territory to another state or territory where they are not [[citizenship|citizens]]. [[Illegal immigration]] is immigration in contravention of a state's [[immigration law]]s.&lt;ref name="ejas.revues.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozak|first1=Krystof|title=Are Immigrants Disloyal? The Case of Mexicans in the U.S.|url=https://ejas.revues.org/7629|website=European Association for American Studies|publisher=European Association for American Studies|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, opponents of immigration typically focus on perceived adverse effects, such as economic costs (job competition and burdens on education and social services); negative environmental impact from accelerated population growth; increased crime rates, and in the long run, changes in traditional identities and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marisa Abrajano|author2=Zoltan L. Hajnal|title=White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IGSBQAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=31–35|isbn=9781400866489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spain, surveys show "in descending order, jobs, crime and housing" as the primary concerns for citizens opposed to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Hall|author2=Paul White|title=Europe's Population|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIWNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=136|isbn=9781135369484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to immigration ranges from calls for various [[immigration reform]]s to proposals to completely restrict immigration to one's [[nation]]; these often also include measures to combat [[immigration]] of existing citizens.

== Anti-immigration arguments ==
{{Further|Criticism of multiculturalism}}

=== National identity ===
{{See also|Cultural identity|Identity politics|Nationalism|#Import of culture}}
Some critics of immigration argue {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} that the presence of immigrants may distort the [[national identity]] of the native population. That means that the native population opposes immigration because they fear they may lose their sense of belonging to their own nation, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|title = Definition of National Identity in English|date = |accessdate = |website = Oxford Dictionaries|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

National identity can be an important factor for social peace in cases where there are intra-national divides. For example, a 2015 study showed that the educational content of [[Suharto]]'s [[Indonesia]] emphasizing the national unity of Indonesia was an important cause of improved inter-ethnic and inter-religious relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2607454|title=Social Spillovers of a School Building Program: Evidence on Improved Inter-Ethnic and Inter-Religious Relationships|first1=Christopher|last1=Roth|first2=Sudarno|last2=Sumarto|date=2 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isolation, separation and stability ===
{{See also|Ethnic conflict|Community cohesion|Social order|Hybrid warfare#Russian involvement with Middle-Eastern refugees|#National identity}}
Immigrants may isolate themselves in their own communities, forming self-organized communities, [[ghetto]]s or [[Parallel society|parallel societies]] where they live according to their own culture, rather than assimilating to the native culture with a reduced or minimal spatial, social and cultural contact with the majority society into which they have immigrated. Such ethnic enclaves can be the result of humans naturally liking to be around people like themselves.&lt;ref name=nationsornot&gt;{{cite web|title=End of nations: Is there an alternative to countries?|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2016/11/09/end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They might not learn the local language and might eventually undermine the national unity, as well as the [[cultural]] and [[religious]] unity of the native country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/URZDVA Parallelgesellschaften?], ''Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte'', No. 1–2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Jennifer Neal of Michigan State University suggests that ethnic enclaves promote [[social cohesion]] at the cost of decreasing tolerance between groups and that their size, autonomy and proximity are factors.&lt;ref name=nationsornot/&gt; Some also suggest to devolve more power to local communities.&lt;ref name=nationsornot/&gt;

Immigration may adversely affect social&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobel|first1=Andrew|title=Challenges of Globalization: Immigration, Social Welfare, Global Governance|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135216955|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4CMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en|date=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Immigration and political stability|url=https://www.oecd.org/dev/pgd/46923664.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased competition ===
Economic arguments concentrate on competition for employment, and the higher burdens that some groups of immigrants may impose on [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] systems, health systems, housing and public schools of the native state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/is-britain-full-home-truths-about-population-panic|title=Is Britain full? Home truths about the population panic|first=Andy|last=Beckett|date=9 February 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Denmark's strict immigration law reform has saved the country 6.7&amp;nbsp;billion euros compared to previous more permissive approach, according to a 2011 report from the Danish Integration Ministry.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web | last = Reimann | first = Anna | title = Putting a price on foreigners: strict immigration laws 'Save Denmark Billions'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/putting-a-price-on-foreigners-strict-immigration-laws-save-denmark-billions-a-759716.html |website =spiegel.de | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 29 April 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark's immigration laws save country £6 billion|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/8492822/Denmarks-immigration-laws-save-country-6-billion.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher = [[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental space, quality and resource scarcity ===
The following are more an argument against [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] than against immigration, but sometimes overpopulation is caused by immigration. Some people think there is a certain size of land needed to provide for a population ("environmental space"), e.g., to provide for the population's consumption, including absorption of waste products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/population_problem_uk.pdf|title=The UK's population problem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants, in this logic, such as a new born child, reduce the per capita size of land of the native country. This idea dates back to [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Robert Malthus]] who claimed this in a similar way in the early 19th century.

Some are concerned about urban sprawl and congestion, alterations in the wildlife and natural environment of the state, and an expansive carbon footprint due to immigration.&lt;ref name="scarce"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rohe|first1=John F|title=Living Standards, Scarce Resources and Immigration: An Interview With Labor Economist Vernon M. Briggs, Jr.|date=1 January 2006|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&amp;context=articles|accessdate=28 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some are concerned over a state's scarce resources, dwindling water reserves, energy, pauperized soils and solid waste.&lt;ref name="scarce"/&gt;

=== Diseases ===
Immigrants (and cross-border movements in general) can bring infectious diseases uncommon to the native population from their home countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhooper|first1=Surjit Singh|title=Social Work in Health Care: Its Past and Future|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483342573|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dggAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Diane|last2=Edwards|first2=Helen|last3=Seaton|first3=Lesley|last4=Buckley|first4=Thomas|title=Lewis's Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780729582209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5u9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ep1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. – Mexico Cross-Border Health|publisher=Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/us-mexico-health.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gushulak|first1=B.

Some point out that this threat is often overstated by opponents.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

=== Military unity ===
{{See also|Unit cohesion}}

Some opponents of immigration argue that emigration of highly skilled or well-educated individuals may hurt their home countries – which could otherwise benefit from them and build up their economy and improve their social and political system (i.e. [[brain drain]]). However, the notion of a "brain drain" remains largely unsupported in the academic literature. According to economist [[Michael Clemens]], it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin.&lt;ref name="Clemens"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens|first=Michael|last2=Development|first2=Center for Global|last3=USA|title=Smart policy toward high-skill emigrants|url=http://wol.iza.org/articles/smart-policy-toward-high-skill-emigrants|journal=IZA World of Labor|doi=10.15185/izawol.203|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to development economist Justin Sandefur, "there is no study out there... showing any empirical evidence that migration restrictions have contributed to development."&lt;ref name="oxfamblogs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/migration-and-development-who-bears-the-burden-of-proof-justin-sandefur-replies-to-paul-collier-2/|title=Migration and Development: Who Bears the Burden of Proof?

=== No solution to underlying problems ===
{{See also|Stabilization of fragile states|Development aid|Category:International development}}
Immigration may be the outcome of problems in the migrants' countries of origin. Open immigration policies and efforts do not address these problems. However, just keeping borders closed does not address them either.

Jeanne Park of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] recommends European leaders to address the root causes of migration such as helping to broker an end to Syria's civil war, restoring stability to Libya, and upping aid to sub-Saharan Africa. According to her barring a political solution to these regional crises, Europe will continue to struggle with migrant inflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe's Migration Crisis|url=http://www.cfr.org/refugees-and-the-displaced/europes-migration-crisis/p32874|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=25 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the migratory and refugee movements in and from the [[Horn of Africa]] Günther Schröder notes that greater efforts are needed to deal with its causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Migratory and Refugee Movements in and from the Horn of Africa|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/12081.pdf|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the German Caritasverband states that only a long-term strategy that differentiates between combating the causes for migration in the countries of origin and the development of an EU migration policy will be able to find solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundations of a Humane Asylum and Migration Policy of the EU|url=https://www.caritas.de/cms/contents/caritasde/medien/dokumente/dcv-zentrale/migration/foundationsofahumane/foundations%20of%20a%20humane%20asylum%20and%20migration[1].pdf?d=a&amp;f=o|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the root causes of illegal migration flows involves cooperation with third countries, including migrants' countries of origin and transit and might manifest itself in [[Conflict avoidance|conflict prevention]] / [[peacekeeping]] and [[state building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing illegal migration flows |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/migratory-pressures/preventing-illegal-migration-flows/|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that safe havens be created within the country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why eastern Europe’s resistance to refugee quotas is not ‘selfish’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/eastern-european-migrants-refugees-selfish|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that immigration means that people "flee" of their country's problems instead of organizing, building up pressure, being involved in constructive foreign aid programs or otherwise addressing them.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Causes of anti-immigration views ==
A 2017 study drawn from 18,000 interviews across eleven countries found that "higher-skilled immigrants are preferred to their lower-skilled counterparts at all levels of native socio-economic status (SES). There is little support for the Labor Market Competition hypothesis, since respondents are not more opposed to immigrants in their own SES stratum. While skin tone itself has little effect in any country, immigrants from Muslim-majority countries do elicit significantly lower levels of support, and racial animus remains a powerful force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas A.|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart N.|last3=Iyengar|first3=Shanto|last4=Aalberg|first4=Toril|last5=Duch|first5=Raymond|last6=Fraile|first6=Marta|last7=Hahn|first7=Kyu S.|last8=Hansen|first8=Kasper M.|last9=Harell|first9=Allison|date=2017|title=Economic and Cultural Drivers of Immigrant Support Worldwide|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/economic-and-cultural-drivers-of-immigrant-support-worldwide/02BBCF09B063FCD0C252B6D78E748DE8|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=|pages=1–26|doi=10.1017/S000712341700031X|issn=0007-1234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 paper found that an influx of high-skilled immigration was associated with declines in nationalist voting, but that an influx in low-skilled immigration was associated with increases in nationalist voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moriconi|first=Simone|last2=Peri|first2=Giovanni|last3=Turati|first3=Riccardo|date=2018|title=Skill of the Immigrants and Vote of the Natives: Immigration and Nationalism in European Elections 2007-2016|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w25077|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3386/w25077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This indicates that support for immigration amongst the better educated may reflect expression of socially desirable views rather than actual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janus|first=Alexander|date=25 October 2010|title=The Influence of Social Desirability Pressures on Expressed Immigration Attitudes |journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=91|issue=4|pages=928–946|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00742.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence for this was found in a study by Creighton et al., where amongst the college educated, it was found the stated support for immigration was higher than the actual pro-immigrant sentiment. This was true for other education levels. The study also found that the 2008 economic crisis did not significantly increase anti-immigration attitudes but rather there was a greater expression of opposition to immigration, with underlying attitudes changing little before and after the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creighton|first=Matthew|last2=Jamal|first2=Amaney|last3=Malancu|first3=Natalia|date=3 May 2014|title=Has Opposition to Immigration Increased in the United States after the Economic Crisis?

=== Intergenerational transmission ===
Some research suggests that anti-immigration views are transmitted from older generations to younger generations. A 2017 study of Germany found "high association between fathers’ and sons’ right-wing extremist attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Intergenerational Correlations of Extreme Right-Wing Party Preferences and Attitudes toward Immigration|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12190|volume=119|year=2017|issue=3|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|pages=768–800 | last1 = Avdeenko | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Siedler | first2 = Thomas}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study found that British communities that were more acceptant of Jews in medieval times show much more tolerance towards 20th century immigrants (chiefly Caribbean and South Asian immigrants) and 21st century immigrants (chiefly Eastern European), and less support for the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fielding|first=David|date=1 January 2015|title=Traditions of Tolerance: The Long-Run Persistence of Regional Variation in Attitudes towards English Immigrants |journal=British Journal of Political Science|pages=1–22|doi=10.1017/S0007123415000575|issn=0007-1234|volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspective-taking ===
A 2017 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' found that prejudice towards marginalized groups, such as refugees, could be explained by a failure to take the perspective of the marginalized group.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonovits|first=Gábor|last2=Kézdi|first2=Gábor|last3=Kardos|first3=Péter|date=2017|title=Seeing the World Through the Other's Eye: An Online Intervention Reducing Ethnic Prejudice|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/seeing-the-world-through-the-others-eye-an-online-intervention-reducing-ethnic-prejudice/5E8284531716D392A0BCC99BB49B76A3|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=112|pages=1–8|doi=10.1017/S0003055417000478|issn=0003-0554|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that young Hungarian adults who played a perspective-taking game (a game intended to reduce prejudice towards marginalized groups by having players assume the role of a member of a marginalized group) showed reduced prejudice towards Romani people and refugees, as well as reduced their vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far right party by 10%.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
A 2017 study found that by emphasizing shared religion can produce more supportive attitudes toward refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarev|first=Egor|last2=Sharma|first2=Kunaal|date=April 2017|title=Brother or Burden: An Experiment on Reducing Prejudice Toward Syrian Refugees in Turkey*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/brother-or-burden-an-experiment-on-reducing-prejudice-toward-syrian-refugees-in-turkey/3801D8A794F0EE37A7528ABD677F33CA|journal=Political Science Research and Methods|volume=5|issue=2|pages=201–219|doi=10.1017/psrm.2015.57|issn=2049-8470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociopsychological explanations ===
A 2014 review study in the ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' found that there is substantial evidence in support of sociopsychological explanations for anti-immigration views.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A 2007 study in ''[[International Organization]]'' found that "the link between education and attitudes toward immigrants is driven by differences among individuals in cultural values and beliefs. More educated respondents are significantly less racist and place greater value on cultural diversity than do their counterparts; they are also more likely to believe that immigration generates benefits for the host economy as a whole."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

A 2017 study in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' argued that hostility towards immigrants is driven by disgust and can be explained as a psychological mechanism designed to protect humans from disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aarøe|first=Lene|last2=Petersen|first2=Michael Bang|last3=Arceneaux|first3=Kevin|date=1 May 2017|title=The Behavioral Immune System Shapes Political Intuitions: Why and How Individual Differences in Disgust Sensitivity Underlie Opposition to Immigration|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/behavioral-immune-system-shapes-political-intuitions-why-and-how-individual-differences-in-disgust-sensitivity-underlie-opposition-to-immigration/AB22952FCB7F270E0D296378D2E330C7|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=111|issue=2|pages=277–294|doi=10.1017/S0003055416000770|issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue "fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a [[vicious cycle]] that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adida|first=Claire L.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|last3=Valfort|first3=Marie-Anne|date=1 February 2017|title=The Wrong Way to Stop Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-01/wrong-way-stop-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition to immigration by country or region ==

=== Australia ===
[[File:Pauline Hanson (438351804) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pauline Hanson, in her maiden speech in 1996, said that Australia "was in danger of being swamped by Asians".]]

The impact of Europeans was profoundly disruptive to Aboriginal life and, though the extent of violence is debated, there was considerable conflict on the frontier. At the same time, some settlers were quite aware they were usurping the Aborigines place in Australia. In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; "The question comes to this; which has the better right – the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life."
Many events illustrate violence and resistance as Aborigines sought to protect their lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town.

A sparsely-populated continental nation with a predominantly European population, [[History of Australia|Australia]] has long feared being overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to its north. The standard policy after 1900 was "[[White Australia]]" which encouraged immigration from Britain, was suspicious of immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and which was quite hostile to immigrants from Asia or the Pacific islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Jensen |first = Richard | title = Comparative nativism: the United States, Canada and Australia, 1880s–1910s | journal = Canadian Issues | pages = 45–55 | publisher = [[Association for Canadian Studies]] | date = Spring 2009 | url = https://acs-aec.ca/en/publications/canadian-issues/borders-boundaries/buy-now/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, most Australians agreed that the country must "populate or perish". Immigration brought people from traditional sources such as the [[British Isles]] along with, for the first time, large numbers of Southern and Central Europeans. The abolition of the so-called '[[White Australia policy]]' during the early 1970s led to a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.

[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] supported [[White Australia policy]], saying "This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race."&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition|title=Fact Sheet – Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, National Communications Branch, Department of Immigration and Citizenship|work=Australian Immigration|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Bruce]] was a supporter of the White Australia Policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election.&lt;ref name="Policy_Launch_Speech"&gt;

labor leader (1951-1960) [[H. V. Evatt]] was a defender of the [[White Australia Policy]]. There was a strong view in Australia that any softening of the White Australia stance might result in cheaper labour being imported from overseas. Another prevailing sentiment was that multiculturalism resulted in instability. Evatt, opposing resolutions which could have led to more Asian immigration to Australia, told the Chinese delegation at San Francisco: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/dr-evatt-goes-to-san-francisco/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An other (ALP) [[Leader of the Labor Party]] from 1960-1967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.&lt;ref&gt;Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the high-profile historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a "cluster of tribes". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to "emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians" and also for tending to be "anti-British", even though "people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants."

According to Blainey, such a policy, with its "emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority," was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that "the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high" and warned that "we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes ({{ISBN|0-454-00828-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as "morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham".

In the 1996 election [[Pauline Hanson]] was elected to the federal seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]]. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia "was in danger of being swamped by Asians". Hanson went on to form the [[One Nation Party]], which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in [[Queensland]] state elections before entering a period of decline due to internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Goot |first = Murray | title = Pauline Hanson's One Nation: extreme right, centre party or extreme left? | journal = Labour History | volume = 89 |issue = 89 | pages = 101–119 | publisher = Australian Society for the Study of Labour History (ASSLH) | doi = 10.2307/27516078 | jstor = 27516078 | date = November 2005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "One Nation" was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Ben-Moshe |first = Danny | title = One Nation and the Australian far right | journal = [[Patterns of Prejudice]] | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 24–40 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/003132201128811205 | date = July 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Australians reacted angrily to One Nation, as Hanson was subjected to water balloons filled with urine at public speeches, ridiculed in the media, and received so many death threats she filmed a "good-bye video" in the case of her assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Scalmer |first = Sean | title = From contestation to autonomy: the staging and framing of anti-Hanson contention | journal = [[Australian Journal of Politics and History]] | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 209–224 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00228 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was imprisoned by the government on political corruption charges, which were dropped after her imprisonment. In recent years the rise of other anti-immigrant parties such as the Australian Liberty Alliance and groups such as the United Patriot Front indicates that anti-immigration sentiment may be becoming mainstream.

===Europe===
{{See also|Immigration to Europe}}
Opposition to high levels of legal immigration has been associated with certain [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties in the EU. The issue flared up with the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 with large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and Africa making dangerous trips to Europe and many deaths en route. With high levels of unemployment and partly unassimilated non-European immigrant populations already within the EU, parties opposed to immigration have improved their position in polls and elections. Right-wing parties critical to immigration have entered the government in Austria, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Slovakia, and have become major factors in English, Swedish, German and French politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Bar-On|first= Tamir | contribution = Neither right, nor left? | editor-last= Bar-On | editor-first = Tamir | title = Rethinking the French new right alternatives to modernity | pages = 39–41 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781135966263 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2nG1bCRUEMC&amp;pg=PA39 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration is one of the central political issues in many European countries, and increasingly also at [[European Union]] level. The anti-immigration perspective is predominantly nationalist, cultural and economic. A new index measuring the level of perceived threat from immigrants has been recently proposed and applied to a data set covering 47 European countries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marozzi|first=Marco | title = Construction, robustness assessment and application of an index of perceived level of socio-economic threat from immigrants: a study of 47 European countries and regions | journal = [[Social Indicators Research]] |volume=128 | pages = 1–25 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11205-015-1037-z | date = 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that Malta and Cyprus have the strongest perception of socio-economic threat from immigrants, followed by Austria, Great Britain (in particular England), Northern Ireland and Hungary, and that the countries/regions with the weakest perception of threat are Armenia, Sweden, Romania and Northern Cyprus. European nationalists see unassimilated immigrants as threatening their historic cultures and a violation of their rights of a land for their own peoples. The fears are compounded the fact that many immigrants in western Europe are poor, working class [[Muslim]]s from the [[Middle East]] and [[Northern Africa]]. Prominent European opponents of immigration include [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Thilo Sarrazin]], [[Fjordman]], the late [[Jörg Haider]] and the assassinated [[Pim Fortuyn]].

A January 2004 survey by Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' showed that the "majority" of Spaniards believe immigration was too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff writer |title=Immigration time-bomb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528065305/http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=83&amp;story_id=8794&amp;name=Immigration%2Btime-bomb |archive-date=28 May 2006 |url=http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=83&amp;story_id=8794&amp;name=Immigration+time%2Dbomb |work=[[Expatica]] |publisher=[[Bram Lebo]] |date=23 June 2004 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small [[Neo-fascism|Neo-fascist]] parties, such as Movimiento Social Español, openly campaign using nationalist or anti-immigrant rhetoric as do other small far-right parties such as [[National Democracy (Spain)]] and [[España 2000]]. These parties have never won national or regional parliamentary seats.

==== Portugal ====
Portugal had little immigration until a sudden influx in the 1970s, as ex-colonists returned. Today &lt;!--in Lisbon?--&gt; there are Lisbon-born Africans. Rural areas have just recently begun to see many new arrivals. The country has one far-right party that supports curbs in immigration. Any resident of a Portuguese-speaking country is free to live and work in Portugal, and vice versa. In recent years, the growth of the Portuguese far-right "[[National Renewal Party]]", known as PNR, has targeted the immigration and ethnic minorities issues after years of growing support—0.09% 4,712 [[Portuguese legislative election, 2002|2002]], 0.16% 9,374 [[Portuguese legislative election, 2005|2005]], 0.20% 11,503 [[Portuguese legislative election, 2009|2009]], 0.31% 17,548 [[Portuguese legislative election, 2011|2011]]—managed 0.50% 27,269 of the electorate in the [[Portuguese legislative election, 2015|2015]]

====United Kingdom====
In the UK the [[British National Party]] made opposition to immigration one of their central policies in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = BNP call for end to immigration from Muslim nations | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8639097.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-mass-immigration party, [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]], have proposed setting up a Migration Control Commission, tasked with bringing down net migration.&lt;ref name="Election_2015"&gt;{{cite news | last = Wilkinson | first = Michael | title = Immigration policies: General Election 2015 and how each party will tackle it | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11451936/General-Election-2015-Immigration-policy.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher = [[Telegraph Media Group]] | date = 5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] pledged to bring immigration from the [[EU]] and rest of the world down to the "tens of thousands", with a range of welfare restrictions and housing restrictions.&lt;ref name="Election_2015" /&gt;

The [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|vote for the UK to leave the EU]] was successful in Britain, with a number of commentators suggesting that populist concern over immigration from the EU was a major feature of the public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/triumph-brexiteer-nigel-farage-british-scourge-eu-134149305.html|title=Triumph for 'Brexiteer' Nigel Farage, British scourge of the EU|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister David Cameron resigned over the vote. In 2006, Cameron dismissed UKIP supporters as "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly" though later conceded to hold a vote on leaving the EU, due in part to the Conservative party losing votes to UKIP.{{Fact?|date=February 2017}}

The current Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] introduced an [[Immigration Skills Charge]] in April 2017, on companies who employ skilled non-EU immigrants, of £1000 per immigrant employee; small or charitable organizations pay a reduced amount of £364.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kerry Garcia, Kate Fellows-Tully|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/five-costly-immigration-changes-april-2017/|title=Five costly immigration changes in April 2017|publisher=Personnel Today|date=22 March 2017|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2017/9780111154663 The Immigration Skills Charge Regulations 2017], legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; The money is to be used to help fund apprenticeships and skills training for people from the UK and EU. In her [[2017 UK General Election]] manifesto, the Prime Minister promised to double the Immigration Skills Charge to £2000 per employee, if re-elected. EU law prevents the charge being applied in relation to immigrants from the EU (or limiting the apprenticeships to people from the UK); the prime minister has promised that after [[Brexit]] there will also be restrictions on migration from the EU.

====India====
India has anti-immigrant parties at the state level. The most common anti-immigrant parties are there in the state of [[Maharashtra]], where the two main anti-immigrant parties are [[Shiv Sena]] and the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]]. Both parties share the idea of migrants from North India stealing jobs from the native Marathi people in Maharashtra. They even have a history of attacking immigrants, who they accuse of being involved in crimes around Mumbai. Shiv Sena also has a history of threatening the Pakistani cricket team from coming to Mumbai and also threatening Australian cricket players in the [[Indian Premier League]] cricket competition following the racist attacks on India students in Australia in 2009.

Even in the last few decades, there has been a rise in the anti-Immigrant attitudes in the North East Indian states like [[Assam]], which has received illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh. Riots have occurred between the native tribes of Assam who are Hindus and the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, who are predominantly Muslims.

====Japan====
{{Main article|Ethnic issues in Japan|Human rights in Japan}}
The movement for Japanese cultural isolation, {{nihongo|''[[sakoku]]''|[[wikt:鎖|鎖]] [[wikt:国|国]]}}, arose in [[Edo period]] Japan, in response to the strong influence of [[Western culture]], especially [[Slavery in Portugal]]. The study of (ancient) Japanese literature and culture was called {{nihongo|''kokugaku''|[[wikt:国|国]] [[wikt:学|学]]||"country study"}}.

====Brazil====
{{See also|Venezuelan migrant crisis}}

Brazil is a country of immigrants and developed a reputation for "warm welcome" of people all over the world. Nevertheless, different analysts often dispute how truthful this image is and, although openly xenophobic manifestation were uncommon, some scholars denounce it existence in more subtle ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Novais |first1=Andréa |title=Xenophobia in Brazil |url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/xenophobia-in-brazil |accessdate=2 November 2018 |agency=The Brazil Business |date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that Brazil was considered a safe haven for neighboring refugees and immigrants, xenophobic violence has erupted. Brazil received up to 3000 [[Syrian refugees]] becoming the largest receiver of such in Latin America.&lt;ref name="garcia"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tsavkko Garcia |first1=Raphael |title=Is Brazil no longer safe for refugees and immigrants? |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/08/brazil-longer-safe-refugees-immigrants-170809113330259.html |accessdate=2 November 2018 |agency=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=16 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[xenophobic]] and [[islamophobic]] attacks were reported against Syrian refugees and Muslims in general.&lt;ref name="garcia" /&gt; After the alleged beating of a shop owner during a robbery by alleged [[Bolivarian diaspora|Venezuelan migrants]], riots occurred in the [[Venezuela-Brazil border|Brazilian-Venezuelan border]] which included attacks on Venezuelans nationals, destruction of refugee tends and fires.&lt;ref name="doce"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doce Villamar |first1=Inacio |title=Tense calm on Brazil-Venezuelan border after anti-immigrant riot |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-brazil-border/tense-calm-on-brazil-venezuelan-border-after-anti-immigrant-riot-idUSKCN1L40LU |accessdate=2 November 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1200 Venezuelans went back to their homeland as a result and [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Michel Temer]]'s government increased military personal in the border. The burning of the refugee camps was reported in national and international news outlet and the authorities announce they will investigate and prosecute the authors.

In ''L'Express'', the French news magazine, Canadian academic, and [[environmentalism|environmental activist]] [[David Suzuki]] called Canada's immigration policy "disgusting" (We "plunder southern countries to deprive them of their future leaders, and wish to increase our population to support economic growth") and insisted that "Canada is full" ("Our useful area is reduced"), even though Canada has one of the smallest population densities in the world.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=David Suzuki and Jason Kenney amplify each other|url =https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/editorials/david-suzuki-and-jason-kenney-amplify-each-other/article13205288/|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2013-10-04|location=Toronto|date=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 poll, the majority of Canadians indicated that they agree that Canada should accept fewer immigrants and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;http://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.05.17-Faith-Wave-1-Part2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
Anti-immigrant feelings date back to late 19th century and early 20th century with the country's first waves of migrations from places like [[China]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Poland]]. Non-Polish European migration dates back to practically the independence from [[Spain]] but was generally well received.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=González|first1=Daniel|title=Migración e identidad cultural en Costa Rica (1840-1940)|journal=Revista de Ciencia Sociales UCR|url=https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/sociales/article/view/30259/30231|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish diaspora|Polish migration]] was mostly [[Jewish]] thus the backlash was due to [[anti-Semitism]]. Records of the time show Chinese migrants as the most affected by prejudice especially from government official and the first [[anti-Chinese]] laws were enacted as far back as the 1910s.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; In 1903 [[President of Costa Rica|President]] [[Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra]] enacted one of the first decrees forbidding non-White immigration and explicitly stating that migration from Asians, Blacks, Gypsies, Arabs and Turks was not allowed.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Although this laws were common in Latin America at the time, and Costa Rica's government eventually became the lead force in its abolishment.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;

[[Polish People|Polish]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Lebanese diaspora|Lebanese]] migrants would integrate fully into Costa Rican society with time to the point that many prominent Costa Ricans from industry, politics, arts, academy, etc. are of those descents.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Latin American migrants became the next source of mistrust and opposition, especially [[Nicaraguans in Costa Rica|Nicaraguan]] and [[Colombians in Costa Rica|Colombian]] migrants. During the second half of the 20th century and to this date Costa Rica receives numerous waves of [[Latin American]] migrants from all the region, but Nicaraguans are by far the higher group among immigrant population encompassing 74.6% of the immigrant population,&lt;ref name="acuña"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acuña|first1=Guillermo|title=La migración en Costa Rica|journal=Ministerio de Salud|date=2005|url=https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/gestores_en_salud/derechos%20humanos/migracion/inmigracr.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Colombians and [[Americans in Costa Rica|Americans]] (immigrants in general are 9% of the population) making [[Nicaraguan people|ethnic Nicaraguans]] and binational Nicaraguan-Costa Rican citizens one of the most notorious ethnic minorities in Costa Rica outnumbering other groups like [[African-Costa Rican]]s.&lt;ref name="acuña" /&gt; This caused debate in the country with some voices claiming for harder regulations and border control.&lt;ref name="acuña" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; The issue was one of the main topics of the [[Costa Rican general election, 2002|2002's political campaign]], and was again important for the [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|2018's campaign]] with right-wing politicians like [[Otto Guevara]] quoting [[Donald Trump]] as an inspiration&lt;ref name="Arias"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arias|first1=L|title=Costa Rican legislator praises Trump’s tactics as he eyes new presidential bid|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/11/23/otto-guevara-trump-campaign|accessdate=12 October 2017|agency=The Tico Times|date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calling for harsher migratory laws and eliminating the [[citizenship by birth]] in the [[Constitution of Costa Rica|Constitution]].

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, during the first eight months of 2005, more than 120,000 people from [[Central America]] were deported to their countries of origin. This is a much higher number than the people deported in the same period in 2002, when only 1 person was deported in the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Roman | first = Jose Antonio | title = Detienen en seis meses a 120 mil indocumentados de Centroamérica | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111024215950/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/08/24/018n3pol.php | archive-date = 24 October 2011 | url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/08/24/018n3pol.php | work = La Journada | publisher = Desarrollo de Medios, S.A. de C.V.

[[Mexico]] has very strict laws pertaining to both illegal and legal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Slagle | first = John W. | title = Illegal alien amnesty, guest workers, international law and politics | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071007080905/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=5240 | archive-date = 7 October 2007 | url = http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=5240 | work = American Chronicle | publisher = Ultio | date = 28 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican constitution restricts non-citizens or foreign-born persons from participating in politics, holding office, acting as a member of the clergy, or serving on the crews of Mexican-flagged ships or airplanes. Certain legal rights are waived, such as the right to a deportation hearing or other legal motions. In cases of [[flagrante delicto]], any person may make a citizen's arrest on the offender and his accomplices, turning them over without delay to the nearest authorities.

Many immigration restrictionists in the United States have accused the Mexican government of [[hypocrisy]] in its immigration policy, noting that while the [[Government of Mexico]] and [[Mexican Americans]] are demanding looser immigration laws in the United States and oppose the [[2010 Arizona Immigration Bill]], at the same time Mexico is imposing even tighter restrictions on immigration into Mexico from Central America and other places than the Arizona law. However Mexico started enforcing those laws which they previously ignored at the direct request of the United State's which saw a surge of Central American immigration during the Bush years; the newly elected president of Mexico has stated he's desire to be more open, and would not deport Central Americas on their way to the United States or those who wish to remain in Mexico. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In countries where the majority of the population is of &lt;!--historically recent--&gt;immigrant descent, such as the United States, opposition to immigration sometimes takes the form of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]].&lt;ref name="Higham"&gt;{{cite book |last = Higham | first = John | title = Strangers in the land: patterns of American nativism, 1860–1925 | publisher = Atheneum | location = New York | year = 1963 | oclc = 421752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, opposition to immigration has a long history, starting in the late 1790s, in reaction to an influx of political refugees from France and Ireland. The [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798 severely restricted the rights of immigrants. Nativism first gained a name and affected politics in the mid-19th century United States because of the large inflows of immigrants from cultures that were markedly different from the existing [[Protestantism|Protestant]] culture. Nativists objected primarily to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], especially [[Irish Americans]]. Nativist movements included the [[United States American Party|American Party]] of the mid-19th Century (formed by members of the [[Know-Nothing movement]]), the Immigration Restriction League of the early 20th Century, and the anti-Asian movements in the [[Western United States|West]], resulting in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the so-called "[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]]" which was aimed at the Japanese. Major restrictions became law in the 1920s and sharply cut the inflow until 1965, when they ended.&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt; The federal government took charge of finding and deporting illegal aliens, which it still does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Ngai |first = Mae M. |title = The strange career of the illegal alien: immigration restriction and deportation policy in the United States, 1921–1965 |journal = Law and History Review |volume = 21 |issue = 1 |pages = 69–107 |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi = 10.2307/3595069 |jstor = 3595069 |date = Spring 2003 |ref = harv |postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration again became a major issue from the 1990s onward, with burgeoning undocumented immigration, particularly by Mexicans crossing the Southern border, and others who overstayed their visitor visas. The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] provided an amnesty which was described as the amnesty to end all amnesties but it had no lasting impact on the flow of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="cis"&gt;{{cite web |last = Camarota |first = Steven A. |url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2000/ins1986amnesty.html|title=New INS Report |website=cis.org |publisher = Center for Immigration Studies |date = October 2000 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}

By 2014, the [[Tea Party movement]] narrowed its focus away from economic issues, spending and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]] to attacking President [[Barack Obama]]'s immigration policies. They see his immigration policies as threatening to transform American society. They tried but failed to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator [[John McCain]]. A typical slogan appeared in the ''Tea Party Tribune'': “Amnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.” The ''New York Times'' reported:
:What started five years ago as a groundswell of conservatives committed to curtailing the reach of the federal government, cutting the deficit and countering the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party has become a movement largely against immigration overhaul. The politicians, intellectual leaders and activists who consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement have redirected their energy from fiscal austerity and small government to stopping any changes that would legitimize people who are here illegally, either through granting them citizenship or legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy W. |date=25 November 2014 |title=Obama’s Immigration Action Reinvigorates Tea Party |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[The New York Times Company]] |access-date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, there were over 42.4 million immigrants living in the United States. This was about 13.3% of the entire United States population at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zong|first1=Jie|last2=Batalova|first2=Jeanne|title=Frequently Requested Statistics on Immigrants and Immigration in the United States|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states|website=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Labor unions
{{Main|Immigration policies of American labor unions}}
The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in the 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons.

However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], and seeing that they were strictly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Lane |first = A.T. | title = American trade unions, mass immigration and the literacy test: 1900–1917 | journal = [[Labor History (journal)|Labor History]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00236568408584739 | date = January 1984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Farm Workers]] during [[Cesar Chavez]] tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.

On a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].{{citation needed|date = May 2017}} In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=UFW+report+undocumented#PPA197,M1|title=Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity|first=David Gregory|last=Gutiérrez|year=1995|pages=97–98|publisher=University of California Press|location=San Diego|isbn=9780520916869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2003/03/05.html|title=Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration|publisher=Accuracy in the Media|first1=Reed|last1=Irvine|first2=Cliff|last2=Kincaid|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=ufw+undocumented#PPA90,M1|title=Strawberry Fields: Politics, Class, and Work in California Agriculture|first=Miriam J.|last=Wells|pages=89–90|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=9780801482793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PnUgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ufw+undocumented&amp;q=crack+down#search|title=Beyond the Border: Mexico &amp; the U.S. Today|first1=Peter|last1=Baird|first2=Ed|last2=McCaughan|page=169|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|isbn=9780916024376|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organization ''X''''' ({{lang-el|Οργάνωσις Χ}}; commonly referred to simply as '''''X''''' ("[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]" in Greek), and members as '''Chites''' (Χίτες)) was a fighting force and resistance organization with a firm right-wing and royalist ideology right set up during the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], in June 1941 as a resistance organization. Initially, the group's name was '''Grivas Military Organization''' (Greek: Στρατιωτική Οργάνωσις Γρίβα) and in March 1943 it was renamed, adopting [[George II of Greece|George's II]] royal monogram of two crossed gammas which resembled the Greek alphabet chi (X). ''X'' was heavily involved in battles against EAM and its secret police, [[Organization for the Protection of the People's Struggle|OPLA]], after the Axis occupation and during the civil war, considered communism to be its principal enemy.

==Foundation and activities during the Occupation==
[[File:Georgios Grivas 1967.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Georgios Grivas]]]]

Founder and leader of ''X'' was Colonel [[Georgios Grivas]], a Greek Cypriot by birth, who later acquired fame as leader of the underground [[EOKA]] movement in Cyprus.  Grivas concentrated his efforts in the wealthy districts of Athens and expanded ''X'' to between 2,000 and 3,000 men in 1944.  He recruited his men and arms from officers who were retained on the active list by the quisling government.&lt;ref&gt;John Louis Hondros, Occupation &amp; Resistance: the Greek Agony (New York: Pella, 1983), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

''X'' was pure anti-communist and its resistance action included spying for the Allies, minor anti-German actions and transport to the Middle East. But its relations to the occupying power were ambivalent.  The organization was tolerated and possibly armed by the Germans, and even before the German departure fortified a base near the ancient temple of [[Thiseion]]. Towards the end of the Occupation, ''X'' received arms from British sources with which its members fought in the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' clashes of December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Richter, British Intervention in Greece (London: Merlin Press, 1985) p. 167; David Close, The Origins of the Greek Civil War (London: Longman, 1995), p. 114; Neni Panourgia, Dangerous Citizens New York: Fordham University Press, 2009), p. 58-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ''Dekemvriana'' ==

In the weeks between the departure of the Germans and the events of December 1944 (the ''Dekemvriana''), ''X'' played an active part in the campaign of provocation of Athenians orchestrated by the British, according to ELAS' members.&lt;ref&gt;Orestis Makis, Ο ΕΛΑΣ της Αθηνας (Athens: Synchroni Epochi,  1985); Επεσαν για τη Ζωη (Athens: KKE, 2004); Manos Ioannidis, Φακελος Νο9745/Β (Athens: Medousa, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This commenced in Athens on 12 October, the day that Athens was celebrating liberation, when a mixed gang of [[EDES]] and Chites killed the ELAS member Theodoros Tsilikas.&lt;ref&gt;Επεσαν για τη Ζωη (Athens: KKE, 2004), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  In late October the ''X'' of Thiseio, reinforced by Security Battalionists, made an incursion into Petralona and killed 20 locals, including a number of Petralona gypsies.&lt;ref&gt;Orestis Makis, Ο ΕΛΑΣ της Αθηνας (Athens: Synchroni Epochi,  1985), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 1944 a 250,000-strong (but unarmed) demonstration was shot at by Greek police under the police chief [[Angelos Evert]], with between 22 and 28 people killed and hundreds wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Tsoukalas, The Greek Tragedy (Baltimkore: Penguin, 1969)  (Tsoukalas gives a figure of 28 dead).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early morning hours of 4 December, ELAS reservists began operations in the Athens–Piraeus area, attacking Grivas' X forces.&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Shrader, ''The Withered Vine: Logistics and the Communist Insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949'', Praeger, 1999, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening, a peaceful demonstration by EAM members cum funeral procession took place. This time government forces took no action but the procession was attacked by Chites led by Colonel Grivas, with over 100 dead.  There followed the [[Dekemvriana|December insurrection]], in which ''X'' supported the British and Greek government forces.

== ''X'' during the White Terror ==

In accordance with the [[Treaty of Varkiza]] of February 1945, ELAS disarmed, leaving its supporters vulnerable to attacks from right-wing forces, during a period known as the [[White Terror (Greece)|White Terror]]. The White Terror was conducted by an informal alliance of army officers, National Guards, policemen, armed gangs, political organizations and people from families who had victims during the occupation and Dekemvriana seeking revenge. The majority were determined to prepare the way for a rigged plebiscite and the return of the king.  Anyone deemed to be left-wing, or who had supported the communist-led resistance (EAM or ELAS) in any way was subjected to random beatings, repeated arrests, torture, murder or rape.  Many people left their villages for safety either in the big towns or in the mountains.  Civil war now appeared to be inevitable.

''X'' played an active role in the White Terror, and even in the weeks before Varkiza British officials were complaining of police using elements of ''X'' and EDES to make political arrests under warrants issued by a police magistrate who was a member of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Hondros, p. 249.  Hondros’s reference is R1373/4/19 Leeper to FO, January 18YT6h.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the significant events involving ''X'' occurred in January 1946 when 1000 Chites under the bandit Manganas took over the town of [[Kalamata]] in the [[Peloponnese]]. They released 32 right-wing prisoners and terrorized the town during the night killing 6 people.  In 1948 Manganas resumed a career of banditry in the Olympia region.

During 1945 attempts were made to coordinate persecution of the Left.  Much of the liaison was conducted by ''X'', which from May 1945 sent agents into the provinces to recruit members, and accepted affiliation from numerous other organizations.  The local right-wing organizations rigged the electoral process and compiled lists of people to be arrested in the event of a coup.&lt;ref&gt;David Close, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the general election approached early in 1946 the role of ''X'' diminished. [[Themistoklis Sophoulis]]’s government closed ''X''’s national offices in January, and its successor did not allow them to reopen. Members of the organization formed the "Party of X" and took part in the elections of 1946, without electing any MP. By 1946 ''X'' was regarded as an embarrassment as it discredited the Greek government in international eyes.&lt;ref&gt;David Close, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

''X'' was officially recognized as a ''National Organization of Internal Resistance'' by a royal decree of March 10, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Papadopoulos Omiros 2000, ''Organosis X: Tria Hronia Tris Eones'', Nea Thesis, Athens, pp. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  (The biggest resistance organisation EAM-ELAS was not recognised until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Βαγγέλης Τζούκας, Η αναγνώριση της Εθνικής Αντίστασης", στο Β.Βαμβακάς-Π. Παναγιωτόπουλος (επιμ.), Η Ελλάδα στη δεκαετία του 80: κοινωνικό, πολιτικό και πολιτισμικό λεξικό, Αθήνα, Το πέρασμα, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;)

Garber Preservation, Re.jpg|thumb|Retired Senior Chief Aviation Machinist's Mate Scott Wood carefully restores a Saturn V F-1 rocket engine to its original condition]]

The '''Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility''' is located in [[Suitland, Maryland]], United States.  The facility, also nicknamed  "'''Silver Hill'''", is where the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] restores aircraft, spacecraft, and other artifacts.

It is named in honor of [[Paul E. Garber]], a Smithsonian curator who devoted most of his career to maintaining a collection of historic aircraft. It was created in the early 1950s by Garber to store, protect the museum's growing collection of [[World War II]] aircraft and provide space to restore them. The facility consists of 32 unassuming metal buildings. 19 of those buildings are devoted to storage of airplanes, spacecraft, engines, and various parts awaiting restoration. One building is devoted to a large restoration shop, and three buildings are for exhibition creation.

The restorers sometimes call on other Smithsonian professionals such as fine art painting restoration experts to consult on aircraft restoration projects. To date, the largest restoration project undertaken by the Garber Facility was the [[B-29 Superfortress]], "[[Enola Gay]]". Work began in 1984. The fuselage alone took 10 years of work. The aircraft was finally delivered to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in 11 tractor trailer loads over the space of three months in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/museum/garber/enola/enola.htm Artifact Restoration — Enola Gay (aft fuselage)], [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], USA. Retrieved March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously it acted as a storage facility for items which could not be put on public display, but with the completion of the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], and restoration at its own, on-site [[Donald D. Engen|Mary Baker Engen]] Restoration Hangar facility, all items in storage are being moved out of the Garber Facility. With the opening of Udvar-Hazy, the Garber facility was closed to public tours.

Approximately 65 [[space suit]]s from the Mercury, Apollo, and other [[US space program]]s had been stored at the facility in an environmentally-controlled room.

The roof collapsed on the facility's Warehouse #21 just before dawn on [[February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard|February 10, 2010 during a blizzard]] and the region's second 15 to 30 inch snowstorm during a five-day period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pgfdpio.blogspot.com/2010/02/smithsonian-museum-support-center-among.html Prince George's County Fire Department report], February 10, 2010. Retrieved March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The warehouse, scheduled for eventual demolition after transfer of the artifacts to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], contained historic aircraft and spacecraft that were exposed to sub-freezing temperatures and blowing snow. They were not thought to be damaged, as all were in protective boxes or crates on shelving units that were still supporting parts of the warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roof Collapse for "Nation's Attic"|publisher=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roof-collapse-for-nations-attic/|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domesday zinco Somerset Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A page from the photozincographic edition of Domesday Book for ''[[Somerset|Somersetshire]]'' (published in 1862), showing entries for some of the landholdings of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]
In the 1860s the first [[facsimile]] of [[Domesday Book]] was created by the process of [[photozincography]] (later termed ''zinco''), and was executed under the directorship of [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] at the [[Southampton]] offices of the [[Ordnance Survey]].

==Initial stages==
Having developed the photozincographic process, in a meeting arranged between James and [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], Sir Henry expressed his ability to produce photozincographic copies of ancient documents at "a very trifling cost".&lt;ref&gt;H. James, ''Domesday Book, or The Great Survey of England of William the Conqueror...Fac-Simile of the Part Relating to Cornwall'', (Southampton: by H.M. Command, 1860), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of £1575 for 500 copies or £3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph.

On 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the [[Cornwall]] fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. [[Joseph Burtt]], one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday  and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domesday Book in Southampton==
[[File:OS Map of Southampton new.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1865 map showing the photography building and the Ordnance Survey offices]]
On arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' "fireproof principles, and…military guard", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;PRO 1/25 16 Feb. 1861&lt;/ref&gt; The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.

==Permissions and difficulties==
Having completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the [[Master of the Rolls]] regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by [[Lambert Larking|Rev. Lambert Larking]] of Kent.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. [[Thomas Letts]] of Letts Son &amp; Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally  bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday – but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life.&lt;ref&gt;T. Owen &amp; E. Pilbeam, ''Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791'', (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; 

The volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.

==Today==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The books which were printed by James's method are still sought after even if they are not up to the standard of later facsimiles. His edition of ''Domesday Book'' is still the only facsimile of it available and can be found reasonably cheaply, whereas the letterpress is extremely rare and very expensive."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; G. Wakeman, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography'', (Wymondham: Brewhouse Press, 1970), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">'''Political Soldier''' is a [[political]] concept associated with the [[Third Position]]. It played a leading role in Britain's [[British National Front|National Front]] from the late 1970s onwards under young radicals [[Nick Griffin]], [[Patrick Harrington]] and [[Derek Holland (activist)|Derek Holland]] of the [[Official National Front]]. The term was used to indicate an almost fanatical devotion to the cause of [[nationalism]], which its supporters felt was needed to bring about a revolutionary change in society.

A faction within the National Front called for the building of a fresh [[ethos]] within [[society]] and for the emergence of a [[New Man (utopian concept)|new man]], to be known as the Political Soldier, who would reject [[materialism]] and devote himself to the nationalist struggle with [[religious zeal]]. Basing their ideas on those of [[Julius Evola]], an Italian philosopher who sought the creation of a new [[elite]] to combat the [[decadence]] of modern [[bourgeois]] society, Political Soldiers rejected traditional [[British nationalism]] in favour of a European outlook and a [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialist]] equality of [[Racial segregation|separate races]].

==History==
The idea of the Political Soldier, someone who devotes all his time and energy to the nationalist struggle, was one that had long existed on the [[far right]] in [[Europe]]. [[Jean-François Thiriart]] was amongst those to argue for this need for complete devotion from [[activists]] and had set up camps to train Political Soldiers in the 1960s.

One issue of ''National Front News'' featured a front cover depicting the 'new alliance' of the NF with [[Libya]]’s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], [[Iran]]’s [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] and [[Louis Farrakhan]], the leader of the [[Black Nationalist]] [[Nation of Islam]], effectively endorsing an [[ethnopluralism|ethnopluralist]] form of racial separatism (although critics were quick to point out the [[anti-Semitism]] linking the chosen allies). A magazine by the name of ''Rising'' was published sporadically in the early 1980s to support the ideal, attracting a [[Europe]]-wide audience in [[far-right]] circles.

Holland published ''The Political Soldier - A Statement'' in 1984. The pamphlet called on supporters to become consumed by their [[nationalism]] and to make it the driving force behind everything in their lives. The book offered four historical examples of a Political Soldier, i.e., the [[Sparta]]ns, the Roman [[Centurion]], the [[Crusade]]rs and the [[Iron Guard]] of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], a Romanian movement of fascism and religion. The book also made the [[Celtic Cross]] the emblem of the Political Soldiers.

The concept of the Political Soldier caused divisions within the British far right as many of its ideas were new and alien concepts. The Official National Front was eventually removed from the NF and the calls for a 'new man' were continued by the [[International Third Position]]. Within the UK, the magazine ''Final Conflict'' is still devoted to this idea. Holland's book has been translated into a number of European languages (notably into [[Polish language|Polish]] for the [[National Revival of Poland]]) whilst the term is still used by the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] to describe its followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/cln_028/nn_332136/sid_5C609CE842275931038221E51AE8113B/Internet/Content/Nachrichten/Archiv/Pressemitteilungen/2001/01/The__Federal__Government__has__filed__a__Id__59989__en.html]{{dl|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queenstown Lakes District Council v Palmer CA83/98 [1998] NZCA 190; [1999] 1 NZLR 549  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the claiming of damages for nervous shock from witnessing an accident.

==Background==
Mark Palmer and his wife were tourists from the US, and went white water rafting on the Shotover River.

Tragedy struck, when his wife drowned in the river, and whilst Palmer did not suffer any physical injuries, he suffered post traumatic injury for witnessing her death.

Thomas sued the rafting company and the local council for damages for his mental injuries.

The council defended the matter by claiming that the ACC law prohibited awarding damages for injury in NZ.

However, Palmer said the law was changed in 1992 with the Accident Rehabilitation Act, where section 14(1) now excluded cover for mental injury for witnessing an accident.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal confirmed that section 14(1) now allowed people to sue for mental injury resulting in witnessing an accident.

'''''Return to Horror High''''' is a 1987 American comedy [[slasher film]] written and directed by Bill Froehlich and starring [[Vince Edwards]], Brendan Hughes, [[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]], Lori Lethin, [[Philip McKeon]], and [[Alex Rocco]]. Told in a [[nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] format, the plot follows a film production crew who begin to disappear while shooting a movie based on an unsolved killing spree that occurred in a high school. The film features supporting performances from Al Fann, [[Panchito Gómez]], Richard Brestoff, [[Maureen McCormick]], and [[George Clooney]]. 

==Plot==
In 1982, the town of Crippen was rocked by a series of murders at Crippen High School. The killer was never caught. Several years later, Cosmic Pictures, headed by sleazy producer Harry Sleerek, arrives in Crippen to make a [[biographical film|biographical movie]] about the crimes titled ''Horror High''. To maximize the production's low budget, the cast and crew temporarily move into the real Crippen High School, where they are to film [[Filming location|on location]]; the lead actress, Callie Cassidy, is hired to play multiple roles. In the midst of the film shoot, multiple disappearances and murders occur, which are subsequently investigated by police Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler. While the bodies are recovered from the school, Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler interview the film's screenwriter, Arthur Lyman, outside, and he recounts the events on-set:

Some days prior, lead actor Oliver informs director Josh Forbes that he is dropping out of the production. Before leaving, he is murdered in an empty wing of the school. Harry immediately replaces Oliver with Steven Blake, a real-life police officer and former Crippen High student. Tensions on set rise when Harry insists Callie show on-screen nudity, while Arthur is forced to repeatedly make script changes to accommodate Harry's requests for more gore. One day, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] is murdered, followed by Choo Choo, a special effects assistant. Shortly after, cast member Richard Farley is caught in a [[booby trap]] that drags his body into a steel-blade industrial fan.

While wandering the high school in-between scenes, Steve recounts to Callie his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Kathy; her father, Crippen's Principal Kastleman, is on-set serving as a [[technical advisor]], but Steve has not seen Kathy in years. Meanwhile, Callie begins noticing that cast and crew are disappearing. Fearing the killer has returned, she and Steve begin their own private investigation. Callie's discomfort is compounded one day while watching the filming of a brutal scene in which the school biology teacher, Richard Birnbaum, is dissected. 

Later, Steve notices a photo of Kathy on the set; when he inquires to Principal Kastleman about Kathy's whereabouts, he claims she is in [[graduate school]]. That night, Steve and Callie find a trail of blood in the hallway, and discover Harry and Josh's corpses, as well as a trapdoor leading to a basement. In the basement, they find a classroom full of the decomposed victims of the 1982 massacre, all posed in desks. They are confronted by Amos, the school janitor, who attacks Steve. During their fight, Steve inadvertently removes a latex mask from Amos's face, revealing him to actually be Principal Kastleman in disguise. Kastleman explains how years ago, Kathy discovered she was pregnant with Steve's child, after which Kastleman murdered her in a rage and hid her body in the school basement before killing multiple students. Callie and Steve manage to overpower Kastleman, impaling him with a [[javelin]].

In the present, after Arthur finishes recounting the events to Chief Deney and Officer Tyler, the police enter the school to investigate. While they do so, Arthur calls out "all clear" outside, upon which all of the victims{{en dash}}who have been laid in the grass and covered in sheets{{en dash}}rise; they have in fact been alive all along. In reality, Callie and Steve uncovered in their research that Kastleman was in fact the true killer in the 1982 massacre, and killed him in the basement. Harry decided to capitalize on this by devising a mock massacre centered around the revelation as a [[publicity stunt]] to help promote the film. In the basement, police find Kastleman, still impaled by the javelin, but alive; he lunges at them, leading them to shoot him multiple times. When they return outside and find the bodies of the film crew inexplicably gone, they assume there is still a killer on the loose.

Later, Arthur sits at a typewriter to compose a new screenplay he has called ''The Return to Horror High'', which he intends as a sequel. A framed photo of Principal Kastleman sits on his desk. An unseen figure enters the room and stops at Arthur's typewriter, dripping blood on the pages being typed. Arthur looks up at the unseen figure and says, "Dad?"

The film was given a [[limited release]] theatrically in the [[United States]] by [[New World Pictures]] on January 9, 1987.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57797?sid=2fd219e4-28d7-4b5e-aa79-f97a167021a3&amp;sr=4.9422884&amp;cp=1&amp;pos=0|work=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Return to Horror High|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release expanded in April, with its widest release being 227 theaters.&lt;ref name=bom/&gt; It grossed $1,189,709 at the U.S. box office.&lt;ref name=bom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=returntohorrorhigh.htm|title=Return to Horror High|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Critical response===
Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the film is "laudably offbeat" with "a rich premise," but added: "True life or nightmare, recollection or schlock—each level of "reality" has the same camera angles, the same fake gore, and the same ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''-in-the-Charnelhouse style acting. And the triple-twist climax is so wildly unlikely, and depends on such cretinous inattention from some of the cast, that you could only accept it in a drunken stupor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Times|title='Horror High'|author=Wilmington, Michael|accessdate=April 18, 2018|date=April 6, 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-06/entertainment/ca-79_1_horror-high}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Cedrone of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' wrote: "As horror films go, this one is not all that gory, but it does well enough to displease the people who don't go for this sort of thing. Are there many of us left?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|title='Return to Horror High' is one reunion you may want to avoid|last=Cedrone|first=Lou|date=March 17, 1987|p=44|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22052075/the_evening_sun/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film's release, an article in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' noted: "[''Return to Horror High'' is] a slasher [[pastiche]] that garnered significant critical acclaim even as it came close to succumbing at the boxoffice because of what Sims called New World Pictures' inept distribution and promotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[Cinefantastique]]|title=Bram Stoker's "Dracula" updated by the way of "Romeo and Juliet"|author=Teitelbaum, Sheldon|p=80|volume=19|publisher=F. S. Clarke|year=1989|issn=0145-6032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] Video Guide'' characterizes the film as an "Ambitious low-budget affair, with a film crew making a movie about gory high school murders caught up in a bunch of real slayings. [It] never really takes off due to slack direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blockbuster Video Guide to Movies and Videos, 1996|year=1995|publisher=Dell|isbn=978-0-440-22114-2|p=964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''150 Movies You Should Die Before You See'' (2010), film critic Steve Miller writes: "The narrative threads of this low-budget spoof of slasher films are more tangled than the cocaine-fueled fever dreams of [[Quentin Tarantino]]. As the end credits start to roll, we start to wonder if this was a movie about real killings or a movie within a movie based on real-life killers. Or... well, you get the idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=150 Movies You Should Die Before You See|year=2010|author=Miller, Steve|publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=88|isbn=978-1-440-50902-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rick Steves''' (born May 10, 1955) is an American [[travel writer]], author, activist and [[television personality]]. Since 2000, he has hosted ''[[Rick Steves' Europe]]'', a travel series on [[PBS]]. Steves also has a [[public broadcasting|public radio]] travel show called ''Travel with Rick Steves'' (2005−present) and has authored numerous travel guides.

==Career==
Steves started his career by teaching travel classes through [[Experimental College (movement)|The Experimental College]], a student-run program of non-credit classes at his [[alma mater]], the [[University of Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holtz|first=Jackson|title=Rick Steves built travel biz through the back door|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-03-07-rick-steves_x.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working as a tour guide in the summer. At the time, he also worked as a [[piano teacher]] (his father had owned a piano store). In 1979, based on his travel classes, he wrote the first edition of ''Europe Through the Back Door'' (ETBD), a general guide on how to travel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Potter|first=Everett|title=Rick Steves takes you to 'Europe Through the Back Door'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6rwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hfwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6714,5982136&amp;dq=europe-through-the-back-door&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=June 19, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steves self-published the first edition of his travel skills book ETBD in 1980. Unlike most guidebook entrepreneurs, he opened a storefront business. Initially, this was both a travel center and a piano teaching studio. He held travel classes and slide show presentations, did travel consulting, organized a few group tours per year, and updated his books. He did not provide ticket booking or other standard travel agency services. He incorporated his business as "Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door." The store was in Steves' hometown of [[Edmonds, Washington]], north of [[Seattle]]. The company's headquarters are still in Edmonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ricksteves.com/about/contact.htm |title=Contact Us |work=Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door |accessdate= June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steves' first television show, ''Travels in Europe with Rick Steves,'' debuted on public television in April 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&amp;id=74691 |title=Rick Steves' Europe: Series Info |website=Thetvdb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended production in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252794/|title=Travels in Europe with Rick Steves |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second show, ''[[Rick Steves' Europe]],'' debuted in September 2000, and has produced episodes through 2016, though because he does not produce a season every year, this accounts for nine seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=74691&amp;lid=7 |title=Rick Steves' Europe: Complete Episode List |website=Thetvdb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steves advocates independent travel. His books and media deal with travel mainly in Europe and are directed at an American audience. As host, writer, and producer of the popular and long-running [[Oregon Public Broadcasting]] television series ''Rick Steves' Europe'', and through his [[Guide book|travel book]]s, he encourages Americans to become what he calls "temporary locals." He encourages his readers and viewers to visit not just major cities but also cozy villages away from popular tourist routes. Steves's television series, guidebooks, radio shows, mobile applications, and his company's European escorted bus tours attract fans known as "Rickniks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DC1438F937A35754C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= Rick Steves's Not-So-Lonely Planet |work=[[New York Times]] |first=Sara |last=Corbett |date= July 4, 2004 |accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steves's relationship with public television began in 1991 with his first series, ''Travels in Europe with Rick Steves''. Since then he has become one of public television's top pledge drive hosts, raising millions of dollars annually for stations across the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He writes and co-produces his television programs through his own production company, '''Back Door Productions'''.

[[File:Rick Steves Italy 2005.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Tourists in Italy encounter Rick Steves on a backstreet, using his book as a guide.]]
Since self-publishing his first book in 1980, Steves has written country guidebooks, city and regional guides, phrase books, and co-authored ''Europe 101: History and Art for Travelers''. His guidebook to Italy is the bestselling international guidebook in the U.S. In 1999, he started writing in a new genre of travel writing with his anecdotal ''Postcards from Europe'', recounting his favorite moments from his many years of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Molnar|first=Jim|title=Travel Books -- Two Takes On Touring Europe|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990214&amp;slug=2944083|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=February 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steves's books are published by [[Moon Publications|Avalon Travel]] Publishing, a member of the [[Perseus Books Group]]. In 2009, Steves published the book ''Travel as a Political Act,'' a guide on traveling more thoughtfully.

In addition to his guidebooks and television shows, Steves has expanded into radio, newspaper and mobile applications. In 2005, Steves launched a weekly public radio program, ''Travel with Rick Steves''. Focusing on world travel, although with a heavy emphasis on Europe and North America, each program has a guest travel expert for interviews, followed by call-ins with questions and comments.  In 2006, Steves became a syndicated newspaper [[columnist]] with his [[Tribune Content Agency]] column.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rick Steves' Europe articles |url=https://tribunecontentagency.com/premium-content/travel/rick-steves-europe/ |website=Tribune Content Agency |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he launched the mobile application ''Rick Steves' Audio Europe'', a library of audio content (including self-guided walking tours) organized into geographic-specific playlists for the iPhone and Android.

==Political and civic advocacy==

[[File:Seattle Hempfest 2010 Rick Steves - Cannabis Is a Civil Liberty.webm|thumb|Rick Steves speaks about [[cannabis prohibition]] at Seattle Hempfest 2010]]

Politically, Steves has identified himself as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and publicly endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/hillaryclinton/|date=July 29, 2016|website = Rick Steves' Travel Blog|title = Top Ten Reasons I'm With Her|last=Steves|first=Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steves is a vocal proponent of legalizing [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and an active supporter of efforts to reform cannabis policy in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's Time for a New Approach to Marijuana |url=https://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick/new-approach-to-marijuana |website=ricksteves.com |accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moneymen"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-22869-meet_the_marijuana_moneymen.html | title=Meet the Marijuana Moneymen | publisher=Willamette Week | date=29 July 2014 | access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steves: "Like most of Europe, I believe marijuana is a [[drug harmfulness|soft drug]], like [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]. Like alcohol and tobacco, there is no reason why it shouldn't be taxed and regulated. Crime should only enter the equation if it is abused to the point where innocent people are harmed."&lt;ref name="NORML" /&gt;

Steves serves on the Advisory Board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]].&lt;ref name="NORML"&gt;{{cite web |title=Advisory Board: Rick Steves |url=http://norml.org/advisory-board/item/rick-steves |website=NORML |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a major supporter of [[Washington Initiative 502|Initiative 502]] to legalize, tax, and regulate cannabis in the state of Washington.&lt;ref name="moneymen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newapproachwa.org/content/sponsors|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625034154/http://newapproachwa.org/content/sponsors|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 25, 2011|title=Sponsors|publisher=New Approach Washington|date=|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steves hosted an [[ACLU]]-sponsored educational program called ''Marijuana: It's Time for a Conversation'', which was nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rick Steves Nominated for EMMY as Host of "Marijuana Conversation" |url=https://www.aclu-wa.org/news/rick-steves-nominated-emmy-host-marijuana-conversation |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=ACLU of Washington |date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steves also supports solutions to [[homelessness]]. In 2005, he constructed a 24-unit apartment complex in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], called Trinity Way and administrated by the local [[YWCA]], to provide transitional housing for homeless mothers and their children.   In 2017, Steves donated that $4 million apartment complex for homeless women and kids to the YWCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steves |first1=Rick |title=Travel, Budget Beds, and the Homeless |url=https://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick/trinity-place |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=ricksteves.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Edmonds Noontime [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] help maintain the buildings and grounds, providing everything from furniture to flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ywcaworks.org/page.aspx?pid=449 |title=Trinity Way |website=YWCA |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217232046/http://www.ywcaworks.org/page.aspx?pid=449 |archivedate=February 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club also raised $30,000 to build a play structure for the children there. Steves also raises funds for the hunger advocacy group [[Bread for the World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/about/pressroom/activism/activism_menu.htm |title=Rick Steves' Europe: Social Activism |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A supporter of the arts, Steves gave US$1 million in 2011 to the [[Edmonds, Washington#The arts|Edmonds Center for the Arts]] and Cascade Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/about/pressroom/cascade-symphony-orchestra.htm |title=Rick Steves Europe: Rick Steves Donates $1 Million to Edmonds Center for the Arts and Cascade Symphony Orchestra |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a lifelong traveler, Steves avows that terrorism is something Americans should get used to, a natural outgrowth of the United States' position in the global community and how it is militarily advanced.  In an interview with the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', Steves said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think we're 300&amp;nbsp;million people and if we lose a few hundred people a year to terrorists, that doesn't change who we are and it shouldn't change the fabric of our society. Frankly I think we should get used to losing—as long as we're taking the stance in the world of being the military superpower, you're going to have people nipping at you. And if it's hundreds or thousands—we lose 15,000&amp;nbsp;people a year to have the right to bear arms and most people think that's a good deal, year after year. We spend 15,000&amp;nbsp;people for the right to bear arms. What do we spend to be as aggressive and heavy weight on this planet? We're always going to have terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Postman |first=David |title=The RIck Steves Guide to terrorism in the world |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Travel as a Political Act'', Steves wrote that displaying the American flag on car antennas "creates a fearful, schizophrenic dynamic that may stoke today's terrorism and tomorrow's international conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;Steves, Rick (2009). Travel As a Political Act (Kindle ed.). New York: Nation Books. Kindle location 1640.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Steves posted on his blog, stating that he would donate $1 for every $1 spent on his website on [[Inauguration Day]] to the ACLU. According to Steves, the website had higher traffic than usual and that customers purchased $42,962 in merchandise. As a response, Steves wrote a check for $50,000 to the ACLU and stated: "Those of us with passports and who are wealthy enough to travel a lot — especially white, straight, Christian males like me — don’t often think a lot about civil liberties…at least, not in an immediate or personal way. Civil liberties just aren’t an issue for most of us. If a wealthy person is in trouble with the law, he can hire a good lawyer. It’s the poor who are filling our prisons. If I want to smoke pot, no one’s going to arrest me. It’s poor and black people who get arrested, and then disenfranchised. I have a voice because I fit societal norms and I have money."&lt;ref name="Steves"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Keeping America Great Together: $50,000 to the ACLU|url=http://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/keeping-america-great-together-50000-to-the-aclu/|website=Rick Steves' Europe|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Steves is an active [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and has written and hosted educational videos on subjects such as [[Martin Luther]] and the European [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Steves, Rick (2009).

Steves is of Norwegian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/norwegian-roots|title=Finding My Norwegian Roots by Rick Steves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Jan Steves is an Iditarod racer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steves |first1=Rick |title=The Iditarod: My Sister, Jan Steves, Mushes with the Best Dog Racers in the World |url=https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/the-iditarod-my-sister-jan-steves-mushes-with-the-best-dog-racers-in-the-world/ |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=ricksteves.com |date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Anne Steves until 2010, when they divorced. They are the parents of two grown children. Their son Andy Steves followed his father's footsteps and founded his own travel company, Weekend Student Adventures Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wsaeurope.com/ |title= Weekend Student Adventures Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote ''Andy Steves' Europe: City-Hopping on a Budget''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.wsaeurope.com/about/about-andy-steves |title= Andy Steves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steves spends about a third of every year in Europe researching guidebooks and filming TV shows. His home and his Back Door Production headquarters are in [[Edmonds, Washington]].

'''''Smart v [[Her Majesty's Advocate]]''''' is a notably Scots law case that effectively excludes the doctrine common law doctrine of [[Volenti non fit injuria]] from Scots criminal law, when concerning assault. 

The case saw the accused, William Smart, who was charged with assault, lodging the defence that his victim Issac Wilkie has consented to a [[Street fighting|"square go"]]. Therefore Smart could not be charged with assaulting Wilkie or any injuries arising from the fight.

==Facts==
Smart was originally trialed at Paisley Sheriff Court in 1974 by Sheriff Mclean and a jury. Smart put forward two lines of argument. Firstly, that he should not be charged with assault because the victim had consented to fight him and thus knew of the risks and consequences. Secondly, he argued that he had acted in self-defence, a plea that was ruled out because  of the lack of evidence to support this defence. The only question to decide was whether or not the consent ruled out assault. 

==Ruling==
The sheriff ruled that:

"Now something has been said about consent. I direct you in law that consent—if you in fact were to find that Wilkie had consented in some way to this assault—then that would not be a defence … if the act is criminal it cannot lose its criminal character because the victim consented, and the reason is not far to seek. "

Smart was found guilty of assault by the jury and sentenced to detention for a period of three months.  Smart chose to appeal this decision claiming consent was a defence to a charge of assault on the grounds that both men had chosen to fight without weapons in similar conditions to a boxing match. Smart relied on a passage from Gordon, Criminal Law at page 773, which stated:
 
"If A and B decide to fight each other they cannot be guilty of assaulting each other, so long as neither exceeds the degree of violence consented to or permitted by law."

The appeal was heard on 24 January 1975 in the High court of justiciary, who on appeal held that it was not a defence to a criminal charge of assault that the injuries had been caused in the course of a consensual fight.  The court held that:

"it is in the public interest that it should be decided and made known that consent to a 'square go' is not a defence to a charge of assault based on that agreed combat."

The situation was different from indecent acts or injuries caused in the course of organised sports, such as boxing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2654">'''The Spinning-Woman by the Spring''' or "The Kind and the Unkind Girls" is a widespread, traditional [[Folklore|folk tale]], known throughout [[Europe]] and in certain regions of [[Asia]], including [[Indonesia]]. The tale is cataloged as AT 480 in the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|international Folktale catalog]].

==Synopsis==
Two [[stepsister]]s are, one after another, sent out to serve in the house of a [[witch]], where they are assigned what appear to be difficult or [[adynaton|impossible tasks]]. For instance, they are tasked to carry water with a [[sieve]]. 

The kind girl, however, obeys requests from grateful animals and learns from the birds' song that she must line the sieve with [[clay]] to complete her task. Other chores they are assigned include washing black [[wool]] white, and gathering [[flower]]s at [[midwinter]].

As payment for her household work she can choose one of three [[casket]]s, an attractive red, a common yellow or an ugly blue casket. Again she receives advice from the animals and makes the modest choice and becomes richly rewarded. Even though the unkind girl is also able to understand [[animal language]], she refuses to follow the advice given by the birds and the help offered by other animals.

== Shakespeare ==
The same [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] is used by [[William Shakespeare]] in the [[play (theatre)|play]] ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Act 2, Scene VII where the [[Prince]] of [[Morocco]] has to solve the [[riddle]] and find out what casket hides [[Portia (The Merchant of Venice)|Portia's]] [[portrait]].

:	MOROCCO 
:	The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
:	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
:	The second, silver, which this promise carries,
:	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
:	This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
:	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
:	How shall I know if I do choose the right?

'''''The Thin Red Line''''' is American author [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]]'s fourth novel. It draws heavily on Jones's experiences at the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse]] during World War II's [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. The author served in the [[United States Army]]'s [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment]], [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]].

==Novel==
''The Thin Red Line'', originally published in September 1962,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesjonesliterarysociety.org/THIN.HTM |title=The Thin Red Line |publisher=Jamesjonesliterarysociety.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131652/http://www.jamesjonesliterarysociety.org/THIN.HTM |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shares its central characters with Jones's other two World War II novels, though with their names necessarily altered, and examines their different reactions to combat. Jones had originally intended the central male characters of his previous war novel [[From Here to Eternity (novel)|''From Here to Eternity'']] to appear in this work. But Jones remarked that "the dramatic structure—I might even say the spiritual content—of the first book demanded that Prewitt be killed at the end of it". Jones tackled the problem by changing the names of the three characters of the first novel, enabling them to appear in ''The Thin Red Line''. The character of Prewitt became Witt, Warden became Welsh and Stark became Storm.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; (Jones' later novel ''[[Whistle (novel)|Whistle]]'' (1978), features a similar set of characters, now named Sergeant Mart Winch, Bobby Prell, and Johnny "Mother" Strange; Corporal Fife in ''The Thin Red Line'' also reappears as company clerk Marion Landers in ''Whistle''.)

The novel portrays battle realistically, including several particularly gruesome acts depicted as natural responses to the soldiers' environment, such as the disinterring of a Japanese corpse for fun, the [[summary execution]] of Japanese prisoners, and the extraction of their corpses' gold teeth. The novel explores the idea that modern war is an extremely personal and lonely experience in which each soldier suffers the emotional horrors of war by himself.

[[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] wrote his novel based on his personal experiences during the battle of the Galloping Horse,  the Sea Horse, and Kokumbona which he renamed "The Dancing Elephant", "The Sea Slug", and "Bunabala".&lt;ref&gt;"Biography of James Jones", the epilogue of "Whistle" by James Jones in the 2010 electronic version published by Open Road Integrated Media.&lt;/ref&gt;    Of particular significance, Jones recounts his own experience killing a Japanese soldier with his bare hands.

The title comes from [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] poem "[[Tommy (Kipling poem)|Tommy]]", from the collection ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'', in which Kipling describes foot soldiers as "the thin red line of 'eroes". Kipling's poem is based on the 1854 action of British soldiers during the [[Crimean War]] called [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)]].

==Reception==
''Kirkus Reviews'' praised the novel in 1962, commenting that the novel's "well-drawn battle narrative provides take-off points for dozens of character studies, and the author describes emotional responses to battle, fear, death, homosexuality, along with detached, ironic comments on army organization and the workings of fate, luck and circumstance".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-jones/thin-red-line/#review&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Christle, speaking at a 20th-century literature conference in 2002, said of the novel, "''The Thin Red Line'' is the only novel of Jones's war quartet that actually deals with combat, and it pulls no punches in its treatment. Reviewers, critics and scholars have lauded it for its realism. Some, myself included, would place the novel in the domain of literary naturalism because the destinies of Jones's soldiers are determined by chance and by social, economic, psychological, and political forces beyond their control and, sometimes, even beyond their recognition".&lt;ref&gt;http://christle.freeshell.org/essays/ttrl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian and military writer [[John Keegan]] nominated ''The Thin Red Line'' as, in his opinion, one of only two novels portraying Second World War combat that could be favorably compared to the best of the literature to arise from the First World War (the other was ''Flesh Wounds'' (1966) by British writer [[David Holbrook]]).&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. ''[[The Face of Battle]]''. Barrie &amp; Jenkins Ltd 1988. p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Fussell]] said that it was "perhaps the best" American WWII novel, better than ''[[A Walk in the Sun (novel)|A Walk in the Sun]]'' and ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="fussell1989"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War |last=Fussell |first=Paul |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-19-503797-9 |pages=290 |lccn=89002875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film versions==
The novel has been adapted for cinema twice, first by [[Andrew Marton]] in [[The Thin Red Line (1964 film)|1964]], then by [[Terrence Malick]] in [[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|1998]].

He also won the [[King of the Ring#1989|1989 King of the Ring]] tournament, and wrestled at all of the first nine [[WrestleMania]] events, as well as helping bridge the gap between the 1980s "[[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n Wrestling Connection]]" era to the 1990s "[[WWE|New Generation]]" era.

Santana was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]]. During his time in the WWF, Santana, despite being born and raised in [[Texas]], was billed from "Tocula, Mexico", which may be a misspelled reference to the city of [[Toluca]]. Santana still appears on the [[independent circuit]].

== Collegiate and professional football career ==
Solis attended [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas State University]], where he was a member of the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. Solis played tight end for the [[West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes football|West Texas State Buffaloes]]. The team was quarterbacked by future professional wrestler [[Tully Blanchard]], who would introduce Solis to the world of professional wrestling.

After graduating, Solis was signed by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] but cut during training camp. He played a single season for the [[BC Lions]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], appearing in 13 regular season games.&lt;ref name=tales&gt;{{cite book|title=Tito Santana's Tales From the Ring|last= Santana|first=Tito|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59670-325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1977–1979) ===
Solis was trained to wrestle by [[Yasuhiro Kojima]] ([[Hiro Matsuda]]) and [[Bob Orton]]. He debuted in 1977, working for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]. Later that year, he joined [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW), where he wrestled until 1978.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980) ===
Santana joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] defeating Mike Hall in his debut match on Championship Wrestling in 1979. He teamed with [[Ivan Putski]] to defeat [[John L. Sullivan (wrestler)|Johnny Valiant]] and [[John Hill (wrestler)|Jerry Valiant]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in October 1979. The duo held the titles for close to six months before losing to the [[Wild Samoans]] in April 1980. Santana left the promotion later that year.

=== American Wrestling Association (1980–1982) ===
Santana wrestled in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) from 1980 to 1982. Matches he had in the AWA include two matches he had against [[Nick Bockwinkel]] in  [[St Paul, Minnesota]], on March 1, 1981, and in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], on May 13, 1982 (Bockwinkel won both matches by cheating). Santana also wrestled Blackie Guzman, and teamed with future tag team partner [[Rick Martel]] against the High Flyers on Aug 29, 1982, in St Paul Minnesota. Santana and Martel lost the match.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube videos posted, June 2, 2013, December 31, 2013, November 7, 2015, May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWF===
==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1982–1987) ====
Santana returned to the WWF in 1982. He made his televised return on the May 14, 1983 episode of ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'' by defeating [[José Estrada, Sr.|José Estrada]].

In 1983, he engaged in a lengthy [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with then [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]], [[Don Muraco|The Magnificent Muraco]]. Santana finally won the title on February 11, 1984, becoming the first Mexican-American wrestler to win the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. Shortly before winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Santana fought [[The Iron Sheik]] to a double-disqualification for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]]. After successfully defending the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against Muraco, Santana would be targeted by [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]], and in September 1984 in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, Valentine defeated Santana to win the title. Soon after, the storyline had Valentine injuring Santana's knee and putting Santana out of action for several months.

Santana returned in December 1984 and set his sights on getting the Intercontinental title back from Valentine. During this time, he started using The Hammer's finishing hold, the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure-four leglock]] and also wrestled in tag-team competition with [[Blackjack Mulligan]]. Santana wrestled at the first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in March 1985, and in the opening match defeated a masked wrestler known as [[Buddy Rose|The Executioner]] ("Playboy" Buddy Rose), making him submit to the figure four in 4:05. Santana made an appearance in the ring later in the card during the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between Valentine and Santana's friend the [[Junkyard Dog]]. Wearing street clothes, Santana rushed to the ring to inform referee Dick Kroll that Valentine had used his feet on the ropes to help pin the JYD. Despite having already called for the bell, Kroll restarted the match and an incensed Valentine was counted out as he didn't get back into the ring to continue.

Santana and Valentine went on to wrestle a memorable series of singles and tag team matches with neither gaining the upper hand. They wrestled in a variety of different types of matches such as regular title matches, [[Professional wrestling match types#No disqualification match|no disqualification matches]], and [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|Lumberjack matches]]. The pair also faced off in tag team competition with Santana teaming with the Junkyard Dog and Valentine teaming with [[Brutus Beefcake]] in a team that would become known as [[The Dream Team (professional wrestling)|The Dream Team]].

Santana recaptured the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship from Valentine in a brutal steel cage match in [[Baltimore]] on July 6, 1985. After the match, Valentine, incensed over losing the belt, destroyed it by repeatedly bashing it against the steel cage, forcing the WWF to get a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt. In reality however, the WWF had made a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt to go along with the new image they were trying to promote and smashing the old championship belt was seen as a way of moving forward with Santana having the honor of being the first to wear the new title belt. Santana would hold on to the title until February 8, 1986 when he lost it to [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] at the [[Boston Garden]], after Savage knocked him out with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign object]] he had hidden in his tights that went unnoticed by referee [[Dangerous Danny Davis|Danny Davis]].

On Right After Wrestling, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jim Korderas|Jimmy Korderas]], Tito stated that he was somewhat disappointed with being in the first match at the original WrestleMania in 1985.&lt;ref name="radio.thescore.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/tito-santana-interview-mar-14-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713003211/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/tito-santana-interview-mar-14-2011 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that [[Vince McMahon]] later told Santana that his reason for putting him in the opening match was to kick the show off with a quality match, something he knew Tito, as a solid fan-favourite and former Intercontinental Champion, would produce.

Although Santana lost the Intercontinental title before the WWF's storyline that Danny Davis was a corrupt official who clearly favoured the heels, the WWF used Santana losing the belt because of Davis' bias to include him in a six-man tag team match at [[WrestleMania III]] on March 29, 1987 where he teamed with [[The British Bulldogs]] ([[Dynamite Kid]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]]) against the  [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart|Bret "Hitman" Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart|Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart]]) and their 'new' partner, former referee "Dangerous" Danny Davis (who had previously wrestled for the WWF as a masked jobber named "Mr. X"). Davis had also been the assigned referee when the Harts 'stole' the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Bulldogs in January 1987, allowing the Harts to double team Davey Boy throughout the entire match after their manager [[Jimmy Hart|"The Mouth of the South" Jimmy Hart]] had knocked Dynamite out with his megaphone. The story for WrestleMania III being that the Bulldogs and Santana wanted revenge on Davis as the one responsible for losing their respective titles. The Harts and Davis won the match when Davis used Jimmy Hart's megaphone to 'knock out' and pin Davey Boy Smith.

Santana would make a second appearance during Wrestlemania III when he later came to the ring and attacked manager [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] after his man [[Butch Reed|"The Natural" Butch Reed]] had defeated [[Koko B. Ware]]. Santana, in response to previous attacks by Slick, tore the clothing from Slick who managed to scamper back to the locker room with his 'threads' in tatters. Following this, Reed entered the ring to fight off Santana but was sent from the ring by a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Double dropkick|Double dropkick]] from Santana and Koko.

==== Strike Force (1987–1989) ====
{{Main|Strike Force (professional wrestling)|l1=Strike Force}}
[[File:Tito Santana in the late '80s.jpg|thumb|Santana making his way to the ring in the late 1980s]]
Santana formed the popular tag team [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]] with Canadian [[Rick Martel]] in August 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/superstars87.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They defeated The Hart Foundation  for the WWF Tag Team championship on a televised edition of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' when Martel made Jim Neidhart submit to a [[Boston crab]]. Strike Force held them for five months before losing to [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] at [[Wrestlemania IV]]. Due to a neck injury inflicted on Martel ([[kayfabe]]) shortly after the loss, the team was inactive for several months (in reality, Martel was granted leave to tend to his wife who was seriously ill). Immediately after the injury, Santana introduced a new tag team to the WWF, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]), two big, muscled up power wrestlers whom he briefly managed. The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. The Powers would later find more permanent management with [[Baron von Raschke|The Baron]] before finally turning heel at the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 Survivor Series]] by stealing away Demolition's manager [[Mr. Fuji]], leaving the champions as [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]].

Martel returned at the [[Royal Rumble]] in [[Royal Rumble (1989)|1989]] and reunited with Santana. However, in their [[WrestleMania V]] match against [[The Brain Busters]] ([[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]]), Martel [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Santana during the match after accidentally being hit by Santana's [[Professional wrestling attacks#Flying forearm smash|Flying forearm smash]]. Martel refused to tag in and walked back to the dressing room leaving Santana to face both opponents alone (the Busters then easily defeated Tito with a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|Spike piledriver]]). In an interview with [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]] immediately following the match, Martel called Santana a loser and said he was sick and tired of carrying him. His feud with the newly [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Martel would last throughout 1989, with both men on opposing teams at both [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]] and [[Survivor Series (1989)|Survivor Series]] and Santana defeating Martel in the finals of the [[King of the Ring#1989|1989]] [[King of the Ring]] tournament. Tito even allied with his former archenemies Demolition against Martel, defeating him and [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]] in a six-man tag match on June 22, 1989 in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm WWF Results: 1989 - WWF @ Hartford, CT - Civic Center - June 22, 1989 WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (sub. for Shawn Michaels &amp; Marty Jannetty) &amp; Tito Santana defeated Rick Martel, Jacques, &amp; Raymond Rougeau&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Various storylines (1990–1991) ====
After [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]] won the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania VI]] and vacated the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Santana took part in an eight-man tournament to name a new Intercontinental Champion. Santana made it to the finals, where he lost to [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]]. Following that loss, Santana occasionally teamed with Koko B. Ware.

At the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], he teamed with [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[The Bushwhackers]] ([[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke]] and [[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch]]). He was the winner and sole survivor in the elimination-style match against [[Sgt. Slaughter]], [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]], and [[The Orient Express]] ([[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Sato]] and [[Pat Tanaka|Tanaka]]). As a result, Santana advanced to the final elimination match, teaming with Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior against Martel, [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]], The Warlord, and [[Power and Glory]] ([[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] and [[Paul Roma]]). Santana would eliminate The Warlord with his Flying forearm before being pinned by DiBiase. Santana would then wrestle at [[WrestleMania VII]], losing to [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] in a little over a minute after being hit in the stomach by The Mountie's electrified [[cattle prod]].

While taking a short hiatus from the World Wrestling Federation, he wrestled in [[International World Class Championship Wrestling]] (IWCCW) briefly where he held a feud with [[Tony Atlas]]. On an IWCCW card in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], Atlas defeated [[Dusty Wolfe]]. After the bout, he openly challenged any of his fellow wrestlers to try to beat him. Tito Santana immediately responded, charging out and dropkicking Atlas out of the ring. Following the event, Santana and Atlas scheduled a match for June 15 in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in [[The Bahamas]] for the IWCCW title, where Santana sought to avenge his former tag team partner [[Ivan Putski|"Polish Power" Ivan Putski]], whom Atlas had hung over the ropes previously. Santana had the upper hand in the bout until Atlas' manager [[Tony Rumble]] interfered by distracting and enraging Santana by repeatedly putting Atlas' foot on the rope. Santana then went after Rumble, pulled him onto the ring apron, and knocked him onto the floor. Tony Atlas took the opportunity to blindside Santana with a pair of brass knuckles from behind. The referee saw this illegal attack, and disqualified Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Wrestling, October 1991 article "Tito Santana's violent vendetta against Tony Atlas", and Pro Wrestling Illustrated 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== El Matador (1991–1993) ====
Later in 1991, Santana adopted a Spanish [[Torero|bullfighter]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] and the nickname "El Matador". His first WrestleMania match under this gimmick is when he faced and lost to [[Shawn Michaels]] in the opening bout of [[WrestleMania VIII]] at the [[Hoosier Dome]] in [[Indianapolis]]. Santana claims that at the time he was being considered for a run with the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], but says that the spot was given to Bret Hart;&lt;ref name=tales/&gt; the WWF was considering expanding into [[Central America]] and [[South America]] and felt that having Santana, its most high-profile Latino wrestler, as champion would aid its cause. The plan was eventually scrapped and the decision was made to expand into Canada and Europe, thus making the Canadian-born Hart a more viable option as champion. In any case, Santana wrestled under the "El Matador" gimmick through 1993, mostly as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber to the stars]]. This included a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] loss to [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Papa Shango]] at [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]] which was held at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]], [[England]]. In his final appearance on WWF TV, Santana defeated friend and frequent tag team partner [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] on a 1993 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge|Wrestling Challenge]]''. As a sign of mutual respect between the two, both men embraced after the match.

Santana then was never mentioned or seen again on WWF TV again, but he continued working on the WWF Summer tour in [[Europe]] and the international house show circuit through the course of August–September. Santana, along with only Hulk Hogan, holds the unique distinction of appearing in the first nine WrestleMania's, accumulating a 2-7 record during that time. Officially he is recognized only for the first eight WrestleManias matches. In his final in-ring WrestleMania appearance, he defeated Papa Shango at [[WrestleMania IX]] in the untelevised opening match called another dark match. Because of this he is later recognized as having a 1–7 record. On Right After Wrestling, hosted by [[Arda Ocal]] and [[Jim Korderas|Jimmy Korderas]], Tito stated that he was somewhat disappointed with being in the first match at the original WrestleMania in 1985.&lt;ref name="radio.thescore.com"/&gt; He also said that WWF owner Vince McMahon later told Santana that his reason for putting him in the opening match was to kick the show off with a quality match, something he knew Tito, as a solid fan-favorite and former Intercontinental Champion, would produce. Unfortunately for Santana, despite regaining the IC title from Greg Valentine later in 1985, and two years later winning the Tag Team title with Rick Martel as part of Strike Force, he would never again win a televised match at a WrestleMania event. Santana continued to wrestle through the first half of 1993 following [[WrestleMania IX]], facing [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bryan Clark|Adam Bomb]], and Papa Shango. His final match was on August 13, 1993 in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]], when he defeated [[Damian Demento]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993)===
Santana played a role in the formative years of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. Then known as Eastern Championship Wrestling, he won the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Heavyweight Championship]] on August 8, 1993 by defeating former WWF rival Don Muraco but forfeited the championship later that year to [[Shane Douglas]].

=== Return to IWCCW (1994–1995)===
After leaving ECW, Santana returned to IWCCW where he wrestled some of his old WWF rivals such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]], [[Rick Martel]], and [[Greg Valentine]]. During his second stint, he won the vacant [[IWCCW Heavyweight Championship]] (a title which had been vacated by [[Tony Atlas]] a man Santana first feuded with during his first stint in IWCCW back in 1991, Tony Atlas had left IWCCW for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) back in 1992) with a tournament victory over Greg Valentine who later claimed the title in a rematch. In IWCCW Santana resumed his feuds from the WWF with Rick Martel and Greg Valentine, and again wrestled Tony Atlas, who defeated him in a match in [[Yardville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=93&amp;page=4&amp;s=100|title=Matches « Tito Santana « Wrestlers Database « CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cagematch.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santana also feuded with [[Manny Fernandez (wrestler)|Manny Fernandez]], as Fernandez had attacked Santana after Santana had defeated L.A.

=== American Wrestling Federation (1994–1996) ===
During 1994 and 1996 Santana wrestled in the short-lived [[American Wrestling Federation]] (AWF). He was both the first and last AWF Heavyweight Champion, defeating [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] in a tournament final for the inaugural belt in November 1994, and losing and regaining the title from Orton on the same night in October 1996. Santana was slightly considered the top [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] of the company, and its major champion along with Orton (who was the top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]])

'''Transphobia''' is a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions toward [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] people, or toward [[transsexuality]]. Transphobia can be emotional disgust, fear, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards people who do not conform to society's [[gender]] expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crime: Impact, Causes and Responses|last = Chakraborti |first = Neil |last2 = Garland |first2 = Jon |publisher = SAGE Publications, Ltd.|year = 2009|isbn = 1412945682|location = |pages = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology, Volume 2|last = Chrisler |first = Donald R. |last2 = McCreary |first2 = Joan C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2010|isbn = 1441913556|location = |pages = 366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often expressed alongside [[Homophobia|homophobic]] views and hence is often considered an aspect of homophobia.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maurianne Adams |author2=Lee Anne Bell |author3=Pat Griffin |title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|isbn =1135928509|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2007|pages=198–199|accessdate=December 27, 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgGUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198|quote=Because of the complicated interplay among gender identity, gender roles, and sexual identity, transgender people are often assumed to be lesbian or gay (See ''Overview: Sexism, Heterosexism, and Transgender Oppression''). ...

[[Transgender youth|Child victims]] of transphobia experience [[Sexual harassment|harassment]], [[school bullying]], and violence in [[School violence|school]], [[foster care]], and [[Welfare|social programs]]. Adult victims experience [[Ridicule|public ridicule]], harassment including misgendering, [[Taunting|taunts]], [[Assault (tort)|threats of violence]], robbery, and [[false arrest]]; many feel unsafe in public. A high percentage report being victims of [[sexual violence]]. Some are [[Transgender rights in the United States#Healthcare|refused healthcare]] or suffer [[Transgender rights in the United States#Discrimination|workplace discrimination]], including being fired for being transgender, or feel under siege by [[Conservatism|conservative]] political or religious groups who [[LGBT rights opposition|oppose]] laws to protect them. There is even discrimination from some people within the [[LGBT social movements|movement for the rights of gender and sexual minorities]].

Besides the increased risk of violence and other threats, the [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] created by transphobia can cause negative emotional consequences which may lead to [[substance abuse]], [[Runaway (dependent)|running away from home]] (in minors), and a higher rate of suicide.

In the [[Western world]], there have been gradual changes towards the establishment of policies of non-discrimination and equal opportunity. The trend is also taking shape in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. In addition, campaigns regarding the LGBT community are being spread around the world to improve acceptance; the "Stop the Stigma" campaign by the UN is one such development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Discrimination/LGBT_discrimination.pdf|title=Tackling Discrimination on Grounds of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and use==
The word ''transphobia'' is a [[classical compound]] patterned on the term ''[[homophobia]]'', sharing its second component ''-phobia'' from the {{lang-el|φόβος}}, ''phóbos'', "fear".  The first component is the [[English prefixes#Neo-classical|neo-classical prefix]] ''trans-'' from ''transgender'' (originally meaning "across, on the far side, beyond"). Along with ''[[lesbophobia]]'', ''[[biphobia]]'', ''homophobia'' and ''transphobia'' are members of the family of terms used when [[Bigotry|intolerance]] and discrimination is directed toward [[LGBT]] people.

''Transphobia'' need not be a [[phobia]] as defined in [[clinical psychology]] (i.e., an [[anxiety disorder]]). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of ''[[xenophobia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing|last = Shelley |first = Christopher A.|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780802097842|location =Toronto |pages = 32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adjective|adjectival]] form ''transphobic'' describes things or qualities related to transphobia, and the noun ''transphobe'' denotes someone who harbors transphobia.

The words ''transphobia'' and ''transphobic'' were added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2013, together with ''transperson'', ''transman'', ''transwoman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/june-2013-update/new-words-list-june-2013/|title=New words list June 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=public.oed.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Transfeminism|Transfeminist]] theorist and author [[Julia Serano]] argues in her book ''[[Whipping Girl]]'' that transphobia is rooted in [[sexism]], and locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls "oppositional sexism", the belief that male and female are "rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with "traditional sexism", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.&lt;ref name=serano&gt;Julia Serano. ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity'', Seal Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-58005-154-5}}, {{ISBN|1-58005-154-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia, and especially of the forms that incite violence towards transsexual people, is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain's protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C. W. Chan Routledge, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sexuality and Equality Law; Suzanne B. Goldberg 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|this whole paragraph is hard to follow. "safety system in the brain" needs elaboration!|date=December 2017}}

The transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and [[misogyny]]. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining [[Gender role|gender norms]] and the [[gender binary]]. Norton writes that the "male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Jody|title="Brain Says You're a Girl, But I Think You're a Sissy Boy": Cultural Origins of Transphobia|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|year=1997|volume=2, Number 2|pages=139–164|doi=10.1023/A:1026320611878|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|cissexism|cisgenderism|cisnormativity}}Related concepts==
The related concept of '''[[cissexism]]''' (also termed '''cisgenderism''', '''cisnormativity''' or '''cissexual assumption''', occasionally used synonymously with '''transphobia''') is the appeal to norms that enforce the [[gender binary]] and gender essentialism, resulting in the oppression of [[gender variant]], [[non-binary gender|non-binary]], and transgender [[gender identity|identities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/everyday-cissexism/|title=3 Examples of Everyday Cissexism|author=Sian Ferguson|work=Everyday Feminism|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cisgenderism refers to the assumption that, due to human [[sexual differentiation]], one's [[gender]] is determined solely by a [[biological sex]] of male or female (based on the assumption that all people must have either an [[XY sex-determination system|XX or XY]] sex-[[chromosome]] pair, or, in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to [[cisgender]] people due to being in "defiance of nature".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Lennon|first= Erica|last2= Mistler|first2= Brian|date= 2014|title= Cisgenderism |journal=[[TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly]] |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=1-2 |pages=63–64 |doi= 10.1215/23289252-2399623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harassment and violence directed against transgender people is often called [[trans bashing]], and can be physical, sexual or verbal. Whereas [[gay bashing]] is directed against a target's real or perceived [[sexual orientation]], trans bashing is directed against the target's real or perceived expressed [[gender identity]]. The term has also been applied to [[hate speech]] directed at transgender people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2007/4-27/view/columns/10484.cfm Demagogues of defamation Gay: Where is the outrage when cable TV’s talking heads trash trans people?]&lt;/ref&gt; and to depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative [[stereotype]]s about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=McNamara|title=Transgender Artists, Work Gaining Acceptance|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable victims of violent crimes motivated by transphobia include [[Brandon Teena]], [[Gwen Araujo]], [[Angie Zapata]], [[Nizah Morris]], and [[Lauren Harries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4218250.stm |title=Transsexual to move to 'safer' LA |publisher=BBC News |date=6 September 2005}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: When the article Transprejudice was merged into this article, consensus was reached ([[Talk:Transphobia/Archive_2#Merge_proposal]]) that that term must remain in this article. Thus, please do not remove references to the term "transprejudice" from this article without discussing it first. --&gt;
''Transprejudice'' is a term similar to transphobia, and refers to the negative valuing, stereotyping, and discriminatory treatment of individuals whose appearance and/or identity does not conform to current social expectations or conventional conceptions of gender.&lt;ref&gt;King, M., Webster, B., &amp; Winter, S.

==Manifestations==

===Harassment and violence===
{{see also|Violence against LGBT people}}

As homophobia and transphobia are correlated, many trans people experience homophobia and [[heterosexism]]; this is due to people who associate trans people's gender identity with [[homosexuality]], or because trans people may also have a [[sexual orientation]] that is [[non-heterosexual]].&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spijkerboer"/&gt; Author Thomas Spijkerboe stated, "Transgender people subjected to violence, in a range of cultural contexts, frequently report that transphobic violence is expressed in homophobic terms."&lt;ref name="Spijkerboer"/&gt; Attacking someone on the basis of a perception of their gender identity rather than a perception of their sexual orientation is known as "[[trans bashing]]", analogous to "[[gay bashing]]".

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], transgender children are more likely than other children to experience harassment and violence in school, foster care, residential treatment centers, homeless centers and juvenile justice programs.&lt;ref name="Cisgenderism"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cisgenderism in psychology: pathologising and misgendering children from 1999 to 2008|year = 2011|url = http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/72252/2/YGA%20%26%20PH%202011%20Cisgenderism.pdf|last = Ansara and Peter Hegarty|first = Y.

Three-quarters report having felt unsafe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As adults, transgender people are frequently subjected to ridicule, stares, taunting and threats of violence, even when just walking down the street or walking into a store.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men|last = Girshick|first = Lori B.|publisher = University Press of New England|year = 2008|isbn = 158465838X|location = Hanover and London|pages = 133–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. survey of 402 older, employed, high-income transgender people found that 60% reported violence or harassment because of their gender identity. 56% had been harassed or verbally abused, 30% had been assaulted, 17% had had objects thrown at them, 14% had been robbed and 8% had experienced what they characterized as an unjustified arrest.&lt;ref name="Lives"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lives of Transgender People|last = Beemyn|first = Genny|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 0231143079|location = New York|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 81 transgender people in [[Philadelphia]] found 30% reported feeling unsafe in public because they were transgender, with 19% feeling uncomfortable for the same reason.

A review of American studies on sexual violence towards transgender people found that it is "shockingly common" and while reported rates vary considerably among studies for methodological and other reasons the most common finding is that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="Stotzer-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stotzer |first=Rebecca |title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |year=2009 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=170–179 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178909000202  |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006 }},  (full text: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222055542 &amp;#91;pdf&amp;#93;])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual violence====
In 2009 researcher Rebecca L. Stotzer published an article in ''[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]'' that compiled information from numerous studies reporting violence against transgender people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stotzer|first=Rebecca L.|title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359178909000202|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=170–179|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article Stotzer noted that transgender people have a high risk of experiencing sexual violence throughout their lifetimes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Transgender people are often excluded from entitlements or privileges reserved for people whose gender identity they share, but whose assigned gender they do not. It is very common, for example, for transgender women to be stopped or questioned when they use public bathrooms designated for women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons have denied trans women admission to women's areas and forced them to sleep and bathe in the presence of men.&lt;ref name="transparent"&gt;{{cite book |last= Beam|first= Cris |title= Transparent |publisher= Harvest Books |date=January 2008|isbn= 978-0-15-603377-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transgender people may also be denied service in restaurants; for example members of the [[Transgender Education Network of Texas]] and the [[Transgender Law Center]] were "denied service" at the Elliston Place IHOP in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on May 21, 2018, leading to staff retraining.&lt;ref name="outandabouttransdiscrimination"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chase |first1=Julie |title=Trans discrimination at Elliston Place IHOP leads to swift action, retraining |url=https://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/trans-discrimination-elliston-place-ihop#.Wxy6qlZKjBI |accessdate=June 10, 2018 |work=Out &amp; About |date=May 25, 2018|quote=The full staff of the International House of Pancakes restaurant at Elliston Place off of West End Avenue will be retrained in customer service expectations as a result of an incident involving a visiting group of transgender people on Monday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As users of healthcare===
{{See also|Healthcare and the LGBT community}}
A study of 81 transgender people in [[Philadelphia]] found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered yes when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, "being transgendered created a problem" for them.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Transgender people depend largely on the medical profession to receive not only [[Hormone replacement therapy (trans)|hormone replacement therapy]], but also vital care. In one case, [[Robert Eads]] died of ovarian cancer after being refused treatment by more than two dozen doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftminfo.net/sundance.html |title=FTM Informational Network |accessdate=2009-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509154651/http://www.ftminfo.net/sundance.html |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States–based National Center For Transgender Equality's 2011 survey, 19% had been [[Omission (criminal law)#Failure to provide medical treatment|refused medical care]] due to their transgender or gender non-conforming status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Injustice at Every Turn A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey |url=http://transequality.org/PDFs/Executive_Summary.pdf |publisher=transequality.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112122305/http://transequality.org/PDFs/Executive_Summary.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that refusal of treatment due to transphobia is not uncommon.
Another example of this is the case of [[Tyra Hunter]]. Hunter was involved in an automobile accident, and when [[Emergency medical services|rescue workers]] discovered she was transgender, they backed away and stopped administering treatment. She later died in a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glaa.org/archive/1998/margiehunter1211.shtml|title=Victory in Tyra Hunter case&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===
Transphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their [[employment|jobs]] when they begin to transition.

News stories from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Associated Press]] cite a 1999 study by the [[San Francisco Department of Public Health]] finding a 70% unemployment rate amongst the city's transgender population. On February 18, 1999, the San Francisco Department of Public Health issued the results of a 1997 survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men, which found that 40% of those trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months. For trans men, the equivalent statistic was 81%. The survey also found that 46% of trans women and 57% of trans men reported [[employment discrimination]].&lt;ref name="transhealth"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Transgender Community Health Project |title=Sociodemographics |work=Descriptive Results |publisher=HIVInSite |date=18 February 1999 |url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=cftg-02-02#S5.1X |accessdate=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 American study found that among educators, trans educators are 10-20% more likely to experience workplace harassment than their gay and lesbian colleagues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers finding other ostensible reasons not to hire a candidate or just not informing prospective employees at all as to why they are not being hired. Additionally, when an employer fires or otherwise discriminates against a transgender employee, it may be a "mixed motive" case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing, [[job performance]] issues or the like (such as excessive tardiness, for example) while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sears|first=Brad|last2=Mallory|first2=Christy|date=2011-07-01|title=Documented Evidence of Employment Discrimination &amp; Its Effects on LGBT People|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/03m1g5sg|journal=The Williams Institute, UCLA|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=eScholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Workplace discrimination|Employment discrimination]] on the basis of gender identity and expression is [[Legal aspects of transsexualism in the United States#Discrimination|illegal in some U.S. cities, towns and states]]. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as ''Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co.'' and ''Jette vs. Honey Farms''.) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom has also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections.&lt;ref name="TransEmploy2"&gt;{{cite web|author=barbara findlay, Q.C. |title=Transgendered people and Employment: An equality analysis |publisher=Barbara Findlay Law Office |date=June 1999 |url=http://www.barbarafindlay.com/articles/43.pdf |accessdate=10 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620100912/http://www.barbarafindlay.com/articles/43.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of a high-profile employment-related court case unfavorable to transgender people, in 2000 the southern U.S. grocery chain [[Winn-Dixie (supermarket)|Winn-Dixie]] fired long-time employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that the married, heterosexual truck driver occasionally [[crossdressing|cross-dressed]] off the job. Management argued that this hurt Winn-Dixie's corporate image. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit against Winn-Dixie on behalf of Oiler but a judge dismissed it.&lt;ref name="ACLUWinnDixie"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald L.

Sometimes transgender people facing employment discrimination turn to [[sex industry|sex work]] [[Forced prostitution#Voluntary vs involuntary prostitution|to survive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacques|first=Juliet|title='No wonder many transsexual people end up in sex work'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/25/transsexual-people-sex-work|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing them at additional risk of such things as encountering troubles with the law, including arrest and criminal prosecution; enduring workplace violence; and possibly contracting [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="transhealth" /&gt;

The transgender community faces huge amount of employment discrimination due to their gender identity, and there are very few laws that protect the employment rights of this community. It results in limited career options for the transgender community leaving them economically vulnerable. A study conducted by Anneliese Singh and Vel McKleroy on transgender people of color revealed that difficulty finding a job or losing a job due to transphobia in workplace resulted in some of the transgender people living in crime-ridden neighborhoods, and getting involved in abusive relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Anneliese A|last2=McKleroy|first2=Vel S|date=2011|title="Just Getting Out of Bed Is a Revolutionary Act" The Resilience of Transgender People of Color Who Have Survived Traumatic Life Events.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1534765610369261|journal=Traumatology|volume=17.2|pages=34–44|via=Sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1534765610369261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of employment has also resulted in the transgender community resorting to illegal activities like selling drugs or sex work for the income support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20416495|last=Bith-Melander|first=Pollie|date=2010|title=Understanding sociocultural and psychological factors affecting transgender people of color in San Francisco|journal=Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care|volume=21.3|pages=207–220|via=Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.jana.2010.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From government===
{{See also|Transgender disenfranchisement in the United States}}

Transgender people also face the denial of [[right of asylum]] or inhuman treatment in process of asylum-seeking. For example, Fernada Milan, a transgender woman from [[Guatemala]] was placed in an asylum center for males in [[Denmark]] and while there, was raped by several men. She was in danger of deportation into Guatemala where transgender people have no rights and face possible execution, but has since been granted entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncommon-scents.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/what-im-most-afraid-of-when-i-go-back.html|title=UnCommon Sense|author=Natacha|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender disenfranchisement is the practice of creating or upholding barriers that keep transgender individuals from [[voting]] and therefore restrict the principles of [[universal suffrage]].

===In education===
Within the school system, many transgender teens are harassed and mistreated with reported negative effects on both victim and the school's population in general.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transgender Bullying: A National Epidemic|url = http://nobullying.com/transgender-bullying/|website = nobullying.com|access-date = 2016-02-22|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Transgender youth frequently report fear and anxiety about using restrooms and locker rooms at school because they had experienced harassment by both peers and adults when using them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eusccr.com/10.%20national%20center%20for%20transgender%20equality.pdf |title=Peer Violence and Bullying Against Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Youth |date=May 2011 |access-date=30 December 2016 |website=National Center for Transgender Equality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005200553/http://www.eusccr.com/10.%20national%20center%20for%20transgender%20equality.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80% of transgender teens report feeling unsafe in a school environment, more than 40% report having been physically abused, and over 65% report being bullied online or via social media.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Through official channels, such discrimination is generally underreported.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Most of the administrators and educators are unaware about the extent of damage that has been caused to the transgender students on account of underestimating the gravity of transphobia in their schools.

===From the religious right===

====Christianity====
{{Unreliable sources|section|date=January 2018}}
The [[Christian right]] in North America, including organizations such as the [[American Family Association]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] believe that transgenderism is unnatural and that transgender people are and remain their birth sex, and they oppose laws and policies intended to accommodate transgender people, such as allowing them to change their legal sex, use the washroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify, or become ordained Christian ministers. They say that God created people's bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and [[natural law]], and that the Bible refers to male and female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu9a.htm|title=Beliefs among religious conservatives about the causes &amp; cures of transsexuality (Cont'd)|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under [[Pope John Paul II]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu15.htm|title=Catholic beliefs about the causes &amp; cures of transsexuality|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity. One author says "expectations [based on gender] are usually predicated upon our genitalia and begin from the moment of birth, continuing throughout our lives."&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, V. 2001. Crossing over: Liberating the transgendered Christian, Cleveland, OH: The Pilgrim Press. [Google Scholar], p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian denominations use biblical notions of gender and gender roles to support their views. These include “So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27) and “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God” (Deuteronomy 22:5).&lt;ref name="Denise L 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Denise L.|title="Transgender, Transsexual, and Gender Queer Individuals with a Christian Upbringing: The Process of Resolving Conflict Between Gender Identity  and Faith."|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Spirituality in Social Work: Social Thought|date=15 Feb 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=60–83|doi=10.1080/15426432.2013.749079}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

Views of gender identity based on the Christian faith do not always coincide with the ideologies of transgender individuals. However, if they do not conform to these expectations, they may face rejection. Many transgender Christians seek out an “individualized relationship with God”, often facing “a period of denial and struggle” as well as depression, disconnection, dissatisfaction, and spiritual difficulty before “discovering a sense of self that feels integral and true”&lt;ref&gt;Tanis, J. 2003. Trans-gendered: Theology, ministry, and communities of faith, Cleveland, OH: The Pilgrim Press.  [Google Scholar], p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after discovering their gender identity, many transgender individuals still face barriers within the church such as, “fear and unfamiliarity on the part of the congregation, language issues, physical layout that separates people by gender, programs that exclude or separate by gender, pathologizing or designating trans issues as sinful, and overt hostility”&lt;ref&gt;Tanis, J. 2003. Trans-gendered: Theology, ministry, and communities of faith, Cleveland, OH: The Pilgrim Press.  [Google Scholar], p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denise L 2013"/&gt;

====Islam====

The Islamic faith ordinarily supports a heteronormative binary of gender identification which is reinforced by their cultural norms and traditional readings of sacred texts which prohibit the wide range of identities that are present in today's society. Transgender men and women are acknowledged and accepted in many Islamic cultures around the world. In actuality, the idea of a man or woman identifying as a member of the opposite gender is more likely to be approved than that of a man or woman expressing sexual desire for someone of their own gender. 

In 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt's Al-Azhar, the world's oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see [[transsexuality in Iran]]). The foundation for this accepting attitude is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual, thus making homosexuality a sin. Nonetheless, transgender individuals within the Muslim community still face particular challenges. 

Some communities of worship are more tolerant—[[Muslims for Progressive Values]] has founded Unity Mosques in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California. The [[Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity]] hosts an annual retreat for LGBTQ+ Muslims in Pennsylvania each May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-islam|title=Stances of Faiths on LGBTQ Issues: Islam - Sunni and Shi'a|website=Human Rights Campaign|publisher=Human Rights Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In feminism===
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

Some positions within feminism have been considered transphobic.  This may include criticism of [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] or [[sex reassignment surgery]] as a personal choice or medical invention, or the position that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be in women-only spaces.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;

[[Second-wave feminist]] and activist [[Gloria Steinem]] expressed concerns in 1977 about transsexuality and [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS), writing that in many cases, transsexuals "surgically mutilate their own bodies."&lt;ref name="Steinem-OutrageousActs"/&gt;{{rp|227}} She concluded that "feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism."&lt;ref name="Steinem-OutrageousActs"/&gt;{{rp|228}}  For some years, this led to Steinem being characterized as transphobic.&lt;ref name="bm-trans-exclusion-steinem"/&gt;  In 2013, she repudiated the interpretation of her text as an altogether condemnation of SRS, stating that her position was informed by accounts of gay men choosing to transition as a way of coping with societal [[homophobia]].  She added that she sees transgender people as living "authentic lives" that should be "celebrated."&lt;ref name="advocate-steinem-oped"/&gt;

Radical feminist [[Janice Raymond]]'s 1979 book, ''The Transsexual Empire'', was and still is controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;  In the book Raymond says, "All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive."&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; Raymond authored a paper in the 1980s which the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] allegedly used to deny trans people access to transgender-specific healthcare.&lt;ref name="hp-what-is-terf"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=opinion piece by a blogger; ok for opinions but not for justifying facts per WP:NEWSBLOG|date=January 2018}}  Raymond repudiated this claim, pointing out that her submission was mentioned only in one sentence of a 15-page final report.&lt;ref name="raymond-fictions-and-facts"/&gt;

Another site of conflict between feminists and [[trans women]] has been the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]. In the early 1990s, the festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder.&lt;ref name="vangelder"/&gt; In 2014, the festival "passionately rejected" accusations that it believed transgender "womyn are 'less than' other womyn."&lt;ref name="michfest-vogel"/&gt; The activist group [[Camp Trans]] had protested the "womyn-born-womyn" intention and advocated for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. The festival had considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, however this was criticized as [[Class discrimination|classist]], as many trans women cannot afford sex reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="sreedhar-transforming-feminism"/&gt;

Trans women such as [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]] challenged the feminist conception of "biological woman". Stone worked as a sound engineer for [[Olivia Records]] from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased.&lt;ref name="Goldberg-Stone"/&gt; The debate continued in Raymond's book,&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; which devoted a chapter to criticism of "the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist." Groups like [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] then voted to exclude trans lesbians.&lt;ref name="ross1995"/&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] labeled transgenderism "deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights."&lt;ref name="jeffreys1997"/&gt;

In 2017, with regard to the question of whether trans women are women, [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]] expressed the view that "trans women are trans women", meaning that while she acknowledges them to face discrimination on the basis of being transgender and sees this as a serious issue, she thinks that their experiences should not be conflated with those of women who face oppression on the basis of being born [[female]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/15/14910900/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-transgender-women-comments-apology |title=The controversy over Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and trans women, explained |author=Emily Crockett |publisher=Vox |date=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After sustaining severe criticism for her views, Adichie opined that the American [[Left-wing politics|Left]] is "creating its own decline" and is "very cannibalistic."  She explained that she sees trans women as women despite her views, but stood behind her position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-says-the-american-left-is-creating-its-own-decline_us_59db6dbae4b072637c454c4d |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Says The American Left ‘Is Creating Its Own Decline’ |author=Claire Fallon |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, cisgender feminist support came from the work of [[poststructuralist]] feminist and lesbian [[Judith Butler]], particularly her books ''Gender Trouble'' (1990) and ''Bodies That Matter'' (1993), which argue that the "violent inscription" of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those that violate such binaristic gender dichotomies.&lt;ref name="butler-1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="butler-1993"/&gt;

Radical feminists who hold negative views on transgender politics are commonly called "[[TERF]]s", short for "trans-exclusionary radical feminists".&lt;ref name="hp-what-is-terf"/&gt;  Those whom the term is targeted against, in turn, have perceived their labeling as "TERF" to be a [[pejorative|slur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2 | title=What Is a Woman? | publisher=The New Yorker | date=August 4, 2014 | author=Michelle Goldberg | quote=TERF stands for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.” The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.}}{{pb}}{{cite news | url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-long-history-of-transgender-exclusion-from-feminism | title=It's Time to End the Long History of Feminism Failing Transgender Women | work=[[Bitch Media]] | date=February 17, 2014 | accessdate=April 18, 2014 | author=Vasquez, Tina | quote=Drawing from that history, Brennan, fellow attorney Elizabeth Hungerford, and other modern-day feminists continue to actively question the inclusion of trans people in women’s spaces.

But note the end result of this: a feminist has withdrawn support for another feminist speaking against male violence, ''because a man told her to.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meghan Murphy, founder of Canadian feminist website Feminist Current, opined that "TERF" should be considered [[hate speech]] after a woman was physically assaulted and several people defended or celebrated the assault on the grounds that the woman was a "TERF" and as such deserving of violence.&lt;ref name="fc-terf-hate-speech"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/09/21/terf-isnt-slur-hate-speech/ | title=‘TERF’ isn’t just a slur, it’s hate speech | date=September 21, 2017 | author=Meghan Murphy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="speakers-corner"/&gt;

Authors and observers, such as transgender author Jillian Todd Weiss, have written that "there are social and political forces that have created a split between gay/lesbian communities and bisexual/transgender communities, and these forces have consequences for civil rights and community inclusion.

Historian [[Joanne Meyerowitz]] documented transphobia within the [[gay rights movement]] in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of [[Christine Jorgensen]]. Jorgensen, who made frequent [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1953, for example, ''ONE'' magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a "sweeping disservice" to gay men. "As far as the public knows," Winters wrote, "you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it." For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine," which, he said, "they are not." Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the "reasoning" that led "to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment – and worse." In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.&lt;ref name="mayerowitz2002"&gt;Meyerowitz, Joanne (2002).

Several prominent figures in [[second wave feminism]] have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' by [[Radical feminism|radical lesbian feminist]] [[Janice Raymond]], who popularized the term ''[[shemale]]'' as derogatory slur referring to [[trans women]] in 1994,&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; and her statements on transsexuality and transsexual people have been criticized by many in the [[LGBT]] and [[feminism|feminist]] communities as extremely [[transphobic]] and as constituting [[hate speech]].&lt;ref name="rose2004"&gt;Rose, Katrina C.

In 1950s America, there was a debate among gay men and women about those who felt they were of the opposite sex.  Gay men and women who were trying to melt quietly into the majority society criticized them as "freaks" who brought unwanted disreputable attention upon them.  Such attitudes were widespread at the time.&lt;ref name="GLBTphobia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=Jillian Todd |title=GL vs. BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |accessdate=7 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329150447/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |archivedate=2016-03-29 }}{{better source|date=April 2016|reason=professor cut/paste of a published journal paper is not the best source and may be copyvio }} quoting Kay Brown of Transhistory.net [defunct since 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[trans men]] face rejection from lesbian communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, "there are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease", stating that this was "shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world".&lt;ref name="rafkin"&gt;Rafkin, Louise (June 22, 2003) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/06/22/CM254728.DTL Straddling Sexes: Young lesbians transitioning into men are shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world.] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], the first time the '[[womyn-born womyn]] only' policy has been used against trans males, women supporting the transgender community and young gender-variant women.&lt;ref name="mantilla2000"&gt;Mantilla, Karla (October 1, 2000).

In the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, [[feminist]] and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer [[Beth Elliott]] became the focus of debate over whether to include transgender lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.&lt;ref name="rubin2003"&gt;Henry Rubin (2003).

====Bisexual communities and binarism====
One view is that the word ''bisexual'' is transphobic, as "bi" means "two" (thus implying a belief in the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Some people, such as scholar Shiri Eisner, say that some make the claim that the term "erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence",&lt;ref name=Eisner1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT27|date=2 July 2013|publisher=Seal Press, 2013|isbn=9781580054751|accessdate=28 December 2014|quote=Yet another way in which bisexuality has been recently imagined is as inherently binary, and therefore intrinsically transphobic. [...] As the argument classically goes, since the word bisexuality has bi (literally: two) in it, it inherently refers to a two-gender structure. This means it erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence.|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many dictionaries define bisexuality as "of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of either sex",&lt;ref name=Freedict1&gt;{{cite web|title=bisexual - definition of Bisexual by the Free Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bisexual|website=thefreedictionary.com|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "sexually attracted to both men and women"&lt;ref name=OxfordDicts&gt;{{cite web|title=bisexual: definition of bisexual in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English)|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bisexual|website=oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford Dictionaies|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other similar definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster - Biseual Define|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bisexual|website=merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=28 December 2014|quote=sexually attracted to both men and women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Search: Bisexual definition|url=https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?complete=0&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=EUGgVLC5G4nsUvyfgKAL#complete=0&amp;q=bisexual+define|website=google.co.uk|quote=sexually attracted to both men and women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some bisexual individuals and scholars object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since ''bisexual'' is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than one&lt;ref name="biresource.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=BRC Brochure 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Bisexual Resource Council/[[Bisexual Resource Center]] |work=biresource.net |accessdate=July 8, 2013 |url=http://www.biresource.net/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731101822/http://www.biresource.net/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |archivedate=July 31, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or more than two genders&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doesn't identifying as bisexual reinforce a false gender binary?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is occasionally defined as such.&lt;ref name="Eisner1"/&gt;  Others, such as the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]], say that the term "is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between bisexual and terms like pansexual, polysexual, omnisexual, ambisexual, and fluid?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|accessdate=May 27, 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/what-is-the-difference-between-bisexual-and-terms-like-pansexual-polysexual-omnisexual-ambisexual-and-fluid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the scientific classification ''bisexual'' only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt;

In order to deal with issues related to transphobia and the gender binary, many individuals have taken on terms such as ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'' (an alternative word for pansexual) or ''[[polysexual]]'' in place of the term ''bisexual''. The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that these terms "describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with these labels are also bisexual"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt; and that the notion that bisexuality is a reinforcement of a gender binary is a concept that is founded upon "anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world".&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt; Eisner agrees with this view, stating that "allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life" and that the allegations are an attempt to separate the bisexual and transgender communities politically.&lt;ref name="Eisner1"/&gt;

==Consequences==
Whether intentional or not, transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low [[self-esteem]], [[social alienation|alienation]] and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or [[Self-mutilation|self-harming]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Disparities in Psychiatric Care: Clinical and Cross-Cultural Perspectives|last = Ruiz MD|first = Pedro|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2009|isbn = 0781796393|location = |pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suicide rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Problems at home and at school===
The 2015 United States Transgender Survey, the largest such survey ever carried out (with 27,715 respondents), found that one in ten respondents suffered transphobic violence at the hands of a family member and 8% were kicked out of their homes for being transgender. The majority of those who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender at school were victims of some form of mistreatment on account of this, including verbal abuse (54%), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%). 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they had to leave school. Support from one's community or family was correlated with more positive outcomes related to mental health and social functioning.&lt;ref name="usts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF|title=Executive Summary|work=U.S. Transgender Survey|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality|location=Washington}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

62% of lawsuits involving transgender people state that defendants face family problems.&lt;ref name="Suicide"/&gt;{{clarify|in what country? what does "family problems" mean/entail?|date=December 2017}}

===Poverty and homelessness===
Nearly one third of U.S. transgender people responding to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey lived in poverty, compared to 14% of the population. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 30% of employed transgender people were either fired or mistreated for being transgender, from verbal abuse to sexual violence. 30% had been homeless at some point in their life, and 12% had been homeless during the previous year. Family and community support were correlated with significantly lower rates of homelessness and poverty.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

===Violence and harassment===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and 9% had been physically attacked for being transgender. 10% had been sexually assaulted during the previous year, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their life.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

====In public restrooms====
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 12% of respondents reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom. 1% reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender, and 1% reported being otherwise physically assaulted for being transgender. 9% reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

===Health===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 59% of respondents reported avoiding using a public restroom out of fear of violence or harassment. 32% limited the amount they ate or drink in order to avoid using a public restroom. 8% reported suffering a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or other kidney problem as a result of avoiding public restrooms.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

33% reported having negative experiences with a healthcare professional related to being transgender, such as verbal harassment or denial of treatment. 23% reported that they did not seek treatment for a condition out of fear of being mistreated, while 33% did not seek treatment because they were unable to afford it.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

During the month prior to the survey, 39% of American transgender people experienced major psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population of the United States. 40% had attempted suicide at some point in their life, compared to 4.6 percent of the American population. Family and community support were correlated with far lower rates of suicide attempts and of major psychological distress.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

A study conducted on transgender women of color in San Francisco has shown a higher correlation between transphobia and risk of transgender women engaging in HIV risk behavior. The study shows that the transgender youth face social discrimination, and they may not have a social role model. The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z|last=Sugano|first=Eiko|last2=Nemoto|first2=Tooru|last3=Operario|first3=Don|date=2006|title=The Impact of Exposure to Transphobia on HIV Risk Behavior in a Sample of Transgendered Women of Color in San Francisco|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=10.2|pages=217|via=Springer Link|doi=10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mental health====
People who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|date=|title=The Center for Collegiate Mental Health: Practice and research working together |journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=|pages=101–104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Effrig|first=Jessica C.|last2=Bieschke|first2=Kathleen J.|last3=Locke|first3=Benjamin D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Examining Victimization and Psychological Distress in Transgender College Students|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x/abstract|journal=Journal of College Counseling|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=143–157|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x|issn=2161-1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%. In India, 31% to 50% of transgender people have tried to commit suicide before age 20. 50% of transgender people in Australia and 45% of those in England have attempted suicide at least once.&lt;ref name="Suicide"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virupaksha|first=H.

According to the study ''Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color'' by the University of California San Francisco, transphobia affects the psychological vulnerability of transgender people of color as compared to those of other ethnicities. Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated. Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prevention.ucsf.edu/uploads/pubs/presentations/pdf/APHA_Nemoto.pdf|title=Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color|work=Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West didn't have the time to check: avoiding any association with a tainted form of feminism took precedence over sharing a message about domestic violence. And she acted perfectly rationally in this: to associate herself with me, even by merely [[retweet|RTing]] a statement she agreed with, could be enough to make her a "known TERF" in turn and lead to her being similarly denounced in public. But note the end result of this: a feminist has withdrawn support for another feminist speaking against male violence, ''because a man told her to.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World Almanac and Book of Facts''''' is a US-published [[reference work]] and is a bestselling&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.worldalmanac.com/wa-wahist-learning-resources.aspx History of The World Almanac] retrieved 2007-12-25&lt;/ref&gt; almanac conveying information about such subjects as world changes, tragedies, sports feats, etc.

It has been published yearly from 1868 to 1875, and again every year since 1886.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  It was number 1 on the ''[[Washington Post]]'' bestseller list on November 27, 2011. The 2017 edition ({{ISBN|978-160057-182-4}}) has 1,008 pages.

==History==
The first edition of ''The World Almanac'' was published by ''The [[New York World]]'' newspaper in 1868 (the name of the publication comes from the newspaper itself, which was known as "The World"). Published just three years after the end of the [[US Civil War]] and the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], its 120 pages of information touched on such events as the process of Reconstruction and the impeachment of President [[Andrew Johnson]].

Publication was suspended in 1876, but in 1886 newspaper publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]], who had purchased ''The [[New York World]]'' and quickly transformed it into one of the most influential newspapers in the country, revived ''The World Almanac'' with the intention of making it "a compendium of universal knowledge." ''The World Almanac'' has been published annually since.

In 1894, when it claimed more than a half-million "habitual users," ''The World Almanac'' changed its name to ''The World Almanac and Encyclopedia''. This was the title it kept until 1923, when it became ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts'', the name it bears today.

In 1906, the ''New York Times'', reporting on the publishing of the 20th edition, said that "the almanac has made for itself a secure position, second only to the forty-year-old [[Whitaker's Almanack|Whitaker's Almanac of London]], with which alone it can be compared."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E1DC103EE733A25753C2A9679C946797D6CF "The World Almanac for 1906"], ''New York Times'', January 20, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 to 1934, the [[New York World Building]] was prominently featured on the cover of the almanac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanac.com/wa-bco-covers.aspx|title=The World Almanac - Bonus Content Online|author=|date=|website=www.worldalmanac.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the name changed to its current name, ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts''.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[Calvin Coolidge]]'s father read from ''The World Almanac'' when he swore his son into office.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Since then, photos have shown that Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Bill Clinton]] have also used ''The World Almanac'' as a resource.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The ''New York World'' merged with the [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]]-owned ''Telegram'' to form the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' in 1931. The ''Almanac'' survived the closure of the ''World-Telegram'' in 1966.

During World War II, ''The World Almanac'' could boast that it was read by GIs all over the world: between 1944 and 1946, at the request of the U.S. Government, ''The World Almanac'' had special print runs of 100,000 to 150,000 copies for distribution to the armed forces.

In late December 1984, the 1985 edition reached first place in the category of paperback Advice, How- To and Miscellaneous books, on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list, with more than 1,760,000 copies sold at the time.&lt;ref name="NYT1984"&gt;Edwin McDowell, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DA1138F934A15751C1A962948260 World Almanac Fact: It's a No. 1 Best Seller"], ''New York Times'', December 27, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version of the video game ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', published in 1985, included ''The World Almanac'' in the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;David Hendin, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DA133FF93AA15750C0A964958260 "'CARMEN SANDIEGO'; Point of Reference"], ''New York Times'', letter to the editor, March 29, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years ''The World Almanac'' has been featured in a number of Hollywood films. For example, [[Fred MacMurray]] talks about it with [[Edward G. Robinson]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''; [[Bette Davis]] screams about it in ''[[All About Eve]]''; [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Gary Cooper]] flirt about it in ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]''; it is featured in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' when a trial is held to see if [[Santa Claus]] really exists; [[Rosie Perez]] continually reads it in the film ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]''; and [[Will Smith]] checks it for the exact time of sunset so he can set his digital watch in ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''.

''The World Almanac For Kids'' was published annually since 1995 until 2013, when the ''2014'' edition was released.

In 1993 [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]] sold the ''Almanac'' to K-III (later [[Rentpath|Primedia]]).''The World Almanac'' was sold to [[Ripplewood Holdings]]' WRC Media in 1999. Ripplewood bought [[Reader's Digest]] and the book was then produced by the [[World Almanac Education Group]], which was owned by [[The Reader's Digest Association]]. ''The World Almanac'' was sold to [[Infobase Publishing]] in 2009.

Some lists published are:
* "Surprising Facts"
* "Number Ones"
* "Americans By the Numbers"
* "Milestone Birthdays"
* "Notable Quotes"
* "Offbeat News"
* "Historical Anniversaries"

==Editing and publishing==
In the mid-1980s, the almanac was being put together by a 10-member staff. At that time, 20 percent of the book was rarely updated (for example, the text of the Constitution of the United States), 50 percent was updated at least briefly each year, and 30 percent of the content was completely new each year.&lt;ref name="NYT1984"/&gt;

==Sports==
As a publication of [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA) the ''World Almanac'' would publish the NEA NFL All-Pro teams, which were also released to the media. The NEA All-Pro teams were considered the "player's" All-Pro team since creator Murray Olderman, a NEA sports editor, would poll NFL players for the All-Pro team. The NEA All-Pro team ran from 1955 through 1992.
