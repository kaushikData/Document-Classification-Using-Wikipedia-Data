      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12923">In January 2009, the City of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]] began the [[AARP]]/[[Blue Zones]] Vitality Project. Sponsored by United Health Foundation and led by [[Dan Buettner]], the author of ''The Blue Zone: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest'', the Vitality Project's goal was to add 10,000 years to the lives of Albert Lea residents by encouraging them to make small changes in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Walking Moai Program:''' Over 500 participants joined approximately 70 "walking moais," which were groups of 4-10 walkers who agreed to meet once a week and walk to a set destination and back. They collectively walked over 75 million steps and approximately 32,000 miles. In addition, Walking Moai participants did over 2,200 hours of volunteer work.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation

* '''Walking School Bus:''' The Walking School Bus Program found parents and volunteers to walk with groups of children to their respective elementary schools. A [[walking bus]] is said to encourage children to walk more, help build social networks, and assist in keeping kids safe on their way to school.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Vitality Compass:''' The Vitality Compass is an online tool which is now available nationwide.  It asks participants  questions about their eating habits, sleeping habits, levels of stress, and amount of daily activity.  At the end of the online survey, participants are given an age which is their approximate life expectancy. For the purposes of determining the efficacy of certain aspects of the Vitality Project participants were asked to take the Vitality Compass twice; once at the beginning of the program and again at the end.  The average [[life expectancy]] for those who took the Vitality Compass at the beginning and at the end of the program increased by three years.&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
The City of [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]] put together a sustainability committee which focuses on keeping practices put in place by Vitality Project organizers and volunteers. The long-term goal is that the Albert Lea will have a Vitality Center where leaders of other cities, organizations, and individuals can come to learn about how making small changes in lifestyle as a community can help to improve health and life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2009, the Albert Lea City Council voted to designate the lower level of the Jacobson Apartment Building on Broadway Avenue in downtown Albert Lea as the Vitality Center.  The space will be refurbished and updated to accommodate the Vitality Center. The city's goal is that the Vitality Center be opened in the first part of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Blue and white faience albarello with designs derived from Kufic script Toscane 2nd half 15th century.jpg|thumb|[[Blue-and-white]] [[faience]] albarello with [[Pseudo-Kufic]] designs, [[Tuscany]], 2nd half of 15th century.]]
An '''albarello''' (plural: ''albarelli'') is a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar, originally a [[medicinal jar]] designed to hold [[apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Middle East during the time of the Islamic conquests.

==History==
The etymology of the word is not clear. Some scholars consider the Latin word ''"albaris"'' with the meaning of "whitish"&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Pfister]], ''[[Lessico etimologico italiano]]'', Reichert, Wiesbaden 1979&lt;/ref&gt; while others criticize this interpretation as such recipients were originally manufactured in wood.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Bianchi, ''Lingua Nostra I'', 1939 (pag. 77)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelico Prati, ''Vocabolario etimologico italiano'', Garzanti, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Parchment was white, or bleached white, so that the contents of the jar could be written upon it. The parchment would overlap the upper half of the jar in order to be affixed with a cord and properly seal the contents.

Brought to Italy by [[Hispano-Moresque]] traders, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century. ''Albarelli'' were made in [[Italy]] from the first half of the 15th century through to the late 18th century and beyond. Based on Persian designs said to emulate bamboo (the traditional manufacturing material), the jars are usually cylindrical with a slightly concave waist. Variations in size and style can be seen from region to region, ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 40&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Such jars served both functional and decorative purposes in traditional apothecaries and [[pharmacies]], and represented status and wealth. The jars were generally sealed with a piece of [[parchment]] or [[leather]] tied with a piece of cord.

The maiolica potter's preoccupation with ornamentation and design is nowhere more in evidence than on albarelli during the [[Renaissance]]. Common design themes include floral motifs against a white background, to more elaborate designs such as portraits of a [[cherub]] or [[priest]], and can include a label describing the contents of the jar. Specific styles of decoration are now associated with various Italian locations, including [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Gerace]] and [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]].

Ayre spatula is a device used to collect [[Pap smear]]. It is a wooden spatula with U shaped openings on one side and a flat surface on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting and processing cellular samples from the cervix|url=http://www.eurocytology.eu/en/course/1119|website=Eurocytology|publisher=Leonardo Davinci project|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad end is for vaginal sample collection and the narrow end is for cervical sample collection. It is rotated 360 degrees in the vagina to obtain the cells to be sent for Pap smear examination. Recent studies have shown that long-tipped spatulas ([[Aylesbury device]]) or a [[cytobrush]] along with an extended-tip spatula are better than Ayre spatula in collecting [[endocervix|endocervical cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vatanaspat|first1=V|title=Collection Devices for Obtaining cervical cytology samples|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/gynaecology/cancer/vvcom/en/|website=The WHO reproductive health library|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ayre spatula continues to be used for cervical sample collection in less-income countries. Ayre spatula is introduced into the cervix after visualizing the os using a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]].  The [[cytology]] specimens are obtained by rotating the spatula firmly over the [[ectocervix]] and quickly transferring the cells to a slide or jar.

'''Balwant Singh Rakkha''' (born 1941) was a [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] medical [[Physician|doctor]] and a member of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] of [[Fiji]] representing the [[National Federation Party]] (NFP), but he is best known for his strong support for the former leader of the NFP, [[Sidiq Koya]] and the split caused within the NFP when he was rewarded by Koya for his loyalty by being given a seat in a constituency where he was a virtual unknown.

Rakkha was born in [[Tavua, Fiji|Tavua]] and went to [[India]] to study medicine. He returned to Fiji after fourteen years and established a practice in [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba]]. He joined the NFP in 1975 and was the President of the Ba branch from 1977.

When the [[Lautoka]] Indian [[Communal constituencies|Communal seat]] became vacant in April 1984 following the resignation of the former leader of the NFP, [[Jai Ram Reddy]], Rakkha was selected to contest the by-election for the NFP. [[Davendra Singh]], a virtually unknown small businessman, managed to persuade the [[NFP Youth Wing]], which had earlier been shunned by Koya, to support him to oppose Rakkha. Singh demanded that a local person be selected by NFP for the vacant seat but when he was ignored by the Party, he nominated himself for the election. The result was a narrow win for Singh by 2209 votes to Rakkha's 2196 votes in an election in which only 4421 of the 12,260 registered voters cast their votes. The election result triggered a series of events which led to the decline of the NFP and the rise of the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (FLP).

For the [[Fijian general election, 1987|1987 general election]], the [[NFP–Labour Coalition]] chose him as a candidate for the Ba Indian Communal Constituency which he won easily,&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Fiji: Race and politics in an island state |year=1991 |publisher= UBC Press|location=Vancouver |isbn= 0-7748-0368-1 | pages =383}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was a member of Parliament for a month when the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup of 1987]] put a  temporary halt to his political career.

In 1994 he stood for the Ba East/Tavua Rural Indian Constituency and lost narrowly to his [[Fiji Labour Party]] opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fiji Times '94 General Election Scoreboard|work= |publisher=[[Fiji Times]] |date= 28 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bank für Sozialwirtschaft AG''' (BFS) is a specialized commercial bank for companies, institutions and organizations from the areas of health, social services (support for the elderly and disabled people, child and youth services) and education which is located in [[Cologne]] and [[Berlin]]. 

==Ownership==
The bank was founded in March 1923&lt;ref name="Caritas" /&gt; at the urging of the Reichsarbeitsministeriums (federal ministry of labor) as financial institute of the ''Freie Wohlfahrtspflege'' (free social welfare services) and operated in the beginning under the name ''Hilfskasse gemeinnütziger Wohlfahrtseinrichtungen Deutschlands G.m.b.H.''.&lt;ref name="future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caritas" /&gt; In 1929 it became the ''Berufsgenossenschaft für Gesundheitsdienst und Wohlfahrtspflege''. Still today [[shareholder]]s of the bank are [[umbrella organization]]s of the free social welfare and its [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]].

Stockholders are the ''Deutscher Caritasverband'' and the foundation ''Kronenkreuz'' ([[Diakonisches Werk]]) with each 25,5%, ''Arbeiterwohlfahrt'' (labor welfare association) with 7,9 %, ''Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband'' (parity welfare association) with 3,6 %, [[German Red Cross]] with 2,4 % and ''Zentralwohlfahrtsstelle der Juden'' (Jewish welfare association) with 0,7 %. The rest is free float.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sozialbank.de/ueber-uns/unternehmen/anteilseigner.html|title=Verwurzelt in der Freien Wohlfahrtspflege|last=|first=|date=|website=Bank für Sozialwirtschaft|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business mission==
The BFS offers all services and products of a [[universal bank]]. However, it is a specialized commercial bank in regards to its limited range of [[customer]]s. The [[Consultant|consulting]] is focused on the traditional business and includes not only banking specific aspects but also financing terms and conditions of health and [[Social economy|social management]]. Those are especially shaped by [[social insurance]]s and social legislation. In addition, the bank offers branch specific products such as social economic [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine fonds]], online-[[factoring (finance)|factoring]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] for donation-based organizations.

Services like production site and competitor analysis for [[Nursing home care|care homes]], [[Feasibility study|feasibility studies]], collateral value assessments and valuation reports, a wide-ranging seminar program as well as publications and presentations on the latest legal and economic issues in the health and social management sector are also on offer at BFS. 

BFS operates in 16 locations in Germany ([[Berlin]], [[Dresden]], [[Erfurt]], [[Essen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hanover]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Kassel]], [[Cologne]], [[Leipzig]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Mainz]], [[Munich]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Rostock]], [[Stuttgart]]) and runs a [[Europe]]an office in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfs-investorrelations.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Geschaeftsberichte/2017/|title=Geschäftsbericht 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Bank für Sozialwirtschaft|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">'''Barry Austin ''' (born 1968), of [[Solihull]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]] is a man widely reputed to be the fattest man in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3080296.stm|title= 'Eating less is the real answer'|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|date= 4 September 2003|accessdate= 13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple press reports claim that at his peak weight, he weighed 50 stone (around 700&amp;nbsp;lbs or 320&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=why&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1572754,00.html Why 50-stone Barry seized a chance of life]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227182310/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C6903%2C1572754%2C00.html |date=December 27, 2005  }}, [[The Observer]], September 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin's appearances in the press and on television are usually related to current concerns about an alarming increase in obesity among the population. He has thus been asked to comment on news and current affairs strands such as the [[BBC]]'s [[Breakfast News]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Austin has also been the star of a [[Sky One]] documentary, ''Inside Britain's Fattest Man'', presented by fellow [[Solihull|Silhillian]] [[Richard Hammond]] in the manner of the [[science fiction]] film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''. According to the programme, Austin typically consumed in excess of 29,000 [[calories]] a day&amp;nbsp;– over ten times the average daily intake for a UK male, and has major health problems as a result of his [[morbid obesity]]. He also claimed to drink up to 40 pints on a night out. A previous documentary on Britain's heaviest men&amp;nbsp;– ''The Fattest Men in Britain''&amp;nbsp;–  which saw Austin take the crown, though he was notably lighter and more mobile at the time, reported that he led an actively social life and was something of a celebrity on the [[Birmingham]] club circuit, and a very visible supporter of [[Birmingham City F.C.]] at their home games. However, he was unable to attend their victorious [[Wembley Stadium]] appearance on 27 February 2011, when they lifted the [[Football League Cup]] with a 2–1 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2011 Football League Cup Final|final]] as he was too big to get a seat. By this stage he weighed 40 stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsden |first=John |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2011/02/14/birmingham-city-fan-big-barry-austin-set-to-miss-wembley-97319-28165062/ |title=Birmingham City fan Big Barry Austin set to miss Wembley&amp;nbsp;– Top Stories&amp;nbsp;– News |publisher=Birmingham Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to both documentaries, Austin's greatest problem is his legs (which have notably reduced his mobility in the latter programme). Starved of blood because of their enormous size and distance from his heart, they cause him to suffer regular terrible bacterial infections that leave him swollen, in agony and immobile at home. In September 2005, Austin committed himself to losing weight, restricting his daily intake to a mere 1,500 calories in a bid to save his life.

In November 2009 it was reported that Austin currently weighed 40 stone and was starting a new diet plan to try to lose at least 10 stone. The report also gave his peak weight as 65 stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2009/11/15/40st-birmingham-city-fan-barry-austin-is-copying-diet-used-by-friends-star-jennifer-anistond-diet-66331-25168132/ 40st Birmingham City fan Barry Austin is copying diet used by Friends star Jennifer Aniston diet], ''Sunday Mercury'', November 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 Austin played 'Big Brian' in [[ITV1]]'s comedy-drama ''[[The Fattest Man in Britain]]'' starring [[Timothy Spall]] and [[Bobby Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/the_fattest_man_in_britain/ The Fattest Man In Britain] on The British Comedy Guide website&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 it was confirmed that Barry would be getting married to long term partner of 13 years and former Britain’s fattest woman contestant, "Big Debs" Debbie Kirby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 February 2012 |author=Adam Aspinall |title=Barry Austin is to get married to his long term love |newspaper=Sunday Mercury |accessdate=2012-03-02 |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2012/02/19/barry-austin-is-to-get-married-to-his-long-term-love-66331-30358006/ |archivedate=2012-03-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65rM79YaA?url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2012/02/19/barry-austin-is-to-get-married-to-his-long-term-love-66331-30358006/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">{{wiktionary|Borvo}}
In [[Lusitanian mythology|Lusitanian]] and [[Celtic polytheism]], '''Borvo''' (also known variously as '''Bormo''', '''Bormanus''', '''Bormanicus''', '''Borbanus''', '''Boruoboendua''', '''Vabusoa''', '''Labbonus''' or '''Borus''') was the Celtic God of Minerals and healing [[deity]] associated with bubbling [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] [[water]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac06.htm The Religion of the Ancient Celts: Chapter III. The Gods of Gaul and the Continental Celts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centres of worship==
In [[Gaul]], he was particularly worshipped at [[Bourbonne-les-Bains]], in the territory of the [[Lingones]], where ten inscriptions are recorded.
Two other inscriptions are recorded, one (CIL 13, 02901) from [[Entrains-sur-Nohain]]&lt;ref name="CIL13"/&gt; and the other (CIL 12, 02443) from  [[Aix-en-Savoie]] in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] (CIL), '''12''': ''Gallia Narbonensis''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Votive tablets inscribed ‘Borvo’ show that the offerers desired healing for themselves or others.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; 
Many of the sites where offerings to Borvo have been found are in [[Gaul]]: inscriptions to him have been found in [[Drôme]] at [[Aix-en-Diois]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Gers]] at [[Auch]], [[Allier]] at [[Bourbon-l'Archambault]], [[Savoie]] at [[Aix-les-Bains]], [[Saône-et-Loire]] at [[Bourbon-Lancy]], in [[Savoie]] at [[Aix-les-Bains]], [[Haute-Marne]] at [[Bourbonne-les-Bains]] and in [[Nièvre]] at [[Entrains-sur-Nohain]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.mythofrancaise.asso.fr/mythes/themes/divcelt2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, findings have also been uncovered in the [[Netherlands]] at [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]],&lt;ref&gt;Garrett S. Olmsted, "The gods of the Celts and the Indo-Europeans", page 427&lt;/ref&gt; where he is called Boruoboendua Vabusoa Labbonus, and in [[Portugal]] at [[Caldas de Vizella]] and at [[Idanha a Velha]], where he is called Borus and identified with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; At [[Aix-en-Provence]], he was referred to as Borbanus and Bormanus but at [[Caldas de Vizella]] in [[Portugal]], he was hailed as Bormanicus,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; and at [[Burtscheid]] and at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in [[Germany]] as Borbetomagus.

==Epithets==
In all of his centers of worship where [[Interpretatio graeca|he was assimilated to a Roman god]], Borvo was equated with [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; Many local gods were identified with Apollo in his capacity of god of healing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; He bore similarities to the goddess [[Sirona]], who was also a healing deity associated with mineral springs,&lt;ref&gt;Paul-Marie Duval. 1957-1993. ''Les dieux de la Gaule.'' Presses Universitaires de France / Éditions Payot. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is clearly distinct from her. Variant forms of his name include Bormo and Bormanus (in [[Gaul]]) and Bormanicus (in [[Portugal]]). The names Bormanus, Bormo and Borvo are found on inscriptions as names of river or fountain gods.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac15.htm The Religion of the Ancient Celts: Chapter XII. River and Well Worship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine entourage==
Borvo was frequently associated with a divine consort. Eight of the inscriptions mention the goddess [[Damona]]. Here is an example of one of them (CIL 13, 05911):

:''Deo Apol/lini Borvoni / et Damonae / C(aius) Daminius / Ferox civis / Lingonus ex / voto''&lt;ref name="CIL13"&gt;[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] (CIL), '''13''': ''Tres Galliae et Germanae''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, Borvo's partner is the goddess [[Bormana]]. Bormana was, in some areas, worshipped independently of her male counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green. ''Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend.'' Thames and Hudson Ltd. London. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Gods like Borvo, and others, equated with Apollo, presided over healing springs, and they are usually associated with goddesses, as their husbands or sons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; He is found in [[Drôme]] at [[Aix-en-Diois]] with [[Bormana]] and in [[Saône-et-Loire]] at [[Bourbon-Lancy]] and in [[Haute-Marne]] at [[Bourbonne-les-Bains]] with [[Damona]] but he is accompanied by the ‘candid spirit’ [[Candidus (Celtic spirit)|Candidus]] in [[Nièvre]] at [[Entrains-sur-Nohain]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] at [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] as '''Boruoboendua''' '''Vabusoa''' '''Lobbonus,''' he is found in the company of an [[Ogmios|Celtic Hercules]], [[Macusanus]] and [[Baldruus]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The variants ''Borus ~ Borvo ~ Bormo ~ Bormanus'' seem to be based on a root *''boru''-. This root in turn is thought to be a variant of the [[Proto-Celtic]] root *''beru''- ‘boil’ and may have meant ‘to bubble.’ Cognate with the names is the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''berw''  ‘boiling.’&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and the [[Goidelic]] ''bruich'', 
‘boil, cook’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb05.html#bruich MacBain's Dictionary - Section 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The words are variants of a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base *''bhreue''- ‘to bubble, boil, effervesce’ (cf. Skt. ''Bhurnih'' ‘violent, passionate,’ Gk. ''Phrear'' ‘well, spring,’ L. ''fervere'' ‘to boil, foam,’ Thracian Gk. ''Brytos'' ‘fermented liquor made from barley;’ O.E. ''beorma'' ‘yeast;’ O.H.G. ''brato'' ‘roast meat’ ) from which the [[English language|English]] [[word]] ''brew'' also derives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=brew&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Proto-Celtic]] forms of the name variants most probably were *''Boru-s'', *''Borwon''-, *''Borumāno-s'' and *''Borumān-iko-s'' and the names most probably meant the ‘Bubbler.’ The base of these names is furthermore the source of the name of the [[River Barrow]]. In [[Irish language|Irish]], the river is called ''[[River Barrow|Bearú]]'', the ‘Boiling, Bubbling’ and in [[Irish mythology]] it was [[Dian Cecht]], a great healer of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], who first caused the river to ‘boil’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cml/cml09.htm Celtic Myth and Legend: The Gaelic Gods: Chapter V. The Gods of the Gaels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; *''Borvo''- is the stem Macbain reconstructs for the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''borbhan'', ‘a purling sound,’ and which he also relates to the Welsh ''berw'', ‘seethe,’ French ''[[Bourbon l'Archambault|Bourbon]]'' and the Latin ''fervo'', ‘boil’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb04.html#borbhan MacBain's Dictionary - Section 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid-1980s, it was believed that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'s hospital prospective payment system with [[diagnosis-related group]]s may have led to hospitals' discharging patients to post-hospital care (such as [[Nursing home|skilled nursing facilities]]) more quickly than was appropriate to save money.&lt;ref name="Neu-1986"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/2009/R3335.pdf |title= Extending the Medicare prospective payment system to posthospital care.

Bundled payments began as early as 1984, when [[The Texas Heart Institute]], under the direction of [[Denton Cooley]], began to charge flat fees for both hospital and physician services for cardiovascular surgeries.&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmonds-1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Edmonds C, Hallman GL | title = CardioVascular Care Providers.

Another early experience with bundled payments occurred between 1987 and 1989, involving an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]], a hospital ([[Ingham Regional Medical Center]]), and a [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) in Michigan.&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson-1994"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Johnson LL, Becker RL | title = An alternative health-care reimbursement system -- application of arthroscopy and financial warranty: results of a 2-year pilot study | journal = Arthroscopy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 462–70; discussion 471–2 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.1016/S0749-8063(05)80200-2 | url = http://www.arthroscopyjournal.org/article/S0749-8063%2805%2980200-2/abstract | pmid = 7945644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HMO referred 111 patients to the surgeon for possible surgery; the surgeon would evaluate each patient for free.&lt;ref name="Johnson-1994"/&gt; The surgeon and the hospital received a predetermined fee for any [[arthroscopy|arthroscopic]] surgery performed, but they also provided a two-year [[warranty]] in that they promised to cover any post-surgery expenses (for example, four re-operations) instead of the HMO.&lt;ref name="Johnson-1994"/&gt; Under this arrangement, "all parties benefitted financially": the HMO paid $193,000 instead of the $318,538 expected; the hospital received $96,500 instead of the $84,892 expected; and the surgeon and his associates received $96,500 instead of the $51,877 expected.&lt;ref name="Johnson-1994"/&gt;

In 1991, a "Medicare Participating Heart Bypass Center Demonstration" began in four hospitals across the United States; three other hospitals were added to the project in 1993, and the project concluded in 1996.&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1998"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/downloads/Medicare_Heart_Bypass_Executive_Summary.pdf |title= Medicare Participating Heart Bypass Demonstration.

* In a 1997 analysis, it was estimated that in 1991-1993, the original four hospitals would have had expenditures of $110.8 million for coronary artery bypasses for Medicare beneficiaries, but the change in reimbursement methodology saved $15.31 million for Medicare and $1.84 million for Medicare beneficiaries and their supplemental insurers, for a total savings of $17.2 million (15.5%).&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1997"/&gt; Of the total savings, 85%-93% was attributable to inpatient savings and another 6%-11% was attributable to postdischarge savings; furthermore, there was "no diminution in quality."&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1997"/&gt;
* A 1998 report to the Health Care Financing Administration (now known as the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]) noted that in the five years of the demonstration project, the seven hospitals would have had expenditures of $438 million for coronary artery bypasses for Medicare beneficiaries, but the change in reimbursement methodology saved $42.3 million for Medicare and $7.9 million for Medicare beneficiaries and their supplemental insurers, for a total savings of $50.3 million (11.5%).&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1998"/&gt; In addition, controlling for patient risk factors, the inpatient mortality rate in the demonstration hospitals declined over the course of the project.&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1998"/&gt; The negative aspects of the project included difficulties in billing and collection.&lt;ref name="Cromwell-1998"/&gt;
* A 2001 paper examining three of the original four hospitals with comparable "micro-cost" data determined that "the cost reductions primarily came from nursing intensive care unit, routine nursing, pharmacy, and catheter lab."&lt;ref name="Liu-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Liu CF, Subramanian S, Cromwell J | title = Impact of global bundled payments on hospital costs of coronary artery bypass grafting | journal = J Health Care Finance | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 39–54 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11434712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, "case rates for episodes of illness" (bundled payments) were recognized as one type of "blended payment method" (combining retrospective and prospective payment) along with "capitation with fee-for-service carve-outs" and "specialty budgets with fee-for-service or 'contact' capitation."&lt;ref name="Robinson-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Robinson JC| title = Theory and practice in the design of physician payment incentives | journal = Milbank Q | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–77 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.milbank.org/quarterly/7902feat.html | pmid = 11439463 | pmc=2751195 | doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, other blended methods of payment have been proposed such as "comprehensive care payment",&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt; "comprehensive payment for comprehensive care",&lt;ref name="Goroll-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Goroll AH, Berenson RA, Schoenbaum SC, Gardner LB | title = Fundamental reform of payment for adult primary care: comprehensive payment for comprehensive care | journal = J Gen Intern Med | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 410–5 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-006-0083-2 | pmid=17356977 | pmc=1824766}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "complete chronic care"&lt;ref name="HC4HR-2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://newamerica.net/files/DeliverySystemWhitePaper.pdf |title= Realigning U.S. health care incentives to better serve patients and taxpayers |author = Health CEOs for Health Reform|date=12 June 2009|location= Washington, DC |publisher= New America Foundation |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporate payment for keeping people as healthy as possible in addition to payment for episodes of illness.

The St. Joseph Hospital in Denver held an acute-care episode (ACE) demonstration project in 2003, administered by Deirdre Baggot. Based on the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, the ACE demonstration bundled Parts A and B of Medicare for episodes of care.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

In 2006-2007, the [[Geisinger Health System]] tested a "ProvenCare" model for coronary artery bypass surgery that included [[best practices]], patient engagement, and "preoperative, inpatient, and postoperative care [rehospitalizations] within 90 days... packaged into a fixed price."&lt;ref name="Casale-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Casale AS, Paulus RA, Selna MJ, Doll MC, Bothe AE Jr, McKinley KE, Berry SA, Davis DE, Gilfillan RJ, Hamory BH, Steele GD Jr |title='ProvenCare&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;': a provider-driven pay-for-performance program for acute episodic cardiac surgical care |journal=Ann Surg |volume=246 |issue=4 |pages=613-21; discussion 621-3 |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/SLA.0b013e318155a996 |url=http://www.geisinger.org/provencare/as_pc.pdf |pmid=17893498 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827070337/http://www.geisinger.org/provencare/as_pc.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program received national attention including articles in ''[[The New York Times]]''

An evaluation published in late 2007 showed that 117 patients who received "ProvenCare" had a significantly shorter total length of stay (resulting in 5% lower [[charge description master|hospital charges]]), a greater likelihood of being discharged to home, and a lower readmission rate compared with 137 patients who received conventional care in 2005.&lt;ref name="Casale-2007"/&gt;

In July 2009, a Special Commission on the Health Care Payment System in Massachusetts distinguished between episode-based payments (i.e., bundled payments) and "global payments" that were defined as "fixed-dollar payments for the care that patients may receive in a given time period... plac[ing] providers at financial risk for both the occurrence of medical conditions and the management of those conditions."&lt;ref name="MA-2009a"/&gt; The Commission recommended that global payments "with adjustments to reward provision of accessible and high quality care" (not bundled payments) be used for Massachusetts health care providers.&lt;ref name="MA-2009b"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dhcfp/pc/Final_Report/Final_Report.pdf| author = Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Special Commission on the Health Care Payment System | title= Recommendations of the Special Commission on the Health Care Payment System | date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for selecting global payment were its potential to reduce episodes of care and previous experience with this payment method in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="MA-2009b"/&gt;

As of 2010, provisions for bundled payments are included in both the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].&lt;ref name="KFF"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/housesenatebill_final.pdf |title= Side-by-side comparison of major health care reform proposals |author= Henry J.

In July 2015, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services announced its proposal to mandate a 90-day bundled payment model as a new program for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing joint replacement called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement initiative. The initiative is based on the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement program launched in 2011 and research from the Acute Care Episode demonstration project. The new program will improve cost efficiencies, patient outcomes, and collaboration among providers for an episode of care. Bundled payments will eliminate the demand for unnecessary testing and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Healthcare Financial Management: Journal of the Healthcare Financial Management Association| date=October 1, 2015|author1=Deirdre Baggot |author2=Andy Edeburn | title=Mandated Bundled Payments Compel Hospitals to Rethink Post-Acute Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, CMS announced three new bundles, referred to as episode payment models (EPMs) aimed at cardiovascular care procedures including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and hip/ femur fractures.  The new model will go into effect on July 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecgmc.com/thought-leadership/articles/cms-targets-cardiovascular-care-with-new-mandatory-bundles|title=CMS Targets Cardiovascular Care with New Mandatory Bundles|publisher=CardioSource World News|first1=Deirdre |last=Baggot|first2=Tori |last2=Manis|date=September 15, 2016|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) introduced the successor to the BPCI program, BPCI Advanced, which is a voluntary episode payment model that will start on October 1, 2018 and run through December 31, 2023.

A Convener Participant is a type of Participant that brings together multiple downstream entities referred to as “Episode Initiators”—which must be either Acute Care Hospitals (ACHs) or Physician Group Practices (PGPs)—to participate in BPCI Advanced, facilitates coordination among them, and bears and apportions financial risks.”

==Advantages==
Advocates of bundled payments note:
* 25 to 30 percent of hospital procedures are wasteful without improving the quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/11/27/247531043/hospital-puts-docs-on-the-spot-to-lower-costs| title=Hospital Puts Docs On the Spot to Lower Costs| date=November 27, 2013| author=Lisa Chow| publisher=NPR| access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike fee-for-service, bundled payment discourages unnecessary care, encourages coordination across providers, and potentially improves quality.&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cg2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecamdengroup.com/thought-leadership/top-ten/bundled-payments-revisited-10-new-critical-success-factors/| title=Bundled Payments Revisited: 10 New Critical Success Factors| date=April 2011| author=Deirdre Baggot| publisher=GE Healthcare Camden Group| access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike capitation, bundled payment does not penalize providers for caring for sicker patients.&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt;
* Considering the advantages and disadvantages of fee-for-service, [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], bundled payment for episodes of care, and global payment such as capitation, Mechanic and Altman concluded that "episode payments are the most immediately viable approach."&lt;ref name="Mechanic-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors= Mechanic RE, Altman SH | title = Payment reform options: episode payment is a good place to start | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = w262-71 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.w262 | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/28/2/w262 | pmid = 19174388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers from the [[RAND Corporation]] estimated that "national health care spending could be reduced by 5.4% between 2010 and 2019" if the PROMETHEUS model for bundled payment for selected conditions and procedures were widely used.&lt;ref name="Hussey-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors= Hussey PS, Eibner C, Ridgely MS, McGlynn EA | title = Controlling U.S. health care spending--separating promising from unpromising approaches | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 361 | issue = 22 | pages = 2109–11 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp0910315 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/22/2109 | pmid = 19907037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was higher than for seven other possible methods of reducing national health expenditures.&lt;ref name="Hussey-2009"/&gt; In addition, RAND found that bundled payments would decrease financial risk to consumers and would decrease waste.&lt;ref name="RAND"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.randcompare.org/policy-options/bundled-payment |author = RAND COMPARE (Comprehensive Assessment of Reform Efforts) | title= Overview of bundled payment |publisher= RAND Corporation |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bundling payment provides additional advantages to providers and patients alike, through removing inefficiency and redundancy from patient-care protocols; e.g. duplicate testing, delivering unnecessary care, and failing to adequately provide postoperative care.&lt;ref name=cg2/&gt;
* This method of payment can also provide transparency for consumers by fixing pricing and publishing cost and outcomes data. Patients would be able to choose a provider based on a comparison of real data, not word of mouth.&lt;ref name=cg2/&gt;
* Bundled payments may also encourage economies of scale - especially if providers agree to use a single product or type of medical supply - as hospitals or integrated health systems can often negotiate better prices if they purchase supplies in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/physician-compensation/bundled-payments-what-physicians-need-know "Bundled Payments: What Physicians Need to Know"] Shelly K. Schwartz, Physicians Practice, November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
Before practices choose to participate in bundled payments, they need to be diligent in researching potential episodes of care that would be amenable to this type of reimbursement. Traditionally, physician’s quality monitoring and improvement is managed by the hospital’s nursing sector. Transitioning to a bundled payment methodology shifts accountability back to physicians, thus considerations for their delivery in an acute care episode is essential as well as realigning strategic nursing priorities to enable the needed capacity for care delivery transformation.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt; Once they have selected and defined an episode of care, they should:
* Identify all associated costs
* List all services provided within the episode of care
* Calculate how the care episode would be reimbursed
* Identify how many entities would share in reimbursement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/payment-special-report/20120921specrpt-paymentmodels.html "Taming Payment and Delivery Model Monsters"] Sheri Porter, AAFP News, September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Involve physicians in care coordination
* Create care delivery models to reduce waste, minimize redundancy, and improve provider communication&lt;ref name=cg&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecamdengroup.com/thought-leadership/top-ten/bundled-payments-ten-critical-success-factors/| title=Bundled Payments: Ten Critical Success Factors| date=September 2010| author=Deirdre Baggot| publisher=GE Healthcare Camden Group| access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the advantages of investing in home care options&lt;ref name=cg3/&gt;

According to a February 2018 ''Health Affairs'' article, Government As Innovation Catalyst: Lessons From The Early Center For Medicare And Medicaid Innovation Models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1109|title=Government As Innovation Catalyst: Lessons From The Early Center For Medicare And Medicaid Innovation Models|last=|first=|date=2018-05-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The [BPCI] initiative also highlighted business and operational barriers to implementing this approach. These included managing cash flows, developing budgets for episodes paid prospectively (rather than retrospectively), and reliably tracking providers’ enrollment in a bundled payment model. Convening organizations (such as Premier or Remedy Partners, which brought multiple providers together to support implementation and sometimes shouldered some financial risk), could bring bundles to scale faster but introduced the additional complexity of a three-way arrangement among payer, convener, and provider.”

Clinical leaders and health systems do not always have a complete set of tools for payment reform. Thus, conveners contracted by CMMI, played a helpful role in catalyzing payment reform for their members.”

== Design options ==
Implementation of bundled payments can take many different forms. Several of the key design dimensions include:
* Prospective vs. retrospective payment: A prospective bundle pays a fixed price, established in advance, to a provider to deliver all services included within the bundle. A retrospective bundle initially pays each provider for services in the traditional fee-for-service payment method; after the completion of the episode of care, a provider designated as the accountable provider for the bundle receives a share of savings relative to the bundle price or pays a share of costs in excess of the bundle price. Retrospective payment is sometimes called "virtual bundling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/state-advocacy-arc/state-advocacy-campaigns/private-payer-reform/state-based-payment-reform/evaluating-payment-options/bundled-payments.page|title=Bundled Payments|website=www.ama-assn.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Approach to risk adjustment: bundled payments often use a ''risk adjustment'' approach to modify the price of the bundle to reflect the severity of the patient's condition. Payment methods vary on the basis of which factors are used to determine the risk adjustment (such a patient diagnoses from the past year, patient diagnoses from the past three years, patient medications) and how much each factor adjusts the price of the bundle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/885503O/3m-bundled-payment-ebook.pdf|title=Bundling payment for episodes of care: Balancing the financial risk of health care|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=3M Health Information Systems|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level of risk sharing: a bundled payment may be structured to offer ''upside'' (a share of savings if costs are below the bundle price), ''downside'' (a share of excess costs if costs are above the bundle price), or both. Providers may bear all of the savings and/or excess costs (100% risk), or they may bear a fraction of the risk while payers continue to bear the rest.
* Exclusions, tail risk, and stop-loss criteria: Bundled payment models may choose to set up a variety of safeguards that limit the financial risk that providers bear under extreme circumstances. Various forms of these safeguards include criteria excluding certain types of cases (such as patients with serious comorbidities), criteria excluding costs for cases in excess of a cost threshold (such as unusual cases whose cost is more than 3 standard deviations above the average), and stop-loss criteria limiting the downside that a provider will bear if the average cost is far above the bundle price.

==Disadvantages==
The drawbacks of a bundled payment approach include:
* The scientific evidence in support of it has been described as "scant."&lt;ref name="MA-2009a"/&gt; For example, RAND concluded that its effect on health outcomes is "uncertain."&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;
* It does not discourage unnecessary episodes of care;&lt;ref name="Miller-2009"/&gt; for example, physicians might hospitalize some patients unnecessarily.&lt;ref name="MedPAC-2008"/&gt;
* Providers may seek to maximize profit by avoiding patients for whom reimbursement may be inadequate (e.g., patients who do not take their drugs as prescribed), by overstating the severity of an illness, by giving the lowest level of service possible, by not diagnosing complications of a treatment before the end date of the bundled payment, or by delaying post-hospital care until after the end date of the bundled payment.&lt;ref name="Satin-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MedPAC-2008"/&gt;
* Hospitals may seek to maximize profit by limiting access to specialists during an inpatient stay.&lt;ref name="Galewitz-2009"/&gt;
* Because one provider may [[Outsourcing|outsource]] part of the care of a patient to other providers, it may be difficult to assign financial accountability for a given bundled payment.&lt;ref name="Satin-2009"/&gt;
* There is an administrative and operational burden, for example in establishing fair compensation rates.&lt;ref name="Satin-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; Small sample sizes and incomplete data may cause difficulties in calculation of proper rates for bundled payments.&lt;ref name="Robinson-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors= Robinson JC, Williams T, Yanagihara D | title = Measurement of and reward for efficiency in California's pay-for-performance program.

* Some types of illnesses may not fall neatly into "episodes."&lt;ref name="MA-2009a"/&gt;
* It is possible that one patient may have multiple bundles that overlap each other.&lt;ref name="Robinow-2010"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/Feb/1373_Robinow_potential_global_payment.pdf |title= The potential of global payment: insights from the field |author = Robinow A |date=February 2010 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= The Commonwealth Fund |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Medical school in the United States#Academic health centers|Academic health centers]], which emphasize research, teaching, and new technologies, may be disadvantaged by the payment scheme.&lt;ref name="Robinow-2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Canadian Football Act''''' (1974), also known in its long title as '''''An Act respecting Canadian Professional Football''''', was a proposed [[Act of Parliament|Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected [[monopoly]] over [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[Canadian football|football]] in Canada to the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the [[World Football League]]'s [[Toronto Northmen]] to move to the [[United States]] as the [[Memphis Southmen]]. The spectre of the Act was again raised when [[John F. Bassett]], the owner of the Northmen/Southmen franchise, proposed a [[United States Football League]] franchise for [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1983.

In 2007, there was speculation that a similar act would develop if the [[National Football League]] attempted to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] and thus threaten the Canadian league's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/64892 NFL's New Hot Market Is North of the Border - October 19, 2007 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act would likely still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl if the NFL decided to host their premier event in a stadium far from an NFL city.{{citation needed|date = December 2018}}

It is also unlikely that any future act will be passed to affect American college football, such as the [[NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], who have or have had teams based in Canada  ([[Simon Fraser University]] being the lone NCAA member in Canada) and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws some of its players from American college teams (and, in the case of bowl games, because their December and January scheduling is well after [[U Sports football|Canadian university football]] ends its season).

==Details==
* Designated C-22.
* Introduced by the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]], [[Marc Lalonde]].
* Claimed it would protect the Canadian Football League, would allow the CFL to grow and develop its own distinct character
* Of the mayors of the nine CFL cities at the time, only three were against the ''Canadian Football Act''. They were the mayors of [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[List of mayors of Montreal|Montreal]] and [[List of Toronto mayors|Toronto]], also the biggest cities of Canada then and now, with two of them hosting teams from leagues that played a different code of football. Montreal played host to one of the [[World League of American Football]] teams, the [[Montréal Machine]], in the early 1990s after their CFL team folded in the late 1980s. Toronto were hosts to an [[Arena Football League]] team for two seasons, the [[Toronto Phantoms]].
* After the bill passed second reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], it was given to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs, where it effectively died after the Northmen moved to Memphis.
* Clause 6 in the ''Act'' stated that no person that owns, operates, or manages a team in a league foreign from the CFL shall play in Canada. Subsection 2 stated that no player or member of the said team shall play in Canada, therefore if the bill passed and became law, it would effectively kill teams like the Northmen.

These facts were gathered from the actual debates held in the House of Commons from April 10 to April 28, 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">'''[[Capital punishment]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]''' has been practiced by the [[Hamas Administration in Gaza|Hamas Administration]] since it assumed power in 2007. The punishment is given for offenses such as crimes against [[Islamic law]] (including murder, [[LGBT rights in the State of Palestine|homosexual activities]], etc.), [[Palestinian land laws|land sales to Jews]], and [[treason]]. The [[Hamas]] administration of the Gaza Strip inherited the [[Palestinian National Authority]] code of law, which included the death penalty for several kinds of offenses, but while the Palestinian administration in [[Ramallah]] has refrained from executing capital punishments, death sentences are periodically performed by Hamas.

==History==
According to an [[Amnesty International]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/hamas-tortured-and-killed-palestinian-collaborators-during-gaza-conflict-new-report|title=Hamas tortured and killed Palestinian 'collaborators' during Gaza conflict - new report|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/webfm/Documents/issues/embargoed_report_2015_strangling_necks.pdf|title=‘Strangling Necks’: Abduction, torture and summary killings of Palestinians by Hamas forces during the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict|publisher=Amnesty International}} May 2015.

According to Amnesty, 23 Palestinians were executed by "[[Islamist]] [[terror group]]"&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt; Hamas in the course of the 2014 conflict - 16 of them imprisoned from before the conflict.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3098254/Hamas-executed-Palestinian-collaborators-AK-47s-hundreds-spectators-including-children-assisting-Israel-Gaza-conflict-reveals-Amnesty-International.html|title=Report: Hamas unlawfully executed ‘collaborators’ in front of hundreds|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=2016-04-06|date=27 May 2015|first=Larisa|last=Brown|first2=Flora|last2=Drury}}&lt;/ref&gt; From among the executed, 6 were killed by a firing squad outside a mosque in front of hundreds of spectators including children.

The Palestinian Center for Human Rights reported in December 2015 that Hamas issued nine death sentences in 2015. Hamas had sentenced four Gazans to death during the first weeks of 2016, all on suspicion of spying.&lt;ref name=newsweek2016/&gt;

In February 2016, the armed wing of Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out execution of Mahmoud Ishtiwi - one of the group’s leading commanders, under allegations of gay sex and theft.&lt;ref name=newsweek2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/prominent-hamas-commander-was-executed-after-accusations-gay-sex-432343|title=Hamas executed a prominent commander after accusations of gay sex|date=2 March 2016|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|first=Jack|last=Moore|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishtiwi left two wives and three children.

In May 2016, Hamas reportedly executed three men by firing squad and hanging.&lt;ref name=telegraph2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/31/hamas-begins-executions-in-gaza/|title=Hamas begins executions in Gaza|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Raf|last=Sanchez|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution was performed in the al-Katiba prison. The executed men were convicted for murder. Reportedly, the execution defied protests from the [[United Nations]] and "will likely" deepen tensions with the [[Palestinian government]] in the West Bank.&lt;ref name=telegraph2016/&gt; Hamas defied an agreement with Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank, by carrying out the executions without the approval of Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Hamas later announced that 13 additional prisoners are to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-executions-calls-for-urgent-moratorium-on-death-penalty-as-10-prisoners-await-execution-by-a7060946.html|title=Hamas resumes executions in Gaza|date=2 June 2016|publisher=[[The Independent]]|first=Lizzie|last=Dearden|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, it was reported that three Palestinians were executed by Hamas in Gaza Strip over alleged collaboration with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/04/06/hamas-executes-palestinians/100111612/|title=Hamas executes 3 Palestinians over Israel ties|publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[USA Today]]|date=April 6, 2017|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the men were hanged at a Hamas police compound, as dozens of Hamas leaders and officials watched the killing.

'''Francis J. Bradley''' (born 15 January 1926) is an American health physicist, writer and founding member of the [[Health Physics Society]].

==Life and times==
Francis J. "Frank" Bradley was born on 15 January 1926 in [[New York City]], [[Queens|Queens County]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Bradley’s father was a New York City [[fireman]]. The Bradley family lived in [[Corona, Queens]] New York. 
Bradley worked his way up to the rank of [[sergeant]] in the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] pulling duty as a [[Air gunner|gunner]] aboard a [[B-29]] bomber and served in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] during [[World War II]]. Bradley graduated in 1949 from [[Manhattan College]] with a degree in [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name=Cember&gt;Cember, H. (June 1989) 1988 Founders Award presented to Francis J. Bradley. Health Physics. 56(6): 811-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==AEC Fellowship==
In June 1949 Bradley applied for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) Fellowship in [[Health physics|Radiological Physics]] and passed the examination administered at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=Cember/&gt; While taking the exam he met [[Herman Cember]]. Bradley and Cember passed the test but were delayed in starting the Fellowship as they waited for their [[Q clearance]] to be completed.&lt;ref name=Cember/&gt;

==Oak Ridge and Elda E. Anderson==
Bradley began his career in health physics and radiological protection when he received an [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] Fellowship grant in Radiological Physics at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;Pratt, Rose Marie. (June 2001). Frank Bradley is Thirty-Eighth Failla Memorial Award Lecturer, Greater New York Chapter, HPS Newsletter. XXIX(6): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oak Ridge he started in the second class of [[Elda E. Anderson]] with students that included: [[Herman Cember]], [[Allen Brodsky]] and [[Lester Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green (1980).

==Ohio State University==
Francis J. Bradley went on to the [[Ohio State University]] responsible for Radiation Inspection as the Superintendent of Radiation Safety effective 25 May 1953 with an [[annual salary]] of $6,324.00.&lt;ref&gt;http://trustees.osu.edu/assets/files/minutes/Archive%20minutes/1953-1956.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael T. and Poston, Sr., John W. (2006). A Half Century of Health Physics: 50th Anniversary of the Health Physics Society. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Ohio State, Bradley became a Fallout Shelter Analysis Instructor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpjet.info/Emergency-Preparedness/Emergency-Shelters/Radiation-Shelter/Architect_&amp;_Engineering_Activities_in_Shelter_Development.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York State==
In 1977 Bradley held the position of Principal Radiophysicist, Division of Safety &amp; Health, New York State Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.factsofwny.com/sweeney.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley spent 20 years with the [[New York State]] Department of Labor, Radiological Health Unit as the Principle Radiophysicist.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, David E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">The '''Global Environmental and Occupational Health e-Library''' or '''GeoLibrary''' is a database of occupational safety and health and environmental health training materials and practice tools.  The library is divided into three sections: Environmental Health; Occupational Health and Safety; and a specialty library on Road Safety at Work.

The GeoLibrary is a project of the [[WHO collaborating centres in occupational health|Network of Collaborating Centres]] Work Plan in support of the [[World Health Organization]] (“WHO”) strategy “Occupational Health for All,” and is maintained by the Great Lakes Centers for Occupational and Environmental Safety and Health at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] School of Public Health.  It was created with the following specific aims, to provide:

#Training materials on diseases of occupation and the environment 
#Training materials on hazards and diseases as they pertain to individual economic sectors
#Teaching materials specific to prevention, safety, advocacy, legal and ethical issues, roles of government, etc.
#Practice materials for control and prevention

With a focus on training programs and capacity building, the GeoLibrary provides its users with access to complete courses, tutorials/modules, fact sheets, sample/model programs, guidelines and case studies, all within the public domain and free of charge.  Resources are available in six languages (English, Spanish, French, Russian, Chinese and Arabic) and come from a variety of sources (international organizations, governmental institutes and agencies, academic institutions, corporations, and unions).

The construction of the library was made possible through a gift from Abbott Fund. Additional support for its creation was provided by the U.S. National Center for Environmental Health, the U.S. National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center, and [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] ("NIOSH") Training Program.

In kind support was provided by NIOSH, the U.S. National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]], and WHO Collaborating Centres in Occupational Health.
 
==Environmental Health Materials==
The environmental health branch of the GeoLibrary provides training materials, practice tools and capacity-building resources on topics such as environmental disasters, exposure to physical, chemical, biological and waste hazards, environmental health practice, and environmental management.

In January 2010, in response to the Haiti earthquake, the GeoLibrary and the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (“PAHO”) coordinated a request for natural disaster-related training materials from the Network of Collaborating Centres.  The result of this collaboration was the timely creation of a library section entitled “Special Focus: Haiti,” which included emergency and disaster response materials in French, English and Spanish.

==Occupational Safety and Health Materials==
The occupational safety and health branch of the GeoLibrary provides training materials, practice tools and capacity-building resources in areas such as exposure to physical, psychosocial, chemical, and biological hazards, adverse health effects, and control strategies.  It also includes a sub-section focused on the safety and health hazards of different economic sectors.

In 2009, the GeoLibrary collaborated with PAHO to centralize resources related to the Influenza A (H1N1) virus. The result was the creation of a database entry entitled “Hot Topic: H1N1.”  Resources included in this section apply to businesses, agricultural workers, educational facilities, health care facilities, laboratory workers, and travel industry workers.

==Specialty: Road Safety at Work==
In collaboration with NIOSH, the Specialty: Road Safety at Work branch was added to provide materials related to the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths while at work.  The resources include employer policies and guidance documents on road safety at work, research reports on risk factors for work-related crashes, as well as statistics about worker injuries and fatalities on roads.

Go Texan day sponsored by the [[Texas Department of Agriculture]], whose purpose is to encourage consumers (both within and outside the state of [[Texas]]) to seek and purchase Texas-made products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myfoxzone.com/news/backing-small-businesses/335825688&lt;/ref&gt;

The GO TEXAN campaign began in 1999 to focus on Texas agricultural products.  Later, the campaign expanded to include [[shrimp]] and [[Texas wine]].  In 2003, the [[Texas Legislature]] expanded the program to include Texas-made products of all sorts.

The current GO TEXAN campaign is divided into four general areas:
*GO TEXAN Products—Markets fiber, food, horticulture/forestry/produce, livestock, oysters and shrimp, and wine
*GO TEXAN Communities—Designates an area as a "Certified Retirement Community" based on its ability to meet the living, employment/volunteer, health, entertainment, education, and safety needs of residents and visitors, and also spotlights rural communities to support and encourage rural tourism
*GO TEXAN Restaurants—Links restaurants to Texas-grown or processed food products
*GO TEXAN Special Programs—Operates special programs such as the GO TEXAN booth at the [[State Fair of Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freestonecountytimesonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17027:state-fair-of-texas-kicks-off-go-texan-pavilion-officially-opens-for-fairgoers&amp;catid=52:community&lt;/ref&gt; a website listing of local [[farmers market]]s, and international marketing  go Texan day is on Friday  February 26

A '''generic drug''' is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] that has the same chemical substance as the drug that was originally developed, patented and innovated. Generic drugs are allowed for sale after the expiry of the [[chemical patent|patent]] of the original drugs. Because the active chemical substance is the same, the medical profile of generics is believed to be equivalent in performance.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{Cite| publisher = [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]], [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]| title = Generic Drug Facts| accessdate = 2017-11-11| date = 2017-10-06| url = https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/GenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{Cite web| title = What's the difference between brand-name and generic prescription drugs?| website = Scientific American| accessdate = 2017-11-11| url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-the-difference-betw-2004-12-13/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generic drug has the same [[active pharmaceutical ingredient|Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]] (API) as the original, but it may differ in characteristics such as manufacturing process, [[pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]], [[excipient]]s, color, taste, and packaging.&lt;ref name=SciAm /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ndrugs.com Definition of generic drug]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are usually subject to government regulations in the countries in which they are dispensed. They are labeled with the name of the manufacturer and a generic non-proprietary name such as the [[United States Adopted Name]] or [[international nonproprietary name|international non-proprietary name]] of the drug. A generic drug must contain the same [[active ingredient]]s as the original brandname formulation. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requires generics to be identical to or within an acceptable [[bioequivalence|bioequivalent]] range of their brandname counterparts, with respect to [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm|title=Food &amp; Drug Administration, Generic Drugs: Questions and Answers|date=January 12, 2010|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The FDA's use of the word "identical" is a [[statutory interpretation|legal interpretation]], not literal.)

[[Biopharmaceutical]]s, such as [[monoclonal antibodies]], differ biologically from [[small molecule]] drugs. [[Biosimilar]]s have active pharmaceutical ingredients that are almost identical to the original product and are typically regulated under an extended set of rules, but they are not the same since generic drugs as the active ingredients are not the same as those of their reference products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=Biosimilar and Interchangeable Products|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/Biosimilars/ucm580419.htm#generic|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=5 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, generic products become available after the [[patent]] protections, afforded to a drug's original developer, expire. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition often leads to substantially lower prices for both the original brandname product and its generic equivalents. In most countries, patents give 20 years of protection. However, many countries and regions, such as the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|35|154(a)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; may grant up to five years of additional protection ("patent term restoration") if manufacturers meet specific goals, such as conducting [[clinical trial]]s for pediatric patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/UCM049870.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers, and drugstores can all increase prices at various stages of production and distribution.&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/25/business/la-fi-lazarus-20130326|title=An insider's view of generic-drug pricing|date=March 25, 2013|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, according to an analysis by the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, generic drugs accounted for 88% of the 4.3 billion prescriptions filled in the United States.&lt;ref name="gphaonline_2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gphaonline.org/media/wysiwyg/PDF/GPhA_Savings_Report_2015.pdf|title=Generic Drug Savings in the U.S|date=2015|publisher=Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

"Branded generics" on the other hand are defined by the [[FDA]] and [[NHS]] as "products that are (a) either novel dosage forms of off-patent products produced by a manufacturer that is not the originator of the molecule, or (b) a molecule copy of an off-patent product with a trade name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ on generic drugs|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/questionsanswers/ucm100100.htm|website=FDA|publisher=Food and drug administration|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the company making branded generics can spend little on [[research and development]], it is able to spend on marketing alone, thus earning higher profits and driving costs down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA White Paper: Generic Drug Prices in the US Are Lower Than Drug Prices in Canada|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/whitepapers/drugprices.html|website=FDA|publisher=6.US Food and Drug Administration, Office of Planning|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the largest revenues of [[Ranbaxy]], now owned by [[Sun Pharma]], came from branded generics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Branded Generics: Misunderstood, but Lucrative|url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2008/2008-10/2008-10-8707|accessdate=21 May 2018|publisher=Pharmacy Times|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Pharma Embraces Branded Generics|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/233592-big-pharma-embraces-branded-generics?page=2|website=Seeking Alpha|publisher=Seeking alpha|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
{{See also|Drug nomenclature#Generic names and affixes|l1=Drug nomenclature}}

Generic drug names are constructed using standardized [[affix]]es that distinguish drugs between and within classes and suggest their action.

==Economics==
When a pharmaceutical company first markets a drug, it is usually under a patent that, until it expires, the company can use to exclude competitors by suing them for patent infringement.&lt;ref name=GuptaRev2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=H|last2=Kumar|first2=S|last3=Roy|first3=SK|last4=Gaud|first4=RS|title=Patent protection strategies|journal=Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences|date=January 2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–7|pmid=21814422|pmc=3146086|doi=10.4103/0975-7406.62694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical companies that develop new drugs generally only invest in drug candidates with strong patent protection as a strategy to recoup their costs to [[drug development|develop the drug]] (including the costs of the drug candidates that fail) and to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frakt|first1=Austin|title=How Patent Law Can Block Even Lifesaving Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/upshot/how-patent-law-can-block-even-lifesaving-drugs.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average cost to a brand-name company of discovering, testing, and obtaining regulatory approval for a new drug, with a [[new chemical entity]], was estimated to be as much as $800 million in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/econ/dimasi2003.pdf | title = The price of innovation: new estimates of drug development cost | author = DiMasi J.A. | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | date = 2003 | pages = 151–185 | doi=10.1016/s0167-6296(02)00126-1|display-authors=etal | pmid=12606142| hdl = 10161/6706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and $2.6 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study | title = Cost to Develop and Win Marketing Approval for a New Drug Is $2.6 Billion | date = November 18, 2014 | author = Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development | publisher = [[Tufts University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drug companies that bring new products have several [[product line extension]] strategies they use to extend their exclusivity, some of which are seen as gaming the system and referred to by critics as "[[evergreening]]", but at some point there is no patent protection available.&lt;ref name=GuptaRev2010/&gt;    For as long as a drug patent lasts, a brand-name company enjoys a period of market exclusivity, or [[monopoly]], in which the company is able to set the price of the drug at a level that maximizes profit. This profit often greatly exceeds the development and production costs of the drug, allowing the company to offset the cost of research and development of other drugs that are not profitable or do not pass clinical trials.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

Large pharmaceutical companies often spend millions of dollars protecting their patents from generic competition.&lt;ref name="insider" /&gt; Apart from litigation, they may reformulate a drug or license a subsidiary (or another company) to sell generics under the original patent. Generics sold under license from the patent holder are known as [[authorized generics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gphaonline.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=1932 |title=Authorized Generics |year=2008 |publisher=Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) |accessdate=2008-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529062710/http://www.gphaonline.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=1932 |archivedate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic drugs are usually sold for significantly lower prices than their branded equivalents and at lower [[profit margin]]s.&lt;ref name=Savings&gt;{{cite web|title=Savings From Generic Drugs Purchased at Retail Pharmacies |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |date=April 2004 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/consumerinfo/savingsfromgenericdrugs.htm |accessdate=2008-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223131005/http://www.fda.gov/cder/consumerinfo/savingsfromgenericdrugs.htm |archivedate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this is that competition increases among producers when a drug is no longer protected by patents.&lt;ref name=Savings/&gt;   Generic companies incur fewer costs in creating generic drugs—only the cost of manufacturing, without the costs of [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development]]—and are therefore able to maintain [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] at a lower price.&lt;ref name=Savings/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clihouston.com/news/the-role-of-reverse-engineering-in-the-development-of-generic-formulations.html|title=The role of reverse engineering in the development of generic formulations|website=www.clihouston.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Mike|title=What it takes to be called 'big pharma' - Market Realist|url=http://marketrealist.com/2015/02/takes-called-big-pharma/|work=Market Realist|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prices are often low enough for users in less-prosperous countries to afford them. For example, Thailand has imported millions of doses of a generic version of the blood-thinning drug [[Plavix]] (used to help prevent heart attacks) from India, the leading manufacturer of generic drugs, at a cost of 3 US cents per dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand to import generic version of heart drug Plavix from India|date=2007-08-22 |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/08/22/afx4043270.html |accessdate=2008-10-13 |work=Forbes}} Forbes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic drug companies may also receive the benefit of the previous marketing efforts of the brand-name company, including advertising, presentations by drug representatives, and distribution of free samples. Many drugs introduced by generic manufacturers have already been on the market for a decade or more and may already be well known to patients and providers, although often under their branded name.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

India is a leading country in the world's generic drugs market, exporting US$17.3 billion worth of drugs in the 2017-18 (April-March) year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-us-trade-under-a-cloud-china-opens-to-indian-pharma/articleshow/64958667.cms|title=With US trade under a cloud, China opens to Indian pharma}}&lt;/ref&gt; India exports generic drugs to the United States and the European Union.

In the United Kingdom, generic drug pricing is controlled by the government's reimbursement rate. The price paid by pharmacists and doctors is determined mainly by the number of license holders, the sales value of the original brand, and the ease of manufacture. A typical price decay graph will show a "scalloped" curve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmaphorum.com/2012/04/04/price-decay-after-loss-brand-exclusivity-patent-expiry-generic-launch/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131142513/http://www.pharmaphorum.com/2012/04/04/price-decay-after-loss-brand-exclusivity-patent-expiry-generic-launch/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 January 2013 |title=Price decay after loss of brand exclusivity (patent expiry) and generic launch |publisher=PharmaPhorum |date=4 Apr 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually starts at the brand-name price on the day of generic launch and then falls as competition intensifies. After some years, the graph typically flattens out at approximately 20% of the original brand price. In about 20% of cases, the price "bounces": Some license holders withdraw from the market when the selling price dips below their cost of goods, and the price then rises for a while until the license holders re-enter the market with new stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Generics Bulletin | date = 8 Sep 2006 | title = Guessing at prices means losing money}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Generics Bulletin | date = 16 Feb 2007 | title = Getting to the bottom of 'bouncing' price}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHS spent about £4.3 billionn on generics medicines in 2016-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No-deal Brexit 'will force up price of generic drugs' |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/pharmaceuticals/exclusive-no-deal-brexit-will-force-up-price-of-generic-drugs/7023454.article |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 84% of prescriptions in the US were filled with generic drugs,&lt;ref name=GenericDev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Garth|last2=Yao|first2=Lixin|last3=Han|first3=Liang|last4=Zheng|first4=Qiang|title=Development of the generic drug industry in the US after the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B|date=September 2013|volume=3|issue=5|pages=297–311|doi=10.1016/j.apsb.2013.07.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383513000762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014, the use of generic drugs in the United States led to $254 billion in health care savings.&lt;ref name="gphaonline_2011" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In the mid 2010s the generics industry began transitioning to the end of an era of giant [[patent cliff]]s in the pharmaceutical industry; patented drugs with sales of around $28 billion were set to come off patent in 2018, but in 2019 only about $10 billion in revenue was set to open for competition, and less the next year.  Companies in the industry have responded with [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] or turning to try to generate new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altstedter|first1=Ari|title=Glenmark’s Glenn Saldanha seeks a new holy grail as generic drugs run dry|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/RAou6M0VoQyMHz9l2A5zYM/Glenmarks-Glenn-Saldanha-seeks-a-new-holy-grail-as-generic.html|work=Live Mint|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioequivalence does not mean generic drugs must be exactly the same as the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical differences may exist; a different [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] or [[ester]]&amp;nbsp;may be used, for instance. Different inactive ingredients means that the generic may look different to the originator brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=A|last2=Etherton-Beer|first2=C|title=Choosing a medication brand: Excipients, food intolerance and prescribing in older people|journal=Maturitas|date=January 2018|volume=107|pages=103–109|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.11.001|pmid=29169573}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative").{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their [[pharmacokinetic]] parameters of [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the curve]] (AUC) and [[Cmax (pharmacology)|maximum concentration]] (C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) are within a 90% [[confidence interval]] of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davit|first=BM |author2=Nwakama PE |author3=Buehler GJ |author4=Conner Dp |author5=Haidar SH |author6=Patel DT |author7=Yang Y |author8=Yu LX |author9=Woodcock J |title=Comparing generic and innovator drugs: a review of 12 years of bioequivalence data from the United States Food and Drug Administration|journal=Annals of Pharmacology|year=2009|volume=43|issue=10 |pages=1583–97|doi=10.1345/aph.1m141|pmid=19776300 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236251 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more complex products—such as [[inhaler]]s, [[Transdermal patch|patch delivery systems]], [[Liposome|liposomal preparations]], or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JB|title=Generics, chemisimilars and biosimilars: is clinical testing fit for purpose?|journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol|year=2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04323.x|pmid=22574725|pmc=3555041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enacted in 1984, the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]], informally known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, standardized procedures for recognition of generic drugs.  In 2007, the FDA launched the [[Generic Initiative for Value and Efficiency]] (GIVE):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/advance/generics.html|title=Generic Initiative for Value and Efficiency (GIVE)|date=October 4, 2007|publisher=FDA|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an effort to modernize and streamline the generic drug approval process, and to increase the number and variety of generic products available.

Before a company can market a generic drug, it needs to file an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved "reference-listed drug" and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently.&lt;ref name=Mossing/&gt;  For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires the bioequivalence of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079068.htm |title= Orange Book Annual Preface, Statistical Criteria for Bioequivalence |accessdate= 2009-08-10 |website= Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations 29th Edition |publisher= U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |date=2009-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This range is part of a statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person’s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/UnderstandingGenericDrugs/ucm167991.htm | title = Facts about Generic Drugs | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davit| year = 2009 | title = Comparing generic and innovator drugs: a review of 12 years of bioequivalence data from the United States Food and Drug Administration | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1236251| journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 43 | issue = 10| pages = 1583–97 | doi=10.1345/aph.1m141| pmid = 19776300 |display-authors=etal| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-innovator versions of biologic drugs, or biosimilars, require clinical trials for [[immunogenicity]] in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch-to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules.&lt;ref name="biosimilars"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calo-Fernández|first=Bruno|author2=Martínez-Hurtado J L|title=Biosimilars: Company Strategies to Capture Value from the Biologics Market|journal=Pharmaceuticals|date=2012-12-12|volume=5|issue=12|pages=1393–1408|doi=10.3390/ph5121393|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/5/12/1393/pdf|accessdate=2012-12-12|pmid=24281342|pmc=3816668}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Generic Drug Research (5915) (8493716336).jpg|thumb|Generic Drugs Research]]
When an application is approved, the FDA adds the generic drug to its [[Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations]] list and annotates the list to show equivalence between the reference-listed drug and the generic. The FDA also recognizes drugs that use the same ingredients with different bioavailability, and divides them into therapeutic equivalence groups.&lt;ref name=Mossing&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://plg-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Overview-of-the-Hatch-Waxman-act-its-impace-on-Drug-Develo.pdf | pmid = 11758572 | volume=54 | issue = 2 | title=Overview of the Hatch-Waxman Act and its impact on the drug development process | year=1999 | journal=Food Drug Law J | pages=187–94 | author=Mossinghoff GJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as of 2006, [[diltiazem|diltiazem hydrochloride]] had four equivalence groups, all using the same active ingredient, but considered equivalent only within each group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/docs/preface/ecpreface.htm#Therapeutic%20Equivalence-Related%20Terms Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, Preface.] - an explanation of FDA terms and procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to start selling a drug promptly after the patent on innovator drug expires, a generic company has to file its ANDA well before the patent expires.  This puts the generic company at risk of being sued for patent infringement, since the act of filing the ANDA is considered "constructive infringement" of the patent.&lt;ref name=Mossing/&gt;   In order to incentivize generic companies to take that risk the Hatch-Waxman act granted a 180-day administrative exclusivity period to generic drug manufacturers who are the first to file an ANDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm079342.pdf|title=Guidance for Industry: 180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|date=June 1998|publisher=FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)|format=PDF|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When faced with patent litigation from the drug innovator or patent holder, generic companies will often counter-sue, challenging the validity of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/#paragraph|title=Paragraph IV Drug Product Applications: Generic Drug Patent Challenge Notifications|date=2008-06-11|publisher=FDA, Office of Generic Drugs (OGD)|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.bms.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=277]  Brisol-Myers Squibb press release on successful defense of Plavix patent {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016185533/http://newsroom.bms.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=277 |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apotex.com/ca/en/about/press/20070321.asp] Apotex press release on successful challenge of Norvasc patent &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apotex.com/PressReleases/20040426-01.asp] Apotex press release on successful challenge of Paxil patent {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807213319/http://www.apotex.com/PressReleases/20040426-01.asp |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like any litigation between private parties, the innovator and generic companies may choose to settle the litigation.  Some of these settlement agreements have been struck down by courts when they took the form of [[reverse payment patent settlement]] agreements, in which the generic company basically accepts a payment to drop the litigation, delaying the introduction of the generic product and frustrating the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2125456 |author = Einer Elhauge &amp; Alex Krueger |title=Solving the Patent Settlement Puzzle |publisher= ''Texas Law Review'' |date = 2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Innovator companies sometimes try to maintain some of the revenue from their drug after patents expire by allowing another company to sell an [[authorized generic]]; a 2011 FTC report found that consumers benefitted from lower costs when an authorized generic was introduced during the 180 day exclusivity period, as it created competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#223: Authorized Generic Drug Study|url=https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/initiative-223|publisher=FTC|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authorized Generic Drugs: Short-Term Effects and Long-Term ImpactAuthorized Generic Drugs: Short-Term Effects and Long-Term Impact|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/authorized-generic-drugs-short-term-effects-and-long-term-impact-report-federal-trade-commission/authorized-generic-drugs-short-term-effects-and-long-term-impact-report-federal-trade-commission.pdf|publisher=FTC|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovator companies may also present arguments to the FDA that the ANDA should not be accepted by filing an [[FDA citizen petition]].  Citizen petitions are part of the basic law governing everything the FDA does—at any time, any "interested person" can request that the FDA "issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order," or "take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action."&lt;ref name=Cardozo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrier|first1=Michael A.|last2=Wander|first2=Daryl|title=Citizen Petitions: An Empirical Study|journal=Cardozo Law Review|date=2012|volume=34|pages=249–293|url=http://cardozolawreview.com/content/34-1/Carrier.34.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acceptance====
A series of scandals around the approval of generic drugs in the late 1980s shook public confidence in generic drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained bioequivalence data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some generic companies' applications and delaying or denying others.&lt;ref name=GenericDev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|title=Bolar: A Drug Company Under Siege|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/nyregion/bolar-a-drug-company-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=15 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/business/exposing-the-fda.html?pagewanted=all|title = Exposing the F.D.A.|last = Freudenheim|first = Milt|date = 10 September 1989|work = New York Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Edmund L.|title=F.D.A.

Some generic drugs are viewed with suspicion by doctors. For example, [[warfarin]] (Coumadin) has a narrow [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic window]] and requires frequent blood tests to make sure patients do not have a subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in [[Ontario]] showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe,&lt;ref name="Pereira-2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pereira JA, Holbrook AM, Dolovich L, Goldsmith C, Thabane L, Douketis JD, Crowther MA, Bates SM, Ginsberg JS |title=Are brand-name and generic warfarin interchangeable?

The [[Government of India|Indian government]] began encouraging more drug manufacturing by Indian companies in the early 1960s, and with the Patents Act in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/IPcourse/patent.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430232700/http://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/IPcourse/patent.html |date=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patents Act removed composition patents for foods and drugs, and though it kept process patents, these were shortened to a period of five to seven years. The resulting lack of patent protection created a niche in both the Indian and global markets that Indian companies filled by reverse-engineering new processes for manufacturing low-cost drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | date = 2012 | pages = 607–619 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.05.012 | title = The effects of patent-law changes on innovation: The case of India's pharmaceutical industry |author1=George T.

'''Genie''' (born 1957)  is the [[pseudonym]] of an American [[feral child]] who was a victim of severe [[Child abuse|abuse]], [[Child neglect|neglect]], and [[social isolation]]. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal [[child psychology]].{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|p=428}}&lt;ref name=Waltz&gt;{{cite book|last=Waltz | first=Mitzi | authorlink=Mitzi Waltz | title=Autism: A Social and Medical History | location=Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EC0RYUtuXgsC&amp;pg=PA96 | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-230-52750-8 | oclc=821693777}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}} When she was a baby, her father concluded that she had a severe [[intellectual disability]], a view which intensified as she got older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months, he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible as a result of this belief, so he kept her locked alone in a room from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months. During this time, he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{cite episode | title=Secret of the Wild Child | publisher=PBS | accessdate=February 12, 2009 | series=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] | network=PBS (United States), [[BBC]] (United Kingdom) | airdate=March 4, 1997 | season=22 | number=2 | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2112gchild.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109103309/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2112gchild.html | archivedate=November 9, 2012 | deadurl=no | oclc=57894649}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=1–6}} The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and she did not acquire language during her childhood as a result.

In the first several years after Genie's early life and circumstances came to light, psychologists, linguists, and other scientists focused a great deal of attention on Genie's case, seeing in her near-total isolation a unique chance to study many aspects of human development. Upon determining that Genie had not yet learned language, linguists saw Genie as providing an opportunity to gain further insight into the processes controlling [[Language development|language acquisition skills]] and to test theories and [[Critical Period Hypothesis|hypotheses identifying critical periods]] during which humans learn to understand and use language. Throughout the time scientists studied Genie, she made substantial advances in her overall mental and psychological development. Within months of being discovered, Genie had developed exceptional [[nonverbal communication]] skills and gradually learned some basic [[social skills]], but even by the end of their case study, she still exhibited many behavioral traits characteristic of an unsocialized person. She also continued to learn and use new language skills throughout the time they tested her, but ultimately remained unable to fully acquire a [[first language]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;

Authorities initially arranged for Genie's admission to the [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where a team of physicians and psychologists managed her care for several months, and her subsequent living arrangements became the subject of rancorous and protracted debate. In late June 1971, she left the hospital to live with her teacher at the hospital, but a month and a half later, authorities placed her with the family of the scientist heading the research team, with whom she lived for almost four years. Soon after turning 18 in mid-1975, Genie returned to live with her mother, who decided after only a few months that she could not adequately care for her. Authorities then moved her into the first of what would become a series of institutions for disabled adults, and the people running it cut her off from almost everyone she knew and subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=151–155}} As a result, her physical and mental health severely deteriorated, and her newly acquired language and behavioral skills very rapidly regressed.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;

In January 1978, Genie's mother suddenly forbade all scientific observations and testing of Genie, and since that time little is known of her circumstances. As of July 2016, her whereabouts were uncertain, although she is believed to be living in the care of the state of California.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Psychologists and linguists continue to discuss her, and there is considerable academic and media interest in her development and the research team's methods. In particular, scientists have compared Genie to [[Victor of Aveyron]], a 19th-century French child who was also the subject of a case study in delayed psychological development and late language acquisition.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Leiber1997/&gt;

==Family background==
Genie was the last, and second surviving, of four children born to parents living in [[Arcadia, California]]. Her father worked in a factory as a [[Flight engineer|flight mechanic]] during [[World War II]] and continued in aviation afterward, and her mother, who was around 20 years younger and from an [[Oklahoma]] farming family, had come to southern California as a teenager with family friends fleeing the [[Dust Bowl]].{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–14}}&lt;ref name=ABCbro&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4873347&amp;page=1 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914082831/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4873347&amp;page=1 | archivedate=September 14, 2011 | deadurl=no | title=Raised by a Tyrant, Suffering a Sibling's Abuse | publisher=ABC News | date=May 19, 2008 | last=James | first=Susan Donaldson | accessdate=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilyPast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/popup?id=4870528 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013190722/http://abcnews.go.com/US/popup?id=4870528 | archivedate=October 13, 2012 | deadurl=no | title=Family's Past | work=ABC News | date=May 19, 2008 | accessdate=May 26, 2013 | last=James | first=Susan Donaldson}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her early childhood, Genie's mother sustained a severe head injury in an accident, giving her lingering neurological damage that caused degenerative vision problems in one eye. Genie's father mostly grew up in orphanages in the American Pacific Northwest. His father died as the result of a lightning strike and his mother ran a brothel while only infrequently seeing him. Additionally, his mother gave him a feminine first name, which made him the target of constant derision. As a result, he harbored extreme resentment toward his mother during childhood, which Genie's brother and the scientists who studied Genie believed was the root cause of his subsequent anger problems.&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–16}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=305}}

When Genie's father reached adulthood, he changed his first name to one which was more typically masculine, and his mother began to spend as much time with him as she could. He became almost singularly fixated on his mother, despite their relentless arguments about her attempts to convince him to adopt a less rigid lifestyle, and treated all other relationships as secondary at best.&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–15}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=2–4}} Although Genie's parents initially seemed happy to those who knew them, soon after they married he prevented his wife from leaving home and beat her with increasing frequency and severity.&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–14}} Her eyesight steadily deteriorated due to lingering effects from the existing neurological damage, the onset of severe [[cataract]]s, and a [[detached retina]] in one eye, leaving her increasingly dependent on her husband.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=3–7}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–14}}

Genie's father disliked children and wanted none of his own, finding them noisy, but, around five years into their marriage, his wife became pregnant. This child, an apparently healthy daughter, caught [[pneumonia]] after her father found her cries disturbing and placed her in the garage, and died at the age of ten weeks.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=3}}&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt; Their second child, born approximately a year later, was a boy diagnosed with [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn|Rh incompatibility]] who died at two days of age, either from complications of Rh incompatibility or from choking on his own mucus.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=13–14}} Three years later, they had another son, who doctors described as healthy despite also having Rh incompatibility. His father forced his wife to keep him quiet, causing significant physical and linguistic developmental delays. When he reached the age of four, his maternal grandmother took over his care for several months, and he made good progress with her before she eventually returned him to his parents.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=3–4}}

==Early life==
Genie was born about five years after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate himself and his family from others.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=14}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=306}} At birth, she was in the 50th percentile for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a [[blood transfusion]], but had no [[sequela]]e and was otherwise described as healthy.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=14}} A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a [[Dislocation of hip#Congenital|congenital hip dislocation]], which required her to wear a highly restrictive [[Hip dysplasia (human)#Harnesses, casts, and traction|Frejka splint]] from the age of 4½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie to be late to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she had an [[intellectual disability]]. As a result, he made a concentrated effort not to talk to or pay attention to her, and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so as well.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}

There is little information about Genie's early life, but available records indicate that for her first months she displayed relatively normal development. Genie's mother later recalled that Genie was not a cuddly baby, did not [[Babbling|babble]] much, and resisted solid food.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Development of Language in Genie: a Case of Language Acquisition Beyond the "Critical Period" | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1974%20-%20The%20development%20of%20language%20in%20Genie.pdf | accessdate=June 6, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806210112/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.5831&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | archivedate=August 6, 2015 | deadurl=no | author1=Curtiss, Susan | author2=Fromkin, Victoria A. | author3=Krashen, Stephen D. | author4=Rigler, David | author5=Rigler, Marilyn | author2-link=Victoria Fromkin | author3-link=Stephen Krashen | journal=Brain and Language | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | year=1974 | location=Los Angeles| doi=10.1016/0093-934X(74)90027-3 | oclc=4652742368 | issn=0093-934X | pages=81–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=4}} At times she said that at some unspecified point Genie spoke individual words, but could not recall them, but at other times she said that Genie had never produced speech of any kind. Researchers never determined which was the truth.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5, 11}}

At the age of 11 months, Genie was still in overall good health and had no noted mental abnormalities, but had fallen to the 11th percentile for weight. The people who later studied her believed this was a sign that she was starting to suffer some degree of [[malnutrition]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=14–16}} When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and [[pneumonitis]] and her parents took her to a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] who had not previously seen her. The pediatrician said that, although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis, there was a possibility that she had an intellectual disability and that the brain dysfunction [[kernicterus]] might be present, further amplifying her father's conclusion that she was severely intellectually disabled.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=4}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978&gt;{{cite journal | title=Language development in the mature (minor) right hemisphere | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1978%20-%20Language%20development%20in%20the%20mature%20%28minor%29%20right%20hemisphere.pdf | first1=Susan | last1=Curtiss | first2=Victoria A. | last2=Fromkin | author2-link=Victoria Fromkin | first3=Stephen D. | last3=Krashen | author3-link=Stephen Krashen | journal= [[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Journal of Applied Linguistics]] | year=1978 | volume=39–40 | issue=1 | pages=23–27 | accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=14–17}}

Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her paternal grandmother died in a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] traffic accident. Her death affected Genie's father far beyond normal levels of grief, and, because his son had been walking with her, he held his son responsible, further heightening his anger.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=5}} When the truck's driver received only a [[probation]]ary sentence for both [[manslaughter]] and [[drunk driving]], Genie's father became delusional with rage. Scientists believed these events made him feel society had failed him and convinced him he would need to protect his family from the outside world, and that in doing so he lacked the [[self-awareness]] to recognize the destruction his actions caused. Because he believed Genie was severely intellectually disabled, he thought she would require additional protection from him, and he, therefore, decided he needed to entirely hide her existence.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=12–16}} He immediately quit his job and moved his family into his mother's two-bedroom house, where he demanded his late mother's car and bedroom be left completely untouched as shrines to her, and further isolated his family.&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=14–15, 208}}

===Childhood===
Upon moving, Genie's father increasingly confined Genie to the second bedroom in the back of the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=211}} During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours, Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a [[straitjacket]]. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities.&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=131–134, 208}} At night, he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a [[Infant bed|crib]] with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=185–186}}&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;

Researchers concluded that, if Genie vocalized or made any other noise, her father beat her with a large plank that he kept in her room.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}} To keep her quiet, he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something he did not like, he made these noises outside the door and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a [[guard dog]] and was acting out the role.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6, 25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–97, 130}} As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to [[sexual abuse]] or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6, 25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=95–98}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=209–210, 215}}

Genie's father fed Genie as little as possible and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, [[Pablum]], an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced, her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough, the person feeding her rubbed her face in her food.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=215}} These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=6–7}} In early 1972, Genie's mother told researchers that at around 11:00 at night, when possible, she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 p.m., woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6½ hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;

Genie's father had an [[Misophonia|extremely low tolerance for noise]], to the point of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}} Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, [[TV Guide]]s with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}}&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=91, 185–186, 209–210}} The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=185–186}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;

Throughout this time, Genie's father almost never permitted anyone else to leave the house, only allowing his son to go to and from school and requiring him to prove his identity through various means before entering, and to discourage disobedience, he frequently sat in the living room with a shotgun in his lap. He did not allow anyone else in or near the house, and kept his gun nearby in case someone did come.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=211}} No one in the neighborhood knew about the abuse Genie's father carried out on his family or was aware that Genie's parents ever had a child besides their son.&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt; Throughout this time, Genie's father kept detailed notes chronicling his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it.{{efn|In her dissertation on Genie, Susan Curtiss alluded to knowledge of additional details regarding Genie's childhood, which she did not discuss.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=6–8}}}}&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;

Genie's mother was passive by nature and almost completely blind by this time. Her husband continued to beat her and threatened to kill her if she attempted to contact her parents, close friends who lived nearby, or the police.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=7}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=11–12}} Genie's father also forced his son into silence, giving him instructions on how to keep his father's actions secret and beating him with increasing frequency and severity, and as he got older his father forced him to carry out progressively more of his abuse of Genie in the same manner.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=6}} He felt completely powerless to do anything to stop it and feared severe retribution for attempting to intervene, and on multiple occasions tried to run away from the house.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt; Genie's father was convinced Genie would die by age 12 and promised that, if she survived past that age, he would allow his wife to seek outside assistance for her, but he reneged when Genie turned 12 and her mother took no action for another year and a half.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=211}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=7}}

===Rescue===
In October 1970, when Genie was approximately 13 years and 6 months old, Genie's parents had a violent argument in which her mother threatened to walk out if she could not call her own parents. Her husband eventually relented, and later that day she left with Genie when he was out of the house and went to her parents in [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]]; Genie's brother, by then 18, had already run away from home and was living with friends.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=7}} Around three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother decided to apply for [[Welfare (financial aid)|disability benefits]] for the blind in nearby [[Temple City, California]] and brought Genie with her, but on account of her near-blindness, Genie's mother accidentally entered the general social services office next door.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=7}} The social worker who greeted them instantly sensed something was wrong when she saw Genie and was shocked to learn her true age, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly [[autism|autistic]], and after she and her supervisor questioned Genie's mother and confirmed Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a [[ward (law)|ward of the court]], and due to her physical condition and near-total unsocialized state, a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to the [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=7}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=9, 15, 20}}{{sfn||Newton|2002|pp=212–215}}

Upon Genie's admission to Children's Hospital, David Rigler, a therapist and [[University of Southern California]] psychology professor who was the chief psychologist at the hospital, and Howard Hansen, then the head of the psychiatry division and an early expert on child abuse, took direct control of Genie's care. The following day they assigned physician James Kent, another early advocate for child abuse awareness, to conduct the first examinations of her.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39–41}} Most of the information doctors received on Genie's early life came from the police investigation into Genie's parents. Even after its conclusion, there were a large number of unresolved questions about Genie's childhood that subsequent research never answered.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=24–25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=10, 96–98}}

News of Genie reached major media outlets on November 17, receiving a great deal of local and national attention, and the one photograph authorities released of Genie significantly fueled public interest in her.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=212–213}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=7–9, 21, 38}} Although Genie's father refused to speak to police or the media, large crowds subsequently went to try to see him, which he reportedly found extremely difficult to handle. On November 20, the morning before a scheduled court appearance on child abuse charges, he committed suicide by gunshot.&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=212–213}} Police found two [[suicide note]]s, one intended for his son which in part said, "Be a good boy, I love you", and one directed at police. One note—sources conflict as to which—contained the declaration, "The world will never understand."&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=20–21, 133–134}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=212–213}}

After Genie's father committed suicide authorities and hospital staff exclusively focused on Genie and her mother; Genie's brother said his mother soon began dedicating all of her love and attention to Genie, and he left Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt; At the request of Hansen, attorney [[John Miner (attorney)|John Miner]], an acquaintance of Hansen, represented Genie's mother in court. She told the court that the beatings from her husband and her near-total blindness had left her unable to protect her children.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=21, 132–134}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=212–214}} Charges against her were dropped, and she received counseling from Children's Hospital; Hansen was her therapist's direct supervisor.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=21, 133–134}}

James Kent stated that his initial examinations of Genie revealed by far the most severe case of child abuse he would ever encounter, and he came away extremely pessimistic about Genie's [[prognosis]].{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39–41}} Genie was extremely pale and grossly malnourished, standing {{height|ft=4|in=6}} and weighing only {{convert|59|lb}}, and had two nearly full sets of teeth in her mouth and a distended abdomen.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=9}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=9}} The restraining harness her father used had caused a thick [[callus]] and heavy black bruising on her buttocks, which took several weeks to heal.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 45}} A series of [[X-ray]]s found Genie had moderate [[coxa valga]] in both hips and an undersized ribcage, and doctors determined her [[bone age]] to be that of an 11-year-old.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; Despite early tests confirming she had normal vision in both eyes she could not focus them on anything more than {{convert|10|ft|0}} away, corresponding to the dimensions of the room her father kept her in.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9, 12}}

Genie's [[gross motor skill]]s were extremely weak; she could neither stand up straight nor fully straighten any of her limbs, and had very little [[endurance]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–14}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 40, 45, 63}} Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic "bunny walk", in which she held her hands in front of her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with [[sensory processing]] and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–14}} Kent was somewhat surprised to find her [[fine motor skill]]s were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=40}} She could not chew and had very severe [[dysphagia]], totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9, 12}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 45}} When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her [[saliva]] broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it with her fingers.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=215}} She was also completely incontinent, and did not respond to extreme temperatures.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 41, 63, 101}}

Doctors found it extremely difficult to test or estimate Genie's [[mental age]] or any of her cognitive abilities, but on two attempts they found Genie scored at the level of a 13-month-old.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 34–36, 185–186}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39–41}} To the surprise of doctors she was intensely interested in exploring new environmental stimuli, although objects seemed to intrigue her much more than people. She seemed especially curious about unfamiliar sounds, and Kent noted how intently she searched for their sources.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=41}} Doctors noticed her extreme fear of cats and dogs very early during her stay, but initially thought this was due to her being incapable of rational thinking; they did not discern its actual origin until years later.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–10, 20, 25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 40–41, 48–49, 63, 101}}

From the start Genie showed interest in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent said she did not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of [[attachment theory|attachment]] to anybody, including her mother and brother.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9, 20}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=42, 132}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=215}} At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 268–269}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=40, 51, 132}} She had no sense of [[personal property]], frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or [[situation awareness|situational awareness]]. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=24–25}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=215}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=97–99}}

From the start Genie showed a small amount of responsiveness to nonverbal information, including gestures and [[facial expression]]s from other people, and made reasonably good [[eye contact]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 39–41}} However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible [[body language]], and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 267–269}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=214}} She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}} When upset Genie would wildly [[self-harm|attack herself]], but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 40, 48–49}} Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=267–269}}

Linguists later discerned that, in January 1971, Genie showed understanding of only her own name, the names of a few others, and about 15–20 words, and her [[active vocabulary]] at the time consisted of two phrases, "stop it" and "no more". They could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before January 1971, and therefore did not know whether she had acquired any or all of these words during the preceding two months.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}} After observing Genie for some time they concluded that she was not [[selective mutism|selectively mute]], and tests found no physiological or psychological explanation for her lack of language.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Because her existing medical records also contained no clear indications of mental disabilities researchers determined that, due to her extreme isolation and lack of exposure to language during childhood, she had not acquired a [[first language]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–13}}

====Preliminary assessment====
Within a month after Genie's admission to Children's Hospital, Jay Shurley, a professor of [[psychiatry]] and [[behavioral sciences]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]] and a specialist in extreme social isolation, took an interest in her case. Shurley noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about, which he maintained more than 20 years later.&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=46–47, 198, 210}} Over the next year and a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a [[sleep study]], hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, whether or not she had sustained any brain damage, and whether or not she was born intellectually disabled.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=SleepEEG&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sleep EEG Patterns in a Fourteen-Year-Old Girl with Severe Developmental Retardation | publisher=Academic Press | date=September 1973 | accessdate=June 20, 2013 | last1=Shurley | first1=Jay T. | last2=Natani | first2=Kirmach | type=Conference presentation | url=http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=shurley1972 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015040318/http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=shurley1972 | archivedate=October 15, 2010 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=42–47}} Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of emotional disturbance, but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral [[defense mechanisms]] were uncharacteristic of autism.{{efn|Psychologist and autism specialist [[Mitzi Waltz]] noted in 2013 that, although psychologist [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]] was conducting autism research at UCLA during the time of Genie's case, no one who worked with Genie attempted to involve him in the case or sought his opinion on whether or not Genie was autistic. Years after the case study on Genie had ended, when somebody asked Susan Curtiss why they had not done so, Curtiss said she and the other scientists felt Lovaas' methods of [[aversion therapy]] would have unduly limited Genie's freedom and prevented her access to a nurturing environment.&lt;ref name=Waltz/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;

Shurley found no signs of brain damage but observed a few persistent abnormalities in Genie's sleep, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]] and an unusually high number of [[sleep spindle]]s.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt; He eventually concluded Genie had been intellectually disabled from birth, specifically citing her significantly elevated number of sleep spindles.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=46–49}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=214–216, 220}} The other scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, she could not have been intellectually disabled. She pointed out that Genie made a year's developmental progress for every calendar year after her rescue, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital, and that some aspects of language Genie acquired were uncharacteristic of mentally disabled people.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=126–127}} She instead believed that Genie was born with at least average intelligence and that the abuse and isolation of her childhood had left her functionally disabled.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=126–127}}

==Hospital stay==
In his first meeting with Genie, James Kent initially observed no reactions from her but eventually drew a small amount of nonverbal and verbal responsiveness with a small puppet. Playing with this and similar puppets quickly became her favorite activity and, apart from her tantrums, accounted for most of the few times she expressed any emotion during the early part of her stay.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=40–49}} Within a few days she started learning to dress herself and began voluntarily using the toilet, but she continued to suffer from nighttime and daytime incontinence which only slowly improved.&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39, 47–48, 151}} Kent quickly realized there would be a large number of people working with Genie, and was concerned that she would not learn to form a normal relationship unless somebody was a steady presence in her life, so he decided to accompany her on walks and to all of her appointments.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=40–44}}

Genie quickly began growing and putting on weight and steadily became more confident in her movements, and by December she had good [[eye–hand coordination]] and was much better at focusing her eyes.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39, 45–51, 140}} She rapidly developed a sense of possession, [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarding]] objects to which she took a liking for reasons doctors did not know, and became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she collected.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=47, 49}} She took all kinds of items but particularly sought colorful plastic objects, which doctors speculated was due to these having been the items she had access to as a child, and she did not seem to care whether they were toys or ordinary containers but especially sought out beach pails. During the first few months of her stay, giving her one of these objects could bring her out of a tantrum.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=7, 267–269}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=91}}

After a few weeks Genie became much more responsive to other people, and shortly afterward began paying attention to people speaking, but at first, she remained mostly unexpressive and it was unclear whether she responded more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=9–10, 42–47}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–15, 267–270}} Shortly afterwards Genie showed clear responses to nonverbal signals, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=92–94}} A month into her stay Genie started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon after with other hospital staff.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=49–51, 55–60}} She was clearly happy when someone she knew visited and sometimes worked very hard to get a person to stay, expressing disappointment if she failed; for no discernible reason, her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=268–269}} After the state dropped charges against Genie's mother she began visiting Genie twice a week, and over the course of a few months they steadily grew better at interacting with each other.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=132–133}}

Around the same time it was noted that Genie took pleasure in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=48–49, 55, 57}} Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=267}} She also showed a deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=47–49, 55, 57, 60, 103–105, 116}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}

By December 1970, Kent and the other hospital staff working with Genie saw her as a potential [[Case study in psychology|case study]] subject. That month David Rigler obtained a small grant from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) to do preliminary studies on her, and began organizing a research team to submit a larger request.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=39, 51, 140}} In January 1971 doctors administered a [[Gesell Developmental Schedules|Gesell Developmental Evaluation]] and found Genie to be at the developmental level of a 1- to 3-year-old, noting she already showed substantial developmental disparities.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; The following month psychologists [[Jeanne Block]] and her husband [[Jack Block]] evaluated Genie, and her scores ranged from below a 2- to 3-year-old level to, on a few components, a normal 12- to 13-year-old level. Around the same time, doctors noted that she was very interested in people speaking and that she attempted to mimic some speech sounds.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=14–15, 200}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–153}}

By April and May 1971, Genie's scores on the [[Leiter International Performance Scale]] tests had dramatically increased, with her overall mental age at the level of a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=12}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=51}} Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=200}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–153}} Around that time, when a minor [[earthquake]] struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=50, 132–133}}

During the later part of Genie's stay at the hospital, she also started engaging in physical play with adults, and eventually began to enjoy giving and receiving hugs.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=51, 56–59, 140, 187}} She continued to exhibit frustration and have tantrums, but in response to situations that would have elicited similar reactions in most young children, and she could sulk for a long time despite receiving an object she liked.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=268–270}} In April 1971, to the great surprise of doctors, she began attacking another girl because she felt she owned the hospital dress the other girl had on. This was both her first exhibition of a sense of possession over items she thought were hers but was otherwise impartial towards and the first time she directed her anger outwards, but she did not entirely stop harming herself when angry.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=269–271}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=51, 56–59}}

===Brain testing===
[[File:Salk Institute1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|alt=Refer to caption|The Salk Institute, where researchers analyzed the data from the first of several brain exams on Genie.]]
Beginning in January 1971 scientists conducted a series of [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] tests on Genie to determine and monitor the course and extent of her mental development, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed study of her brain.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}} Genie's entire brain was physically intact and Shurley's sleep-studies found sleep patterns typical of a [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]] person, leading scientists to believe she was most likely [[right-handed]]. Over the following years multiple tests of her handedness supported this conclusion, as did observations of her in everyday situations.&lt;ref name=SleepEEG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}} Based on their early tests, doctors suspected Genie's brain was extremely [[cerebral hemisphere|right-hemisphere]] dominant.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}}

In early March of that year, neuroscientists [[Ursula Bellugi]] and [[Edward Klima]] came from the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] to administer their own series of brain exams on Genie. [[Audiometry]] tests confirmed that she had normal hearing in both ears, but on a series of [[dichotic listening test]]s Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either [[split-brain]] or who had undergone a [[hemispherectomy]] as an adult.&lt;ref name=Lateralization&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1467-1770.1973.tb00097.x | title=Lateralization, Language Learning, and the Critical Period: Some New Evidence | last=Krashen | first=Stephen D. | authorlink=Stephen Krashen | journal=[[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] |date=June 1973 | volume=53 | issue=1 | pages=63–74 | issn=0023-8333 | oclc=4651814274 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1973.tb00097.x | accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}} When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=217}}

Based on these results, Bellugi and Klima believed that Genie had been developing as a typical right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] to the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt; They, therefore, believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result, her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they thought her language functions had lateralized there instead.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=216}}

===Interest as a case study and grant funding===
[[File:Victor of Aveyron, 1800.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|alt=A black and white print of Victor of Aveyron as a teenager from the chest up and shirtless, with his body facing forward and his face slightly turned to the left.|Victor of Aveyron c. 1800.]]
At the time of Genie's admission to Children's Hospital there was wide discussion in both lay and academic circles about the hypotheses of [[Noam Chomsky]], who had first suggested that language was [[Innateness hypothesis|innate]] to humans and distinguished humans from all other animals, and [[Eric Lenneberg]], who in 1967 hypothesized that humans have a [[critical period hypothesis|critical period]] for language acquisition and defined its end as the onset of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=26–38}} Despite the interest in these hypotheses, prior to Genie's discovery there had been no way to test them. Though ancient and medieval texts made several references to [[language deprivation experiments]] modern researchers labeled such ideas "The Forbidden Experiment", impossible to carry out for ethical reasons.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=3–7}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=216–217}} Coincidentally the [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[The Wild Child]]'', which chronicled the life of [[Victor of Aveyron]] in the years immediately after his discovery and the efforts of [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] to teach him language and integrate him into society, also premiered in the United States only a week after Genie's rescue. The movie was a major success, and further heightened public interest in cases of children subjected to extreme abuse or isolation.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=216–217}}

Prompted by this coincidence of timing, David Rigler led a team of scientists who sought and obtained a three-year grant from the NIMH to study Genie in May 1971. At the suggestion of Jean Butler, Genie's special education teacher at the hospital, they screened ''The Wild Child'' during their first meeting, and the scientists later said the film had an immediate and profound impact.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=56–58}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=216–217, 225–226}} The huge variety of suggestions for how to work with Genie made it extremely difficult for researchers to give the proposal a coherent direction. To the surprise of several scientists involved in the grant meetings, Rigler decided the primary focus of the study would be to test Chomsky and Lenneberg's hypotheses and selected UCLA linguistics professor [[Victoria Fromkin]] to head linguistic evaluation.{{efn|Lenneberg stated that he did not have any desire to study Genie and declined to participate, saying no definite conclusions could be drawn because the level of trauma associated with Genie's childhood would be impossible to discern.}}&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=52–61, 121}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=217}} The research team also planned to continue periodic evaluations of Genie's [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] in various aspects of her life. From the time of her admission to Children's Hospital researchers had tried to keep her identity concealed, and it was around this time that they adopted the pseudonym Genie for her, referencing similarities between a [[genie]] coming out of a lamp without having a childhood and Genie's sudden emergence into society past childhood.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=17}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=214}}

===Early research===
Soon after the NIMH accepted the grant proposal, in late May 1971, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Victoria Fromkin, and for the remainder of Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with Genie almost every day.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=19}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=23, 38, 86}}&lt;ref name=Contradictions&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/d901cc36-2c8d-4d54-a276-43c295288927/Readings/Genie.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170135/https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/d901cc36-2c8d-4d54-a276-43c295288927/Readings/Genie.pdf | archivedate=February 26, 2014 | deadurl=no | title=Contradictions and unanswered questions in the Genie case: a fresh look at the linguistic evidence | last=Jones | first=Peter E. | journal=Language and Communication | date=July 1995 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=261–280 | doi=10.1016/0271-5309(95)00007-D | issn=0271-5309 | oclc=427070647 | accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtiss quickly recognized Genie's powerful nonverbal communication abilities, writing that complete strangers would frequently buy something for her because they sensed she wanted it and that these gifts were always the types of objects she most enjoyed.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=92–94}} Curtiss concluded that Genie had learned a significant amount of language but that it was not yet at a usefully testable level, so she decided to dedicate the next few months to getting to know Genie and gaining her friendship. Over the following month, she and Genie very quickly bonded with each other.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=15, 24–28, 93–110}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=38–39, 86, 90}}

At around the same time Curtiss began her work, doctors reevaluated Genie on the Leiter scale and measured her on the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale]], which placed her estimated mental age between a 5- and 8-year-old with a very high degree of scatter.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; Doctors believed Genie had learned to use her [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt perception]] to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via [[Subitization|gestalt perception]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=222}} Child psychologist [[David Elkind]], who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|concrete operational stage]] of development, noting that she understood [[object permanence]] and could engage in [[Imitation#Deferred imitation|deferred imitation]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=15}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=89–94, 101}} Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=14, 23}} Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some optimism about her prognosis.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=60}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Curtiss, Susan | author2=Fromkin, Victoria A. | author3=Krashen, Stephen D. | author4=Rigler, David | author5=Rigler, Marilyn | authorlink2=Victoria Fromkin | authorlink3=Stephen Krashen | title=The linguistic development of Genie | journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] | year=1974 | pages=528–554 | volume=50 | issue=3 | doi=10.2307/412222 | issn=0097-8507 | oclc=4910013345 | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1974%20-%20The%20linguistic%20development%20of%20Genie.pdf | accessdate=May 15, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807210505/http://ling.umd.edu/~omaki/teaching/Ling240_Winter09/Curtiss1974_genie.pdf | archivedate=August 7, 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First foster home==
In June 1971, Jean Butler obtained permission to take Genie on day trips to her home in [[Country Club Park, Los Angeles]]. Near the end of that month, after one of these trips, Butler told the hospital that she (Butler) might have contracted [[rubella]], to which Genie would have been exposed. Hospital staff were reluctant to give foster custody to Butler and were very skeptical of her story, strongly suspecting she had concocted it as part of a bid to take over as Genie's guardian and primary caretaker, but decided that placing Genie in an [[Isolation ward (medicine)|isolation ward]] at the hospital could potentially be highly damaging to her social and psychological development, so they agreed to temporarily quarantine her in Butler's home.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=222}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=96}} Butler, who was childless, unmarried, and at the time living alone, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections authorities extended Genie's stay while they considered the matter.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=50, 95–96, 98–99}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=222}}

===Butler's observations===
Soon after moving in with Butler, Genie started showing the first signs of reaching [[puberty]], marking a dramatic improvement in her overall physical health and definitively putting her past Lenneberg's proposed critical period for language acquisition.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=97–98}} Butler continued to observe and document Genie's hoarding, in particular noting that Genie collected and kept dozens of containers of liquid in her room.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt; Although she could not discern the reason for Genie's intense fear of cats and dogs, after witnessing it firsthand Butler and the man she was dating—who was a retired [[University of Southern California]] professor and psychologist—tried to help her overcome it by watching episodes of the television series ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' with her and giving her a battery-powered toy dog. Butler wrote that Genie could eventually tolerate fenced dogs, but that there was no progress with cats.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=100–101}}

In her journal, Butler wrote that she had gotten Genie to stop attacking herself when angry and had taught Genie to instead express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler also claimed that, shortly after moving in with her, Genie had become noticeably more talkative and that she had made substantial progress with her language acquisition.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=100–103}} In an early August letter to Jay Shurley, she wrote that the man she was dating had also noticed and commented on the improvement in her language. Genie's incontinence gradually improved until, by the end of her stay, she was almost entirely continent.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=100–101, 151}}

===Custody dispute===
Genie's mother continued to visit Genie, and around the time Genie moved in with Butler, Genie's mother received corrective [[cataract surgery]] which restored much of her vision. During Genie's stay Butler had the man she was dating move in with her, believing that authorities would view her pending foster application more favorably if she offered a two-parent home.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–97, 101, 104–106, 136–137, 211}} However, Butler began to strenuously resist visits from the researchers, who she felt overtaxed Genie, and began disparagingly referring to them as the "Genie team", a nickname which stuck.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=222}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–99}} Butler particularly seemed to dislike James Kent and Susan Curtiss, preventing both from visiting during the latter part of Genie's stay, and also had several disagreements with Rigler, although he said their disputes were never as personal or as heated as she portrayed them.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=222}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–100}}

Researchers believed Butler had good intentions for Genie, but criticized Butler's unwillingness to work with them and thought she negatively affected Genie's care and the case study. They strongly contested Butler's claims of pushing Genie too hard, contending that she enjoyed the tests and could take breaks at will, and both Curtiss and Kent emphatically denied Butler's accusations towards them.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=187–188, 193, 199}} The research team viewed Butler as personally troubled, noting her longstanding and widely known reputation for combativeness among coworkers and superiors.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–103}} Several of the scientists, including Curtiss and Howard Hansen, recalled Butler openly stating that she hoped Genie would make her famous, and Curtiss especially remembered Butler repeatedly proclaiming her intent to be "the next [[Anne Sullivan]]".&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–97}}

In mid-August, California authorities informed Butler they had rejected her application for foster custody.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=96–106}} The extent, if any, to which Children's Hospital influenced the decision is unclear. Rigler maintained several times that despite the scientists' objections neither the hospital nor any of its staff had intervened, and said the authorities' decision surprised him.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D6103FF930A25755C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107224531/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/books/l-letters-669393.html | archivedate=November 7, 2012 | deadurl=no | title=Rigler, Letter to the Editor | publisher=The New York Times | date=June 13, 1993 | accessdate=December 21, 2009 | last=Rigler | first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=105–106}} The ''Nova'' documentary on Genie, however, states the rejection of Butler came partially on the hospital's recommendation; there is evidence many hospital authorities, including Hansen, felt Butler's ability to care for Genie was inadequate, and hospital policy forbade its staff members from becoming foster parents of its patients.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=99, 104–106}} Butler herself believed the hospital had opposed her application so Genie could be moved somewhere more conducive to research, and wrote that Genie, upon being told of the decision, was extremely upset and had said, "No, no, no."{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=99, 104–106}}

==Second foster home==
[[File:Genie_working_with_Marilyn.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A black and white frame taken from a video of Genie, who is enthusiastically smiling, taken from several feet away. It shows her from the chest up, and Genie is facing slightly to the right of the camera.|Genie working with Marilyn Rigler]]
In early August, Hansen suggested to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially balked at the idea but decided to talk it over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training as a social worker and had just completed a graduate degree in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and had previously worked in [[nursery school]]s and [[Head Start Program]]s. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=107–108, 208–213}} They ultimately decided that, if no one else would, they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a [[dual relationship]] with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=107–108}}

On the same day, Genie went back to the hospital, the Riglers had Genie transferred to their home in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]]. David Rigler said that he and Marilyn initially intended the arrangement to last for a maximum of three months, but Genie ultimately stayed with them for almost four years.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=107–108}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=226}} When Genie moved in with the Riglers, Marilyn became her teacher, David Rigler decided to take over the role of Genie's primary therapist from James Kent, and the research team immediately resumed observations and evaluations.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112, 116–117, 133–134}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=326}} The Riglers remained Genie's primary caretakers throughout this time, but with the consent of Genie's mother and her psychologists authorities designated John Miner as Genie's uncompensated legal guardian in 1972.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=133–134}}

===Relationship with her mother===
While Genie lived with the Riglers her mother usually met with her once a week at a park or restaurant, and their relationship continued to grow stronger.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=135–139}} Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be polite to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=43, 131, 135–140}} The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in [[denial]] about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=138–140}} Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=45}}

Jean Butler, who married shortly after authorities removed Genie from her house and began using her married name, Ruch, stayed in touch with Genie's mother. Although Genie's mother later recalled that most of their conversations during this time were shallow in nature, they continued to get along very well.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=139–140}} Throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers, Ruch persistently accused researchers of conducting harmful tests, deliberately forcing her mother out of her life, and misusing the available grant money, all of which the research team consistently and emphatically denied.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=138–142}} Genie's mother steadily began listening more to Ruch, and eventually came to feel the research team was marginalizing her.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=107, 138–142}}

===Research team testing and observations===

====Behavior====
Without any obvious cause, Genie's incontinence immediately resurfaced, and was especially severe for the first few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=36, 42}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–117}} In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. They also wrote that Genie was extremely frightened of their dog, and upon seeing it immediately ran and hid. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Ruch had described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for the first three months of her stay, almost always used one-word utterances.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=36, 42}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–117}} Unless she saw something which frightened her both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and she still had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=23–27, 33–36}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–117}}

Shortly after Genie moved in, Marilyn taught her to direct her frustrations outward by generally "having a fit."&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=117–118}} Because Genie sought compliments on her appearance Marilyn began to paint Genie's fingernails and told her she did not look good when she scratched herself, and when situations came up which especially upset Genie Marilyn tried to verbally de-escalate her.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=40}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=117–118}} Genie gradually gained more control over her responses and with prompting could verbally express frustration, although she never entirely ceased to have tantrums or engage in self-harm, and on occasion could indicate her level of anger; depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated, she either vigorously shook one finger or loosely waved her hand.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=230–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=113, 117–119, 151}}

Although the scientists did not yet know the reason for Genie's fear of cats and dogs the Riglers used their puppy in an effort to acclimate her, and after approximately two weeks she entirely overcame her fear of their dog but continued to be extremely afraid of unfamiliar cats and dogs. Marilyn worked with Genie to help overcome her ongoing difficulty with chewing and swallowing, which took approximately four months. She also tried to help Genie become more attuned to her body's sensations, and in late 1973 Curtiss recorded the first instance of Genie showing sensitivity to temperature.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=25, 28, 40}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=113, 117–119}} Although Genie deliberately did the least she possibly could in both Curtiss' and the Riglers' estimation, throughout her stay her physical health substantially improved.&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=140}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=151}}

At first, Genie usually did not listen to anyone unless someone directly addressed her or if Curtiss played classical music on the piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=23–27, 33–36}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–117}} In an effort to get Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that, she paid attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with people and became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she heard someone.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27–28, 33, 232–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–116}} Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response to somebody.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27–28, 232–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=112–115}}

After several months living with the Riglers, Genie's behavior and [[social skills]] improved to the point that she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for intellectually disabled children her age.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=146}} The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=30}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=127}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=146}} She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation she had almost entirely ceased it by the end of her stay.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=24–25}} In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie [[sharing|shared]] something with her, and while she continued to take things from other people her responses clearly indicated that she knew she was not supposed to.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=35–44, 230–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=122–126, 149}}

During the time Genie lived with the Riglers, everyone who worked with her reported that her mood significantly improved and she was clearly content with her life.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=117–118, 151–156}} As late as June 1975, David Rigler wrote that Genie continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing, and Curtiss' contemporaneous accounts expressed some optimism about Genie's social development.&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=230–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=122–126}} Nonetheless, even by mid-1975 most social interactions with her remained abnormal in quality. The scientists wrote that, while her overall demeanor and interactions with others had significantly improved, many aspects of her behavior remained characteristic of an unsocialized person.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27–28, 35–44, 230–233}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=115–117}}

====Language====
{{Main|Linguistic development of Genie}}
Curtiss began thorough, active testing of Genie's language in October 1971, when she and Fromkin decided that her linguistic abilities were sufficient to yield usable results. Linguists designed their tests to measure both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of [[grammar]], including [[syntax]], [[phonology]], and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. They also continued to observe her in everyday conversations to gauge what [[pragmatics]] of language she acquired. The research team considered her language acquisition to be a substantial part of their larger goal of helping her to integrate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could learn on her own, out of a sense of obligation they sometimes stepped in to assist her.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=145–151}}

Throughout linguists' testing, the size of Genie's vocabulary and the speed with which she expanded it continued to outstrip all anticipations. By mid-1975 she could accurately name most objects she encountered, and clearly knew more words than she regularly used.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=182, 185–186}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=145–151}} By contrast, Genie had far more difficulty with learning and using basic grammar. She clearly mastered certain principles of grammar, and her receptive comprehension consistently remained significantly ahead of her production, but the rate of her grammar acquisition was far slower than normal and resulted in an unusually large disparity between her vocabulary and grammar.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=150–153}} In everyday conversations Genie typically spoke only in short utterances and inconsistently used what grammar she knew, although her use of grammar remained significantly better in imitation, and her conversational competence markedly improved during her stay but remained very low, which the scientists found unsurprising and suggested was evidence that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from knowing language.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=30, 162, 231–234}}

In many cases, the scientists used Genie's language development to help them gauge her overall psychological state. For instance, Genie consistently [[Pronoun reversal|confused the pronouns ''you'' and ''me'']], often saying, "Mama love you" while pointing to herself, which Curtiss attributed to a manifestation of Genie's inability to distinguish who she was from who someone else was.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=121–122}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=124}} The scientists especially noted that she often understood conceptual information even if she lacked the grammar to express it, which they wrote demonstrated that she had greater cognitive abilities than most children in congruous phases of language acquisition.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=149}} In some instances, learning a new aspect of language played a direct role in furthering her development. At the time Genie learned to say "May I have [example]" as a ritual phrase she was also learning how to use money, and Curtiss wrote that this phrase gave Genie the ability to ask for payment and fueled her desire to make money, causing her to take a more active role in performing activities which would lead to a reward.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=30}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=127–130}}

At the start of testing Genie's voice was still extremely high-pitched and soft, which linguists believed accounted for some of her abnormal expressive language, and the scientists worked very hard to improve it.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=52, 62, 83–87}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} Her voice gradually became moderately lower and louder, although it remained unusually high and soft, and she began to better articulate words. Despite this she consistently deleted or substituted sounds, making her extremely difficult to understand. The scientists believed Genie was often unaware of her pronunciation, but on other occasions she produced [[Haplology|haplologies]] which were clearly intentional and would only speak more clearly if firmly, explicitly requested to; Curtiss attributed the latter to Genie trying to say as little as possible and still be understood.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=29, 67, 180, 230–234}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Eventually Curtiss and Marilyn convinced Genie to stop attempting her most extreme haplologies, but she continued to delete sounds when possible, causing linguists following the case to refer to Genie as "the Great Abbreviator".{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=29, 52, 62, 83–87}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=115–116}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}}

Papers contemporaneous with the case study indicated that Genie was learning new vocabulary and grammar throughout her entire stay with the Riglers, and were optimistic about her potential to varying degrees.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Nonetheless, even by mid-1975, there were still many pieces of language which she had not acquired. Furthermore, although she could understand and produce longer utterances, she still primarily spoke in short phrases such as "Ball belong hospital".&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=230–233}} Despite the clear increase in Genie's conversational competence, the scientists wrote that it remained very low compared to normal people. Curtiss and Fromkin ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, she was unable to fully acquire a language.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=208–209, 230–234}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;

===Recalling past events===
Sometime during early to mid-1972 the Riglers overheard Genie saying, "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." to herself, demonstrating that she could talk about her life before she had started to learn language.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=223}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=124–125, 127–130}} During the rest of her stay with the Riglers she would constantly repeat, "Father hit" to herself, and before the Riglers worked with Genie to understand the concept of [[death]] she often asked them where her father was, afraid that he would come to get her.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=124–125, 127–130}} Although she did not speak to others about her childhood often she gave researchers valuable new information when she did, and the scientists tried to get Genie to tell them as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=186}} As she learned more language, she gradually began to speak about her father and his treatment of her in greater detail.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=127–130}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Father hit arm. Big wood. Genie cry&amp;nbsp; ... Not spit. Father. Hit face—spit. Father hit big stick. Father is angry. Father hit Genie big stick. Father take piece wood hit. Cry. Father make me cry. Father is dead.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=223}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Nonverbal communication====
In contrast to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words as she said them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34, 37–38, 61}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=117, 124–125}} Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=vi, 37–38, 267, 272}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=128}} In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=124, 128}} Sometime during mid-1972, Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them that her husband had acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=25}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=128, 130}}

Throughout Genie's stay the scientists saw how frequently and effectively she used her nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=92–94, 117, 125}} David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed a father and a young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=92–94, 117, 125}} To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38, 51, 171}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=117, 125, 128–130}}

===Continued brain exams===

====Language tests====
Starting in the fall of 1971, under the direction of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and [[Stephen Krashen]]—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—linguists continued to administer regular dichotic listening tests to Genie until 1973. Their results consistently corroborated the initial findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima.&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/PDF/1978/GM_1978.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612154805/http://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/PDF/1978/GM_1978.pdf | archivedate=June 12, 2010 | title=A Study in Human Capacities | last=Goldin-Meadow | first=Susan | authorlink=Susan Goldin-Meadow | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=May 1978 | volume=200 | issue=4342 | doi=10.1126/science.200.4342.649 | issn=0036-8075 | oclc=4633223637 | pages=649–651 | accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–154}} Researchers therefore concluded that Genie was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain, and definitively ruled out the possibility that Genie's language lateralization was only reversed.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–154}} Due to the lack of physiological problems with Genie's left hemisphere, they believed abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated came from her atrophied language center—blocked all language reception in her right ear but did not obstruct non-language sounds.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–155}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=217–218}}

Linguists also administered several brain exams specifically geared towards measuring Genie's language comprehension. On one such test, she had no difficulty giving the correct meaning of sentences containing familiar [[homophone]]s, demonstrating that her receptive comprehension was significantly better than her expressive language. Genie also did very well at identifying [[rhyme]]s, both tasks that adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients had previously been recorded performing well on.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=149–152}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=56, 212, 220–221}} During these tests an EEG consistently picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere of her brain than from those over the normal locations of the [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], and found especially high involvement from her right [[prefrontal cortex|anterior cerebral cortex]], lending further support to the researchers' conclusion that Genie was using her right hemisphere to acquire language.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=218–221}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–155}}

====Additional tests====
Curtiss, Fromkin, and Krashen continued to measure Genie's mental age through a variety of measures, and she consistently showed an extremely high degree of scatter. She measured significantly higher on tests which did not require language, such as the Leiter Scale, than on tests with any kind of language component, such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]].{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} In addition, throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers, they tested a variety of her brain functions and her performance on different tasks. For these they primarily used [[tachistoscope|tachistoscopic]] tests, and during 1974 and 1975 they also gave her a series of [[evoked potential|evoked response]] tests.&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=220}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–155}}

As early as 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the scientists tested her on and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability to piece together objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial awareness]] tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded.&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 220–228}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–155}} Similarly, on a [[Mooney Face Test]] in May 1975 she had the highest score in medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the 95th percentile for adults.{{efn|As all of Genie's incorrect answers on the Mooney Face Test were pictures of either masks or caricatures of faces, Curtiss thought Genie may not have understood that she was only supposed to select the realistic looking faces and therefore may have been able to score even higher.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=222–224}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=154–155}} On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better than other people in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for [[stereognosis]] at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dissociations between language and cognition: cases and implications | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1981%20-%20Dissociations%20between%20language%20and%20cognition.pdf | last=Curtiss | first=Susan | journal=[[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | year=1981 | volume=11 | issue=1 | doi=10.1007/BF01531338 | issn=0162-3257 | oclc=114861365 | pmid=6927695 | pages=15–30 | accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to be able to recognize the location she was in and was good at getting from one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;

Genie's performance on these tests led the scientists to believe that her brain had lateralized and that her right hemisphere had undergone specialization. Because Genie's performance was so high on such a wide variety of tasks predominantly utilizing the right hemisphere of her brain, they concluded her exceptional abilities extended to typical right-hemisphere functions in general and were not specific to any individual task.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt; They attributed her extreme right hemisphere dominance to the fact that what very little cognitive stimulation she did receive was almost entirely visual and tactile. While even this had been extremely minimal it had been enough to commence lateralization in her right hemisphere, and the severe imbalance in stimulation caused her right hemisphere to become extraordinarily developed.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=220–224}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=154–155}}

By contrast, Genie performed significantly below average and showed much slower progress on all tests measuring predominantly left-hemisphere tasks. Stephen Krashen wrote that by 2 years after the first examinations on her mental age Genie's scores on left-hemisphere tasks consistently fell into the 2{{1/2}}- to 3-year-old range, only showing an improvement of 1{{1/2}} years.&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt; On sequential order tests she consistently scored well below average for someone with a fully intact brain, although she did somewhat better on visual than on auditory tests.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 227–228}} The scientists especially noted that she did not start to [[counting|count]] until late 1972, and then only in an extremely deliberate and laborious manner.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–155}} In January 1972 the scientists measured her in the 50th percentile for an 8{{1/2}}- to 9-year-old on [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]], although they noted she was outside of the age range of the test's design.{{efn|Since she did very well on some individual parts of the test, and because previous results had shown indications of utilizing both hemispheres, Curtiss believed Genie could have used her gestalt perception for some elements and was forced to use her analytic skills on others.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=230}} Similarly, when the scientists administered [[Knox Cubes]] tests in 1973 and 1975 Genie's score improved from the level of a 6-year-old to a 7{{1/2}}-year-old, more rapid than her progress with language but significantly slower than that of right hemisphere tasks.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=225–228}}

There were a few primarily right hemisphere tasks Genie did not perform well on. On one memory for design test, she scored at a "borderline" level in October 1975, although she did not make the mistakes typical of patients with brain damage. In addition, on a [[Benton Visual Retention Test]] and an associated [[Face perception|facial recognition]] test Genie's scores were far lower than any average scores for people without brain damage.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 227–228}} Although these contrasted with observations of Genie in everyday situations, researchers wrote that they anticipated these results.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=126}} Curtiss' explanation was that these tasks likely require use of both hemispheres, noting that previous results on the memory for design test found a negative impact from abnormal brain function in either hemisphere and that these would, therefore, be very difficult for Genie since she exclusively used her right hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 227–228}}

==Loss of funding and research interest==
On several occasions during the course of the case study, the NIMH voiced misgivings about the lack of scientific data researchers generated from the case study and the disorganized state of project records. Outside of the linguistics aspect of research David Rigler did not clearly define any parameters for the scope of the study, and both the extremely high volume and incoherence of the research team's data left the scientists unable to determine the importance of much of the information they collected.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=140–141}} After the initial grant and a one-year extension Rigler proposed an additional three-year extension, and the NIMH's grants committee acknowledged that the study had clearly benefited Genie but concluded that the research team had not adequately addressed their concerns. In a unanimous decision, the committee denied the extension request, cutting off further funding.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=144–145, 149–150}}

==Early adulthood==
In 1975, when Genie turned 18, her mother stated that she wished to care for her, and in mid-1975 the Riglers decided to end their foster parenting and agreed to let Genie move back in with her mother at her childhood home.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=149–150}} John Miner remained Genie's legal guardian and the Riglers offered to continue assisting with Genie's care, and despite the NIMH grant ending Curtiss continued to conduct regular testing and observations.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=144–145, 155}} While living together Genie's mother found many of Genie's behaviors, especially her lack of self-control, very distressing, and after a few months the task of caring for Genie by herself quickly overwhelmed her. She then contacted the [[California Health and Human Services Agency|California Department of Health]] to find care for Genie, which David Rigler said she did without his or Marilyn's knowledge, and in the latter part of 1975 authorities transferred Genie to the first of what would become a succession of foster homes.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=149–155}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}}

The environment in Genie's new placement was extremely rigid and gave her far less access to her favorite objects and activities, and her caretakers rarely allowed her mother to visit. Soon after she moved in they began to subject her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in both incontinence and constipation resurfacing and causing her to revert to her [[coping mechanism]] of silence.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=150–155}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}} The incident with the strongest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting and told her that if she did it again they would never let her see her mother, making her terrified of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As a result, she was extremely frightened of eating or speaking, and she became extremely withdrawn and almost exclusively relied on sign language for communication.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=150–155}} During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have regular contact with her, continuing to conduct weekly meetings to continue her testing, and she noted the extreme deterioration in Genie's condition. She quickly started petitioning to have Genie taken out of the home, but Curtiss said that both she and social services had a difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after several months. In late April 1977, with assistance from David Rigler, Miner removed her from this location.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=153–155}}

Because of Genie's previous treatment Miner and David Rigler arranged for her to stay at Children's Hospital for two weeks, where her condition moderately improved.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=154}} Authorities then placed Genie in another foster home, where she did fairly well, but in mid-December 1977 the arrangement very suddenly ended. Through the end of that month into early January Genie lived in a temporary setting, after which authorities put her in another foster home.&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=155–159}} During this time Curtiss wrote to Miner that Genie did not understand the reasons she was moving and believed it was her fault for not being a good enough person, and said the frequency with which her living arrangements changed further traumatized her and caused continued developmental regression.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=155–159}}

===Lawsuit===
In 1976 Curtiss finished and presented her dissertation, entitled ''Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day "Wild Child"'', and [[Academic Press]] published it the following year.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}} Prior to this time, Genie's mother had reportedly thought of Genie and Curtiss as friends, but in early 1978 she wrote that she was very offended at the title and some of the contents of Curtiss' dissertation. She decided to sue Children's Hospital, her therapists, their supervisors, and several of the researchers, including Curtiss, Rigler, James Kent, and Howard Hansen.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=184–187, 190–191}} Privately she disputed some details of the family's treatment during Genie's childhood, but her official complaint did not; instead she asserted a violation of patient confidentiality, and accused the research team of giving testing priority over Genie's welfare, invading Genie's privacy, and severely overworking Genie.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=184–186}}

Regional media immediately picked up the lawsuit, and members of the research team were shocked when they found out about it. All of the scientists named in the suit were adamant that they never coerced Genie, maintaining that Genie's mother and her lawyers grossly exaggerated the length and nature of their testing, and denied any breach of confidentiality.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=184–191, 199}} While David Rigler was giving his [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] he discovered that Jean Butler Ruch had goaded Genie's mother into suing, and in an interview several years later the lawyers who worked with Genie's mother confirmed Ruch heavily influenced the actions of Genie's mother throughout the course of the lawsuit.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=187–189}} According to author [[Russ Rymer]], the suit was settled in 1984.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=188–194}} However, in 1993 David Rigler wrote, "[T]he case never came to trial. It was dismissed by the [[California superior courts|Superior Court of the State of California]] '[[Prejudice (legal procedure)|with prejudice]],' meaning that because it was without substance it can never again be refiled."&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;

==Post-1977==
Susan Curtiss said that in late December 1977 she had been asked if she could be Genie's legal guardian but that, after she met with Genie on January 3, 1978, Genie's mother suddenly stopped allowing her and the rest of the research team to see Genie again, immediately ending all testing and observations.&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=192–194}} In early 1978 authorities discovered that, after Genie turned 18, John Miner had failed to update his status as Genie's legal guardian as a minor to that of her legal guardian as an adult incapable of caring for herself. Without consulting Miner, on March 30 of that year authorities officially transferred guardianship to her mother, who subsequently forbade all of the scientists except Jay Shurley from seeing her or Genie.&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=185–194, 208–210}}  Jean Butler Ruch remained in contact with Genie's mother and continued to spread negative rumors about Genie's condition, especially targeting Curtiss, until 1986, when a [[stroke]] left Ruch with aphasia. Ruch died in 1988 following another stroke.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=191, 200–202}}

From January 1978 until the early 1990s Genie moved through a series of at least four additional foster homes and institutions, some of which subjected her to extreme physical abuse and harassment.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=208–213}} Shurley saw her at her 27th birthday party in 1984, and again two years later, and in an interview years later he said that both times she was very depressed and uncommunicative.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=208–213}} In 1992, Curtiss told Russ Rymer that the only two updates she had heard on Genie indicated she barely spoke and was depressed and withdrawn. When Rymer published a two-part magazine article on Genie in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in April of that year he wrote that she lived in an institution and only saw her mother one weekend every month, as did the first edition of his 1993 book, entitled ''Genie: A Scientific Tragedy''.{{efn|Also published as ''Genie: An Abused Child's Flight From Silence'' and ''Genie: Escape From A Silent Childhood''.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/classes/2007_fall/3220_001/readings/Rymer,%20R.%20(1992)%20Part%20II.pdf | accessdate=May 9, 2013 | title=II-A Silent Childhood | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308072651/http://www.psych.utah.edu/classes/2007_fall/3220_001/readings/Rymer%2C%20R.%20%281992%29%20Part%20II.pdf | archivedate=March 8, 2012 | deadurl=yes | last=Rymer | first=Russ | authorlink=Russ Rymer | journal=The New Yorker | date=April 20, 1992 | pages=43–77 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|p=219}} The afterword of the 1994 edition of Rymer's book on Genie, written in November 1993, detailed conversations he had with Genie's mother—who had since gone blind again due to [[glaucoma]]—just before and after the publication of his magazine articles. At that time she told him that Genie had recently moved into a more supportive foster home which permitted regular visits, and said that Genie was happy and, although hard to understand, was significantly more verbal.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=228–231}}

Several people who worked with Genie, including Curtiss and James Kent, harshly criticized Rymer's works.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; A late April 1993 [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] review of Rymer's book from scientific reporter [[Natalie Angier]], which took an extremely negative view of the research team, prompted David Rigler to write his first public account of his involvement in Genie's case.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angier/&gt; In his letter to the ''Times'', published in mid-June 1993, Rigler wrote that Genie was doing well in a small, private facility where her mother regularly visited her.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Angier&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/stopit-she-said-nomore.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228024416/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/stopit-she-said-nomore.html| archivedate=December 28, 2009| deadurl=no| title='Stopit!'

Genie's is one of the best-known case studies of language acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development outside of studies on deaf children.&lt;ref name=Waltz/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Leiber1997&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=leiber | accessdate=September 1, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323092817/http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=leiber | archivedate=March 23, 2010 | deadurl=yes | title=Nature's Experiments, Society's Closures | last=Leiber | first=Justin | authorlink=Justin Leiber | journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour | date=June–September 1977 | volume=27 | issue=2–3 | pages=325–343 | doi=10.1111/1468-5914.00041 | issn=0021-8308 | oclc=5152679776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Curtiss argued that, even if humans possess the innate ability to acquire language, Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=154}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt; Since Genie never fully acquired grammar, Curtiss submitted that Genie provided evidence for a weaker variation of the critical period hypothesis.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=208–209, 234}} Genie's nonverbal skills were exceptionally good, which demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally different from language.{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|p=428}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}} Because Genie's language acquisition occurred in the right hemisphere of her brain, its course also aided linguists in refining existing hypotheses on the capacity for right-hemisphere language acquisition in people after the critical period.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–153}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}}

Since the publication of Curtiss' findings, her arguments have become widely accepted in the field of linguistics. Many linguistics books have used Genie's case study as an example to illustrate principles of language acquisition, frequently citing it as support of Chomsky's hypothesis of language being innate to humans and of a modified version of Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis, and her work with Genie provided the impetus for several additional case studies.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|pp=115–118}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}} In addition, the disparity between Curtiss' pre and post-1977 analyses of Genie's language has sparked debate among other linguists regarding how much grammar Genie acquired and whether she could have acquired more. To date, no one directly involved in Genie's case has responded to this controversy.&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt;{{sfn|Sampson|2005|pp=}}&lt;ref name=deGroot&gt;* {{Citation | title=Language and Cognition in Bilinguals and Multilinguals: An Introduction | publisher=Psychology Press | last=de Groot | first=Annette M. B. | year=2011 | location=New York, NY | oclc=701718082 | isbn=978-0-203-84122-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7sp5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Genie's brain aided scientists in refining several existing hypotheses regarding brain lateralization, especially its effect on language development. In particular, the disparity between Genie's linguistic abilities and her competence in other aspects of human development strongly suggested there was a separation of cognition and language acquisition, a new concept at the time.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}} The unevenness of her ability to learn right-hemisphere versus left-hemisphere tasks gave the scientists valuable information about the manner in which certain brain functions develop, as well as the way lateralization affects a person's ability to improve upon them.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lateralization/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 227–228}} Genie's difficulty with certain tasks which had been described as predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere also gave neuroscientists more insight into the processes controlling these functions.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214, 227–228}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;

===Comparisons to other cases===
In several of their publications, the scientists acknowledged the influence that Jean Marc Gaspard Itard's study of Victor of Aveyron had on their research and testing.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=xi–xii}} Genie's development has also influenced perceptions of Victor and the case study on him.&lt;ref name=Leiber1997/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=221–226}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=209–215}} Both researchers working with Genie and outside writers noted the influence of the historical reports of language deprivation experiments, including accounts of the language deprivation experiments of [[Psamtik I]], [[King James IV of Scotland]], and Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=3–7}} The two ABC News stories on Genie compared her case to the [[Fritzl case]], noting the similarities between Genie's father and Josef Fritzl and the mental states of Genie and Fritzl's captive three grandchildren upon entering into society.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCbro/&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilyPast/&gt; The research team and outside scientists also contrasted Genie with a case in the 1950s of a girl, known by the name Isabella, whose first exposure to anyone besides her deaf non-speaking mother came at the age of 6 but who successfully acquired language and developed fully normal social skills within a year.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=deGroot/&gt;

===Ethical dispute===
During the grant meetings in May 1971 some of the scientists, including Jay Shurley and David Elkind, voiced concern that the prevailing methods of research pursued scientific study at the expense of Genie's well-being and could cause love and attention to be contingent on her language acquisition.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=59, 188, 200–204}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}} Shurley said that there was strong disagreement during the initial grant meetings and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and bitter, especially noting that the later meetings excluded many of the people who had worked most closely with Genie.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=46–47, 59, 62–63}} After May 1971 Elkind declined to participate in the study further, despite having personally known both the Riglers for several years, and in an interview years later he cited a desire not to be involved in a case which, in his view, prioritized scientific research over Genie's care.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=199–201}} While Shurley acknowledged that the scientists at the center of the case were in a completely unprecedented situation, he also decided to minimize his involvement over these concerns and felt that by the conclusion of the study all of the scientists, including himself, had been guilty to varying degrees of using Genie as an object and putting themselves and their goals ahead of her and her mother's best interests.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=59, 188, 200–204, 211–213}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=223–226}}

Kent, Howard Hansen, the Riglers, and Curtiss readily acknowledged that it had been extremely difficult to determine the course of the study, but maintained that all disputes during the meetings were impersonal and typical of scientific discourse.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt; After the case study ended David Rigler said that, despite his disagreements with Shurley, Shurley's early recommendations were the only useful advice he received on handling Genie and he attempted to follow them as much as possible.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=46–47, 198–199, 210–212}}&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt; The Riglers and Curtiss further stated that everyone involved in Genie's life, with the exception of Jean Butler Ruch, worked together as best they could to rehabilitate Genie and never fought with each other, and independently denied allegations of factionalism. Ruch never stated a motive for her actions, but members of the research team believed they were due to her anger over her foster custody rejection and her perception that Children's Hospital staff influenced the decision.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=133–137, 199–200}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=225–226}} The role of the scientists in Genie's case has become the source of debate within the scientific community.{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|p=428}}&lt;ref name=Leiber1997/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=208–247}}

Several people have also emphasized the lack of distinction between Genie's caretakers and her therapists. Shurley thought that Ruch would have been the best guardian for Genie, and felt the Riglers gave her adequate care but viewed her as a test subject first.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=121, 198–200, 202–204}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}} Russ Rymer contended that the roles of everyone involved in Genie's life became progressively clear, citing the starting point as the appointment of John Miner as legal counsel for Genie's mother, and that personal friendships prevented them from recognizing it. He argued that this interfered with providing Genie the best possible care and compromised their objectivity, which in turn contributed to the case study's lack of coherence, and both he and Harlan Lane emphasized that making David Rigler a foster parent accelerated this breakdown.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=131–136}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=225–227}} Several independent reviews of Genie's case also accused the Riglers and the other scientists of abandoning Genie after the case study concluded.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}

On several occasions, the Riglers maintained that their home had been the best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=131–136}} They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out that she had made substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leiber1997/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=192–194}} While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner went out of his way to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care.{{sfn|Rymer|1994|pp=139–144, 153–156, 187, 202–206}} Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.&lt;ref name=Leiber1997/&gt;

==Media==
Several books about feral or abused children contain chapters on Genie, and many books on linguistics and psychology also discuss Genie's case at length.{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|pp=428–429}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=208–247}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|pp=115–130}} In 1994, ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' made a documentary about Genie titled ''Secret of the Wild Child'', based on Russ Rymer's book, and narrated by [[Stacy Keach]].{{efn|Broadcast as ''Genie: A Deprived Child'' in the United Kingdom.}} It won multiple Emmy Awards.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/about/tvaw.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126191728/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/about/tvaw.html | archivedate=January 26, 2013 | deadurl=no | title=Broadcast Awards by Date | publisher=NOVA | date=July 2007 | accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists' footage ''Nova'' used from the case study archives had significantly deteriorated, and required restoration for use in the documentary.&lt;ref name=Contradictions/&gt; In 2002, an episode of the television series ''[[Body Shock]]'' on feral children entitled "Wild Child" included a segment on Genie.{{efn|Broadcast as ''Wild Child: The Story of Feral Children'' in the United States.}}&lt;ref name=FeralChildren&gt;{{cite episode | title=Wild Child | series=[[Body Shock]] | credits=Weston, Jonah (director/producer) | network=[[Channel 4]] | location=London, U.

The award-winning [[independent film]] ''[[Mockingbird Don't Sing]]'', released in 2001, is about Genie's case primarily from the perspective of Susan Curtiss. For legal reasons, all of the names in the film were changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.film-festival.org/awardswin01.php | title=2001 Film Festival Award Winners | publisher=[[Rhode Island International Film Festival]] | date=August 20, 2001 | accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gio Batta Gori has a doctorate in biological sciences and a master's degree in [[public health]]. Between 1968 and 1980, he was a scientist and senior official at the United States' [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), where he specialized in [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]] and [[nutrition]]. He held several positions, including Deputy Director of the Division of Cancer Causes and Prevention; Acting Associate Director, Carcinogenesis Program; Director of the Diet, Nutrition and Cancer Program and Director of the Smoking and Health Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/frh21e00 |title=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library: DR.

==Gori and the tobacco industry==
In 1980 Gori became Vice President of the [[Franklin Institute Policy Analysis Center]] (FIPAC), a consulting firm funded initially by a $400,000 grant from the [[Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation]] (B&amp;W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/wpw70f00 |title=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library: The Franklin Institute Policy Analysis C...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">The '''Great Plague of 1738''' was an outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]] between 1738–1740 that affected areas in the modern nations of [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], and [[Austria]]. Although no exact figure is available, the epidemic likely killed over 50,000 people.

In February 1738 the plague hit the [[Banat]] region, having been spread there by the Imperial Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.ro/cont/20c.htm|title=history XVIII|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1740 Hungarian Diet, the Great Plague claimed 36,000 lives.&lt;ref name="Demographic Changes"&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/280.html Demographic Changes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Southeastern Transylvania may have been the hardest area hit. Over the following eight years, the plague killed a sixth of the population of [[Timişoara]]. Timişoara's Monument of the Holy Trinity in Piaţa Unirii is dedicated to the plague's victims. The plague would return to hit the city again in 1762–1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thekonst.net/en/propaganda/226|title=thekonst.net :: propaganda. weekly notes by konst :: the cradle of Romanian Revol..|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cities in the region were also stricken. Between October 1737 and April 1738, 111 deaths were reported in [[Zărneşti]], and 70 in [[Codlea]].&lt;ref name="Demographic Changes"/&gt; More than 10% of the population of [[Cluj-Napoca]] was reported to have been killed by the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clujonline.com/history/history.htm|title=CLUJ-NAPOCA, The Treasure City of Transylvania, Romania - History|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease's spread extended to the [[Adriatic]]. It made its way to the island of [[Brač]] in modern-day Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatians.com/sumartin_island_of_brac.htm|title=www.croatians.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer, the [[Serbia]]n region of Grad [[Zrenjanin]] was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zrenjanin.org.rs/ogradu/ogradu/eistorija.htm History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of fish are claimed to produce hallucinogenic effects when consumed.  For example, ''[[Sarpa salpa]]'', a species of [[sea bream]], is commonly claimed to be hallucinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahalo.com/sarpa-salpa/ Sarpa Salpa] ''[[Mahalo]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2017}} These widely distributed [[coastal fish]] are normally found in the Mediterranean and around Spain, and along the west and south coasts of Africa.&lt;ref name=FBsalpa /&gt; Occasionally they are found in British waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/5318202/Fish-that-triggers-hallucinations-found-off-British-coast.html Fish that triggers hallucinations found off British coast] ''The Telegraph'', 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}} They may induce hallucinogenic effects that are purportedly [[LSD]]-like if eaten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/13/hallucination-fish-cornwall 'Hallucination' fish netted in Channel] ''The Guardian'', 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, two men who apparently ate the fish experienced hallucinations lasting for several days.&lt;ref name=deHaro2006&gt;

The active agent(s) that cause hallucinations in humans, and the origin of these agents, are not clear. Some authors think they could come from toxins associated with [[macroalgae]] that accumulate in the flesh of the fish. Toxins from the [[green algae]] ''[[Caulerpa prolifera]]'' in the Mediterranean Sea appear to be implicated,&lt;ref name=deHaro1998 /&gt; as is the [[seagrass]] ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]''.&lt;ref name=Bellassoued2012&gt;Bellassoued K, A Hamza, A Abdelmouleh, FA Makni, JV Pelt and A Elfeki (2012) [http://wflpublisher.net/download/journal-content/contents-april-2012issue%202.pdf "Toxicity assessment of dreamfish ''Sarpa salpa'' from the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia, Eastern Mediterranean Sea)"] ''Journal of Food, Agriculture and Environment'', '''10''' (2): 1308–1313.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[herbivore]]s eat seagrass leaves they ingest algal [[epiphyte]]s and toxic [[dinoflagellate]]s that live on the seagrass leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Kitting CL, Fry B and Morgan MD (1984) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00379006#page-1 "Detection of inconspicuous epiphytic algae supporting food webs in seagrass meadows"] ''Oecologia'', '''62''' :145–149.&lt;/ref&gt; The German anthropologist [[Christian Rätsch]] thinks that dreamfish might contain the hallucinogen [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name=Pickover9&gt;[[Clifford A.

==Ichthyoallyeinotoxism==
{{main|Ichthyoallyeinotoxism}}

[[Ichthyoallyeinotoxism]], or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, is a clinical syndrome that refers to a hallucinogenic [[inebriation]] of a distressing nature that can arise from consuming hallucinogenic fish. It is characterised by "psychologic disturbances of hallucination and depression. Gastrointestinal disturbance may occur".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/Meetings/Meetings_on_Ciguatera/Seminar_Ichthyosarcotoxism_68/Report.pdf  Report of the Seminar on Ichthyosarcotoxism] Papeete 1968, ''South Pacific Commission''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ichthyoallyeinotoxism is a kind of ichthysarcotoxism (fish flesh poisoning) responsible of an unusual clinical feature: it is the unique case of central nervous system [[wikt:ichthyotoxicity|ichthyotoxicity]]. The most frequent signs are dizziness, loss of co-ordination and hallucinations."&lt;ref name=deHaro1998&gt;de Haro, L., Prost, N., Arditti, J., David, J. M., &amp; Jouglard, J. (1998) [http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-8bca58ea-fd50-38a1-b9b4-6f1dc88725e9 "Ichthyoallyeinotoxism: a rare pathology"] ''Toxicon'', '''36''' (12): 1738–1739.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ichthyoallyeinotoxism may result from eating the flesh or the head of the fish where the poison is reputedly concentrated. This biotoxication is sporadic and unpredictable in its occurrence. The poison affects primarily the central nervous system. The symptoms may develop within a few minutes to 2 hours and persist for 24 hours or longer. Symptoms are dizziness, loss of equilibrium, lack of motor coordination, hallucinations and mental depression. A common complaint of the victim is that "someone is sitting on my chest", or there is a sensation of a tight construction around the chest. The conviction that he is going to die, or some other frightening phantasy, is a characteristic part of the clinical picture. Other complaints consist of itching, burning of the throat, muscular weakness and abdominal distress. No fatalities have been reported, and in comparison with other forms of ichthyosarcotoxism, hallucinogenic fish poisoning is relatively mild... Ordinary cooking procedures do not destroy the poison.&lt;ref&gt;R Bagnis R, F Berglund, PS Elias, GJ van Esch, BW Halstead and K Kojima (1970) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427509/pdf/bullwho00212-0080.pdf "Problems of Toxicants in Marine Food Products: 1. Marine biotoxins"] ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', '''42''': 69–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psychedelic fish==
Hallucinogenic fish can be contrasted with [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] fish. Psychedelic fish do not produce hallucinations if eaten, but look as if they were the product of a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] hallucination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090226-psychedelic-fish-picture-ap.html "Psychedelic" fish picture: New Species Bounces on Reef] ''National Geographic'', 25 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/content.php?sid=3890 The Psychedelic mandarin] ''Practical fishkeeping'', 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TGvVsq42Lt8C&amp;pg=PT13 ''Coral Reef Protection Implementation Plan''] Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|9781428911260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health care efficiency''' is a comparison of delivery system outputs, such as physician visits, [[relative value unit]]s, or [[Outcomes research|health outcomes]], with inputs like cost, time, or material. [[Efficiency]] can be reported then as a ratio of outputs to inputs or a comparison to optimal [[productivity]] using [[stochastic frontier analysis]] or [[data envelopment analysis]].

One difficulty in creating a generalized efficiency measure is comparability of outputs. For example, if hospital A discharges 100 people at an average cost of $8000, while hospital B discharges 100 at $7000, the presumption may be that B is more efficient, but hospital B may be discharging patients with poorer health that will require [[Hospital readmission|readmission]] and net higher costs to treat.

== Measures of efficiency ==

=== Bloomberg Health-Care Efficiency Index ===

The Bloomberg index uses weighted metrics including [[life expectancy]] along with relative and absolute health expenditures.  In 2016 [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] ranked [[Hong Kong]] the nation with the most efficient [[health care]].  The US was 50th on the list of 55.&lt;ref name="Du 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Du | first=Lisa | title=U.S. Health-Care System Ranks as One of the Least-Efficient | website=Bloomberg Quint | date=2016-09-29 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/u-s-health-care-system-ranks-as-one-of-the-least-efficient | access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism  ===

The Bloomberg Health-Care Efficiency Index &lt;ref&gt; This criticism is based on the 2014 Bloomberg Health-Care Efficiency Index | url= http://www.ospedalesicuro.eu/attachments/article/337/CLASSIFICA%20BLOOMBERG%20rankings%202014%20su%20SSN.pdf | access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that the paramount benchmark in assessing a health-care system is life expectancy. It also postulates that the cost of health-care systems is inversely proportional to their efficiency (the lower the cost, the higher the efficiency), taking for granted that efficiency implies effectiveness, as it should be according to the dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary, Fifth Edition, 2011: 1) Efficiency: The quality or property of being efficient. 2) Efficient: Acting or producing effectively with a minimum of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. &lt;/ref&gt; That is oversimplistic and misleading.

The raison d'être of a health-care system is to provide as highly as possible effective health care. Effective health care does not come cheap. State-of-the-art health equipment cannot be acquired and maintained at a discount, high qualified health personnel cannot be hired for a song, top-level medical treatment can be very expensive, first-class health facilities cannot be built and kept up with little money.

By giving crucial importance to the low costs of health-care systems, Bloomberg’s Index disregards true effectiveness. What is more, the life expectancy measure it so heavily relies upon is hardly a stringent criterion for assessing the efficiency of  health-care systems. 

First of all, life expectancies are mainly linked to living conditions. Fairly good living conditions (the very basic goal of any public health effort barely worthy of the name) bring about fairly high life expectancies even where health-care systems are skeletal.&lt;ref&gt;Thailand, for example, not a highly developed country, has an extremely low health-care cost (just 215 $ per capita, 26 times less than the very highly developed Netherlands), but its life expectancy is a not so low 74.2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, given that Bloomberg ranks only countries whose life expectancy is at least 70 years, and that the highest life expectance is 83.5 years, very important differences can easily be overlooked. For instance, there might seem to be little deviation between Libya’s 75.2 years and Denmark’s 80.1 years (a mere 6.6%  advantage for Denmark), but it is not so. If we take 70 as the minimum and 83.5 as the maximum, what we must consider is the 13.5 gap. Under this conditions, Libya scores 5.2/13.5, which is 0.385, while Denmark scores 10.1/13.5, which is 0.748, nearly twice as much.

Finally and most important, life expectancy tells us little about the good or bad health of individuals. A person can live to a great age while suffering from a myriad of untreated (but not life-threatening) diseases, another one can die at the same age after receiving successful treatment for his or her diseases  (including life-threatening ones) and therefore enjoying much better health.

Consider for instance a hypothetical Libyan man who died at 75 after poorly treated and long-lasting tooth problems, skin problems, gastrointestinal problems, urinary problems, joint problems, ear problems and eye problems. Then consider a hypothetical Danish man who died at the same age and had the same problems, each one of them promptly and effectively (and expensively) treated, and who was saved from cancer and myocardial infarction. The differences are striking. According to Bloomberg, however, there is no difference at all, because both men died at 75.

In the 2014 Bloomberg Health-Care Efficiency Index, Libya is ranked above Denmark, Thailand fares better than the Netherlands, and the United States is below Belarus. 

If such a ranking was accurate and dependable, the Bloomberg people who drew it up would prefer to receive medical care in Libya rather than in Denmark, they would choose the Thai medical system over the Dutch one, they would sooner undergo surgical procedures in Belarus than in the United States. It can safely be assumed they would not.

==Targets to increase efficiency==

=== Market dynamics ===

==== Increasing information ====
In general consumers are motivated to pursue the best value in a market.  The [[Healthcare industry|health care market]] is complicated by the fact that pricing and quality are opaque, consumers don't usually pay the full cost of care, and health is considered a "priceless" asset.

Efforts to increase [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] include hospital reporting requirements and insurers offering their customers estimates of provider costs for particular conditions.

==== Simplifying information ====
Efforts to simplify market information, steering participant decision-making to achieve better efficiency can include regulations like those associated with the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] insurance [[Health insurance marketplace|market]] creating minimum standards on what each plan can offer as well as placing them into "gold", "silver", or "bronze" categories.&lt;ref name="HealthCare.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title=Understanding Marketplace health insurance categories | website=HealthCare.gov | url=https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/ | access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cost sharing ====
[[Cost sharing]] refers to various schemes to ensure health care resources aren't overused.  In many health systems, the patient doesn't bear the full cost of services.  If the person making the purchase decision effectively sees no cost, the demand for that service would tend to rise.  In health care this could manifest as emergency room visits for minor ailments that could be managed through other less expensive remedies like primary care or nursing hotlines.

Common cost sharing mechanisms include [[Copayment|copays]], [[deductible]]s, and [[health savings account]]s.

=== Increasing quality ===
In health care poor quality can mean patients need more services at greater expense.  For example, if a patient is repeatedly [[misdiagnose]]d, they may return to the ER or doctor's office presenting the same symptoms that remain unresolved, increasing the overall use of health care resources.

==== Variations in provider practices ====

[[Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care]] states, "Among the 306 hospital referral regions in the United States, price-adjusted [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reimbursements varied twofold in 2014, from about $7,000 per enrollee in the lowest spending region to more than $13,000 in the highest spending region."&lt;ref name="Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care"&gt;{{cite web | title=Medicare Reimbursements | website=Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care | url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/topic/topic.aspx?cat=21 | access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One investigation found that "Variation in clinical practice is substantial and is associated with poorer health outcomes, increased costs, and disparities in care. Despite these efforts, practice variation has been difficult to overcome. Challenges to reducing variation include heterogeneity and gaps in clinicians’ knowledge; economic incentives for undesired clinical behaviors; concerns about malpractice risk; physicians’ value of autonomy and personal preference; inadequate communication and decision support tools; and imbalances between clinical demand and resource capacity. Another fundamental barrier to practice standardization is that good clinical practice must sometimes vary to reflect a patient’s specific social, environmental, and biological situation. Sometimes a standard practice would not be best for a given patient. Hence, efforts to legislate or establish policies governing care have been limited because they impede the common sense that there are nearly always exceptions to a given rule."&lt;ref name="Soni Giboney Yee p=2163"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Soni | first=S. Monica | last2=Giboney | first2=Paul | last3=Yee | first3=Hal F. | title=Development and Implementation of Expected Practices to Reduce Inappropriate Variations in Clinical Practice | journal=JAMA | publisher=American Medical Association (AMA) | volume=315 | issue=20 | date=2016-05-24 | issn=0098-7484 | doi=10.1001/jama.2016.4255 | page=2163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Care coordination ====

Effectively sharing information among the providers participating in a patient's care can increase quality and reduce costs.&lt;ref name="Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Care Coordination | website=Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality | date=2015-05-01 | url=https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/prevention-chronic-care/improve/coordination/index.html | access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Care fragmentation can result in duplication of tests, preventable hospitalizations, and increased costs.&lt;ref name="Frandsen Joynt Rebitzer Jha 2015 pp. 355–62"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frandsen | first=BR | last2=Joynt | first2=KE | last3=Rebitzer | first3=JB | last4=Jha | first4=AK | title=Care fragmentation, quality, and costs among chronically ill patients. | journal=The American journal of managed care | volume=21 | issue=5 | year=2015 | issn=1088-0224 | pmid=26167702 | pages=355–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electronic health record]]s are developed with the hope of improving care coordination.

=== Increasing access ===
If a patient doesn't have access to the appropriate care because they cannot afford it, they may delay treatment until the cost of that treatment and the morbidity of the disease has increased, or choose more expensive emergency care.

Some research suggests people lacking insurance use emergency rooms more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad388.pdf |title=Advance Data From Vital and Health Statistics No. 388  |website=Cdc.gov |format=PDF |date= June 28, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While another study that looked at the population level found that US states that expanded [[Medicaid]] actually saw an increase in ER use per capital compared to states that didn't expand access, though it didn't control for other possible variables.&lt;ref name="Nikpay Freedman Levy Buchmueller 2017 pp. 215–225.e6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nikpay | first=Sayeh | last2=Freedman | first2=Seth | last3=Levy | first3=Helen | last4=Buchmueller | first4=Tom | title=Effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion on Emergency Department Visits: Evidence From State-Level Emergency Department Databases | journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=70 | issue=2 | year=2017 | issn=0196-0644 | doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.03.023 | pages=215–225.e6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative costs ===

A 2017 [[Commonwealth Fund]] report found that hospital administrative costs comprise 1.43% of GDP in the US, but only 0.41% in Canada.&lt;ref name="Himmelstein 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Himmelstein | first=David U. | title=A Comparison of Hospital Administrative Costs in Eight Nations: U.S. Costs Exceed All Others by Far | website=The Commonwealth Fund | date=2014-09-08 | url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2014/sep/hospital-administrative-costs | access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration costs also exist in insurance systems.  In the US estimates for Medicare administrative costs range from 2 to 5%, while private insurance estimates have ranged from 12 to 18%.  The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to maintain [[medical loss ratio]]s of at least 80%.

A '''health insurance mandate''' is either an [[Health insurance mandate#employer mandate|employer]] or [[individual mandate]] to obtain private [[health insurance]] instead of (or in addition to) a [[national health insurance]] plan.&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;D.

==Japan==
{{Main|Health care system in Japan}}
[[Japan]] has a [[universal health care system]] that mandates all residents have health insurance, either at work or through a local community-based insurer, but does not impose penalties on individuals for not having insurance.&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/85466/E92927.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Japanese health ministry]] "tightly controls the price of health care down to the smallest detail. Every two years, the doctors and the health ministry negotiate a fixed price for every procedure and every drug. That helps keep premiums to around $280 a month for the average Japanese family."&lt;ref name="JapanPay"/&gt; Insurance premiums are set by the government, with guaranteed issue and community rating.&lt;ref&gt;http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN020063.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Insurers are not allowed to deny claims or coverage, or to make profits (net revenue is carried over to the next year, and if the carryover is large, the premium goes down).&lt;ref name="JapanPay"/&gt; Around 10% evade the compulsory insurance premium; municipal governments do not issue them insurance cards, which providers require.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; Voluntary private insurance is available through several sources including employers and unions to cover expenditures not covered by statutory insurance, but this accounts for only about 2% of health care spending.&lt;ref name="euro" /&gt; In practice, doctors will not deny care to patients in the low-priced universal system because they make up the great majority of patients nationwide, and doctors would not be able to earn enough by serving only the small number of patients with private insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/etc/script.html |title= Sick Around The World  |work= FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sick"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sick around the world |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |airdate=April 15, 2008 |minutes=17 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total spending is around half the American level, and taxpayers subsidize the poor.&lt;ref name="JapanPay"&gt;[[T.R.

==The Netherlands==
{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has a health insurance mandate&lt;ref name="S&amp;D"&gt;Robert E. Leu, Frans F. H. Rutten, Werner Brouwer, Pius Matter, and Christian Rütschi (January 2009). [http://mobile.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2009/Jan/The%20Swiss%20and%20Dutch%20Health%20Insurance%20Systems%20%20Universal%20Coverage%20and%20Regulated%20Competitive%20Insurance/Leu_swissdutchhltinssystems_1220%20pdf.pdf The Swiss and Dutch Health Insurance Systems: Universal Coverage and Regulated Competitive Insurance Markets] [[The Commonwealth Fund]] Accessed August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and allows for-profit companies to compete for minimum coverage insurance plans, though there are also mutual insurers so use of a commercial for-profit insurer is not compulsory. The government regulates the insurers and operates a [[risk equalization]] mechanism to subsidize insurers that insure relatively more expensive customers. Several features hold down the level of premiums which facilitate public compliance with the mandate. The cost of health care in the Netherlands is higher than the European average but is less than in the United States. Half of the cost of insurance for adults is paid for by an income-related tax with which goes towards a subsidy of private insurance via the risk reinsurance pool operated by the regulator. The government pays the entire cost for children. Forty percent of the population is eligible for a premium subsidy. About 1.5 percent of the legal population is estimated to be uninsured. The architects of the Dutch mandate did not envision any problem with non-compliance, the initial legislation created few effective sanctions if a person does not take out insurance or pay premiums, and the government is currently developing enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NASI"&gt;[http://www.nasi.org/usr_doc/Administering_Health_Insurance_Mandates.pdf Administering Health Insurance Mandates], Steuerle, C E and Van de Water, Paul N. ''National Academy of Social Insurance''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
{{Main|Health care in Switzerland}}
[[Switzerland]]'s system is similar to that of the Netherlands with regulated private insurance companies competing to provide the minimum necessary coverage to meet its mandate. Premiums are not linked to incomes, but the government provides [[subsidies]] to lower-class individuals to help them pay for their plans. About 40% of households received some kind of subsidy in 2004. Individuals are free to spend as much as they want for their plans and buy additional health services if desired. The system has virtual universal coverage, with about 99% of people having insurance. The laws behind the system were created in 1996.&lt;ref name=switz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/health-care-abroad-switzerland/|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Health Care Abroad: Switzerland| first=Anne| last= Underwood| date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent issue in the country is their rising health care costs, which are higher than European averages. However, those rising costs are still a little less than the increases in the United States.&lt;ref name=switz/&gt;

==United States==

=== History ===
An individual mandate to purchase healthcare was initially proposed by the [[conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] [[Heritage Foundation]] in 1989 as an alternative to [[single-payer health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-revealed-a-moderate-republican/2011/04/25/AFPrGfkE_story.html|title=Obama revealed: A moderate Republican|author=Ezra Klein|date=25 April 2011|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204618704576641190920152366|title=ObamaCare's Heritage|author=James Taranto|date=19 October 2011|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/an_interview_with_mark_pauly_t.html|title=Ezra Klein  - An interview with Mark Pauly, father of the individual mandate|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Testimony/Laying-the-Groundwork-for-Universal-Health-Care-Coverage|title=Laying the Groundwork for Universal Health Care Coverage|work=The Heritage Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913144610/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Testimony/Laying-the-Groundwork-for-Universal-Health-Care-Coverage|archivedate=2011-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2010/03/29/was-the-individual-mandate-a-republican-idea/|title=Was the Individual Mandate a "Republican Idea"? - The Volokh Conspiracy|work=The Volokh Conspiracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Stuart Butler]], an early supporter of the individual mandate at the Heritage Foundation, wrote:
{{quote|If a young man wrecks his Porsche and has not had the foresight to obtain insurance, we may commiserate, but society feels no obligation to repair his car. But health care is different. If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance.&lt;ref name="nyt-mandate"/&gt;}}
The Heritage Foundation changed its position in 2011, calling the individual mandate unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Louis |first=Patrick |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2011/03/individual-mandate-unconstitutional-unenforceable |title=Individual Mandate Unconstitutional, Unenforceable |publisher= Heritage.org |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, the idea of an individual mandate was championed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians as a free-market approach to health care reform.&lt;ref name="nyt-mandate"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title= Conservatives Sowed Idea of Health Care Mandate, Only to Spurn It Later | first = Michael | last = Cooper | date = February 14, 2012 | accessdate=  July 2, 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/health/policy/health-care-mandate-was-first-backed-by-conservatives.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new-yorker-klein"/&gt; Supporters included [[Charles Grassley]], [[Mitt Romney]], and the late [[John Chafee]].&lt;ref name=flies&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/08/24/individual-mandate-flies-under-the-radar/5| title= Individual Mandate Flies Under the Radar|date=August 24, 2009| first= Patricia|last= Murphy| publisher= ''[[Politics Daily]]''|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual mandate was felt to resonate with conservative principles of individual responsibility, and conservative groups recognized that the healthcare market was unique.

In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|proposed a health care reform bill]] which included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of [[health maintenance organization]]s and an individual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4816/doc38.pdf |title=CBO &amp;#124; The Budgetary Treatment of an Individual Mandate to Buy Health Insurance |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=1994-08-01 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ben |url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Obamacare_vs_Clintoncare.html |title=Obamacare vs. Clintoncare - Ben Smith |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Clinton plan failed amid concerns that it was overly complex or unrealistic, and in the face of an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry.&lt;ref name="newsweek-clinton"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Newsweek]] | title = The Lost Chance | first = Bob | last=  Cohn |author2=Eleanor Clift | date = September 18, 1994 | accessdate= July 2, 2012 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1994/09/18/the-lost-chance.print.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Republican Senators proposed a bill that would have required individuals, and not employers, to buy insurance, as an alternative to Clinton's plan.&lt;ref name="nyt-mandate"/&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]]'s plan in 2008 also included an individual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=96434 |title=Hillary Clinton: Excerpts of Remarks on Health Care |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massachusetts ===

An individual health-insurance mandate was initially enacted on a state level: the 2005 [[Massachusetts health care reform]] law. In 2006, Republican [[Mitt Romney]], then governor of Massachusetts, [[Massachusetts health care reform|signed an individual mandate into law]] with strong bipartisan support. In 2007, a [[Healthy Americans Act|Senate bill featuring a federal mandate]], authored by [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Utah|UT]]) and [[Ron Wyden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Oregon|OR]]), attracted substantial bipartisan support.&lt;ref name="new-yorker-klein"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New Yorker]] | first = Ezra | last = Klein | authorlink = Ezra Klein | title = Unpopular Mandate | accessdate = June 19, 2012 | date = June 25, 2012 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new-yorker-lizza"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New Yorker]] | title= Romney's dilemma | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/06/06/110606fa_fact_lizza | first = Ryan | last = Lizza | authorlink = Ryan Lizza | accessdate = June 19, 2012 | date = June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2016}}, more than 97 percent of Massachusetts residents were insured, which made it the state with the lowest percentage of people without health insurance.&lt;ref name=PoliticoNJ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2018/05/30/new-jersey-becomes-second-state-to-adopt-individual-health-insurance-mandate-442183|title=New Jersey becomes second state to adopt individual health insurance mandate|first=Katie|last=Jennings|date=May 30, 2018|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the law was passed, per capita health care costs in Massachusetts were the highest for any part of the country except D.C. From 2003 to 2008 (three years prior and two years after enactment) Massachusetts insurance premiums continued to outpace the rest of United States, however the rate of growth year to year for Massachusetts has slowed as a result of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health expenditures by state of residence: Summary Tables, 1991-2009| url= https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/res-tables.pdf| publisher= cms.gov| accessdate= 28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romney's success in installing an individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign]], Sen. [[Jim DeMint]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[South Carolina|SC]]) praised Romney's ability to "take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured." Romney himself said of the individual mandate: "I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation."&lt;ref name="new-yorker-lizza"/&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential campaign]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] campaigned against an individual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drobnic Holan|first1=Angie|title=Obama flip-flops on requiring people to buy health care|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-requiring-people-buy-health-care/|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=Politifact|date=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama attacked [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[John Edwards]] for their support of the individual mandate during primary debates and in television ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cline|first1=Andrew|title=How Obama Broke His Promise on Individual Mandates|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/how-obama-broke-his-promise-on-individual-mandates/259183/|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=The Atlantic|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of President Obama's [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in 2009, Republicans began to oppose the mandate. In 2009, every Republican Senator (including Bennett, who had co-written the 2007 bill featuring a mandate) voted to describe the mandate as "unconstitutional". (Explaining his opposition, Bennett later said: "I didn't focus on the particulars of the amendment as closely as I should have, and probably would have voted the other way if I had understood that the individual mandate was at its core. I just wanted to express my opposition to the Obama proposal at every opportunity.")&lt;ref name="new-yorker-klein"/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote: "It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's health care law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking."&lt;ref name="nyt-mandate"/&gt;

Other Republican politicians who had previously supported individual mandates, including Romney and [[Orrin Hatch]], similarly emerged as vocal critics of the mandate in Obama's legislation.&lt;ref name="new-yorker-klein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new-yorker-lizza"/&gt; Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Ezra Klein stated that "the end result was...&amp;nbsp;a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition."&lt;ref name="new-yorker-klein"/&gt;

The Affordable Care Act signed in 2010 by Obama included an individual mandate to take effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;See Internal Revenue Code section 5000A, {{usc|26|5000A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2013, final regulations for the individual mandate were published in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' ({{USFR|78|53646}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual Mandate Under ACA|date=March 6, 2014|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41331.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minor corrections published December 26, 2013 ({{USFR|78|78256}}).&lt;ref&gt;Codified at 26 C.F.R. sections 1.5000A-0 through 1.5000A-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act's]] individual mandate is repealed effective 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53348|title=Reconciliation Recommendations of the Senate Committee on Finance|date=2017-11-26|work=Congressional Budget Office|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional challenges ===

The ACA mandate was challenged in federal courts by Republican state Attorneys General. On June 28, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the provision as Constitutional.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Upholds The Health Care Law"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Upholds The Health Care Law |url=http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/28/12457822-supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law?lite |accessdate=2012-06-28 |newspaper=MSNBC |date=2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629123918/http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/28/12457822-supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law?lite |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] delivered the majority opinion in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', which upheld the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] by a 5-4 vote. The Court ruled that although the "individual mandate" component of the act was not constitutional under the [[Commerce Clause]], it was reasonably construed as a tax and was therefore valid under the Congressional authority to "lay and collect taxes."&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news|last=Haberkorn|first=Jennifer|title=Health care ruling: Individual mandate upheld by Supreme Court|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77935.html|accessdate=28 June 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cushman&gt;{{cite news|last=Cushman|first=John|title=Supreme Court Lets Health Law Largely Stand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html?_r=1&amp;hp|accessdate=28 June 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2010 working paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1680392|title=Commandeering the People: Why the Individual Health Insurance Mandate is Unconstitutional |url= https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1433&amp;context=facpub | first=Randy |last=Barnett|publisher= ssrn.com |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a forthcoming article in the NYU Journal of Law and Liberty, and a lecture given at NYU, [[Randy Barnett]] of [[Georgetown University Law Center]] argues that the mandate is unconstitutional under the doctrine of the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses, and that enforcing it is equivalent to "commandeering the people." Penalizing inaction, he argues, is only defensible when a fundamental duty of a person has been established. He also asserted that Congress fails to enforce the mandate under its taxing power because the penalty is not revenue-generating according to the Act itself.

The U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the individual mandate was rendered in June 2012, in the case of ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]''.

=== Criticism of individual mandate ===

[[Insurance companies|Insurance]] [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] ([[America's Health Insurance Plans|AHIP]]) in the United States advocate that the mandate is necessary to support [[guaranteed issue]] and [[community rating]], which limit [[underwriting]] by [[insurance companies|insurers]]; insurers propose that the mandate is intended to prevent [[adverse selection]] by ensuring healthy individuals purchase insurance and thus broaden the [[risk pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/obamasdeal/etc/script.html|title=Transcript - Obama's Deal - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/1/6|title=The Individual Mandate — An Affordable and Fair Approach to Achieving Universal Coverage|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0904729 | volume=361|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without mandates, for-profit insurers have necessarily relied on risk aversion to charge [[Insurance premium|premiums]] over expected [[risks]], but have been constrained by what customers are willing to pay; mandates eliminate that constraint, allowing insurers to charge more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/health/policy/25view.html | work=The New York Times | title=How an Insurance Mandate Could Leave Many Worse Off | first=Tyler | last=Cowen | date=October 25, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments that impose a mandate must [[subsidize]] those who cannot afford it, thus shifting the cost onto [[taxpayers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/sustinet/lib/sustinet/referencelibrary/sustinet_jama_re_cost_shifting_9-2-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mdpolicy.org/policyblog/detail/a-bad-exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/06/15/news/economy/massachusetts_healthcare_reform.fortune/index.htm|title=5 painful health-care lessons from Massachusetts|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurance mandate faced opposition across the political spectrum, from [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups such as the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] and other advocates of [[single-payer healthcare]] to [[right-wing politics|right-leaning]] groups such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], [[FreedomWorks]], and the [[Cato Institute]] as well as some members of the [[U.S. Senate]] and [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=flies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/press/pr-national.php?ID=249 |title=2009-09-14 The Green Party responds to Obama's speech: Mr. President, make health care a right for all Americans |publisher=GP.org |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113926/http://www.gp.org/press/pr-national.php?ID=249 |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents such as Michael Cannon, Director of Health Policy Studies at the [[Cato Institute]], make a philosophical argument that people should have the right to live without government social interference as a matter of [[individual liberty]]. He has stated that federal, state, and local governments are not willing or able to raise the necessary funds to effectively subsidize people who cannot currently afford insurance. He has also stated that the costs of increasing coverage are far higher than other reforms, such as reducing the number of errors and accidents in treatment, which would accomplish as much or more benefit to society.&lt;ref name=ask/&gt;

Public opinion polls from 2009 through 2012 continued to find that most Americans rejected penalizing people for not buying health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/as-health-care-laws-trial-approaches-two-thirds-say-ditch-individual-mandate/|title=As Health Care Law's Trial Approaches, Two-Thirds Say Ditch Individual Mandate|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/090729_NBC-WSJ_poll.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/06/09/healthcare.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=useit&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]]|date=July 1, 2009|title=U.S. Voters Back Public Insurance 2-1, But Won't Use It|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1344|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employer mandates==

In the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) includes both [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Employer mandate and part-time working hours|employer]] and [[individual mandate|individual]] mandates that take effect in 2014. The PPACA's employer mandate requires that all businesses with 50 or more full-time employees provide minimum affordable health insurance to at least 95% of their full-time employees and dependents up to age 26, or pay a fee by 2016. In the two largest EU countries, [[France]] and [[Germany]], Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) mandates employers and employees pay into statutory sickness funds. In France, private health insurance (PHI) is voluntary and used to increase the reimbursement rate from the statutory sickness system. The same applies in Germany where it is also possible to opt out of SHI if you are a very high earner and into a PHI but if a person has reached the age of 55 and is in the PHI sector he or she must remain covered by PHI and cannot opt back into SHI. Persons who are unemployed can usually continue their payments through [[social insurance]] and the very poor receive support from the government to be insured. Most workers are insured through compulsory membership of "sickness funds" that are non-profit entities established originally by [[trades unions]] and now given statutory status. In Germany and France, as is the case with most European health care finance, the personal contribution to health care financing varies according to a person's income level and not according to their health status. Only 0.2% of Germans are uninsured, mainly self-employed, rich and poor, and persons who have failed to pay contributions to the statutory insurance or premiums to the private health insurance. Between 1990 and 2000 the share of French SHI income coming directly from employees via salaries fell from around 30% to just 3% and employer direct contributions also fell. The difference was made up by a rise in income from government taxation, thus widening the mandatory contribution base to the health insurance system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/80703/E85472.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/80694/E83126.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Health Policy 2011(NHP)==

The Health Policy has 19 goals and objectives, 16 policy principles and 39 strategies.

=== Policy contents ===
The '''Bangladesh health policy''' document was published in 2011 and adheres to the following principles:

Health is defined as "A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions |url=http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/index.html |date=2012 |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Every citizen has the basic right to adequate health care. The State and the government are constitutionally obliged to ensure health care for its citizens.
# To ensure an effective health care system that responds to the need of a healthy nation, health policy provides the vision and mission for development.
# Pursuit of such policy will fulfill the demands of the people of the country, while health service providers will be encouraged and inspired. People's physical well-being and free thought process have proved to be a precondition for the growth and intellectual enrichment in today's human society
# Bangladesh expressed agreement on the following declarations:

** The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] (1978)
** The [[World Summit for Children]] (1990)
** [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (1994)
** [[International Women's Year#International|Beijing Women's Conference]] (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Policy 2011|url=http://www.mohfw.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74%3Ahealth-policy-of-bangladesh&amp;catid=54%3Abasic-link-page&amp;Itemid=92&amp;lang=en|work=Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|access-date=7 June 2012|author=Staff|language=Bengali|format=PDF|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a written and approved Health Policy, the national Annual Development Program and Five Year Plans substituted for policy principles. The problems in the health services multiplied in the absence of a clear policy. Bangladesh is a developing country with the world's highest population density.

===History of the development of the policy===

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.mohfw.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=frontpage&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en|work=Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|publisher=Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|accessdate=7 June 2012|author=Staff|language=Bengali, English|year=2007–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled a Committee in 1996 for the purpose of preparing a [[health policy]], with members drawn from [[civil society]] and professional bodies, including [[Technocracy|technocrats]] and [[bureaucrat]]s.

A further five sub-committees were formed to:

* Evaluate the existing health services and determining the goals
* Formulate policies to ensure essential services
* Formulate policies to ensure hospital-based services
* Design Strategies for HRD
* Integrate NGOs and the Private Sector and plan for resources and utilisation of funds

The sub-committees worked for more than a year and submitted their efforts/recommendations. A working group was formed and entrusted with the responsibilities for compiling the recommendations contained in the reports. The working group also organised workshops in all six Divisions to elicit opinions of cross-section of the society on these reports. Finally the working group presented the proposals and recommendations to the National Health Policy Formulation Committee.  A report on the health policy was thus formulated on the basis of consensus. The Cabinet on 14 Aug 2000 approved the National Health Policy.

==Health care system==
The health care are designated to meet the health needs of the community through the use of available knowledge and resources. The services provided should be comprehensive and community based. The resources must be distributed according to the needs of the community. The final outcome of good health care system is the changed [[health status]] or improve health status of the community which is expressed in terms of lives saved, death averted, disease prevented, disease treated, prolongation of life etc.

Health care delivery system in [[Bangladesh]] based on PHC concept has got various Level of service delivery:
* Home and community level.
* Union level,
* Union sub centre (USC) or Health and family welfare centre; This is the first health facility level.
* Thana level, Thana Health Complex (THC): This is the first referral level.
* District Hospital: This is the secondary referral level.
* National Level: This is the tertiary referral level.

A) Primary level health care is delivered though USC or HFWC with one in each union domiciliary level, 
integrated health and family planning services through field workers for every 3000–4000 population and 31 
bed capacities in hospitals.

B) The secondary level health care is provided through 500 bed capacities in district hospital. Facilities provide specialist services in internal medicine, general surgery, gynecology, paediatrics and obstetrics, eye clinical, [[pathology]], [[blood transfusion]] and public health laboratories.

C) Tertiary Level health care is available at the medical college hospital, public health and medical institutes and other specialist hospitals at the national level where a mass wide range of specialised as well as better 
laboratory facilities are available.

The referral system will be developed keeping in view the following.

1. A clearly spent-out linkage between the specialised national institutes, medical college and district hospitals
to ensure proper care and treatment of patients from the rural areas served by lower level facilities.

2. Patients from the rural areas referred by lower level facilities to district and medical college hospitals and 
specialised institutions should get [[preferential treatment]] after admission

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13570">A '''human milk bank''' or '''breast milk bank''' is a service which collects, screens, processes, and dispenses by prescription human milk donated by nursing mothers who are not biologically related to the recipient infant. The optimum nutrition for newborn infants is breastfeeding, if possible, for the first year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378378209001327/1-s2.0-S0378378209001327-main.pdf?_tid=76f1ec58-e24d-11e4-8ff3-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1428978486_42f06ef0c5a55187a3157e4e592d8d63 Benefits of Donor Human Milk for preterm infants]&lt;/ref&gt; Human milk banks offer a solution to the mothers that cannot supply their own breast milk to their child, for reasons such as a baby being at risk of getting diseases and infections from a mother with certain diseases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://breastfeeding.about.com/od/breastmilkpumpingcare/a/milkbank.htm When Not to Breastfeed: Safety Issues for You and Baby]&lt;/ref&gt; or when a child is hospitalized at birth due to [[low birth weight|very low birth weight]] (and thus at risk for conditions such as [[necrotizing enterocolitis]]), and the mother cannot provide her own milk during the extended stay for reasons such as living far from the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/elena/titles/full_recommendations/feeding_lbw/en/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Human milk banks had an increase in the amount of milk collected in 2012 compared to 2007, in addition the amount of milk donated by each donor had also increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhl.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/02/25/0890334415573502 Survey of Italian Human Milk Banks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mothers' Milk Bank (MMB) says, this service provides mothers with an alternative to [[infant formula]] and allows the mother to give their newborn the nutrition it needs for healthy growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mothersmilkbank.com.au/about-mmb/ Mothers' Milk Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Milk Banking Initiative (IMBI), was founded at the International HMBANA Congress in 2005. It lists 33 countries with milk bank programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalmilkbanking.org International Milk Banking Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the first alternative to a biological mother not being able to breast feed is the use of human milk from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazingbreastmilk.nhs.uk/support/milk-banks/&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary and by far the largest group of consumers of human breast milk are premature babies. Infants with gastrointestinal disorders or metabolic disorders may also consume this form of milk as well. Human breast milk acts as a substitute, instead of formula, when a mother cannot provide her own milk. Human breast milk can also be fed to toddlers and children with medical conditions that include but are not limited to chemotherapy for cancer and growth failure while on formula.

== History ==
Donating breast milk can be traced back to the practice of wet nursing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moro|first=Guido E.|date=2018-04|title=History of Milk Banking: From Origin to Present Time|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/bfm.2018.29077.gem|journal=Breastfeeding Medicine|language=en|volume=13|issue=S1|pages=S–16-S-17|doi=10.1089/bfm.2018.29077.gem|issn=1556-8253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of regulations regarding the sharing of breastmilk are found in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (1800 BC).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These regulations were motivated by the long held belief that infants inherit the nurse’s traits through their breast milk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By the 11th century European culture considered breastfeeding indecent, which led wet nursing to become common practice among royalty and aristocracy of Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The practice of wet nursing declined by the 19th century due to concerns regarding unhealthy lifestyles among nurses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Consequently, the medical community began researching the effects of alternative nutrition on neonates. Theodor Escherich of the University of Vienna conducted studies from 1902 to 1911 investigating different sources of nutrition and their effect on neonates. His studies demonstrated that breastfed neonate’s intestinal bacteria was significantly different compared to neonates fed by other means.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1909, Escherich opened the first human milk bank .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Frances|date=2003-08|title=History of North American Donor Milk Banking: One Hundred Years of Progress|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0890334403255857|journal=Journal of Human Lactation|volume=19|issue=3|pages=313–318|doi=10.1177/0890334403255857|issn=0890-3344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, another milk bank opened in the Boston Floating Hospital, the first milk bank in the US.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haiden|first=Nadja|last2=Ziegler|first2=Ekhard E.|date=2016|title=Human Milk Banking|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/452821|journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism|language=english|volume=69|issue=2|pages=8–15|doi=10.1159/000452821|issn=0250-6807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960’s saw a decline in milk banking because of recent advances in neonatal care and baby formula.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite these new advancements, in 1980 the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s fund maintained their position that donor breast milk is the best alternative to the mother’s breast milk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The practice of milk banking declined further with the HIV epidemic. The need for stringent screening increased the cost of operating milk banks, forcing them to close doors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Improved screening methods and standardization of procedure have made donated milk a viable alternative to mother’s breast milk. The ability to pasteurize and store breast milk for up to 8 months&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Waard|first=Marita|last2=Mank|first2=Elise|last3=van Dijk|first3=Karin|last4=Schoonderwoerd|first4=Anne|last5=van Goudoever|first5=Johannes B.|date=2018-3|title=Holder-Pasteurized Human Donor Milk: How Long Can It Be Preserved?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019853|journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition|volume=66|issue=3|pages=479–483|doi=10.1097/MPG.0000000000001782|issn=1536-4801|pmid=29019853}}&lt;/ref&gt; means milk banking could become a global enterprise.

==Donor Requirement==
A donor must: 
* Be healthy
* Be in the process of lactation
* Undertake a chest x-ray or Tyne test 
* Have a negative VDRL 
* Have no  evidence of hepatitis
* Be HIV negative

More requirements may apply.  For example, the requirements in Australia can be found at: http://jhl.sagepub.com/content/2/1/20.full.pdf

==Concerns==
Some concerns that surround human milk bank include:
* Cost 
* Availability
* Lack of health care provider interest 
* Concern about the type of women who might donate &lt;ref&gt;Jones, F., RN, MSN, IBCLC. (2003). History of North American Donor Milk Banking: One Hundred Years of Progress. Journal of Human Lactation, 19 (3)313-318.  doi: 10.1177/0890334403255857&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumers==
After the milk has been donated the primary consumer of the milk are premature babies; other consumers include adults with medical complications or conditions. The main reason why premature babies consume donor milk is that the mother cannot provide milk for the baby. The donor milk therefore acts as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Heiman, H., Schanler, R.J. (2006). Benefits of maternal and donor human milk for premature infants. Early human development 82, 781-787. Retrieved from  http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378378206002325/1-s2.0-S0378378206002325-main.pdf?_tid=7a9a5b2a-e4c2-11e4-8dcd-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1429248646_57f08db067cf2a164ce0db1708cf6aa3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits of human milk banks==
Human milk banks offer families a chance to provide their child with reliable and healthy milk from other mothers. Human milk banks are needed as they offer milk which mostly is consumed by children whose mothers are not able to provide them with reliable milk. &lt;ref&gt;Simmer, K., Hartmann, B. (2009).  The knowns and unknowns of human milk banking.  Early Human Development 85 (2009), 701–704. Retrieved from  http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378378209001820/1-s2.0-S0378378209001820-main.pdf?_tid=9050387e-e4b1-11e4-bf4e-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1429241381_df6123b4c07fb3c15df186a8b331a3ba &lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Milk Banks Around the World==

=== Brazil and Latin America ===
[[Brazil]] has an extensive network of 217 milk banks, and is considered to have the most cost efficient system of milk banking in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citizenmatters.in/breast-feeding-human-milk-bank-bangalore-delhi-infants-8268|title=Banking on 'liquid gold': How breast milk banks are saving infant lives {{!}}|date=2018-09-21|work=Citizen Matters|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of the first milk bank in 1985, the infant mortality rate in Brazil has dropped 73% due, in part, to the popularization of milk banks. In 2011, 165,000 liters (5,580,000 fl oz) of breast milk were donated by some 166,000 mothers, and provided to nearly 170,000 babies. The Brazilian and Ibero-American Network of Human Milk Banks coordinates these efforts. All donors are screened: in general, they must be healthy and not be taking any medication. The Brazilian system is defined by its inexpensive pasteurization of milk and has spread to other countries such as Spain, Portugal, the Cape Verde Islands, and portions of the rest of Latin America.

===Europe===
There are 223 active human milk banks in 28 countries within Europe, with14 more planned as of November 2018. Currently, Italy has the most milk banks, at 37, while Turkey has the least, having no milk banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europeanmilkbanking.com/|title=EMBA|website=europeanmilkbanking.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
{{main|Human milk banking in North America}}
The Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) has a "Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of a Donor Human Milk Bank" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.breastfeedingindia.com/breastfeeding/human_milk_banks.html&lt;/ref&gt; that establishes exhaustive guidelines for safe milk collection and usage in North America.
There are 16 milk banks in North America as of 2014. They collect about 3,000,000 oz per year as of 2013.

===South Africa===
[[South Africa]] has a breast milk collection and distribution program, Milk Matters, based in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milkmatters.org Milk Matters]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
[[Singapore]] launched a three-year pilot donor breast milk bank on Thursday 17th August 2017. It is a collaboration between KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and Temasek Foundation Cares. The foundation has set aside S$1.37 million (US$1 million) for the milk bank, which will collect, screen, process and store breast milk from donor mothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-launches-first-donor-breast-milk-bank-9130360 Singapore launches first donor breast milk bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
As of 2014 [[Australia]] has a total of 5 Human Milk Banks in operation:
* PREM bank (based at King Edward Memorial Hospital, WA and also supplying Princess Margaret Hospital);

An '''intracavernous''' (or '''intracavernosal''') '''injection''' is an [[injection (medicine)|injection]] into the base of the [[penis]].  This injection site is often used to administer medications to check for or treat [[erectile dysfunction]] in adult men (in e.g. [[combined intracavernous injection and stimulation test]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more common medications administered in this manner include Caverject, Trimix (prostaglandin, papaverine, and phentolamine), Bimix (papaverine and phentolamine), and Quadmix (prostaglandin, papaverine, phentolamine, and either atropine or forskolin). These medications are all types of vasodilators and cause [[tumescence]] within 10-15 minutes.
Common side effects include priapism, bruising, fibrosis, Peyronies, and pain.

[[Priapism]] is also often treated with intracavernous injections, usually with [[sympathomimetic]] vasoconstricting drugs like [[adrenaline]] or [[phenylephrine]].

Chokka Rao Devadula lift irrigation scheme''' is a [[lift irrigation scheme]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-16/hyderabad/29781230_1_devadula-workers-tunnel&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second biggest of its kind in [[Asia]]. Devadula is the place in [[Warangal District]], [[Telangana]],  where the scheme's intake well is located.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-18/hyderabad/29786709_1_devadula-project-site-bodies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/news/hcc-bags-devadula-lift-irrigation-phase-iii-order/345426/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Project==
The project is specially designed to lift water from the [[River Godavari]] to irrigate more than {{convert|600000|acre|km2}} in the [[drought]] prone [[Telangana]] state, India. Later it was named after the politician J. Chokkarao as the 'J. Chokkarao Devadula lift irrigation scheme'. The total work was divided into three phases for executional convenience in the year 2003 .

The minimum river water level required is 73 m [[Mean sea level|MSL]] in the river to pump the water whereas the non-monsoon / lean season river water level is below 71 m MSL. No downstream weir is yet constructed to build up the river minimum water level at this location of the river.

The maximum water lift is by 510 meters. The project operational requirement is 484 [[Megawatt|MW]] power and 1.4 billion [[KWh]] of electrical energy annually for pumping 38 [[Tmcft]] water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irrigation.telangana.gov.in/icad/projects|title=J.C.R. DEVADULA LIFT IRRIGATION SCHEME|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lift canal is an inter river basin transfer link by feeding Godavari River water to [[Krishna River]] basin in Warangal and Nalgonda districts.

==Honour==
The project was renamed to honour [[J. Chokka Rao]], a freedom fighter from [[Karimnagar]].

'''José Antonio Delgado Sucre''' (13 May 1965 – 22 July 2006) was the first [[Venezuela]]n [[mountaineer]] to reach the summit of five [[eight-thousander]]s and one of the most experienced climbers in Latin America. Known as ''el indio'' (the "Indian" for his strength), Delgado led the first Venezuelan Everest expedition in 2001. On May 23 of that year, he and Marcus Tobía were the only members of the expedition to summit Everest. He held several records in mountaineering, such as the first [[paragliding]] flight from Pico Humboldt, Pico Bolívar, and [[Roraima]]. Delgado also made the fastest summit for a Venezuelan to the Aconcagua (from the ''Puente del Inca'' in 34 hours) and Huascarán (from the base in 14 hours).

==Biography==
Jose Antonio Delgado Sucre was born in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. He studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Universidad Simón Bolívar]] and married Frida Ayala with whom he had two children.

==Death and legacy==
Delgado was the leader of the Venezuelan [[Nanga Parbat]] expedition. He and fellow climber Edgar Guariguata flew out to [[Pakistan]] in June 2006. Due to illness Guariguata remained at [[base camp]] while Delgado went on. After he reached the summit of the Nanga Parbat on July 11, a snow storm surprised him on his descent. Delgado managed to reach camp four. After being without food or water for two days he attempted to make it to camp three. No further communications were received by base camp, so the Pakistani authorities were alerted. A group of six [[Pakistan]]i mountaineers, consisting of Qurban Muhammad (Shimshal), Ghulam Rasool, Muhammad, Muhammad Ibrahim, Ghulam Muhammad, and Muhammad Ali, climbed the mountain despite the rough weather. On July 22, they found Delgado's body at an altitude of 7100m between camp three and four in the open near his tent.&lt;ref name="nanga"&gt;[http://www.nangaparbat2006.explorart.com/ NANGA PARBAT 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the expedition to Nanga Parbat, he was the subject of a pilot for a television series about mountaineering.&lt;ref name="nanga"&gt;[http://www.nangaparbat2006.explorart.com/ NANGA PARBAT 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Explorart Films, the production company, later developed the project into a feature documentary film, released in South America in January 2008.&lt;ref name="masalla"&gt;[http://www.masalladelacumbre.com/ Mas Alla de la Cumbre - Beyond the Summit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows Jose Antonio's climbing career and includes footage of several of his expeditions including the Nanga Parbat climb and the rescue attempts that followed the accident. Jose Antonio and his wife Frida were co-producers of the film.&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;[http://us.masalladelacumbre.com/cast.php Mas Alla de la Cumbre - Beyond the Summit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
He was awarded the ''Orden al Mérito Deportivo'' and the ''Orden Vicente Emilio Sojo'' in 2001 by the Venezuelan government. He was a founding member of the ''Proyecto Cumbre'' (1997) and the head of the ''Centro Excursionista Loyola'' from 1982-83.&lt;ref name="cumbre"&gt;[http://www.proyectocumbre.com.ve Proyecto Cumbre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first instance that became national news in Japan was in 2000 when the corpse of a 69-year-old man was discovered   three years after his death; his monthly rent and utilities had been withdrawn automatically from his bank account and only after his savings were depleted was his skeleton discovered at his home. The body had been consumed by maggots and beetles.&lt;ref name="Norimitsu Onishi"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/asia/japan-lonely-deaths-the-end.html A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death] Norimitsu Onishi, [[New York Times]], November 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

Statistics regarding kodokushi are often incomplete or inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald |first=Mark |url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/in-japan-lonely-deaths-in-societys-margins/|title=In Japan, Lonely Deaths in Society’s Margins |publisher=The New York Times|date=2012-03-25 |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NHK|Japan's national broadcasting network]] reported that 32,000 elderly people nationwide died alone in 2009.&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Allison|title=Precarious Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wbMAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 June 2014|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-7724-5|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of kodokushi tripled between 1983 and 1994, with 1,049 lonely deaths reported in Tokyo in 1994.&lt;ref name="Thang"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leng Leng Thang|title=Generations in Touch: Linking the Old and Young in a Tokyo Neighborhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4k1TAGTAJm8C&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=22 June 2014|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8732-3|pages=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, there were more than 2,200 reported lonely deaths in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Similar numbers were reported in 2011.&lt;ref name="Robila"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mihaela Robila|title=Handbook of Family Policies Across the Globe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cM_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327|accessdate=22 June 2014|date=19 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business|isbn=978-1-4614-6771-7|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; One private moving company in [[Osaka]] reported that 20 percent of the moving company's jobs (300 per year) involved removing the belongings of people who had died lonely deaths.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Approximately 4.5% of funerals in 2006 involved instances of kodokushi.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hikaru Suzuki|title=Death and Dying in Contemporary Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfVqTro9bSgC&amp;pg=PA229|accessdate=22 June 2014|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-63190-7|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodokushi most often affects men in their 50s and people over 65 years old.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

==Causes==

Several reasons for the increase in kodokushi have been proposed. One proposed reason is increased social isolation. A decreasing proportion of elderly Japanese people are living in multi-generational housing and are instead living alone.&lt;ref name=Thang/&gt; Elderly people who live alone are more likely to lack social contacts with family and neighbors, and are therefore more likely to die alone and remain undiscovered.&lt;ref name=Thang/&gt;

Economic reasons for kodokushi have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Many incidents of kodokushi have involved people who were receiving welfare or had few financial resources.&lt;ref name=Brasor/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt; McDonald suggests that the "Japanese trait of uncomplaining endurance," or [[gaman (term)|''gaman'']], discourages people in need from seeking help from neighbors and authorities.&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt;&lt;ref name=Asahi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201202220065 |title=3 unnoticed deaths in Saitama show poor slipping through safety net |author= |date=2012-02-22 |publisher=The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=2014-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405065952/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201202220065 |archivedate=2015-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of kodokushi have been described as "slipping through the cracks" between governmental and familial support.&lt;ref name=Asahi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allison/&gt;

Additionally, the [[Japanese asset price bubble|economic slump]] in Japan since 1990 has been cited as contributing to the increase in lonely deaths.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Since 1990, many Japanese [[salaryman|businessmen]] have been forced into early retirement.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Many of these men have never married and become socially isolated when removed from the corporate culture.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

Masaki Ichinose, head of the [[University of Tokyo]]'s Institute of Death and Life Studies, hypothesizes that the increase in kodokushi is linked to Japan's contemporary culture which ignores death.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; Several hundred years ago, Japanese people commonly confronted death; for example, bodies were typically buried by family members.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt; In contrast, in modern Japan, there are fewer opportunities to witness death and death is not readily discussed.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

Hypothesized psychological reasons for the increase in kodokushi include social apathy and [[stress (psychological)|life stress]].&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--staff writer--&gt;|title=Noida sisters' case: It's 'kodokushi' in Japan!|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/noida-sisters-case-it-s-kodokushi-in-japan_703409.html|work=News|publisher=Zeenews.com|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social isolation is used as a coping mechanism to avoid stressful situations.&lt;ref name=India/&gt;

==Responses==

Some districts in Japan have begun campaigns and movements to prevent lonely deaths. Officials in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku Ward]] have started a kodokushi awareness campaign that includes scheduled social events and checking in on the well-being of elderly citizens.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;

'''Mabel Isabel Wilcox''' (November 4, 1882 – December 28, 1978) was a pioneering nurse on the island of [[Kauai]].  She served with the Red Cross in Europe during World War I, and was decorated by Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium and by the Mayor of Le Havre. She was instrumental in instituting public nursing services on Kauai and in getting a hospital built on the island.

==Family background==

She was born November 4, 1882, in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], on the island of [[Kauai]], as one of six children of [[Samuel Whitney Wilcox]] (1847–1929) and [[Emma Washburn Lyman Wilcox]] (1849–1934). Mabel's mother was a seminary student in Chicago in 1871 when the [[Great Chicago Fire]] occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Wilcox, Noted Kamaaina of Kauai, Passes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19972196/mrs_wilcox_noted_kamaaina_of/|accessdate=May 10, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 29, 1934|page=1}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her father was a Kauai sugar planter, manager of a cattle ranch, and sheriff of Kauai for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samuel Wilcox, Hawaii Builder, Is Dead At 82|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19972257/samuel_wilcox_hawaii_builder_is_dead/|accessdate=May 10, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=May 24, 1929|page=3}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal grandparents [[David Belden Lyman]] (1803–1884) and [[Sarah Joiner Lyman]] (1805–1885), and paternal grandparents [[Abner Wilcox]] (1808–1869) and [[Lucy Eliza Hart Wilcox]] (1814–1869), had been sent to Hawaii by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] in [[Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|pp=40, 70}}  She was the niece of businessmen [[George Norton Wilcox]] and [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]].

Her sisters and brothers were high-achieving individuals. Sister [[Lucy Etta Wilcox Sloggett]] (1877–1933) was a civic leader on Kauai, and also the [[World War I]] secretary of the Maui chapter of the American Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School Board Member for Kauai Passes|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19971726/school_board_member_for_kauai_passes/|accessdate=May 10, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=December 29, 1933|page=1}}{{free access}}; {{cite news|title=Mrs. H.

==Education and early career==
She received her early education at home from a private instructor, transferring later to [[Punahou School]] on Oahu, followed by three years at  [[Oakland High School (Oakland, California)|Oakland High School]] in California, completing her basic education at the college preparatory [[Dana Hall School]] in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Peterson|1984}}

Her parents discouraged her from a career in nursing, but she persisted in pursuing her profession at [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]], receiving her RN degree in 1911. According to Johns Hopkins, she was the first Hawaii resident to graduate from the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scher|first1=Betty Borenstein|last2=McComas|first2=Pamela|title=Who was the first person from Hawaii to graduate from The Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing? – Johns Hopkins Nursing Magazine|url=http://magazine.nursing.jhu.edu/2012/07/who-was-the-first-person-from-hawaii-to-graduate-from-the-johns-hopkins-university-school-of-nursing/|website=Johns Hopkins Nursing Magazine|accessdate=March 2, 2018|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation, she remained in New York for several years, affiliated with the Buffalo Red Cross War Relief organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buffalo Red Cross War Relief Organization|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19986602/buffalo_red_cross_war_relief/|accessdate=May 11, 2018|work=The Buffalo Enquirer|date=November 18, 1914|page=5, col. 4}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, she returned home to Kauai as an employee of the Territorial Board of Health.&lt;ref name=DiesAt96&gt;{{cite news|last=TerBRUGGENCATE |first=Jan |title=Kauai's Mabel Wilcox, 96, Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19986652/kauais_mabel_wilcox_96_dies/|accessdate=May 11, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=December 28, 1978|page=3}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instituting the island's first public nursing services, she was influential in raising funds and getting the territorial legislature to allocate land to build the [[Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital]] at [[Kapaa, Hawaii|Kapaa]].{{sfn|Peterson|1984}}

==World War I==
With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Johns Hopkins pediatrician [[Edwards A. Park (doctor)|Edwards A.

He appointed Mabel as head nurse in supervision over 15 other nurses, among whom was [[Ethel Moseley Damon]] of Honolulu. They provided medical care and a safe haven for the children, often putting themselves in harm's way behind enemy lines to assist refugee women.{{sfn|Peterson|1984}} In recognition of their war-time services, Mabel and Ethel were decorated with the [[Queen Elisabeth Medal]] by the [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|Queen Elisabeth of Belgium]] and the Bronze Medal of the City of Le Havre by the Mayor of Le Havre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinclair|first=Jane|title=Hawaii's heroic women in war hospitals:Nurses from Mid-Pacific go halfway around the world following the flag of the Red Cross|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19986772/hawaiis_heroic_women_in_war_hospitals/|accessdate=May 11, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=October 5, 1918|page=59}}{{free access}}; {{cite news|title=Island Girls Are Awarded Decorations|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19975330/island_girls_are_awarded_decorations/|accessdate=May 10, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=May 14, 1919|page=2, col. 5}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning home to Kauai, she became the trustee and treasurer of Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital, and a probation officer of the Kauai County Juvenile Court. In the ensuing decades, she served in administrative and advisory capacities of numerous boards and institutions. Mabel and her sisters renovated the Wai‘oli Mission House, which had been the boyhood home of their father.  The house is now part of the [[Waioli Mission District]] on Kauai.&lt;ref name=Death&gt;{{cite news|title=Community losses: Mabel Isabel Wilcox|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19975208/community_losses_mabel_isabel_wilcox/|accessdate=May 10, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=December 28, 1978|page=10}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, 1861-65''''' (the ''MSHWR'') was a [[United States]] [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] publication consisting of six volumes, issued between 1870 and 1888 and "prepared Under the Direction of [[Surgeon General United States Army]], [[Joseph K. Barnes]]". The History was divided into three parts, each consisting of a medical history volume and a surgical history volume. The works detail tens of thousands of surgical cases and diseases occurring during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865).

==Contents==
The ''MSHWR'' included numerous statistical summaries relating to diseases, wounds, and deaths in both the [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]], almost all of the material formed from the reports of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] medical directors, surgeons, doctors, and hospital staff. The accounts are a basic source for medical data on the War and also comprise an important source of information relating to individual soldiers. The names of the surgeons who submitted these case studies are almost always included, so the books can be helpful in tracking where an individual surgeon was at various times.

Hundreds of [[etching]]s, [[wood engraving]]s, charts, and tables, as well as many photographs and color plates ([[lithograph]]s, [[chromolithograph]]s, [[Albumen print|albumen photograph]]s, [[Heliography|heliotype]]s, and [[woodburytype]]s) accompany the approximately 3,000 pages of densely printed text. (Almost every reproductive process available at the time can be found somewhere within the six volumes.)

==Editions and reprints==
Publication of the ''MSHWR'' was preceded by publication of the ''"Reports on the Extent and Nature of the Materials Available for the Preparation of a Medical and Surgical History of the Rebellion"'' ([[Surgeon General|Surgeon General's Office]]; [[United States War Department|War Department]], [[J.B. Lippincott]], 1865).

The ''MSHWR'' was reprinted (1990-1992) as ''The Medical and Surgical History of the Civil War'' ([[Broadfoot Publishing Company]]; editor, [[James I. Robertson, Jr.|Dr. James I. ("Bud") Robertson, Jr.]], Alumni Professor of History, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]], ["[[Virginia Tech]]"], [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]).

In addition to original printings and the reprinting, the ''MSHWR'' is also available on Compact Disc (CD) and on the internet/World Wide Web (see "External links").

The '''MuSmate''' is an invention that helps those afflicted with [[multiple sclerosis]] and other [[neurological]] conditions to walk.  It was invented by Anne and Ken Armitage in 2005, and released for the public in April 2006.  The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080904205217/http://www.musmate.com/ Musmate] is a treatment for [[foot drop]] which uses an elastic cord to lift the foot.  This is attached to a shoulder harness and allows the strong muscles in the [[human leg|leg]], [[human back|back]], and [[shoulder]] to support the weaker muscles in the [[foot]].  The design allows for the height of the foot lift and the level of support to be adjusted easily.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/12/21/musmate_feature.shtml  BBC Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Armstrong says that he jury-rigged the prototype when his wife Anne wanted to walk two kilometers to get to the [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] that serves "the best [[cream tea]]s in [[Dartmoor]]" 
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4950592.stm BBC News article]&lt;/ref&gt;  The device was successful in a clinical trial, and was nominated for the "best new product" award at [[Naidex]], the leading [[United Kingdom]] disability convention held in [[Birmingham]] in 2006.

In early 2008, The MuSmate device was approved by the United States FDA (Federal Drug Administration) and will be distributed in the USA starting in May 2008.

In 2011 it appeared to have gathered acceptance from MS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MS experts in Britain have to open their minds|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/8359854/MS-experts-in-Britain-have-to-open-their-minds.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Council on Problem Gambling''' was founded in 1972 by Msgr. Joseph A. Dunne and Dr. Robert Custer, among others. From the outset the Council established two principles that it continues to espouse today: that the organization would be the [[Advocacy group|advocate]] for [[problem gambler]]s and their families, and that it would maintain a neutral stance regarding the activity of gambling. Its mission is to lead state and national stakeholders in the development of comprehensive policy and programs for all those affected by problem gambling with the purpose of serving as the national advocate for programs and services to assist problem gamblers and their families. The National Council is neither for nor against legalized gambling.

The NCPG concentrates efforts on the national level, while the state affiliates work at the state and local level.  NCPG's network of state affiliate, individual and corporate members includes leaders in prevention, education, treatment, enforcement, research, responsible gaming and recovery communities.

A large portion of the NCPG funding comes from its [[Membership organization|membership program]]. NCPG membership is organized with 3 classes of members: state affiliate, corporate and individual.

The NCPG's major programs include the following:

* '''National Problem Gambling Helpline (1-800-522-4700):''' ensures local problem gambling help is just one call away anywhere in the US. 
* '''National Referral Resource:''' NCPG maintains the only nationwide online directories of certified counselors and inpatient/residential treatment facilities that offer specialized help in problem gambling, plus state-by-state referral resource listings. See: Inpatient &amp; Residential Treatment Facility List and Counselor Directory Search.
* '''Problem Gambling Awareness Month:''' An annual grassroots campaign in March aiming to raise awareness about problem gambling and to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the availability of help and hope. In 2018, over 200 organizations participated in encouraging stakeholders to “Have the Conversation” about problem gambling and explore the many meanings of this theme by providing free press releases, screening tools, logo files, wearable messaging and other resources.  
* '''National Conference on Problem Gambling:''' The oldest and largest annual conference of its kind.  Approximately 500 regulators, legislators, counselors, researchers, industry executives and recovering gamblers attend each year.  Specific in-depth training is provided for all aspects of the field and top researchers present their latest findings.  Up to 30 hours of Continuing Education Units may be earned over the 2-day Pre-Conference Workshops and 2-day Main Conference.  The location changes each year, hosted by a state Affiliate and offering each region of the country easy access on a rotating basis. 
* '''Lottery Holiday Responsible Gaming Campaign:''' Created in partnership with the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill University, this campaign encourages adults to be aware of the risks of giving lottery products to minors as holiday gifts because those who start gambling at a young age are more likely to develop a problem later in life. NCPG partners with lottery organizations, providing free resources such as press release samples, social media guidelines and advertising materials, to launch their own independent campaigns. In 2017, 54 U.S. and international lotteries participated in the Campaign. Endorsed by the World Lottery Association (WLA).
* '''NASPL/NCPG Responsible Gambling Verification Program (RGV):''' In partnership with the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, RGV is an independent review of lottery efforts to plan, implement and sustain their programs in RG in accordance with NCPG standards. Free to NASPL members.
* '''Internet Compliance Assessment Program (iCAP):''' Independent reviewers assess an internet gambling site’s compliance with NCPG’s Internet Responsible Gaming Standards, the first such standards developed for the U.S. market.
* '''Responsible Gaming Principles for Sports Gambling Legislation:''' Provides a basis for new regulations and legislation that may be enacted by individual states to allow sports betting. The principles will help protect individuals, gaming companies, and legislators by assisting the creation of reasonable efforts to prevent harm and provide treatment.
* '''Risk Education for Athletes Program (REAP):''' educates athletes of all ages about the personal and professional risks involved with gambling and how to be smart in risky situations.

The Executive Director of the NCPG, Keith Whyte, has worked for The [[American Gaming Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masscompulsivegambling.org/keithwhyte/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Health Security Strategy (NHSS)''' is a strategic plan for 2010 developed by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to help minimize the consequences associated with significant health incidents. The purpose of the plan is to provide coordination between separate organisations in order to reduce the social and economic cost in the case of a significant health incident. The strategy covers coordination of preparation and contingency planning, incident identification and recovery strategies relevant to each stakeholder in the event of a national health incident.

The aim of the document is that when a health incident occurs, all appropriate organisations will coordinate and minimise the effect of the incident on the nation. In addition to this the strategy includes a framework for the accountability and assessment of implementation including eventual assessment criteria.

The document was initially developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in consultation with stakeholder organisations as required by the [[Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]]. These include local, state, territorial, tribal and federal governments; community focus groups, private sector firms and academic advisers.

The National Health Security Strategy was first published in 2009 with an implementation schedule extending until 2014. In addition to this an interim implementation guide was published in 2010 and then every two years in order to provide additional guidance as the project matures.

==The National Health Security Strategy==
The National Health Security Strategy (NHSS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/planning/authority/nhss/strategy/Pages/default.aspx National Health Security Strategy (December 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to improve coordination and response of stakeholders in the event of a health incident, and thereby minimise the consequences of that incident. The strategy provides a framework for improvement within the scope of the [[Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]], which aims to improve the preparedness and response of the nation to emergencies.

In preparing the strategy, its developers consulted with a range of independent stakeholders, reflecting the wide scope of organisations which would be involved in the strategy. In particular, developers consulted all levels of medical organisations and government from local to federal grades. The developers also consulted with community organisations, private-sector firms and academia.

The principle of health security defined in the NHSS is built on the principle of community resilience. This means that in an emergency healthy individuals, families, and communities with access to health care, and with the knowledge and resources to know what to do to care for themselves and others would work together in both routine and emergency situations.

The NHSS was developed with the understanding that achieving improved health security at the national level is a long term proposition. The improvement of the nation's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a major health incident by coordinating many stakeholders will take significant commitment by all parties to improvement, accountability and engagement.

==Interim Implementation Guide==
In order to properly realise the strategic objectives of the NHSS, an implementation guide was produced which aids stakeholder organisations in how to comply with the strategy. The comprehensive implementation guide is produced biennially from 2010, so that it can include amendments based on the initial implementation of the strategy. In order to provide implementation guidance in the first few months, an initial interim implementation plan was also produced and released accompanying the original strategy in 2009.

The interim implementation guide describes initial implementation activities, and provides the foundation for a more complete biennial implementation planning process.

==Biennial Implementation Plan==
To help the Nation achieve national health security and to implement the first quadrennial National Health Security Strategy (NHSS) of the United States of America (2009), the U.S. Government produced and published NHSS Biennial Implementation Plan (BIP).

To help stakeholders improve national health security and to effectively implement the quadrennial National Health Security Strategy (NHSS) 2009, the U.S. Government produce and publish biennial implementation plans. These provide comprehensive guidance on implementation of the strategy for participating organisations. The first Biennial Implementation Plan was published in July 2010, six months after the strategy first began, this means the Biennial includes guidance augmented by several months of implementation.

==Legal Authority==
The [[Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]] (PAHPA) was enacted in 2006 to improve the nation’s ability to detect, prepare for, and respond to a variety of public health emergencies. Among other things, PAHPA directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a National Health Security Strategy, presented to Congress in December 2009 and to be subsequently revised every four years afterwards.  The statutory authority and requirements for the NHSS are provided under section 2802 of the Public Health Service Act.

The [[Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 307; 113th Congress)]] was enacted in 2013 to reauthorize and improve many of the programs established by the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act.&lt;ref name=307summary&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 307|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/307|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 101 of the bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to submit the National Health Security Strategy to the relevant congressional committees in 2014. The bill revises the Strategy's [[preparedness]] goals, particularly to require that regular preparedness drills also include drills and exercises to ensure medical surge capacity for events without notice.&lt;ref name="307summary" /&gt;

Section 101 of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 also requires that the National Health Security Strategy include:
:(1) provisions for increasing the preparedness, response capabilities, and surge capacity of ambulatory care facilities, [[Dentistry|dental]] health facilities, and critical care service systems;
:(2) plans for optimizing a coordinated and flexible approach to the medical surge capacity of [[hospital]]s, other health care facilities, critical care, and [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] care and emergency medical systems;
:(3) provisions taking into account the unique needs of individuals with [[Disability|disabilities]] in a [[public health]] emergency; and
:(4) strategic initiatives to advance countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any [[biological agent]] or [[toxin]] or any chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, whether naturally occurring, unintentional, or deliberate.

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">'''Occupational (or industrial) toxicology''' is the application of the principles and methodology of [[toxicology]] to understanding and managing chemical and biological hazards encountered at work. The objective of the occupational toxicologist is to prevent adverse health effects in workers that arise from exposures in their work environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Casarett and Doull’s ,TOXICOLOGY, The Basic Science of Poisons&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of [[toxicology]] has many applications. One of these, relates to [[Radiant exposure|exposure]] of people to noxious or hazardous agents during the course of their work. Field of occupational toxicology is the study of the adverse effects of agents that may be encountered by.workers during the course of their [[employment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;

The work environment has played a significant role in the occurrence of adverse human health effects due to chemical and biological hazards for centuries. Occupational health specialists, including toxicologists, rely upon human and animal data to determine safe exposure levels. If effects observed in workers can be reproduced in a laboratory animal, it becomes possible to investigate the mechanisms that might reasonably be expected to produce such effects. On the other hand, shedding light on the mechanism by which a designated effect is produced in a test animal species may make it easier to find ways to prevent such effects from occurring in humans. Such an understanding may also help to identify subtle or delayed effects that have not been observed in workers, but to which health professionals should be alerted.&lt;ref&gt;PRINCIPLES OF TOXICOLOGY , Environmental and Industrial Applications , SECOND EDITION , Edited by Phillip L. Williams,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==
Occupational exposures involve situations ranging، for example from a secretary using typewriter correction fluid to the loading and off-loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline.

== History ==

Early writings by Ulrich Ellenbog (1435–1499), [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] (1494–1555), and [[Paracelsus]] (1492–1541) revealed the toxic nature of exposures in [[mining]], [[smelting]], and [[metallurgy]].
A systematic treatise by [[Ramazzini]] (1633–1714) described the hazards as they applied to miners, chemists, metal workers, [[Driver (series)|tanners]], [[pharmacists]], grain sifters, stonecutters, sewage workers, and even corpse bearers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==How is occupational toxicology used?==
*Role in decision making within hierarchical control
*Role in setting exposure standards for workplace chemicals
*Role in biological monitoring for chemical exposure&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Biological monitoring ==
The [[measurement]] of a chemical, its [[metabolite]], or a [[biochemical]] effect in a biologic [[Biological specimen|specimen]] for the purpose of assessing [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]. Biologic [[Biomonitoring|monitoring]] is an important [[tool]] to identify the nature and amount of chemical exposures in [[occupational]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;CURRENT Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine,fourth edition Edited by Joseph LaDou&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Heavy metals]]==
[[Metal]]s with a [[density]] of more than 5 g/cm3 and [[toxic]] effects.
Including [[arsenic]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[lithium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[thorium]], have documented ototoxic potential.
The metals represent a different aspect of toxicology in that they do not undergo breakdown to other metals (to do so would be transmutation of the elements, an old alchemical principle still not possible without huge sources of energy, and a particle accelerator!). The absorption, disposition and excretion of metals are largely dependent on physical factors, such as solubility, ionisation, particle size and chemical species (for metal salts). About 70–80 elements in the periodic table are considered metals. Groups Ia and IIa, the‘s block’ metals, form monovalent and divalent cations respectively. Groups IIIb to VIb constitute the ‘p block’ elements, which include metals that can have ions of different valencies. These are called the transition elements. Of the metal elements, about 40 are considered to be ‘common’ metals. However, less than 30 have compounds that have been reported to produce toxicity. Metals are probably some of the oldest toxicants known to humans. Health effects such as colic were reported following exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury over 2000 years ago. On the other hand, metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel belong to the modern era. The importance of some of the rarer metals may become apparent with emerging changes in technology, such as microelectronics and superconductors. The toxicity of a metal is only partially related to its position in the periodic table. Toxicity decreases with the stability of the configuration of electrons in the atomic nuclei. This produces a number of properties that can affect toxicity&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Pasqual Maragall Foundation for Research on Alzheimer''' was founded to answer publicly the commitment made by [[Pasqual Maragall]], President of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (Government of Catalonia 2003–2006) and Mayor of [[Barcelona]] (1982–1997), in October 2007, when he announced that he had been diagnosed with the disease.

The Foundation was established in April 2008, and is led by Dr. [[Jordi Camí]], director and promoter of the [[Barcelona Biomedical Research Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prbb.org/contingut/part00?from_action=eng_part00 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706034255/http://www.prbb.org/contingut/part00?from_action=eng_part00 |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation promotes scientific research into the prevention and cure of [[Alzheimer's]] and related [[neurodegenerative]] diseases and aims to create a dedicated scientific research center.

== Future Institute for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases ==
The research center is planned and directed by an international scientific council with the aim of becoming a global benchmark in the field of [[neuroscience]]. The center will host young researchers from around the world, and it will provide them with unrestricted support. The Institute will also lead interdisciplinary teams, risky projects and will be committed to cross-border research programs following the high-risk/high-reward research philosophy.

== International ambition ==
The foundation has established contacts and partnerships with two international centers: the [[Lou Ruvo Brain Institute]] in Las Vegas, headed by Professor Zaven Khachaturian, and the [[Janelia Farm Research Campus]] at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], in Ashburn, Virginia, United States.

In order to internationalize the project, an American corporation associated with the Foundation was created in September 2008; the Friends of Pasqual Maragall Foundation. This partner aims to deploy an international scientific network and assist in raising resources.

'''Pediatric neuropsychology''' (paediatric in the UK) is a sub-speciality within the field of [[clinical neuropsychology]] that studies the relationship between brain health and behaviour in children.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Ivnik , Kathleen Y. Haaland &amp; Linas A. Bieliauskas (2000): AMERICAN BOARD OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY SPECIAL PRESENTATION The American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology (ABCN), 2000 Update, The Clinical Neuropsychologist, 14:3, 261-268&lt;/ref&gt; Many pediatric neuropsychologists are involved in teaching, research, supervision, and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the field.

In the United States undergraduate and graduate psychology programs generally do not offer a "track" in pediatric neuropsychology, per se. Specific supervised training in pediatric neuropsychology typically begins at the internship or postdoctoral level, as the graduate student is completing or has just completed a PhD or PsyD in clinical child psychology, pediatric psychology, clinical neuropsychology, or school psychology.

In the UK formal Clinical Paediatric Neuropsychology Training is available via [http://Page%20title%20or%20URLhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropsych UCL]. This makes up part of the [http://www.bps.org.uk/ British Psychological Society's] (BPS) criteria for accreditation as a Paediatric Clinical Neuropsychologist, known as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120203043507/http://exams.bps.org.uk/exams/clinical-neuropsychology/qcn.cfm Qualification in Clinical Neuropsychology (QiCN)]. Other requirements included documented supervised practise and the submission of a portfolio of clinical cases. Once completed paediatric clinical neuropsychologists are eligible to be on the [http://www.bps.org.uk/bpssearchablelists/SRCN Specialist Register of Clinical Neuropsychology] run by the BPS

==Definition==
Most pediatric neuropsychologists have several years of post-doctoral training regarding developmental or acquired neuropathology in children. Pediatric neuropsychologists work in any setting where children with [[central nervous system]] dysfunction are treated. This includes neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry practices as well as in hospital and outpatient settings.  In addition to assessing and treating children with medical disorders such as [[traumatic brain injury]], brain tumors or epilepsy, pediatric neuropsychologists work with children who have [[Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD), learning disabilities, intellectual and developmental disorders ([[mental retardation]]), [[autism spectrum]] disorders. Some may work in other settings, such as schools, and provide more traditional mental health services as well.

In the United States, consistent with the current American Psychological Association's definition, "proficiencies can only be acquired through appropriate education and training focused quite specifically and intensively on defined content".

People in the field are sometimes referred to as "neurodevelopmentalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shea|first1=SE|last2=Gordon|first2=K|last3=Hawkins|first3=A|last4=Kawchuk|first4=J|last5=Smith|first5=D|title=Pathology in the Hundred Acre Wood: a neurodevelopmental perspective on A.A.

==Five maxims==
In many ways, pediatric and adult neuropsychological practice are the same, but there are important differences. Some of these differences can be seen as [[Wikt:maxim|maxims]] of neuropsychological practice with children include:&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, K. O., Ris, M. D., Taylor, H. G., &amp; Pennington, B. F. (2010). Pediatric neuropsychology research, theory and practice. (2nd ed., Vol. 1, pp. 475-483). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Maturation is a paramount force in pediatric neuropsychology
# Adult brain-behavior relationship rules do not invariably apply to children
# A model of normal development provides clinical critical context.
# Pediatric neuropsychological methods are distinctive
# Genetic, socio-environmental and family factors have primacy for evaluation

== A pediatric neuropsychological evaluation==
* A clinical interview and observations of the child
* An interview of significant others if possible 
* A review of any relevant school and or medical records and 
* Administration of standardised tests that measure brain functions, such as: attention, executive functioning, memory, language, behavioral/emotional functioning, visuospatial abilities, fine motor skills and others. The tests are selected based on the child's presenting problems, age, developmental status, language and cultural considerations.
* Integration of the clinical history, observations, collateral information, and test results, with relevant research and clinical experience, to formulate and convey diagnostic impressions and recommendations.

The neuropsychological evaluation is used to determine the pattern of brain-related strengths and weaknesses to understand the origin of the problem and to make a diagnosis. Often, this will guide specific treatment recommendations. Pediatric neuropsychological evaluations are performed by licensed professionals and are helpful in determining functional outcomes and guiding interventions related to genetic syndromes, prenatal influences on development, systemic illness affecting the nervous system, acquired brain injuries or developmental conditions such as autism or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, C. H., Blackburn, L. B., Arffa, S., Barth, J. T., Bush, S. S., Koffler, S. P., Pliskin, N. H., &amp; Reynolds, C. R. (2006). The importance of neuropsychological assessment for the evaluation of childhood learning disorders. NAN policy and planning committee. Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, (21), 741-744.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders commonly evaluated by pediatric neuropsychologists==
*Developmental Disabilities
**Speech and Language Impairment (of unknown origin)
**ADHD and Learning Disabilities
**Intellectual Disability
**Autism Spectrum Disorder
*Genetic and metabolic syndromes (e.g., [[phenylketonuria]], [[Down syndrome]], [[neurofibromatosis]], [[Turner syndrome]])
*Acquired Neuropsychological Disorders
**Prenatal Substance Exposure (e.g., [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]], Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder)
**Hypoxic-Ischemic Injuries (e.g.,  periventricular leukomalacia associated with prematurity; near-drowning [[asphyxia]])
**Other prenatal anomalies ([[amniotic band syndrome]], [[spina bifida]] [[myelomeningocele]])

**Cerebrovascular disease (ischemia, thrombosis, embolism, infarct, arteriovenous malformation)
**Neurological conditions of varying etiology ([[epilepsy]], [[hydrocephalus]], cysts, demyelination)
**Systemic illness affecting brain development or function (e.g., [[HIV/AIDS]], [[meningitis]], [[encephalitis]], [[leukemia]], [[sickle cell disease]])
**Organ dysfunction affecting brain development or function, e.g., Cardiac, Circulatory, Renal, Hepatic, or Pulmonary Problems
**Psychiatric Disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, somatization)&lt;ref&gt;Gouvier, W. M. D., Baumeister, A., &amp; Ijaola, K., (2009). Neuropsychological disorders of children. In J. L. Matson, F.

==Board certification==
In the United States and Canada, each state or province licenses professionals to practice psychology. Additionally, two boards specifically examine and certify neuropsychologists engaged in pediatric practice:

* The American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology, a subsidiary of the American Academy of Pediatric Neuropsychology, is an exclusively pediatric board.
* The American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, a specialty board of the American Board of Professional Psychology, provides board certification for clinical neuropsychologists who subspecialize with different populations, including pediatric, lifespan, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury rehabilitation, geriatric, forensic work, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, I.S., et al.

'''Pipe Smoker of the Year''' was an [[award]] given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous [[pipe-smoking]] individual. Initiated in 1965 as '''Pipeman of the Year''' by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's [[Savoy Hotel]] each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco.&lt;ref name="indo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/annual-pipe-smoker-award-is-extinguished-74202.html|title=Annual pipe-smoker award is extinguished|last=Thompson|first=Jonathan|date=2004-01-18|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News and Media|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at [[Newark Showground]]. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=lower-roman|refs=
&lt;ref name="Y67"&gt;Warren Mitchell did not accept his award, calling it "silly". "I smoke a pipe; I also use a lavatory brush. By the same token you could make me 'lavatory brush man of the year.'" ''The Guardian'' 13 January 1968&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Y72"&gt;Until 1972 the award was made for the pipe smoker of the ''previous'' year; from 1973 onwards it was for the forthcoming year. Manny Shinwell, who held the award throughout 1972, was subsequently listed as the "1971/1972" winner.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Y80"&gt;Edward Fox accepted his award but declined the prize of three pipes and a quantity of his favourite tobacco and asked for the cash value, about £100, to be sent to help Cambodian refugees. ''The Times'' 25 January 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 15''' of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] contains guaranteed [[Social equality|equality right]]s. As part of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], the section prohibits certain forms of [[discrimination]] perpetrated by the governments of [[Canada]] with the exception of ameliorative programs ([[affirmative action]]) and rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools ([[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|religious education]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mendes|editor1-first=Errol|editor2-last=Beaulac|editor2-first=Stéfane |title=Charte canadienne des droits et libertés / Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|date=2013|publisher=LexisNexis Canada|location=Markham, ON|isbn=9780433471400|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights under section 15 include [[racial equality]], [[sexual equality]], mental [[disability]], and physical disability. In its jurisprudence, it has also been a source of [[gay rights in Canada]]. These rights are guaranteed to "every individual", that is, every [[natural person]]. This wording excludes "[[legal person]]s" such as corporations, contrasting other sections that use the word "everyone", where "legal persons" were meant to be included. Section 15 has been in force since 1985.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Equality Rights" this section states: 
{{cquote|15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.}}

==Background==
The [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] of 1960 had guaranteed the "right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law."  Equal protection of the law is a right that has been guaranteed by the [[Equal Protection Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] since 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), 1067.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 15 itself dates back to the earliest draft of the Charter, published in October 1980, but it was worded differently. It read,

{{cquote|(1) Everyone has the right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the law without discrimination because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex.

(2) This section does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged persons or groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1062–1063.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the drafting, the guarantee to "everyone" was dropped in favour of "every individual," with the intent that corporations could not invoke equality rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, page 744.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, while the original version spoke of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, the section ultimately enacted included guarantees of equality under the law and equal benefit of the law. The reason for these additions was to encourage a generous reading of section 15. In the Bill of Rights cases ''[[Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell]]'' (1974) and ''[[Bliss v. Canada (Attorney General)|Bliss v. Canada]]'' (1979), Supreme Court Justice [[Roland Ritchie]] had said only the application, and not the outcome, of the law must be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equality under the law; and that legal benefits need not be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equal benefit of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1066–1067.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Charter itself came into effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not [[coming into force|brought into force]] until April 17, 1985, in accordance with [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32(2)]] of the Charter. The reason for this was so that provincial and federal governments would have enough time to review their legislation and make the appropriate changes to any discriminatory laws.

==Meaning and purpose of equality==
According to the Supreme Court of Canada's Section 15 jurisprudence, the equality guarantees of section 15 are aimed at preventing the "violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political and social prejudices, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration." (Iacobucci J. in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', [1999])

To that end, the Charter recognizes four dimensions of equality, including [[substantive equality]].

* ''Equality before the law'' is equality in the administration of justice, where all individuals are subject to the same criminal laws in the same manner by law enforcement and the courts.
* ''Equality under the law'' is equality in the substance of the law, where the content of the law is equal and fair to everyone so that everyone experiences the same result.
* ''Equal benefit of the law'' ensures that benefits imposed by law will be proportionate.
* ''Equal protection of the law'' ensure that the protections imposed by law will be proportionate so that the human dignity of every person is equally safeguarded by the law.

Unlike formal equality, which overlooks personal differences, substantive equality is concerned with the impact of the law on different groups of individuals. Substantive equality requires that there be an equal impact on the person affected by the law.

==Application of section fifteen==
In any challenge of section 15(1) the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is always on the claimant. The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed a [[purposive interpretation]] of Section 15.

===Current interpretation===
After ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999) the question of whether dignity was affected was key to a section 15 analysis. In ''[[R. v. Kapp]]'' (2008), the problems with the dignity analysis were recognized and the dignity analysis was jettisoned. The Court established a two-part test based on the one found in ''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'' (1989): (1) Does the law create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground? (2) Does the distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?

In ''[[Quebec (Attorney General) v. A]]'' (2013) a majority of the Court found that perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping did not form an additional requirement in the second part of the test. The majority itself split on the correct way to apply the second part of the test, leaving the present state of the law on Section 15 unclear.

====Enumerated or analogous grounds====
[[Image:Hendricks-leboeuf2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Discrimination based upon [[sexual orientation]] is an analogous ground for discrimination, leading all but two provincial courts to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Canada]].]]

The concept of ''enumerated or analogous grounds'' originated in the essential 1989 ''Andrews'' case to refer to personal characteristics that, when being the basis of discrimination, show the discrimination is unconstitutional under section 15. There are nine enumerated grounds explicitly mentioned in section 15, although they are not actually numbered. In practice, the enumerated grounds have been given liberal and broad interpretations. For example, discrimination on the basis of [[pregnancy]] has been ruled to be sex discrimination (''[[Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.]]'').

As section 15's words "in particular" hint that the explicitly named grounds do not exhaust the scope of section 15, additional grounds can be considered if it can be shown that the group or individual's equality rights were denied in comparison with another group that shares all of the same characteristics except for the personal characteristic at issue. A personal characteristic is considered ''analogous'' to the ones enumerated in section 15 if it is "immutable" or cannot be changed or can only be changed at excessive cost (constructively immutable). Thus far, several analogous grounds have been identified:

* [[sexual orientation]] (''[[Egan v. Canada]]'' [1995], ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' [1998], ''[[M. v. H.]]'' [1999]  ''[[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada]]'' [2000])  This finding has led provincial courts (the Supreme Court declined in ''[[Reference re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' to rule on the issue as the government had voiced its intent to legalize them anyway) to find that laws against [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] would be unconstitutional. In ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2003), the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] used section 15 to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Ontario]].
* [[marriage|marital status]] (''[[Miron v. Trudel]]'', [1995], ''[[Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh|Nova Scotia v. Walsh]]'' [2002]),
* off-reserve aboriginal status/"Aboriginality-residence" (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'').
* citizenship (''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'', [1989], ''[[Lavoie v. Canada]]'' [2000])

As well, the courts have rejected several analogous grounds including:
* having a "taste for marijuana". (''[[R. v. Malmo-Levine]]'')
* employment status (''Reference Re Workers' Compensation Act'' [1989], ''Delisle v. Canada'' [1999])
* litigants against the Crown (''Rudolph Wolff v. Canada'' [1990])
* province of prosecution/residence (''[[R. v. Turpin]]'' [1989], R. v. S. (S.) [1990])
* membership in military (''[[R. v. Genereux]]'')
* new resident of province (''[[Haig v. Canada]]'')
* persons committing crimes outside Canada (''[[R. v. Finta]]'')
* begging and extreme poverty (''[[R. v. Banks]]'')

===Past interpretations: the Law test===
As first outlined in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', discrimination can be identified through a three-step test.

# Did the ''law, program, or activity'' impose ''differential treatment'' between the claimant and a comparator group? That is, was a distinction created between the groups in purpose or effect?
# If so, was the differential treatment based on ''enumerated or analogous'' grounds?
# If so, did the law in question have a purpose or effect that is ''discriminatory'' within the meaning of the equality guarantee?

====Differential treatment====
This step asks whether there is a formal distinction between the claimant and a comparator group based on one or more personal characteristics or else does it fail to take into account the claimant's current disadvantaged position?

The selection of the ''comparator group'' is integral. They must possess all the qualities of the claimant except for the personal characteristic at issue. (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'' [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203)  In ''[[Hodge v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development)]]'' (2004), it was noted that a court may reject a claimant's choice for a comparator group, and that choosing the wrong comparator group may cause the rights claim to fail.

In ''[[Withler v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2011), the Supreme Court has jettisoned the ''comparator group'' requirement, mandating that instead a contextual analysis is the way to go. They recognized that comparator group analysis was leading to much injustice, something also noted in ''R. v. Kapp''.

====Discrimination====
For discrimination to be found it must be determined if the burden or denial of benefit harms an individual's ''human dignity'' (''Law v. Canada''). That is, the discrimination will marginalize, ignore, or devalue an individual's sense of ''self-respect'' and ''self-worth''.

''Law'' suggests four "contextual factors" which  can help guide a contextual analysis of whether the imputed distinction violates the human dignity of the claimant. None of these are determinative of discrimination, and the Court must not consider all of them in every case. This list is also not exhaustive, although the standard ''Law'' analysis has yet to develop any additional factors:

# ''pre-existing disadvantage''
# ''correlation between the grounds of the claim and the actual needs, capacities, and circumstances''
# ''ameliorative purpose or effect of the law on more disadvantaged groups''
# ''nature and scope of interest''

Jurisprudence has shown that each of these factors are weighed differently depending on the context.

Pre-existing disadvantage asks whether there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In ''Corbiere v. Canada'' McLachlin described this factor to be the most compelling and suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in ''Trociuk v. British Columbia''.

With correlation between grounds and reality, the claimant must show that there is a link between the grounds raise and the claimant's actual needs, circumstances, and capacities. Discrimination will be more difficult to establish if the law takes the qualities of the claimant into account. In ''[[Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' [2002] the court was sharply divided on this point. The majority said that the law that provided less social assistance to youth was connected to the ability of youth to find employment easily. However, the dissenters insisted that the evidence did not show this to be actual qualities, but were rather stereotypes.

The ameliorative purpose factor asks whether there is a distinction made for the purpose of aiding an even less advantaged group. If this can be shown then it is unlikely that the claimant would be able to show a violation of their dignity. However, ''Lovelace v. Ontario'' warned that the analysis should not be reduced to a balancing of relative disadvantages.

The final factor of nature and scope considers the nature and scope of the interest affected by the law. The more severe and localized the results of the law for those affected the more likely to show that the distinctions in treatment responsible are discriminatory.

==Enforcement==
Section 15, like the rest of the Charter, is mainly enforced by the courts through litigation under [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 24]] and 52 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. Such litigation can be very costly.

To overcome this barrier, the federal government expanded the Court Challenges Program of Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml Court Challenges Program of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411165618/http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml |date=2006-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 to fund test cases challenging federal legislation in relation to the equality rights guaranteed by the Charter. Some funding has been provided to challenge provincial laws under a variety of programs in the past, but its availability has varied considerably from province to province.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Peltz &amp; Betsy Gibbons, [http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html "Deep Discount Justice: The Challenge of Going to Court with a Charter Claim and No Money"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509063345/http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html |date=2006-05-09 }}, 1999. URL accessed on March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Conservative federal government announced that it would be "trimming the fat and refocusing spending on the priorities of Canadians." This included cutting all funding to the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html "Press Release"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128092005/http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html |date=2006-11-28 }}, URL accessed on December 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the newly elected Liberal government announced they would be providing $5 million annually to restore the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.budget.gc.ca/2016/docs/plan/ch5-en.html "Budget 2016: Chapter 5 - An Inclusive and Fair Canada"], URL accessed on April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">The '''Tobacco and Vaping Products Act''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[law]] to regulate the production, marketing and sale of [[tobacco]] and [[vaping]] products. The law was introduced as the ''Tobacco Act'', Bill C-71 during the [[35th Canadian Parliament]] in 1997, which replaced the former ''Tobacco Sales To Young Persons Act'' of 1994 as well as the ''Tobacco Products Control Act'' of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Legislation and Regulatory Action|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/modules/prb98-8-tobacco/legislation.htm|publisher=Parliamentary Research Branch|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahood|first=Garfield|title=Warnings that tell the truth: breaking new ground in Canada|journal=Tobacco Control|year=1999|volume=8|issue=4|page=356|doi=10.1136/tc.8.4.356|pmc=1759750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tobacco Act was amended on July 5, 2010&lt;ref name="tobact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-11.5/|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed to ''Tobacco and Vaping Products Act'' in 2018 when similar laws concerning vaping products were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-plain-packaging-vaping-law-1.4662112 |publisher=CBC News |title=Parliament passes plain tobacco packaging law, regulates vaping |first=John Paul |last=Tasker |date=May 16, 2018 |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the act is to protect the health of Canadians by imposing limits on the sale and production of tobacco products. It increases awareness of the health risks associated with use of tobacco products. The act also protects young people by restricting the age of purchase.&lt;ref name="tobact" /&gt;

== Regulations Made Under The Act ==

=== Tobacco (Access) Regulations ===
The [[smoking age#Canada|legal age]] to purchase tobacco products varies with each province. A person may be asked for documentation to verify their age before purchasing a tobacco product. Under the act, suitable forms of identification includes a [[driver's license]], [[passport]], Canadian permanent resident document, certificate of Canadian citizenship with signature, or a Canadian Armed Forces identification card. Forms of identification issued by a provincial, federal, or foreign government with a signature, photo, and date of birth are also accepted. In addition, every retailer must a place a sign near the tobacco products. The sign must adhere to the specifications outlined in the Tobacco Act. It must be in a visible location with a surface area no smaller than 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the following text:
:"It is prohibited by federal law to provide tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. Il est interdit par la loi fédérale de fournir des produits du tabac aux personnes âgées de moins de 18 ans.”&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco (Access) Regulations|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-93/page-1.html|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars) ===
[[Tobacco]] products must have legible packaging with text in both of [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Canada's official languages]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The package must contain health warnings and information on toxic emissions, either in the form of text or pictures and text. They must be displayed on equal opposite sides of the packaging, on the largest visible side, and on the lid. The warnings may also be included on a leaflet that is visible when accessing the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars)|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2011-177/index.html|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promotion of Tobacco Products and Accessories Regulations (Prohibited Terms) ===
The Tobacco Act prohibits the promotion and advertising of tobacco products when the terms "light" or "mild" are used. This applies to products, packaging, and accessories associated with tobacco. A retailer also cannot display these products if "light" and "mild" are on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promotion of Tobacco Products and Accessories Regulations (Prohibited Terms)|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2011-178/index.html|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cigarette Ignition Propensity Regulations ===
The act requires that every brand of cigarettes manufactured on or after October 1, 2005 be tested by manufacturers to make sure the cigarette burns up completely less than 25% of the time. The test is to be conducted using 10 layers of filter paper and each cigarette tested must be of the same brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cigarette Ignition Propensity Regulations|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-178/page-1.html|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12122">'''Transgenerational trauma''' is trauma that is transferred from the first generation of trauma survivors to the second and further generations of offspring of the survivors via ''[[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]'' mechanisms.

==History==

Soon after descriptions of ''concentration camp syndrome'' (also known as [[survivor syndrome]]) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that large numbers of children of [[Holocaust]] survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in [[Canada]]. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Fossion, P., Rejas, M., Servais, L., Pelc, I. &amp; Hirsch, S. (2003). "Family approach with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors," ''American Journal of Psychotherapy,'' 57(4), 519-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of children of traumatized parents being affected directly or indirectly by their parents’ post-traumatic symptoms has been described by some authors as ''secondary traumatisation'' (in reference to the ''second generation''). To include the ''third generation'', as well, the term intergenerational transmission of trauma was introduced.  Building upon the clinical observations by [[Selma Fraiberg]], child trauma researchers such as Byron Egeland, Inge Bretherton, and [[Daniel Schechter]] have empirically identified psychological mechanisms that favor intergenerational transmission, including dissociation in the context of attachment, and "communication"{{clarify|date=September 2017}} of prior traumatic experience as an effect of parental efforts to maintain self-regulation in the context of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and related alterations in social cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Fraiberg S, Adelson E, Shapiro V (1975).Ghosts in the nursery. A psychoanalytic approach to the problems of impaired infant-mother relationships. Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry,14(3), 387-421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egeland B, Susman-Stillman A (1996). Dissociation as a mediator of child abuse across generations. Child Abuse Negl.20(11):1123-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton I (1990). Communication patterns, internal working models, and the intergenerational transmission of attachment relationships. Infant Mental Health Journal, 11(3), 237-251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS (2003).  Intergenerational communication of maternal violent trauma:  Understanding the interplay of reflective functioning and posttraumatic psychopathology.  In S.W. Coates, J.L. Rosenthal and D.S. Schechter (eds.)  September 11:  Trauma and Human Bonds.  Hillside, NJ:  Analytic Press, Inc. pp. 115-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A., Robinson JL (2007). Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children’s mental representations of self and others.  Attachment &amp; Human Development, 9(3), 187-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both survivors and immediate witnesses of traumatic events in family history have traditionally been treated by family therapists. The first-generation experiences of combat veterans, hostages, prisoners of war, and the civil population who was victimized at the hands of [[war criminals]] from genocidal organizations such as the German [[Nazi Party]], Italian [[Mario Roatta|Fascist]] party, and similar organizations and their (para-)military arms, have been dealt with within the confines of political arena and international law, however the descendants of both immediate witnesses and victims of genocide, colonial suppression, slavery, political totalitarian control, clerical abuse in religious organizations, and many survivors of [[terrorism]] had to deal with the [[victimization sequelae symptoms|victimization symptoms]] themselves, without the transfer of original trauma being recognized and help offered.

Enslavement and slavery, civil and domestic violence, sexual abuse, and extreme poverty are also sources of trauma that can be transferred to subsequent generations. For instance, survivors of child sexual abuse may negatively influence future generations due to past untreated or unresolved trauma which can increase feelings of mistrust, isolation, and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frazier|first=Kimberly|last2=West-Olatunji|first2=Cirecie|last3=St. Juste|first3=Shirley|last4=Goodman|first4=Rachael|date=2009|title=Transgenerational Trauma and Child Sexual Abuse: Reconceptualizing Cases Involving Young Survivors of CSA|url=https://pinnacle-secure.allenpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.17744%2Fmehc.31.1.u72580m253524811%3Fcode%3Damhc-site&amp;code=amhc-site|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|language=en-US|volume=31|issue=1|pages=22–33|doi=10.17744/mehc.31.1.u72580m253524811|issn=1040-2861|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman and West-Olatunji proposed potential transgenerational trauma in the aftermath of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Rachael|last2=West-Olatunji|first2=Cirecie|date=2008|title=Transgenerational Trauma and Resilience: Improving Mental Health Counseling for Survivors of Hurricane Katrina|url=https://pinnacle-secure.allenpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.17744%2Fmehc.30.2.q52260n242204r84%3Fcode%3Damhc-site&amp;code=amhc-site|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|language=en-US|volume=30|issue=2|pages=121–136|doi=10.17744/mehc.30.2.q52260n242204r84|issn=1040-2861|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, residents have seen a dramatic increase in interpersonal violence with higher mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-neworleans-katrina-crime/slow-recovery-goes-on-in-crime-weary-new-orleans-idUSN2827931220070829|title=Slow recovery goes on in crime-wear New Orleans|last=Franks|first=J.|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=9 August 2007|dead-url=|access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been reported in the descendants of students at [[American Indian boarding schools]], who were removed from their parents and extended family and lacked models for parenting as a result. Being punished for speaking their native language and forbidden from practicing traditional rituals had a traumatic effect on many students, and child abuse was rampant in the schools as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ann M.

==Transmission==

{{About|Transmission (medicine)|other uses| Transmission (disambiguation){{!}} Transmission |}}

In [[medicine]], [[public health]], and [[biology]], '''transmission''' is the passing of a pathogen causing [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]] from an infected [[host (biology)|host]] individual or group to a particular individual or group, regardless of whether the other individual was previously infected.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, A.O. ''et al.'' (2001) Parasitism: the diversity and ecology of animal parasites. ''Cambridge University Press''. Pp 391-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term strictly refers to the transmission of [[microorganism]]s directly from one individual to another by one or more of the following means:
* droplet contact – coughing or sneezing on another individual
* direct physical contact – touching an infected individual, including sexual contact
* indirect physical contact – usually by touching a contaminated surface, including [[soil]] ([[fomite]])
* airborne transmission – if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods
* [[fecal-oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] – usually from unwashed hands, contaminated food or water sources due to lack of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]], an important transmission route in pediatrics, veterinary medicine and developing countries.

Transmission can also be indirect, via another [[organism]], either a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] (e.g. a [[mosquito]] or fly) or an intermediate [[host (biology)|host]] (e.g. [[Taenia solium|tapeworm in pigs]] can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked [[pork]]). Indirect transmission could involve [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] or, more typically, larger [[pathogen]]s like [[macroparasite]]s with more complex [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]s. Transmissions can be [[autochthonous transmission|autochthonous]] (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.

==Definition and related terms==
An [[infectious disease]] agent can be transmitted in two ways: as {{visible anchor|horizontal}} disease agent transmission from one individual to another in the same generation (peers in the same age group)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/Horizontal+Disease+Transmission.asp?q=Horizontal+Disease+Transmission Horizontal Disease Transmission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927140147/http://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/Horizontal+Disease+Transmission.asp?q=Horizontal+Disease+Transmission |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''online-medical-dictionary.org''. date ?&lt;/ref&gt;  by either direct contact (licking, touching, biting), or indirect contact through air – cough or sneeze ([[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] or [[fomites]] that allow the transmission of the agent causing the disease without physical contact)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/archives/IVM/ENG/Modes/routes.htm Routes of transmission of infectious diseases agents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315032413/http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/archives/IVM/ENG/Modes/routes.htm |date=2012-03-15 }} from &lt;u&gt;Modes of Introduction of Exotic Animal Disease Agents&lt;/u&gt; by Katharine M. Kurkjian &amp; Susan E. Little of The University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, date?&lt;/ref&gt;
or by [[vertical disease transmission]], passing the agent causing the disease from parent to offspring, such as in prenatal or [[perinatal transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7982 Vertical transmission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328061254/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7982 |date=2007-03-28 }} ''(definition -- medterms.com)'' date?&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[infectivity]]'' describes the ability of an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the ''infectiousness'' of a disease agent indicates the comparative ease with which the disease agent is transmitted to other hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm | title=Glossary of Notifiable Conditions | publisher=Washington State Department of Health | accessdate=2010-02-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm | archivedate=2010-01-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission of pathogen can occur in various ways including physical contact, contaminated food, body fluids, objects, airborne inhalation, or through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] organisms.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes==

The route of transmission is important to [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene due to the lack of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as [[cholera]]. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that [[polio]] is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route.

===Airborne===
{{Further|Airborne disease}}

"Airborne transmission refers to infectious agents that are spread via droplet nuclei (residue from evaporated droplets) containing infective microorganisms. These organisms can survive outside the body and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. They infect others via the upper and lower respiratory tracts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cd33_icg_clinical_ed_guide_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034015/http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cd33_icg_clinical_ed_guide_web.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases that are commonly spread by coughing or sneezing include bacterial [[meningitis]], [[chickenpox]], [[Acute viral nasopharyngitis (common cold)|common cold]], [[influenza]], [[mumps]], [[strep throat]], [[tuberculosis]], [[measles]], [[rubella]], [[whooping cough]], [[SARS]] and [[leprosy]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==={{visible anchor|Droplet}}===
"Droplet transmission occurs when respiratory droplets generated via coughing, sneezing or talking contact susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes, nose or mouth.  Transmission may also occur indirectly via contact with contaminated formites with hands and then mucosal surfaces. Respiratory droplets are large and are not able to remain suspended in the air thus they are usually dispersed over short distances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Educators Guide for the prevention and control of infection in healthcare|publisher=NHMRC, Commonwealth of Australia|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cd33_icg_clinical_ed_guide_web.pdf|date=2010|accessdate=2015-09-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034015/http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cd33_icg_clinical_ed_guide_web.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathogen-containing particles, also called ''Flügge droplets'' (after [[Carl Flügge]]), are 0,1–2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, and are reduced by evaporation to ''droplet nuclei'' – small (smaller than 100 μ in diameter), dry particles that can remain airborne for long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=HARE R |title=THE TRANSMISSION OF RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Med. |volume=57 |issue= |pages=221–30 |year=1964 |pmid=14130877 |pmc=1897886 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms spread by droplet transmission include respiratory viruses (e.g., [[influenza]], [[parainfluenza]] virus, [[adenovirus]], [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[human metapneumovirus]]), ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', [[pneumococci]], [[diphtheria]], and rubella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/d/diseases_contagious_from_droplets/basics.htm|title=What is Diseases contagious from droplets?|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716185815/http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/d/diseases_contagious_from_droplets/basics.htm|archivedate=2015-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fecal–oral===
{{Main|Fecal–oral route}}
In the fecal-oral route, [[pathogens]] in [[Feces|fecal]] particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person. Main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate [[sanitation]] and poor [[hygiene]] practices - which can take various forms.

Fecal oral transmission can be via foodstuffs or water that has become contaminated. This can happen when people do not adequately [[Hand washing|wash their hands]] after using the [[toilet]] and before preparing food or tending to patients.

The fecal-oral route of transmission can be a public health risk for people in [[developing countries]] who live in urban [[slum]]s without access to adequate sanitation. Here, [[Human excreta|excreta]] or untreated [[sewage]] can pollute drinking water sources ([[Groundwater pollution|groundwater]] or surface water). The people who drink the [[Water pollution|polluted water]] can become infected. Another problem in some developing countries, such as India, is [[open defecation]] which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route.

Even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a [[sanitary sewer overflow]].  This is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of for example: [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[polio]], [[Rotavirus]], ''[[Salmonella]]'', and [[parasite]]s (e.g. ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'').

===Sexual===
{{main|Sexually transmitted disease}}
This refers to any disease that can be caught during sexual activity with another person, including [[sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[anal sex]] or (less commonly) through [[oral sex]] (see below). Transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse (the usual route for [[bacterium|bacteria]]l infections and those infections causing sores) or from secretions ([[semen]] or the fluid secreted by the excited female) which carry infectious agents that get into the partner's blood stream through tiny tears in the [[penis]], [[vagina]] or [[rectum]] (this is a more usual route for [[virus]]es). In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since the penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is more elastic and more accommodating.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some diseases transmissible by the sexual route include [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[genital warts]], [[gonorrhea]], [[hepatitis B]], [[syphilis]], [[herpes]], and [[trichomoniasis]].

====Oral sexual====
[[Sexually transmitted disease]]s such as HIV and hepatitis B are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth-to-mouth contact, although it is possible to transmit some STDs between the genitals and the mouth, during oral sex.  In the case of HIV this possibility has been established. It is also responsible for the increased incidence of [[herpes simplex virus]] 1 (which is usually responsible for oral infections) in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus (more common genitally) in oral infections.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Oral===
Diseases that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as [[kiss]]ing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette. Diseases that are known to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the diseases transmissible by droplet contact and (at least) all forms of [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]], namely [[Cytomegalovirus]] infections  herpes simplex virus (especially HSV-1) and [[infectious mononucleosis]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Direct contact===
{{Further|Contagious disease}}
Diseases that can be transmitted by direct contact are called contagious (contagious is not the same as infectious; although all [[contagious diseases]] are infectious, not all infectious diseases are contagious). These diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel (where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies) or items of clothing in close contact with the body (socks, for example) if they are not washed thoroughly between uses. For this reason, contagious diseases often break out in schools, where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped in the changing rooms.

Some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include [[athlete's foot]], [[impetigo]], syphilis (on rare occasions, if an uninfected person touches a [[chancre]]), [[wart]]s, and conjunctivitis. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Vertical===
{{Main|Vertically transmitted disease}}
This is from mother to child (more rarely father to child), often ''in utero'', during [[childbirth]] (also referred to as [[perinatal infection]]) or during postnatal physical contact between parents and offspring. In mammals, including humans, it occurs also via [[breastfeeding|breast milk]] (transmammary transmission). [[Infectious disease]]s that can be transmitted in this way include: HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ebert|first1=Dieter|title=The Epidemiology and Evolution of Symbionts with Mixed-Mode Transmission|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=2013|volume=44|pages=623–643|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-032513-100555|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-032513-100555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iatrogenic===
Transmission [[iatrogenic|due to medical procedures]], such as touching a wound, an [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or [[organ transplant|transplantation]] of infected material. Some diseases that can be transmitted [[iatrogenic]]ally include:
[[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] by injection of contaminated human [[growth hormone]], [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and many more.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Vector-borne===
{{Further|Vector (epidemiology)}}
A ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]'' is an [[organism]] that does not cause disease itself but that transmits [[infection]] by conveying [[pathogen]]s from one [[Host (biology)|host]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metapathogen.com Pathogens and vectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124020044/http://www.metapathogen.com/ |date=2015-01-24 }}. ''MetaPathogen.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vectors may be mechanical or biological. A mechanical vector picks up an infectious agent on the outside of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a [[housefly]], which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious [[blood-borne disease]]s, such as [[malaria]], [[viral encephalitis]], [[Chagas disease]], [[Lyme disease]] and [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]]. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, [[arthropod]]s, such as [[mosquito]]es, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s and [[Louse|lice]]. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Tracking==
{{see also|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease}}
Tracking the transmission of infectious diseases is called [[disease surveillance]]. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of [[public health]] agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of [[reportable disease]]s to them. The analysis of [[aggregate data]] can show the spread of a disease and is at the core of the specialty of [[epidemiology]].
To understand the spread of the vast majority of non-notifiable diseases, data either need to be collected in a particular study, or existing data collections can be mined, such as insurance company data or antimicrobial drug sales for example.

For diseases transmitted within an institution, such as a hospital, prison, nursing home, boarding school, orphanage, refugee camp etc., [[infection control]] specialists are employed, who will review medical records to analyze transmission as part of a hospital epidemiology program, for example.

Because these traditional methods are slow, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, [[proxy (statistics)|proxies]] of transmission have been sought. One proxy in the case of influenza is tracking of [[influenza-like illness]] at certain sentinel sites of health care practitioners within a state, for example.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Polgreen, E. Chen, A.M. Segre, M. Harris, M. Pentella, G. Rushton. Optimizing Influenza Sentinel Surveillance at the State Level American Journal of Epidemiology, 170 (November 2009), pp 1300–1306. {{doi|10.1093/aje/kwp270}}, {{PMID|19822570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools have been developed to help track influenza [[epidemic]]s by finding patterns in certain [[web search query]] activity. It was found that the frequency of influenza-related web searches as a whole rises as the number of people sick with influenza rises. Examining space-time relationships of web queries has been shown to approximate the spread of influenza&lt;ref name=gins&gt;J. Ginsberg, M.H. Mohebbi, R.S. Patel, L. Brammer, M.S. Smolinski, L. Brilliant Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data Nature, 457 (2008), pp. 1012–1014, {{doi|10.1038/nature07634}}. {{PMID|19020500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dengue]].&lt;ref name=chan&gt;E.H.

Brownstein [http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001206 Using web search query data to monitor dengue epidemics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314031401/http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0001206 |date=2015-03-14 }} PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 5 (2011), p. e1206, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pntd.0001206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer simulation]]s of infectious disease spread have been used.&lt;ref name=math&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Siettos CI, Russo L|title=Mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics.|journal=Virulence|date=15 May 2013| volume=4| issue=4| pages=295–306|doi=10.4161/viru.24041|pmid=23552814| pmc=3710332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human aggregation can drive transmission, [[seasonal variation]] and [[epidemic|outbreaks]] of infectious diseases, such as the annual start of school, bootcamp, the annual [[Hajj]] etc. Most recently, data from cell phones have been shown to be able to capture population movements well enough to predict the transmission of certain infectious diseases, like rubella.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wesolowski A, Metcalf CJ, Eagle N, Kombich J, Grenfell BT, Bjørnstad ON, Lessler J, Tatem AJ, Buckee CO.|title=Quantifying seasonal population fluxes driving rubella transmission dynamics using mobile phone data|journal=PNAS|date=September 1, 2015| volume=112| issue=35|pages=11114–11119| doi=10.1073/pnas.1423542112| pmid=26283349| pmc=4568255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with virulence and survival==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Pathogens must have a way to be transmitted from one host to another to ensure their species' survival. Infectious agents are generally specialized for a particular method of transmission. Taking an example from the respiratory route, from an evolutionary perspective viruses or bacteria that cause their host to develop coughing and sneezing symptoms have a great survival advantage, as they are much more likely to be ejected from one host and carried to another.  This is also the reason that many microorganisms cause [[diarrhea]].

The relationship between [[virulence]] and transmission is complex, and has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious [[aerosol]]s).

==Beneficial microorganisms==

The mode of transmission is also an important aspect of the biology of beneficial microbial symbionts, such as [[coral#Intracellular symbionts|coral]]-associated dinoflagellates or [[human microbiota]]. Organisms can form symbioses with microbes transmitted from their parents, from the environment or unrelated individuals, or both.
 
===Vertical transmission===

Vertical transmission refers to acquisition of symbionts from parents (usually mothers). Vertical transmission can be intracellular (e.g. transovarial), or extracellular (for example through post-embryonic contact between parents and offspring). Both intracellular and extracellular vertical transmission can be considered a form of non-genetic [[Hologenome theory of evolution|inheritance]] or [[maternal effect|parental effect]]. It has been argued that most organisms experience some form of vertical transmission of symbionts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funkhouser|first1=Lisa|last2=Bordenstein|first2=Seth|title=Mom Knows Best: The Universality of Maternal Microbial Transmission|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001631|pages=e1001631|pmid=23976878|pmc=3747981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canonical examples of vertically transmitted symbionts include the nutritional symbiont [[Buchnera (bacterium)|Buchnera]] in aphids (transovarially transmitted intracellular symbiont) and some components of the [[Gut flora#Acquisition of gut flora in human infants|human microbiota]] (transmitted during passage of infants through the birth canal and also through breastfeeding). 
 
===Horizontal transmission===

Some beneficial symbionts are acquired horizontally, from the environment or unrelated individuals. This requires that host and symbiont have some method of recognizing each other or each other’s products or services. Often, horizontally acquired symbionts are relevant to [[secondary metabolism|secondary]] rather than primary metabolism, for example for use in defense against pathogens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaltenpoth |first1=Martin |last2=Engl |first2=Tobias |title=Defensive microbial symbionts in Hymenoptera |journal=Functional Ecology |date=2013 |volume=28 |issue=2 |doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12089 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12089/abstract |pages=315–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some primary nutritional symbionts are also horizontally (environmentally) acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nussbaumer |first1=Andrea |last2=Fisher |first2=Charles |last3=Bright |first3=Monika |title=Horizontal endosymbiont transmission in hydrothermal vent tubeworms |journal=Nature |date=2006 |volume=441 |pages=345–348 |doi=10.1038/nature04793 |pmid=16710420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples of horizontally transmitted beneficial symbionts include  [[Bobtail squid#light organ|bioluminescent bacteria associated with bobtail squid]] and [[Rhizobia|nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plants]].

===Mixed-mode transmission===

Many microbial symbionts, including [[Gut flora#Acquisition of gut flora in human infants|human microbiota]], can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Mixed-mode transmission can allow symbionts to have the “best of both worlds” – they can vertically infect host offspring when host density is low, and horizontally infect diverse additional hosts when a number of additional hosts are available. Mixed-mode transmission make the outcome (degree of harm or benefit) of the relationship more difficult to predict, because the [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionary success]] of the symbiont is sometimes but not always tied to the success of the host.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">'''Walter Dunham Claus''' (6 March 1903 – 12 May 1995) was a pioneer in the field of [[radiation biology]], especially in helping to establish the field in [[medical physics]] curriculum.

==Life and Times==
He was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and died in Golden, [[Jefferson County, Colorado]]. Claus's father Ernest Claus was from [[Germany]] and his mother Laura Claus was from [[Missouri]]. They resided at 310 N. Stein in St. Louis, Missouri.
In 1931 received his Ph.D. in [[Physics]] from [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. 
Claus worked at the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research|Mellon Institute]] and then went to work for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].
