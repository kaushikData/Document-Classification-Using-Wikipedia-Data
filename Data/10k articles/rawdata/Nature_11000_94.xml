The '''2009 Zigana avalanche''' was an [[avalanche]] that occurred on 25 January at around 11:15 local time (09:15 [[UTC]]) on [[Mount Zigana]], [[Gümüşhane Province]] in north-eastern [[Turkey]]. It struck a group of 17 hikers at a height of {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} near the site of a small ski resort. The snow mass dragged the hikers about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} into a valley.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/01/25/turkey.avalanche/index.html?iref=topnews|title=Avalanche kills 10 at Turkish ski resort|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2009-01-25 | date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people were killed, one person was rescued with injuries and another one died in hospital while five others survived without injuries.&lt;ref name="hdn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/10853072.asp |work=Hürriyet Daily News |title=Zigana avalanche kills 11 mountain trekkers |accessdate=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teams from civilian defense and other public administrations rushed to the scene for the rescue of the victims from a sports club in [[Trabzon]] after local gendarmerie was notified of the incident.  Also a team of AKUT, a voluntary disaster search and rescue organization, travelled from Trabzon to the location, to assess the situation and to offer any help and assistance necessary.

[[Nasuh Mahruki]], the first Turkish [[Mt. Everest]] summiter and the head of AKUT, said that "the accident was a walking group accident, not a mountain climbing accident. It is apparent that they hit the road without an avalanche test. It is very difficult for 16 to 17 people to remain under an avalanche."&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;

'''Cirrus duplicatus''' is a variety of [[cirrus cloud]]. The name ''cirrus duplicatus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "double".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=duplicatus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/18551/duplicatus|accessdate=13 July 2011|author=Latin Lookup}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duplicatus variety of cirrus clouds occurs when there are at least two layers of cirrus clouds.

The '''Clean Boating Act of 2008''' (CBA) is a United States law that requires recreational vessels to implement [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] to control [[water pollution|pollution]] discharges. The law exempts these vessels from requirements to obtain a discharge permit under the [[Clean Water Act]] (i.e. they are exempt from coverage under the EPA [[Regulation_of_ship_pollution_in_the_United_States#Vessels_General_Permit|Vessels General Permit]]).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Boating Act of 2008, {{uspl|110|288}}, approved July 29, 2008. Added sec. 312(o) to the Clean Water Act; {{usc|33|1322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/history-clean-boating-act-cba |title=History of the Clean Boating Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-02 |website=Vessels, Marinas and Ports |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBA amended the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and directs the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to develop performance standard regulations. The regulations will not apply to [[sewage]] discharges from recreational vessels, which are already regulated under the CWA. (''See'' [[Marine sanitation device]].)&lt;ref name="about CBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/about-clean-boating-act-cba |title=About the Clean Boating Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-13 |website=Vessels, Marinas and Ports |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/vessel-sewage-discharges |title=Vessel Sewage Discharges |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-02 |website=Vessels, Marinas and Ports |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA designated the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] as the enforcing agency.&lt;ref name="about CBA"/&gt;

In 2011 EPA conducted public meetings to obtain public comment about developing CBA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Stakeholder Input: Listening Session to Provide Information and Solicit Suggestions for Regulations Forthcoming Under the Clean Water Act." ''[[Federal Register]]'', {{usfr|76|11980}}. 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, EPA has not announced a schedule for issuing the regulations.&lt;ref name="about CBA"/&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Medicine ===
Coal tar is used in medicated [[shampoo]], [[Wrights Coal Tar Soap|soap]] and [[ointment]]. It demonstrates [[antifungal]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antipruritic|anti-itch]], and [[antiparasitic]] properties.&lt;ref name="Mai2011" /&gt; It may be applied topically as a treatment for [[dandruff]] and [[psoriasis]], and to kill and repel [[head lice]].&lt;ref name="WHO2008"/&gt; It may be used in combination with [[ultraviolet light therapy]].&lt;ref name="WHO2008" /&gt; 

Coal tar is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name="WHO19th"/&gt; Coal tar is generally available as a [[generic medication]] and [[over the counter]].&lt;ref name="Ric2015" /&gt; In the United Kingdom 125 ml of 5% shampoo costs the [[NHS]] about [[Pound sterling|£]]1.89.&lt;ref name="BNF69"/&gt; In the United States a month of treatment costs less than [[United States dollar|$]]25 USD.&lt;ref name="Ric2015" /&gt;

[[Pine tar]] has historically also been used for this purpose. Though it is frequently cited online as having been banned as a medical product by the FDA due to a "lack of evidence having been submitted for proof of effectiveness", pine tar is included in the Code of Federal Regulations, subchapter D: Drugs for Human Use, as an OTC treatment for "Dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title21-vol5/xml/CFR-2008-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.xml|title=Title 21&amp;nbsp;– Food and Drugs.

Coal tar may be used in two forms: crude coal tar ({{lang-la|pix carbonis}}) or a coal tar solution ({{lang-la|liquor picis carbonis, LPC}}) also known as liquor carbonis detergens (LCD).&lt;ref name="Mai2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacyaus"&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical pharmacy : a practical approach - Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia|last1=Hughes|first1=Jeff|last2=Donnelly|first2=Richard|last3=James-Chatgilaou|first3=Greta|date=2001|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Australia|isbn=9780732980290|location=South Yarra|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paghdal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Paghdal KV|author2=Schwartz RA|date={{date| 31 jan 2009}}|title=Topical tar: back to the future|journal=J Am Acad Dermatol|volume=61|issue=2|pages=294–302|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.11.024|pmid=19185953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named brands include Denorex, Balnetar, Psoriasin, Tegrin, T/Gel, and Neutar. When used in the extemporaneous preparation of topical medications, it is supplied in the form of coal tar topical solution [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], which consists of a [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|20% w/v]] solution of coal tar in [[alcohol]], with an additional 5% w/v of [[polysorbate 80]]&amp;nbsp;USP; this must then be diluted in an ointment base such as [[petrolatum]].

=== Construction ===
{{Main|Sealcoat}}

Coal tar was a component of the first sealed roads. In its original development by [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]], [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was tar covered with granite chips. Later the filler used was industrial [[slag]]. Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and reduce maintenance cost associated with [[asphalt]] pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.

Coal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot [[sealcoat]] products used to protect the structural integrity of the underlying pavement.&lt;ref name="fs20113010"&gt;{{cite web| author1 = Mahler BJ| author2 = Van Metre PC| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| title = Coal-Tar-Based Pavement Sealcoat, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Environmental Health| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet| date = {{date| 2 feb 2011}}| accessdate = {{date| 8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328042236/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| archivedate = 2013-03-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealcoat products that are coal-tar based typically contain 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch.&lt;ref name="fs20113010"/&gt; Research&lt;ref name=lakes&gt;{{cite journal| title = Contribution of PAHs from coal-tar pavement sealcoat and other sources to 40 U.S. lakes| author1 = Van Metre PC| author2 = Mahler BJ| journal = U.S. Geological Survey| date = {{date| 15 dec 2010}}| pmid = 21112613| doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.014| volume=409| issue=2| pages=334–44| bibcode=2010ScTEn.409..334V}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows it is used in [[United States]] states from [[Alaska]] to [[Florida]], but several areas have banned its use in sealcoat products,

=== Industry ===
Being flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire [[boilers]]. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.

A large part of the binder used in the [[graphite]] industry for making "green blocks" is coke oven volatiles (COV), a considerable portion of which is coal tar. During the baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial graphite production, most of the coal tar binders are vaporised and are generally burned in an incinerator to prevent release into the atmosphere, as COV and coal tar can be injurious to health.

Coal tar is also used to manufacture paints, synthetic dyes (notably [[tartrazine]]/Yellow #5), and photographic materials.

In the [[coal gas]] era, there were many companies in Britain whose business was to [[distill]] coal tar to separate the higher-value fractions, such as [[naphtha]], [[creosote]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. A great many industrial chemicals were first isolated from coal tar during this time. These companies included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Smith |url=http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/tardis.htm |title=GANSG&amp;nbsp;– Coal Tar Distillers |publisher=Igg.org.uk |date= |accessdate={{date|8 mar 2013}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619153801/http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/tardis.htm |archivedate=2013-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles can occur in the workplace by breathing, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]]) to 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[benzene]]-soluble fraction over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[cyclohexane]]-extractable fraction over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 80&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, coal tar pitch volatiles are [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC&amp;nbsp;– NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards&amp;nbsp;– Coal tar pitch volatiles|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0145.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208120356/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0145.html|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a medication in the [[United States|U.S.]], coal tar preparations are considered [[over-the-counter drug]] pharmaceuticals and are subject to regulation by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].

The '''Cypriot mouse''' (''Mus cypriacus'') is a species of [[mouse]] [[endemic]] to [[Cyprus]]. Its primary habitat seems to be the vineyards and fields of the [[Troödos Mountains]] region.&lt;ref name ="AP"&gt;[http://www.nctimes.com/news/science/article_3f52b0d4-74ae-50c3-b7b0-288b44a6996e.html North County Times: 'Living fossil' mouse found on Cyprus, a rare discovery for Europe] 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouse was recognized as a new species in 2004 by [[Thomas Cucchi]], a research fellow at the [[University of Durham]]. It was formally described in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6043648.stm BBC News - New mouse find is 'living fossil'] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  in ''[[Zootaxa]]''.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

The Cypriot mouse has characteristics that distinguish it from other European mice: bigger [[ears]], [[eyes]] and [[teeth]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=4778 Durham News - Durham Research Fellow discovers new species of mammal in Europe] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; DNA tests confirmed that it was a distinct species.

"All other endemic mammals of Mediterranean islands died out following the arrival of man, with the exception of two species of shrew. The new mouse of Cyprus is the only endemic rodent still alive, and as such can be considered as a [[living fossil]]," said Dr. Cucchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/science/article_3f52b0d4-74ae-50c3-b7b0-288b44a6996e.html|title='Living fossil' mouse found on Cyprus|last=Wagner|first=Thomas|date=October 13, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-11|publisher=[[North County Times]]}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Dr. Cucchi wanted to call it ''Mus aphrodite'', as Cyprus is the birthplace of [[Aphrodite]] according to [[Greek mythology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15116">A '''direct exchange (DX) geothermal heat pump''' is a type of [[geothermal heat pump]] (or ground source heat pump) in which [[refrigerant]] circulates through [[copper]] tubing placed in the ground. It is a closed-loop, refrigerant-based geothermal system.

Direct exchange geothermal heat pumps function similarly to [[air source heat pumps]], according to the principles of [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression refrigeration]], except they take advantage of the relatively constant ground temperatures, which are less variable than outdoor air temperatures. Ground temperature is cooler than the outdoor air temperature in summer – making for a better heat sink – and warmer in the winter – making for a better heat source.  Direct exchange geothermal heat pumps are therefore more efficient than air source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geoconnectionsinc.com/resources/ashp_vs_gshp.html|title=ASHP vs. GSHP {{!}} GeoConnections Inc.|website=geoconnectionsinc.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also quieter, more durable and require less maintenance since they don’t have any outdoor fan or outdoor coil. Furthermore, the uniformity of the underground temperature compared to the outdoor air translates into less stress on the systems.

In direct exchange systems, the refrigerant exchanges heat directly with the soil through the copper tubing. The designation “direct exchange" therefore refers to the heat transfer between the earth and the ground loop without the use of any intermediary. By contrast, [[Geothermal heat pump|water-based geothermal systems]] rely on two loops on the ground side: a primary refrigerant loop, contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary ground loop that is buried underground and is made of high-density polyethylene containing a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geojerry.com/earthloopantifreeze.html|title=The Types of Antifreeze Used in Geothermal Heat Pump Earth Loop Fluid|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct exchange systems eliminate the plastic water pipe and water circulating pump found in water-source geothermal systems. This simplicity allows the system to reach high efficiencies while using a shorter and smaller set of buried tubing, reducing footprint and installation cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/heatpump/geothermal/gthrml_main.html#top|title=Applications: Tube, Pipe &amp; Fittings: Direct-Exchange Geothermal Heating/Cooling Technology|website=www.copper.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all ground source heat pumps, direct exchange systems indirectly harvest solar energy, by absorbing the solar heat stored at the Earth's surface. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Protection Agency (1993). "Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier - Report 430-R-93-004". EPA.''&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential.

== History ==
[[File:First project.jpg|thumb|161x161px|DX system being drilled in the 1980s]]
The first geothermal heat pump was a DX system built in the late 1940s by Robert C. Webber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/about/|title=About Us {{!}} What is IGSHPA?|website=www.igshpa.okstate.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used Freon gas and buried copper tubing, for increased efficiency.

Later geothermal heat pumps designs started incorporating an additional plastic pipe loop to circulate water in deep wells in an effort to gather sufficient heat for large industrial applications, such as cement plants. Thus water-source technology advanced due to industrial interest while DX, more suited for residential and light commercial projects such as small businesses and private homes, lagged behind.

Gradually developing since the 1980s, DX technology is now experiencing a surge in popularity due in part to its simplicity, efficiency and compact footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://earthlinked.com/uncategorized/geothermal-industry-see-rapid-growth-earthlinked-forefront/|title=Geothermal Industry to See Rapid Growth|last=|first=|date=2016-11-28|work=|newspaper=Earthlinked Technologies|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing awareness of environmental and energy issues among urban and suburban residents with limited space in which to install a system.

While the technology was expanding in the 80s and 90s, several of the early manufacturers faced issues with the refrigerant and oil management system. Oil return was especially a challenge with old system using R22 refrigerant and mineral oils, after the ban of CFC refrigerants. This is because R22 and mineral oil separate into two phases in the operating range which can cause return issues in improperly designed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=OIL IN REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS|url=http://www.rses.org/assets/serviceapplicationmanual/620-1071.pdf|journal=RSES|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays geothermal systems use polyolester oil (POE) and R-410A refrigerant. POE oil and R-410A mix very well together, which translates into superior oil return characteristics.

== Operation Principles ==
[[File:Vapor Compression Cycle.png|thumb|Vapor Compression Cycle in DX Geothermal]]
Direct exchange heat pumps are closed-loop geothermal systems which rely on small copper pipes (¼” to 1-1/8”) to exchange heat with the earth. The copper pipes are placed in the ground and form a ground loop – sometimes also referred to as earth loop or refrigerant loop - where the circulating refrigerant undergoes phase transition by exchanging heat with the ground: in heating mode it absorbs heat and changes from liquid to gas (evaporation), while in cooling mode it gives heat off and changes from gas to liquid (condensation).

A direct exchange geothermal heat pump is a type of [[Central heating and cooling|central heating and cooling system]] that functions similarly to a standard [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|heat pump]], according to the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression cycle]].

In the heating mode the ground serves as the evaporator. Liquid refrigerant coming - through the liquid line- from the heat pump’s indoor coil (serving as the condenser) is expanded and enters the smaller diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the warmer ground to the ground loop. This leads to the refrigerant boiling to a vapor (evaporation) as it progresses through the loop. The refrigerant vapor then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the vapor line- to the compressor unit. Once in the compressor, the refrigerant is compressed to a higher pressure and temperature. The hot, superheated refrigerant vapor is now delivered to the indoor coil (condenser) where it gives off heat to the cooler building’s final delivery fluid with the assistance of the indoor circulator. As the refrigerant vapor gives off heat, it gradually condenses back to the liquid state.

In the cooling mode the ground serves as a condenser. Superheated vapor refrigerant from the heat pump’s compressor is pumped -through the vapor line- into the larger diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the ground loop to the cooler ground. This leads to the refrigerant condensing to a full liquid as it progresses through the loop, as shown in Figure 12. The refrigerant liquid then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the liquid line- to the indoor coil to be re-expanded to a lower pressure and temperature. This will enable it to absorb heat from the space to condition with the assistance of the indoor circulator. It will also enable it to dehumidify thanks to the indoor coil (evaporator) temperature being lower than the room temperature dew point. As the refrigerant absorbs heat while passing through the indoor coil (evaporator), the refrigerant evaporates and exits as a saturated vapor towards the heat pump’s compressor.

== Applications ==
[[Image:Geoprobe Drill.jpg|thumb|right|Typical drill rig for DX installation, length 8 ft]]Direct exchange systems are rather simple refrigerant-based systems and operate without requiring anti-freezing agents, system flushing, circulating pump, water well drilling or plumbing.

Depending on the models, they can provide space heating, space cooling, domestic water heating as well as radiant floor hydronic heating and chilled water cooling.

Direct exchange geothermal systems are the least invasive geothermal systems and feature small earth loop size. Because of that, they can be installed in relatively small areas and in relatively shallow soil - typical loop depth does not exceed 100 linear feet.

Since the length of the ground loop system is minimized, DX systems require smaller drill rigs - in comparison with water well rigs - which can get into smaller spaces and yards. This provides a greater flexibility of installation and makes it an available option in more areas and for more properties.

The compactness of the earth loop systems, which require less drilling and smaller borehole, makes up for a simpler system that is cheaper and quicker to install.[[Image:SpeedStar.jpg|thumb|right|Typical drill rig for water source installation, length 22 ft]]The relative simplicity of refrigerant-based systems – relying on a one-step heat exchange process – translates not only into a simpler and less expensive installation but also into less maintenance as well: unlike [[Geothermal heat pump|water-based systems]], they do not require maintenance to top up water and glycol levels.

== Use of Copper ==
Direct exchange systems use copper because it is an [[Copper in heat exchangers|excellent ground heat exchanger material]] and easy to manufacture. Copper tubing is strong and ductile; resistant to corrosion; has a very high thermal conductivity; and is available in many different diameters and in long coil lengths. Copper connections can be brazed, the tubing may be bent, and copper tubing is economically available.

In addition, copper has a [[Copper tubing|long history of use in air conditioning and refrigeration]], and is the material of choice for potable water for water lines buried underground and in buildings.

Copper has been used since antiquity in architectural constructions because it is a noble metal – one of a few that can be found naturally in the ground. This makes it a durable, weatherproof and corrosion-resistant material with an indefinite lifetime in most soils.

Although copper is extracted from the ground itself and is a [[noble metal]] - and is therefore almost completely impervious to corrosion from soils found worldwide - it might still undergo some corrosion in abnormally aggressive soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copper.org/resources/properties/protection/underground.html|title=Corrosion Protection &amp; Resistance: Conditions Contributing to Underground Copper Corrosion|website=www.copper.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally requires an oxidizing environment to start corrosion, and most soils are reducing, thus they contribute electrons to the copper and protect it against corrosion. In those areas where corrosive conditions may exist, copper will then naturally form a protective film on its surface which remains intact under most soil conditions.

In anticipation of particularly corrosive soils, DX systems come with a [[Cathodic protection|Cathodic Protection]] system. The principle is to protect the metal surface from corrosion by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. In that process, the metal –copper – is connected to a sacrificial metal which will corrode in its place. Corrosion of metals is an electrochemical process of deterioration that results from a loss of electrons as they react with water and/or oxygen. As the current flows from the Earth Loop Protection system, the metal surface to be protected is given in a uniform negative electrical potential that precludes corrosion of the ground loops, even in hostile environments.

== Ground loop configuration ==
[[File:ETI-FS Loop Diagrams, 01.26.11.jpg|thumb|Three main ground loop configurations]]
The ground loop system may be installed in several different configurations.  The three most common configurations are:  
# Vertical
# Diagonal
# Horizontal
Diagonal and Vertical configurations typically require drilling and grouting to be installed in drilled bore holes. Grout reseals the earth below the surface so that natural ground water aquifers are not interrupted. All diagonal and vertical systems must be grouted from the bottom up to the top.

Diagonal systems usually have a very small footprint.

Horizontal configurations usually only require trenching to be installed in excavated trenches or a pit. Horizontal systems do not usually require grout, except in the case of directional boring.

== System sizing ==

DX systems are currently manufactured in sizes from 1.5 [[Ton#Refrigeration|ton]]s (5.25&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) to 15 tons (52&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;).  Larger projects can be accomplished through installation of multiple units.

The '''Eurasian Steppe''', also called the '''Great Steppe''' or '''the steppes''', is the vast [[steppe]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Eurasia]] in the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]]. It stretches from [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] through [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Mongolia]] to [[Manchuria]], with one major [[exclave]], the [[Pannonian steppe]] or Puszta, located mostly in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=QpHCHdrgSVoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Eurasian+Steppe&amp;hl=sk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=foIzT9-DOdDmtQaJxaSfDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Eurasian%20Steppe&amp;f=false |title=Canada's vegetation: a world perspective – Geoffrey A.

Since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic age]], the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] has connected [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[China]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Middle East]] economically, politically, and culturally through overland trade routes. The Steppe route is a predecessor not only of the [[Silk Road]] which developed during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], but also of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]] in the modern era. It has been home to [[nomadic empire]]s and many large [[tribal]] [[confederations]] and ancient states throughout history, such as the [[Xiongnu]], [[Scythia]], [[Cimmerians|Cimmeria]], [[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]], [[Hunnic Empire]], [[Chorasmia]], [[Transoxiana]], [[Sogdiana]], [[Xianbei]], [[Mongols]], and [[Göktürk Khaganate]].

==Geography==

===Divisions===
[[File:two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|A map of Eurasia with emphasis on deserts. Note the oval [[Tarim Basin]] at the center of the map.]]

The Eurasian Steppe extends thousands of miles from near the mouth of the [[Danube]] almost to the Pacific Ocean. It is bounded on the north by the forests of European Russia, [[Siberia]] and Asian Russia. There is no clear southern boundary although the land becomes increasingly dry as one moves south. The steppe narrows at two points, dividing it into three major parts.

====Western Steppe====
[[File:Pontic Caspian climate.png|thumb|150px|The Pontic–Caspian Steppe]]

*The ''Western Steppe'', or [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]], begins near the mouth of the [[Danube]] and extends northeast almost to [[Kazan]] and then southeast to the southern tip of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Its northern edge was a broad band of [[forest steppe]] which has now been obliterated by the conversion of the whole area to agricultural land. In the southeast the [[Black Sea–Caspian Steppe]] extends between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. In the west, the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] is an island of steppe separated from the main steppe by the mountains of [[Transylvania]]. On the north shore of the Black Sea, the [[Crimean Peninsula]] has some interior steppe and ports on the south coast which link the steppe to the civilizations of the Mediterranean basin.

====Ural–Caspian Narrowing====
*The ''[[Ural Mountains]]'' extend south to a point about 650&amp;nbsp;km (400&amp;nbsp;mi) northeast of the ''[[Caspian Sea]]''. This is not a major barrier to movement, but the area near the Caspian is quite dry.

====Central Steppe====
[[File:Seidenstrasse_GMT_Ausschnitt_Zentralasien.jpg|thumb|right|The Kazakh Steppe in the north with the Tarim Basin (Takhlamakan) and Dzungaria]]

*The ''Central Steppe'' or [[Kazakh Steppe]] extends from the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] to [[Dzungaria]]. To the south, it grades off into semi-desert and desert which is interrupted by two great rivers, the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) and [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes), which flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]] and provide irrigation agriculture. In the southeast is the densely populated [[Fergana Valley]] and west of it the great oasis cities of [[Tashkent]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] along the [[Zeravshan River]]. The southern area has a complex history (see [[Central Asia]] and [[Greater Iran]]), while in the north, the Kazakh Steppe proper was relatively isolated from the main currents of [[recorded history|written history]].

====Dzungarian Narrowing====
On the east side of the former Sino-Soviet border mountains extend north almost to the forest zone with only limited grassland in Dzungaria.

====Eastern Steppe====
*''[[Xinjiang]]'' is the northwestern province of China.  The east-west Tien Shan Mountains divide it into Dzungaria in the north and the Tarim Basin to the south. ''[[Dzungaria]]'' is bounded by the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] on the west and the Mongolian [[Altai Mountains]] on the east, neither of which is a significant barrier.  Dzungaria has good grassland around the edges and a central desert. It often behaved as a westward extension of Mongolia and connected Mongolia to the Kazakh steppe. To the north of Dzungaria are mountains and the Siberian forest. To the south and west of Dzungaria, and separated from it by the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, is an area about twice the size of Dzungaria, the oval ''[[Tarim Basin]]''. The Tarim Basin is too dry to support even a nomadic population, but around its edges rivers flow down from the mountains giving rise to a ring of cities which lived by irrigation agriculture and east-west trade. The Tarim Basin formed an island of near civilization in the center of the steppe. The [[Northern Silk Road]] went along the north and south sides of the Tarim Basin and then crossed the mountains west to the [[Fergana Valley]]. At the west end of the basin the [[Pamir Mountains]] connect the Tien Shan Mountains to the [[Himalayas]]. To the south, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] separate the Tarim Basin from the thinly peopled [[Tibetan Plateau]].
*The ''Mongol Steppe'' includes both [[Mongolia]] and the Chinese province of [[Inner Mongolia]]. The two are separated by a relatively dry area marked by the [[Gobi Desert]]. South  of the Mongol Steppe is the high and thinly peopled [[Tibetan Plateau]]. The northern edge of the plateau is the [[Gansu]] or [[Hexi Corridor]], a belt of moderately dense population that connects [[China proper]] with the Tarim Basin. The [[Hexi Corridor]] was the main route of the [[Silk Road]]. In the southeast the Silk Road led over some hills to the east-flowing [[Wei River]] valley which led to the [[North China Plain]].

[[File:China 100.78713E 35.63718N.jpg|thumb|270px|China and surrounding regions. Note the oval Tarim Basin, the dryer area separating Inner and Outer Mongolia and the projection of steppe into Manchuria]]

*''[[Manchuria]]'' is a special case. Westerners tend to think of Manchuria as the northeast projection of China that they see on maps.  The Chinese now call this, or the eastern two thirds of it, [[Northeast China]]. The dryer western third west of the [[Greater Khingan]] Mountains has normally been part of [[Inner Mongolia]]. Before 1859, Manchuria also included [[Outer Manchuria]] to the north and east, which is now part of Russia. South of the Khingan Mountains and north of the [[Taihang Mountains]], the [[Mongolian-Manchurian steppe]] extends east into Manchuria as the Liao Xi steppe. In Manchuria, the steppe grades off into forest and mountains without reaching the Pacific. The central area of forest-steppe was inhabited by pastoral and agricultural peoples, while to the north and east was a thin population of hunting tribes of the Siberian type.

===Fauna===
Big mammals of the Eurasian steppe were the [[Przewalski's horse]], the [[saiga antelope]], the [[Mongolian gazelle]], the [[goitered gazelle]], the [[wild Bactrian camel]] and the [[onager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/7961/0|title=Equus ferus ssp. przewalskii (Asian Wild Horse, Mongolian Wild Horse, Przewalski's Horse)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815223053/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/7961/0|archivedate=2016-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/19832/0|title=Saiga tatarica (Mongolian Saiga, Saiga, Saiga Antelope)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107054631/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/19832/0|archivedate=2018-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/18232/0|title=Procapra gutturosa (Dzeren, Mongolian Gazelle)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113235028/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/18232/0|archivedate=2012-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/8976/0|title=Gazella subgutturosa (Goitered Gazelle)|website=www.iucnredlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/63543/0|title=Camelus ferus (Bactrian Camel, Two-humped Camel, Wild Bactrian Camel)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210065950/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/63543/0|archivedate=2012-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/7951/0|title=Equus hemionus (Asian Wild Ass, Asiatic Wild Ass)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107114433/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/7951/0|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gray wolf]] and the [[corsac fox]] and occasionally the [[brown bear]] are predators roaming the steppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/3746/0|title=Canis lupus (Arctic Wolf, Common Wolf, Gray Wolf, Grey Wolf, Mexican Wolf, Plains Wolf, Timber Wolf, Tundra Wolf, Wolf)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202005336/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/3746/0|archivedate=2018-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/23051/0|title=Vulpes corsac (Corsac Fox)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429175317/http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/23051/0|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutleb, Bernhard; Ziaie, Hooshang (1999).

Furthermore, the Eurasian steppe is home to a great variety of bird species. Threatened bird species living there are for example the [[Eastern imperial eagle|imperial eagle]], the [[lesser kestrel]], the [[great bustard]], the [[Yellow-eyed pigeon|pale-back pigeon]] and the [[White-throated bush chat|white-throated bushchat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/asia_strategy/pdf_downloads/grasslandsGO1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154007/http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/asia_strategy/pdf_downloads/grasslandsGO1.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The primary domesticated animals raised were sheep and goats with fewer cattle than one might expect. [[Camel]]s were used in the drier areas for transport as far west as [[Astrakhan]]. There were some [[yak]]s along the edge of [[Tibet]]. The horse was used for transportation and warfare. [[Domestication of the horse|The horse was first domesticated]] on the Pontic–Caspian or Kazakh steppe sometime before 3000 BC, but it took a long time for [[mounted archery]] to develop and the process is not fully understood. The [[stirrup]] does not seem to have been completely developed until 300 AD (see [[Stirrup]], [[Saddle]], [[Composite bow]], [[Domestication of the horse]] and related articles).

===Ecoregions===
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides the Eurasian steppe's temperate [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, and shrublands into a number of [[ecoregion]]s, distinguished by elevation, climate, rainfall, and other characteristics, and home to distinct animal and [[plant community|plant communities]] and species, and distinct [[habitat]] [[ecosystem]]s.

===Trade habits===
The major centers of population and high culture in Eurasia are Europe,the Middle East, India and China. For some purposes it is useful to treat [[Greater Iran]] as a separate region. All these regions are connected by the Eurasian [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] which was an active predecessor of the [[Silk Road]]. The latter started in the [[Guanzhong]] region of China and ran west along the Hexi Corridor to the Tarim Basin. From there it went southwest to Greater Iran and turned southeast to India or west to the Middle East and Europe. A minor branch went northwest along the great rivers and north of the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. When faced with a rich caravan the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] could either rob it, or tax it, or hire themselves out as guards. Economically these three forms of taxation or parasitism amounted to the same thing. Trade was usually most vigorous when a strong empire controlled the steppe and reduced the number of petty chieftains preying on trade. The silk road first became significant and Chinese silk began reaching the Roman Empire about the time that the [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor of Han]] pushed Chinese power west to the Tarim Basin.

===Agriculture===
The nomads would occasionally tolerate colonies of peasants on the steppe in the few areas where farming was possible. These were often captives who grew grain for their nomadic masters. Along the fringes there were areas that could be used for either plowland or grassland. These alternated between one and the other depending on the relative strength of the nomadic and agrarian heartlands. Over the last few hundred years, the Russian steppe and much of Inner Mongolia has been cultivated. The fact that most of the Russian steppe is not irrigated implies that it was maintained as grasslands as a result of the military strength of the nomads.

===Language===
According to the most widely held hypothesis of the origin of the [[Indo-European languages]], the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], their common ancestor is thought to have originated on the Pontic-Caspian steppe. The [[Tocharians]] were an early Indo-European branch in the [[Tarim Basin]]. At the beginning of written history the entire steppe population west of Dzungaria spoke [[Iranian languages]]. From about 500 AD the [[Turkic languages]] replaced the Iranian languages first on the steppe, and later in the oases north of Iran (the reasons for this are poorly understood). Additionally, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] speakers, a branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, who previously lived in the steppe in what is now Southern Russia, settled in the [[Carpathian basin]] in year 895. [[Mongolic languages]] are in Mongolia. In Manchuria one finds [[Tungusic languages]] and some others.

===Religion===
According to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of Indo-European origins, the earliest hypothesized steppe religion would have been [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto Indo-European]]. Later, [[Tengrism|Tengriism]] was introduced by [[Turko-Mongol]] nomads. [[Nestorianism]] and [[Manichaeism]] spread to the Tarim Basin and into China, but they never became established majority religions. [[Buddhism]] spread from the north of India to the Tarim Basin and found a new home in China. By about 1400 AD, the entire steppe west of [[Dzungaria]] had adopted [[Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} By about 1600 AD, Islam was established in the Tarim Basin while Dzungaria and Mongolia had adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

===Warfare===
[[File:Mongol warrior of Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|[[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot]]
Raids between tribes were prevalent throughout the region's history. This is connected to the ease with which a defeated enemy's flocks can be driven away, making raiding profitable. In terms of warfare and raiding, in relation to sedentary societies, the horse gave the nomads an advantage of mobility. Horsemen could raid a village and retreat with their loot before an infantry-based army could be mustered and deployed. When confronted with  superior infantry, horsemen could simply ride away and retreat and regroup. Outside of Europe and parts of the Middle East, agrarian societies had difficulty raising a sufficient number of war horses, and often had to enlist them from their nomadic enemies(as mercenaries). Nomads could not easily be pursued onto the steppe since the steppe could not easily support a land army. If the Chinese sent an army into Mongolia, the nomads would flee and come back when the Chinese ran out of supplies. But the steppe nomads were relatively few and their rulers had difficulty holding together enough clans and tribes to field a large army. If they conquered an agricultural area they often lacked the skills to administer it. If they tried to hold agrarian land they gradually absorbed the civilization of their subjects, lost their nomadic skills and were either assimilated or driven out.

===Relations with neighbors===
Along the northern fringe the nomads would collect tribute from and blend with the forest tribes (see [[Khanate of Sibir]], [[Buryats]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} From about 1240 to 1480 Russia paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} South of the Kazakh steppe the nomads blended with the sedentary population, partly because the Middle East has significant areas of steppe (taken by force in past invasions) and pastoralism. There was a sharp cultural divide between Mongolia and China and almost constant warfare from the dawn of history until 1757.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The nomads collected large amounts of tribute from the Chinese and several Chinese dynasties were of steppe origin. Perhaps because of the mixture of agriculture and pastoralism in Manchuria its inhabitants knew how to deal with both nomads and the settled populations, and therefore were able to conquer much of northern China when both Chinese and Mongols were weak.

An '''explosively pumped flux compression generator''' ('''EPFCG''') is a device used to generate a high-power [[electromagnetic pulse]] by compressing [[magnetic flux]] using [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]].

An EPFCG only ever generates a single pulse as the device is physically destroyed during operation. An EPFCG package that could be easily carried by a person can produce pulses in the millions of [[ampere]]s and tens of [[Watt#Multiples|terawatt]]s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} They require a starting [[Electric current|current]] pulse to operate, usually supplied by [[capacitor]]s.

They are being investigated as power sources for [[electronic warfare]] devices known as transient electromagnetic devices that generate an [[electromagnetic pulse]] without the costs, side effects, or enormous range of a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] device. 

The first work on these generators was conducted by the [[VNIIEF]] center for nuclear research in [[Sarov]] in [[Soviet Union]] at the beginning of the 1950s followed by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in the [[United States]].

== History ==
At the start of the 1950s, the need for very short and powerful electrical pulses became evident to Soviet scientists conducting [[nuclear fusion]] research. The [[Marx generator]], which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device capable at the time of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost of the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search for a more economical device. The first magneto-explosive generators, which followed from the ideas of [[Andrei Sakharov]], were designed to fill this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== How it works ==
[[Image:Magnetic flux.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|For a constant intensity magnetic field of magnitude B traversing a surface S, the flux Φ is equal to B times S.]]

Magneto-explosive generators use a technique called "magnetic flux compression", described in detail below. The technique is made possible when the time scales over which the device operates are sufficiently brief that resistive current loss is negligible, and the [[magnetic flux]] through any surface surrounded by a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] (copper wire, for example) remains constant, even though the size and shape of the surface may change.

This flux conservation can be demonstrated from [[Maxwell's equations]]. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from [[Lenz's law]], which says that any change in the flux through an electric circuit will cause a current in the circuit which will oppose the change. For this reason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a closed loop conductor with a magnetic field passing through it, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which tends to keep the enclosed flux at its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, the reduction in area is accomplished by detonating explosives packed around a conductive tube or disk, so the resulting [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] compresses the tube or disk.&lt;ref&gt;Other techniques exist which do not depend on explosives. Notably, see: [http://mathias.bavay.free.fr/these/html/node20.html Flux compression scheme used at the Gramat centre of study, doctoral thesis, Mathias Bavay, 8 July 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since flux is equal to the magnitude of the [[magnetic field]] multiplied by the area of the surface, as the surface area shrinks the magnetic field strength inside the conductor increases.  The compression process partially transforms the chemical energy of the explosives into the energy of an intense magnetic field surrounded by a correspondingly large electric current. 

The purpose of the flux generator can be either the generation of an extremely strong magnetic field pulse, or an extremely strong electric current pulse; in the latter case the closed conductor is attached to an external [[electric circuit]].   This technique has been used to create the most intense manmade magnetic fields on Earth; fields up to about 1000&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (about 1000 times the strength of a typical permanent magnet) can be created for a few microseconds.

=== Elementary description of flux compression ===
[[Image:Flux compression 1.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Fig. 1: Original magnetic field lines.]]
An external magnetic field (blue lines) threads a closed ring made of a perfect conductor (with zero [[electrical resistance|resistance]]).  The total magnetic flux &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; through the ring is equal to the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the surface spanning the ring.  The nine field lines represent the magnetic flux threading the ring.{{clear|left}}

[[Image:Flux compression 2.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Fig. 2: Configuration after the ring's diameter has been reduced.]]
Suppose the ring is deformed, reducing its cross-sectional area.   The magnetic flux threading the ring, represented by five field lines, is reduced by the same ratio as the area of the ring. The variation of the magnetic flux induces a current ''(red arrows)'' in the ring by [[Faraday's law of induction]], which in turn creates a new magnetic field circling the wire ''(green arrows)'' by [[Ampere's circuital law]]. The new magnetic field opposes the field outside the ring but adds to the field inside, so that the total flux in the interior of the ring is maintained: four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the original nine field lines.{{clear|left}}

[[Image:Flux compression 3.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Fig. 3: Magnetic field lines after compression.]]
By adding together the external magnetic field and the induced field, it can be shown that the net result is that the magnetic field lines originally threading the hole stay inside the hole, thus flux is conserved, and a current has been created in the conductive ring.  The magnetic field lines are "pinched" closer together, so the (average) magnetic field intensity inside the ring increases by the ratio of the original area to the final area.  {{clear}}

== The various types of generators ==
The simple basic principle of flux compression can be applied in a variety of different ways. Soviet scientists at the VNIIEF in [[Sarov]], pioneers in this domain, conceived of three different types of generators:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In the first type of generator (MK-1, 1951) developed by Robert Lyudaev, the magnetic flux produced by a wound conductor is confined to the interior of a hollow metallic tube surrounded by explosives, and submitted to a violent compression when the explosives are fired; a device of the same type was developed in the [[United States|USA]] a dozen years later by [[Clarence Max Fowler|C.M. (Max) Fowler]]'s team at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]];
* The next type of generator (MK-2, 1952), the magnetic flux, confined between the windings of the external conductor and a central conductive tube filled with explosive, is compressed by the conical 'piston' created by the deformation of the central tube as the detonation wave travels across the device.
* A third type of generator (DEMG), developed by Vladimir Chernyshev, is cylindrical, and contains a stack of concave metallic disks, facing each other in pairs, to create hollow modules (with the number varying according to the desired power), and separated by explosives; each module functions as an independent generator.

Such generators can, if necessary, be utilised independently, or even assembled in a chain of successive stages: the energy produced by each generator is transferred to the next, which amplifies the pulse, and so on. For example, it is foreseen that the DEMG generator will be supplied by a MK-2 type generator.

=== Hollow tube generators ===
In the spring of 1952, R.Z. Lyudaev, [[Ekaterina Feoktistova|E.A. Feoktistova]], G.A. Tsyrkov, and A.A. Chvileva
undertook the first experiment with this type of generator, with the goal of obtaining a very high magnetic field.
[[Image:Flux compression generator 1.png|thumb|center|450px|Hollow tube generator.]]
The MK-1 generator functions as follows:
* A longitudinal magnetic field is produced inside a hollow metallic conductor, by discharging a bank of capacitors into the solenoid that surrounds the cylinder. To ensure a rapid penetration of the field in the cylinder, there is a slit in the cylinder, which closes rapidly as the cylinder deforms;
* The explosive charge placed around the tube is detonated in a manner that ensures that the compression of the cylinder commences when the current through the solenoid is at its maximum;
* The convergent cylindrical shock wave unleashed by the explosion produces a rapid contraction (greater than 1&amp;nbsp;km/s) of the central cylinder, compressing the magnetic field, and creating an inductive current, as per the explanation above (the speed of contraction permits, to first approximation, the neglect of Joule losses and the consideration of the cylinder as a perfect conductor).

The first experiments were able to attain magnetic fields of millions of [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] (hundreds of [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s), given an initial field of 30 kG (3 T) which is in the free space "air" the same as H = B/μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (3 V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (4π × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/Am) = {{val|2.387|e=6|u=A/m}} (approximately 2.4 MA/m).

=== Helical generators ===
Helical generators were principally conceived to deliver an intense current to a load situated at a safe distance. They are frequently used as the first stage of a multi-stage generator, with the exit current used to generate a very intense magnetic field in a second generator.
[[Image:Flux compression generator 2.png|thumb|center|450px|Function of a helical generator.]]

The MK-2 generators function as follows:
* A longitudinal magnetic field is produced in between a metallic conductor and a surrounding solenoid, by discharging a battery of capacitors into the solenoid;
* After the charge is ignited, a detonation wave propagates in the explosive charge placed in the interior of the central metallic tube (from left to right on the figure);
* Under the effect of the pressure of the detonation wave, the tube deforms and becomes a cone which contacts the helically wrapped coil, diminishing the number of turns not short-circuited, compressing the magnetic field and creating an inductive current;
* At the point of maximal flux compression, the load switch is opened, which then delivers the maximal current to the load.

The MK-2 generator is particularly interesting for the production of intense currents, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[ampere|A]] (100 MA), as well as a very high energy magnetic field, as up to 20% of the explosive energy can be converted to magnetic energy, and the field strength can attain 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;gauss (200 T).

The practical realization of high performance MK-2 systems required the pursuit of fundamental studies by a large team of researchers; this was effectively achieved by 1956, following the production of the first MK-2 generator in 1952, and the achievement of currents over 100 megaamperes from 1953.

=== Disc generators ===
[[Image:Flux compression generator 3.png|thumb|center|500px|Disc generators.]]

A DEMG generator functions as follows:
* Conductive metallic discs, assembled in facing pairs to create hollow modules having the form of a lined [[torus]], with explosive packed between pairs of modules, are stacked inside a cylinder;&lt;ref&gt;In practice, each prefabricated element, destined to be assembled into a cylinder, corresponds to an explosive device surrounded by two discs, which explains why the line of disks is terminated at each end by a hollow half module.&lt;/ref&gt; the number of modules can vary according to the desired power (the figure shows a device of 15 modules), as well as the radius of the discs (of the order of 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm).
* Current runs through the device, supplied by a MK-2 generator, and an intense magnetic field is created inside each module.
* When initiated, the explosion begins on the axis and propagates radially outwards, deforming the disc shaped protuberances with triangular section and pushing them away from the axis. The outward movement of this section of conductor plays the role of a piston.
* As the explosion proceeds, the magnetic field is compressed in the inside of each module by the conductive piston and the simultaneous drawing together of the inner faces, also creating an inductive current.
* As the induced current attains its maximum, the fuse opening switch fuses and the load switch simultaneously closes, allowing the current to be delivered to the load (the mechanism for the operation of the load switch is not explained in available documentation).

Systems using up to 25 modules have been developed at VNIIEF. Output of 100&amp;nbsp;[[Joule#SI multiples|MJ]] at 256&amp;nbsp;MA have been produced by a generator a metre in diameter composed of three modules.

[[File:Von einem Schrecklichen vnd Wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M. D. Lxxvij. Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat (grayscale).png|right|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1577, depicted in a woodcut, over [[Prague]]]]
A '''great comet''' is a [[comet]] that becomes exceptionally bright. There is no official definition; often the term is attached to comets such as [[Halley's Comet]], which are bright enough to be noticed by casual observers who are not looking for them, and become well known outside the astronomical community. Great comets are rare; on average, only one will appear in a [[decade]]. Although comets are officially named after their discoverers, great comets are sometimes also referred to by the year in which they appeared great, using the formulation "The Great Comet of ...", followed by the year.

== Causes ==
[[File:Verschuier1680.jpg|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1680 over [[Rotterdam]] as painted by [[Lieve Verschuier]]]]
The vast majority of comets are never bright enough to be seen by the naked eye, and generally pass through the inner [[Solar System]] unseen by anyone except [[astronomers]]. However, occasionally a comet may brighten to naked eye visibility, and even more rarely it may become as bright as or brighter than the brightest stars. The requirements for this to occur are: a large and active [[cometary nucleus|nucleus]], a close approach to the [[Sun]], and a close approach to the [[Earth]]. A comet fulfilling all three of these criteria will certainly be spectacular. Sometimes, a comet failing on one criterion will still be extremely impressive. For example, [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] had an exceptionally large and active nucleus, but did not approach the Sun very closely at all, yet it still became an extremely famous and well observed comet. Equally, [[Comet Hyakutake]] was a rather small comet, but appeared bright because it passed extremely close to the Earth.

=== Size and activity of the nucleus ===
Cometary nuclei vary in size from a few hundreds of metres across or less to many kilometres across. When they approach the Sun, large amounts of [[gas]] and [[dust]] are ejected by cometary nuclei, due to solar heating. A crucial factor in how bright a comet becomes is how large and how active its nucleus is. After many returns to the inner Solar System, cometary nuclei become depleted in volatile materials and thus are much less bright than comets which are making their first passage through the Solar System.

The sudden brightening of comet [[17P/Holmes]] in 2007 showed the importance of the activity of the nucleus in the comet's brightness. On October 23–24, 2007, the comet suffered a sudden outburst which caused it to brighten by factor of about half a million. It unexpectedly brightened from an [[apparent magnitude]] of about 17 to about 2.8 in a period of only 42 hours, making it visible to the naked eye. All these temporarily made comet 17P the largest (by radius) object in the Solar System although its nucleus is estimated to be only about 3.4&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.

=== Close perihelion approach ===
The brightness of a simple reflective body varies with the [[inverse square]] of its distance from the Sun. That is, if an object's distance from the Sun is halved, its brightness is quadrupled. However, comets behave differently, due to their ejection of large amounts of volatile gas which then also reflect sunlight and may also [[fluorescence|fluoresce]]. Their brightness varies roughly as the inverse cube of their distance from the Sun, meaning that if a comet's distance from the Sun is halved, it will become eight times as bright.

This means that the peak brightness of a comet depends significantly on its distance from the Sun. For most comets, the [[perihelion]] of their orbit lies outside the Earth's orbit. Any comet approaching the Sun to within 0.5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] or less may have a chance of becoming a great comet.

=== Close approach to the Earth ===
[[Image:Comet Halley.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[Halley's Comet]]'s 1986 apparition was unusually modest in brightness.]]
For a comet to become spectacular, it also needs to pass close to the Earth if it is to be easily seen. [[Halley's Comet]], for example, is usually very bright when it passes through the inner Solar System every seventy-six years, but during its 1986 [[periodic comet|apparition]], its closest approach to Earth was almost the most distant possible. The comet became visible to the naked eye, but was unspectacular. On the other hand, the intrinsically small and faint [[Comet Hyakutake]] (C/1996 B2) appeared very bright and spectacular due to its very close approach to Earth at its nearest during March 1996. Its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches on record.

division of [[Earth]] by the [[Equator]] and [[prime meridian]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[cartography]], the '''hemispheres of Earth''' refer to any division of [[Earth|the globe]] into two [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡμισφαίριον}} {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmisphairion}}, meaning "half of a sphere").

The most common such divisions are by [[latitude|latitudinal]] or [[longitude|longitudinal]] markers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hemisphere/ | title=Hemisphere| date=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

** [[Southern Hemisphere]], the half that lies south of the Equator
* East–West
** [[Eastern Hemisphere]], the half that lies east of the [[prime meridian]] and west of the [[180th meridian]]
** [[Western Hemisphere]], the half that lies west of the prime meridian and east of the 180th meridian

The East–West division can also be seen in a cultural sense, as a division into two [[East–West dichotomy|cultural hemispheres]].

However, other schemes have sought to divide the planet in a way that maximizes the preponderance of one geographic feature or another in each division:

In [[chemistry]], the '''history of molecular theory''' traces the origins of the concept or idea of the existence of [[Covalent bond|strong chemical bonds]] between two or more [[atom]]s.

The modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] who argued that all the universe is composed of [[atomic theory|atoms and voids]]. Circa 450 BC [[Empedocles]] imagined [[classical element|fundamental elements]] ([[Fire (classical element)|fire]] ([[File:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|20px]]), [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] ([[File:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|20px]]), [[Air (classical element)|air]] ([[File:Alchemy air symbol.svg|20px]]), and [[Water (classical element)|water]] ([[File:Alchemy water symbol.svg|20px]])) and "forces" of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact. Prior to this, [[Heraclitus]] had claimed that fire or change was fundamental to our existence, created through the combination of opposite properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Bertrand  | title = A History of Western Philosophy | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4165-5477-6 | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Plato]], following [[Pythagoras]], considered mathematical entities such as number, point, line and triangle as the fundamental building blocks or elements of this ephemeral world, and considered the four elements of fire, air, water and earth as states of substances through which the true mathematical principles or elements would pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Bertrand  | title = A History of Western Philosophy | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4165-5477-6 | page = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by [[Aristotle]] and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe. A modern conceptualization of molecules began to develop in the 19th century along with experimental evidence for pure [[chemical elements]] and how individual atoms of different chemical substances such as hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form chemically stable molecules such as water molecules.

==17th century==
The earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms was that proposed by [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]] who reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved.  Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pfeffer | first = Jeremy, I.  |author2=Nir, Shlomo | title = Modern Physics: An Introduction Text | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | date = 2001 | isbn = 1-86094-250-4 | page = 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Democritus that was the main proponent of this view.  Using analogies based on the experiences of the [[sense]]s, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts.  Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;See ''testimonia'' DK 68 A 80, DK 68 A 37 and DK 68 A 43. See also {{cite book | last = Cassirer | first = Ernst  | title = An Essay on Man: an Introduction to the Philosophy of Human Culture | publisher = Doubleday &amp; Co. | date = 1953 | id = ASIN B0007EK5MM |  page = 214 | isbn = 0-300-00034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hook and eye model.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A water molecule as hook-and-eye model might have represented it. [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]], [[Lucretius]] and [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] adhered to such conception. Note that the composition of water was not known before [[Amedeo Avogadro|Avogadro]] (c. 1811).]]
With the rise of [[scholasticism]] and the decline of the Roman Empire, the atomic theory was abandoned for many ages in favor of the various four element theories and later alchemical theories. The 17th century, however, saw a resurgence in the atomic theory primarily through the works of [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. Among other scientists of that time Gassendi deeply studied ancient history, wrote major works about [[Epicurus]] natural philosophy and was a persuasive propagandist of it. He reasoned that to account for the size and shape of atoms moving in a void could account for the properties of matter.  Heat was due to small, round atoms; cold, to pyramidal atoms with sharp points, which accounted for the pricking sensation of severe cold; and solids were held together by interlacing hooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leicester | first = Henry, M. | title = The Historical Background of Chemistry | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 1956 | isbn = 0-486-61053-5 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton, though he acknowledged the various atom attachment theories in vogue at the time, i.e. "hooked atoms", "glued atoms" (bodies at rest), and the "stick together by conspiring motions" theory, rather believed, as famously stated in "Query 31" of his 1704 ''[[Opticks]]'', that particles attract one another by some force, which "in immediate contact is extremely strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from particles with any sensible effect." &lt;ref&gt;(a) [[Isaac Newton]], (1704). [[Opticks]]. (pg. 389). New York: Dover.&lt;br&gt;(b) {{cite book | last = Bernard | first = Pullman | author2 = Reisinger, Axel, R. | title = The Atom in the History of Human Thought | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2001 | isbn = 0-19-515040-6 | page = 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more concrete manner, however, the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. "[[molecule]]s", traces its origins to [[Robert Boyle]]'s 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise ''The Sceptical Chymist'', that matter is composed of ''clusters of [[particle]]s'' and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters.  Boyle argued that matter's basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called "[[Particle|corpuscles]]", which were capable of arranging themselves into groups.

In 1680, using the [[corpuscular theory]] as a basis, French chemist [[Nicolas Lemery]] stipulated that the [[acidity]] of any substance consisted in its pointed particles, while [[alkalis]] were endowed with pores of various sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Lemery, Nicolas. (1680). An Appendix to a Course of Chymistry. London, pgs 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  A molecule, according to this view, consisted of corpuscles united through a geometric locking of points and pores.

==18th century==
[[File:Affinity-table.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Étienne François Geoffroy]]’s 1718 ''Affinity Table'': at the head of the column is a substance with which all the substances below can combine.]]
An early precursor to the idea of bonded "combinations of atoms", was the theory of "combination via [[chemical affinity]]".  For example, in 1718, building on Boyle’s conception of combinations of clusters, the French chemist [[Étienne François Geoffroy]] developed theories of [[chemical affinity]] to explain combinations of particles, reasoning that a certain alchemical "force" draws certain alchemical components together.  Geoffroy's name is best known in connection with his tables of "[[chemical affinity|affinities]]" (''tables des rapports''), which he presented to the [[French Academy]] in 1718 and 1720.

These were lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different [[reagent]]s.  These tables retained their vogue for the rest of the century, until displaced by the profounder conceptions introduced by [[Claude Louis Berthollet|CL Berthollet]].

In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', which laid the basis for the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases.  In this work, Bernoulli positioned the argument, still used to this day, that [[gas]]es consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas [[pressure]] that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the kinetic energy of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.

In 1789, [[William Higgins (chemist)|William Higgins]] published views on what he called combinations of "ultimate" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of [[valency bonds]].  If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles:

[[File:Higgins-particles.jpg|250px|center|thumb|[[William Higgins (chemist)|William Higgins]]' combinations of ultimate particles (1789)]]

==19th century==
[[File:Daltons particles.jpg|150px|thumb|[[John Dalton]]'s union of atoms combined in ratios (1808)]]
Similar to these views, in 1803 [[John Dalton]] took the atomic weight of hydrogen, the lightest element, as unity, and determined, for example, that the ratio for [[nitrous anhydride]] was 2 to 3 which gives the formula N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Dalton incorrectly imagined that atoms "hooked" together to form molecules. Later, in 1808, Dalton published his famous diagram of combined "atoms":

[[Amedeo Avogadro]] created the word "molecule".&lt;ref name="ley196606"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1811 paper "Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies", he essentially states, i.e. according to [[J. R. Partington|Partington]]'s ''A Short History of Chemistry'', that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Avogadro | first1 = Amedeo | date = 1811 | title = Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies | url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/AVOGADRO.HTML | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 58–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The smallest particles of gases are not necessarily simple atoms, but are made up of a certain number of these atoms united by attraction to form a single '''molecule'''.}}

Note that this quote is not a literal translation.  Avogadro uses the name "molecule" for both atoms and molecules.  Specifically, he uses the name "elementary molecule" when referring to atoms and to complicate the matter also speaks of "compound molecules" and "composite molecules".

During his stay in Vercelli, Avogadro wrote a concise note (''memoria'') in which he declared the hypothesis of what we now call [[Avogadro's law]]: ''equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules''.  This law implies that the relationship occurring between the weights of same volumes of different gases, at the same temperature and pressure, corresponds to the relationship between respective [[molecular weight]]s. Hence, relative molecular masses could now be calculated from the masses of gas samples.

Avogadro developed this hypothesis in order to reconcile [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]]'s 1808 [[Gay-Lussac's law|law on volumes and combining gases]] with Dalton's 1803 [[atomic theory]]. The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules—one of the most important contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms. Dalton, by contrast, did not consider this possibility.  Curiously, Avogadro considers only molecules containing even numbers of atoms; he does not say why odd numbers are left out.

In 1826, building on the work of Avogadro, the French chemist [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] states:

{{quote|Gases in similar circumstances are composed of '''molecules''' or atoms placed at the same distance, which is the same as saying that they contain the same number in the same volume.}}

In coordination with these concepts, in 1833 the French chemist [[Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin]] presented a clear account of Avogadro's hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title =  The Atomic Structural Theories of Ampère and Gaudin: Molecular Speculation and Avogadro's Hypothesis| author = Seymour H. Mauskopf| journal = Isis| date = 1969| volume = 60| issue =  1| pages = 61–74| doi =  10.1086/350449| jstor=229022}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding atomic weights, by making use of "volume diagrams", which clearly show both semi-correct molecular geometries, such as a linear water molecule, and correct molecular formulas, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:

[[File:Gaudins-volume-diagrams.jpg|350px|center|thumb|[[Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin]]'s volume diagrams of molecules in the gas phase (1833)]]

In two papers outlining his "theory of atomicity of the elements" (1857–58), [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] was the first to offer a theory of how every atom in an organic molecule was bonded to every other atom.  He proposed that carbon atoms were tetravalent, and could bond to themselves to form the carbon skeletons of organic molecules.

In 1856, Scottish chemist [[Archibald Couper]] began research on the [[bromination]] of benzene at the laboratory of [[Charles Wurtz]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okstate.edu/jgelder/bondpage37.html Chemical Bonding Concepts] – Oklahoma State University&lt;/ref&gt;  One month after Kekulé's second paper appeared, Couper's independent and largely identical theory of molecular structure was published.  He offered a very concrete idea of molecular structure, proposing that atoms joined to each other like modern-day [[Tinkertoys]] in specific three-dimensional structures. Couper was the first to use lines between atoms, in conjunction with the older method of using brackets, to represent bonds, and also postulated straight chains of atoms as the structures of some molecules, ring-shaped molecules of others, such as in [[tartaric acid]] and [[cyanuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Chemical achievers : the human face of the chemical sciences|date=1997|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780941901123|pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In later publications, Couper’s bonds were represented using straight dotted lines (although it is not known if this is the typesetter’s preference) such as with [[alcohol]] and [[oxalic acid]] below:

[[File:Coupers-molecule.jpg|200px|center|thumb|[[Archibald Couper]]'s molecular structures, for [[alcohol]] and [[oxalic acid]], using elemental symbols for atoms and lines for bonds (1858)]]

In 1861, an unknown Vienna high-school teacher named [[Joseph Loschmidt]] published, at his own expense, a booklet entitled ''Chemische Studien I'', containing pioneering molecular images which showed both "ringed" structures as well as double-bonded structures, such as:&lt;ref&gt;Bader, A. &amp; Parker, L. (2001). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20010726224221/http://physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-3/captions/p45cap4.html Joseph Loschmidt]", ''Physics Today'', Mar.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loschmidts-molecules.jpg|200px|center|thumb|[[Joseph Loschmidt]]'s molecule drawings of [[ethylene]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[acetylene]] HC≡CH (1861)]]

Loschmidt also suggested a possible formula for benzene, but left the issue open.  The first proposal of the modern structure for benzene was due to Kekulé, in 1865.  The cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer [[Kathleen Lonsdale]]. Benzene presents a special problem in that, to account for all the bonds, there must be alternating [[double bond|double]] carbon bonds:

[[File:benz1.png|200px|center|thumb|[[Benzene]] molecule with alternating [[double bond]]s]]

In 1865, German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] was the first to make stick-and-ball molecular models, which he used in lecture at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], such as methane shown below:

[[File:Molecular Model of Methane Hofmann.jpg|150px|thumb|center|[[August Wilhelm von Hofmann|Hofmann]]'s 1865 [[stick-and-ball model]] of [[methane]] ''CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]

The basis of this model followed the earlier 1855 suggestion by his colleague [[William Odling]] that [[carbon]] is [[tetravalent]]. Hofmann's color scheme, to note, is still used to this day: [[nitrogen]] = blue, [[oxygen]] = red, [[chlorine]] = green,  [[sulfur]] = yellow, [[hydrogen]] = white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ollis | first1 = W. D. | date = 1972 | title = Models and molecules | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deficiencies in Hofmann's model were essentially geometric: [[carbon]] bonding was shown as [[plane (geometry)|planar]], rather than tetrahedral, and the atoms were out of proportion, e.g. carbon was smaller in size than the hydrogen.

In 1864, Scottish organic chemist [[Alexander Crum Brown]] began to draw pictures of molecules, in which he enclosed the symbols for atoms in circles, and used broken lines to connect the atoms together in a way that satisfied each atom's valence.

The year 1873, by many accounts, was a seminal point in the history of the development of the concept of the "molecule".  In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, James Clerk, "[http://www.thecore.nus.edu.sg/landow/victorian/science/science_texts/molecules.html Molecules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209001003/http://www.thecore.nus.edu.sg/landow/victorian/science/science_texts/molecules.html |date=2007-02-09 }}". ''Nature'', September, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states:

{{quote|An atom is a body which cannot be cut in two; a '''molecule''' is the smallest possible portion of a particular substance.}}

After speaking about the [[atomic theory]] of [[Democritus]], Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word.  He states, "it does not occur in ''[[Johnson's Dictionary]]''.  The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry."  We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called [[pressure]] of air and other gases.  At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.

In 1874, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] and [[Joseph Achille Le Bel]] independently proposed that the phenomenon of [[optical activity]] could be explained by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This led to a better understanding of the three-dimensional nature of molecules.

[[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] developed the [[Fischer projection]] technique for viewing 3-D molecules on a 2-D sheet of paper:

[[File:Fischer Projection2.svg|thumb|center|200px]]

In 1898, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in his ''Lectures on Gas Theory'', used the theory of [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] to explain the phenomenon of gas phase molecular dissociation, and in doing so drew one of the first rudimentary yet detailed atomic orbital overlap drawings.  Noting first the known fact that molecular [[iodine]] vapor dissociates into atoms at higher temperatures, Boltzmann states that we must explain the existence of molecules composed of two atoms, the "double atom" as Boltzmann calls it, by an attractive force acting between the two atoms.  Boltzmann states that this chemical attraction, owing to certain facts of chemical valence, must be associated with a relatively small region on the surface of the atom called the ''sensitive region''.

Boltzmann states that this "sensitive region" will lie on the surface of the atom, or may partially lie inside the atom, and will firmly be connected to it.  Specifically, he states "only when two atoms are situated so that their sensitive regions are in contact, or partly overlap, will there be a chemical attraction between them.  We then say that they are chemically bound to each other."  This picture is detailed below, showing the ''α-sensitive region'' of atom-A overlapping with the ''β-sensitive region'' of atom-B:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig | title = Lectures on Gas Theory | publisher = Dover |edition=Reprint | date = 1898 | isbn = 0-486-68455-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
In the early 20th century, the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] began to use dots in lecture, while teaching undergraduates at [[Harvard]], to represent the electrons around atoms.  His students favored these drawings, which stimulated him in this direction.  From these lectures, Lewis noted that elements with a certain number of electrons seemed to have a special stability.  This phenomenon was pointed out by the German chemist [[Richard Abegg]] in 1904, to which Lewis referred to as "Abegg's law of valence" (now generally known as [[Abegg's rule]]).  To Lewis it appeared that once a core of eight electrons has formed around a nucleus, the layer is filled, and a new layer is started.  Lewis also noted that various [[ion]]s with eight electrons also seemed to have a special stability. On these views, he proposed the rule of eight or [[octet rule]]: ''Ions or atoms with a filled layer of eight electrons have a special stability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cobb | first = Cathy | title = Creations of Fire - Chemistry's Lively History From Alchemy to the Atomic Age | publisher = Perseus Publishing | date = 1995 | isbn = 0-7382-0594-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, noting that a cube has eight corners Lewis envisioned an atom as having eight sides available for electrons, like the corner of a cube.  Subsequently, in 1902 he devised a conception in which [[cubic atoms]] can bond on their sides to form cubic-structured molecules.

In other words, electron-pair bonds are formed when two atoms share an edge, as in structure '''C''' below. This results in the sharing of two electrons.  Similarly, charged ionic-bonds are formed by the transfer of an electron from one cube to another, without sharing an edge '''A'''. An intermediate state '''B''' where only one corner is shared was also postulated by Lewis.

[[File:cubical atom 2.png|350px|center|thumb|Lewis cubic-atoms bonding to form '''cubic-molecules''']]

Hence, [[double bond]]s are formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This results in the sharing of four electrons.

In 1913, while working as the chair of the department of chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Lewis read a preliminary outline of paper by an English graduate student, [[Alfred Lauck Parson]], who was visiting Berkeley for a year.  In this paper, Parson suggested that the [[electron]] is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or "[[Toroidal Ring Model|magneton]]" as he called it) and furthermore that a [[chemical bond]] results from two electrons being shared between two atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Parson, A.L. (1915). "A Magneton Theory of the Structure of the Atom". ''Smithsonian Publication'' 2371, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, according to Lewis, meant that bonding occurred when two electrons formed a shared edge between two complete cubes.

On these views, in his famous 1916 article ''[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr216.3-lewispub-19160400.html The Atom and the Molecule]'', Lewis introduced the "Lewis structure" to represent atoms and molecules, where dots represent [[electron]]s and lines represent [[covalent bond]]s.  In this article, he developed the concept of the [[Covalent bond|electron-pair bond]], in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the [[Single electron bond#One- and three-electron bonds|single electron bond]], a [[single bond]], a [[double bond]], or a [[triple bond]].

[[File:Lewis-bond.svg|thumb|250px|center|Lewis-type Chemical bond]]

In Lewis' own words:
{{quote|An electron may form a part of the shell of two different atoms and cannot be said to belong to either one exclusively.}}

Moreover, he proposed that an atom tended to form an ion by gaining or losing the number of electrons needed to complete a cube.  Thus, Lewis structures show each atom in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another; occasionally, pairs of dots are used instead of lines.  Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pair of dots, and are placed next to the atoms on which they reside:

[[File:Nitrite-ion-lewis-canonical.png|300px|thumb|center|Lewis dot structures of the Nitrite-ion]]

To summarize his views on his new bonding model, Lewis states:&lt;ref&gt;"Valence and The Structure of Atoms and Molecules", G. N. Lewis, American Chemical Society Monograph Series, page 79 and 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Two atoms may conform to the rule of eight, or the octet rule, not only by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, but also by sharing one or more pairs of electrons...Two electrons thus coupled together, when lying between two atomic centers, and held jointly in the shells of the two atoms, I have considered to be the chemical bond. We thus have a concrete picture of that physical entity, that "hook and eye" which is part of the creed of the organic chemist.}}

The following year, in 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named [[Linus Pauling]] was learning the Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method at the [[Oregon Agricultural College]], which was the vogue description of bonds between atoms at the time. Each atom had a certain number of hooks that allowed it to attach to other atoms, and a certain number of eyes that allowed other atoms to attach to it. A chemical bond resulted when a hook and eye connected.  Pauling, however, wasn't satisfied with this archaic method and looked to the newly emerging field of [[quantum physics]] for a new method.

In 1927, the physicists [[Fritz London]] and [[Walter Heitler]] applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule.  Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01397394 | last1 = Heitler | first1 = Walter | last2 = London | first2 = Fritz | date = 1927 | title = Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und homöopolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 455–472 |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...44..455H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics.  Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zürich on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].

Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article "The Nature of the Chemical Bond"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01355a027 | last1 = Pauling | first1 = Linus | date = 1931 | title = The nature of the chemical bond. Application of results obtained from the quantum mechanics and from a theory of paramagnetic susceptibility to the structure of molecules | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 1367–1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/narrative/page24.html manuscript]) in which he used [[quantum mechanics]] to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds.  On these concepts, Pauling developed [[hybridization theory]] to account for bonds in molecules such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in which four sp³ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by [[hydrogen]]'s ''1s'' orbital, yielding four [[sigma bond|sigma (σ) bonds]]. The four bonds are of the same length and strength, which yields a molecular structure as shown below:

[[File:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|center|200px|A schematic presentation of hybrid orbitals overlapping hydrogens' s orbitals]]

Owing to these exceptional theories, Pauling won the 1954 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. Notably he has been the only person to ever win two unshared [[Nobel prize]]s, winning the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1963.

In 1926, French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] received the Nobel Prize in physics for proving, conclusively, the existence of molecules.  He did this by calculating [[Avogadro's number]] using three different methods, all involving liquid phase systems.  First, he used a [[gamboge]] soap-like emulsion, second by doing experimental work on [[Brownian motion]], and third by confirming Einstein’s theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, Jean, B. (1926). [https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1926/perrin/lecture/ Discontinuous Structure of Matter], Nobel Lecture, December 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, chemist [[K.L. Wolf]] introduced the concept of [[supermolecules]] (''Übermoleküle'') to describe [[hydrogen bonding]] in [[acetic acid]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s.  This would eventually lead to the area of [[supermolecular chemistry]], which is the study of non-covalent bonding.

In 1951, physicist [[Erwin Wilhelm Müller]] invents the [[field ion microscope]] and is the first to see [[atom]]s, e.g. bonded atomic arrangements at the tip of a metal point.

In 1999, researchers from the [[University]] of [[Vienna]] reported results from experiments on [[wave-particle duality]] for C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60 molecules| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

This experiment was noted for extending the applicability of wave–particle duality by about one order of magnitude in the macroscopic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Quantum physics: Waves, particles and fullerenes| first=A.

In 2009, researchers from [[IBM]] managed to take the first picture of a real molecule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8225491.stm Single molecule's stunning image].&lt;/ref&gt; Using an [[atomic force microscope]] every single atom and bond of a [[pentacene]] molecule could be imaged.

'''''Hollow Earth Expedition''''' is a [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] [[role-playing game]] set in the fictitious Hollow Earth (see [[Hollow Earth theory]]), published by [[Exile Game Studio]]. The game has been nominated for several [[Origins Award|Origins]] and [[ENnie]] awards since its release in 2006. The main rule book is ''Hollow Earth Expedition''.

==System==
''Hollow Earth Expedition'' uses the Ubiquity rules, which were also created by Exile Game Studio. The main feature of the system is its use of binary dice pool rolls to determine success. Under the default rules, each even number rolled counts as a success, while odd numbers count as nothing. Odd 'nothings' do not cancel out even 'successes', making dice rolling quick and simple. This binary system has also led to the development of special Ubiquity Dice, which are not detailed below.

==Game setting==

===The surface world===
Hollow Earth Expedition is set in the 1930s. On the surface, everything appears as it does in our real world history books, but if you dig a little deeper you encounter secret societies and villainous organizations, many of whom have a vested interest in the Hollow Earth.

Two organizations are detailed in the main rulebook: the Terra Arcana and the [[Thule Society]]. Further organizations are listed in the first expansion, '''Secrets of the Surface World'''.

The '''Terra Arcanum''' is an [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] society dedicated to keeping the Hollow Earth a secret. They have their foundations deep in the mists of time, and only a few of their current members realize their true origins.

The '''[[Thule Society]]''' are based on an actual organization associated with the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]]. In HEX they have a deep interest in getting into the Hollow Earth and the powerful ancient weapons they believe are kept there.

===The Hollow Earth===
The Hollow Earth boasts a wide selection of beasts and humans. [[Dinosaur]]s and other extinct creatures still live and hunt and are hunted by the various human groups who have become stranded in the Hollow Earth over the centuries. Not a great deal of detail is provided about the Hollow Earth in the main book, allowing Game Masters to customize the terrain to suit their campaign.

'''Mysteries of the Hollow Earth''' expands a great deal on the denizens of Hollow Earth, including rules for beastmen of various sorts, and provides details such as a map and gazetteer for those GMs who want a more fleshed-out world, rather than the more nebulous "land of mysteries" from the core book.

===Mars===

'''Revelations of [[Mars]]''' expands the setting to include the dying and dangerous Red Planet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Explore a desolate world filled with strange aliens, bizarre creatures, and ancient artifacts buried beneath its shifting sands. Discover xenophobic nomads roaming the wastelands, [[Air pirate|sky pirates]] prowling the air in their great flying vessels, and power-hungry warlords fighting over dwindling resources. Take shelter within one of the great walled city-states, and rub shoulders with haughty nobles, devout priests, and greedy merchants who plot and scheme therein.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''James Patrick Harris''' (born 1954), better known as Jim Harris, is an [[United States|American]] [[natural history|naturalist]], writer, and artist from [[El Paso, Texas]].

By his own admission "somewhat less than outstanding" in the classroom environment, Harris nonetheless managed to (eventually) obtain advanced degrees in both zoology and wildlife management. He attended (at various times) Sul Ross State University, Texas A &amp; M University, the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of Hawaii, the University of Guam, and the University of Rhodesia. Much of his formal education was obtained while on active military duty. 

Harris spent several decades roaming the world, working at a variety of occupations ranging from farrier to hunting guide to prospector.  Such widespread travels presented the opportunity for first-hand interaction with such exotic species as aardwolves, echidnas, and megamouth sharks (these and other creatures later appeared in his syndicated newspaper column, "Animal Journal"). He has since returned to his native Southwest, where he lives in an adobe home surrounded by native desert vegetation and wildlife.

Harris' work has appeared in such magazines as [[Troika magazine]], ''Enchanted Rock'', and ''Pacific'' ''Star''.  He is the author of ''Lone Star Menagerie: Adventures with Texas'' ''Wildlife'' (2000) and formerly wrote and illustrated the syndicated column "Animal Journal".

Retrieved Jul 15 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Canadian designer and artist, John Hardy, in 1975. He visited [[Bali]] in the mid-1970s and the island's jewelry-making traditions raised his interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=02&amp;episode=25 "Designing Paradise."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324195102/http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=02&amp;episode=25 |date=2010-03-24 }}- ''Recreating Eden.'' Retrieved Jul 15 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He began learning the techniques of the local artisans then developed his first pieces by applying new design concepts to traditional Balinese techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The John Hardy compound was built in Mumbal, Bali in 1996 and is the company production center where the jewelry is created. It also serves as a living and gathering space with an organic farm and low impact buildings.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1999, [[Guy Bedarida]], a senior designer of haute joaillerie of the Place Vendôme, joined the company as Head Designer and expanded Hardy’s design concepts to include the use of classical European jewelry techniques and new motifs inspired by nature and ancient East Asian art styles and themes.&lt;ref&gt;First Person: Biting it with Bling - ''Men's Folio Magazine.'' May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, then John Hardy president [[Damien Dernoncourt]], with Head Designer and Creative Director, Bedarida, purchased the company from Hardy. That same year the company headquarters was moved to Hong Kong and a satellite office was opened in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Slowey, Anne. - "Elle Fashion Insider Bali High". - ''Elle Magazine.'' Edition no. 297. Page 102. May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company opened its first flagship store in Plaza Indonesia, Jakarta in 2010. In 2011, it opened its first store at The Landmark, Hong Kong. In 2014, two more stores were opened in Bali, Indonesia.

On July 31, 2014, John Hardy announced that Robert Hanson, former CEO of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Eagle admits it fired former CEO Hanson|url=http://triblive.com/business/headlines/5506533-74/hanson-million-american|publisher=www.triblive.com|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhardy.com/inside/blog/robert-hanson-appointed-john-hardy-chief-executive-officer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109222407/http://www.johnhardy.com/inside/blog/robert-hanson-appointed-john-hardy-chief-executive-officer |archivedate=2014-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer 2016, John Hardy opened its first U.S. boutique in [[Houston]] and is scheduled to open the second on the Island of Manhattan. The building at 11 Prince Street, between Greene and Wooster streets in the SoHo neighborhood, will take up an entire building over three floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hardy’s Island Life: In Bali and New York City|url=http://jrdunn.com/blog/john-hardy-store-opens-in-nyc|publisher=www.jrdunn.com|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lepidocrocite''' (γ-FeO(OH)), also called '''esmeraldite''' or '''hydrohematite''', is an [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide|iron oxide-hydroxide]] [[mineral]]. Lepidocrocite has an [[orthorhombic]] [[crystal structure]], a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] of 5, [[specific gravity]] of 4, a submetallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and a yellow-brown streak. It is red to reddish brown and forms when [[iron]]-containing substances [[rust]] underwater. Lepidocrocite is commonly found in the [[weathering]] of primary iron minerals and in [[iron ore]] deposits. It can be seen as rust [[fouling|scale]] inside old [[steel]] [[water pipe]]s and water tanks.

The structure of lepidocrocite is similar to the [[boehmite]] structure found in [[bauxite]] and consists of layered iron(III) oxide octahedra bonded by [[hydrogen bonding]] via [[hydroxide]] layers. This relatively weakly bonded layering accounts for the ''scaley'' habit of the mineral.

It was first described in 1813 from the Zlaté Hory [[polymetallic]] [[ore]] deposit in [[Moravia]], [[Czech Republic]]. The name is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''lipis'' for ''scale'' and ''krokis'' for ''fibre.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36231">This is a '''list of Arabic star names'''. In Western [[astronomy]], most of the accepted star names are Arabic, a few are [[Greek language|Greek]] and some are of unknown origin. Typically only bright stars have names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazing.net/david/constel/starnames.html |title=Stargazing Network |publisher=Stargazing.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Arabic star names==
{{further|History of the constellations|Medieval Islamic astronomy|Book of Fixed Stars}}

Very old star names originated among people who lived in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] more than a thousand years ago, before the rise of [[Islam]]. However, many [[Arabic language]] star names sprang up later in history, as translations of ancient [[Greek language]] descriptions.

The astronomer [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' (2nd century) tabulated the celestial position and brightness (visual magnitude) of 1,025 stars. Ptolemy's book was translated into Arabic in the 8th and 9th centuries and became famous in Europe as a 12th-century Latin translation. Many of the Arabic-language star descriptions in the ''Almagest'' came to be widely used as names for stars.

Ptolemy used a strategy of "figure reference" to identify stars according to their position within a familiar constellation or asterism (e.g., "in the right shoulder of The Hunter"). [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Muslim astronomers]] adopted some of these as proper names for stars, and added names from traditional Arabic star lore, which they recorded in various [[Zij]] treatises. The most notable of these is the ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' written by the [[Muslim]] astronomer [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] (known as ''Azophi'' in the West), who thoroughly illustrated all the stars known to him along with their observations, descriptions, positions, magnitudes, brightness, and color.

In Europe, during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, many ancient star names were copied or translated incorrectly by various writers, some of whom did not know the Arabic language very well. As a result, the history of a star's name can be complicated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043446/http://www.rmsc.org/planetarium/qandi/snames.htm "Star Names: Where Do They Come From?

Because the mass of a brown dwarf is between that of a [[planet]] and that of a [[star]], they have also been called [[planetar (astronomy)|planetar]]s or [[hyperjovian]]s. Various catalog designations have been used to name brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs with names ending in a letter such as B, C, or D are in orbit around a primary star; those with names ending in a lower-case letter such as b, c, or d, were first thought to be [[exoplanet]]s (see [[Exoplanet naming convention]]).

Some exoplanets, especially those detected by [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity]], can turn out to be brown dwarfs if their mass is higher than originally thought: most have only known [[minimum mass]]es because the [[inclination]] of their [[orbit]] is not known. Examples include [[HD 114762 b]] (&gt;11.68 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Pi Mensae b]] (&gt;10.312 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[NGC 2423-3 b]] (&gt;10.6 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Status iucn3.1 CR.svg|thumb|Critically Endangered (CR) species face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.]]

As of September 2016, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) lists 2493 [[critically endangered]] [[Plantae|plant]] species, including 145 which are tagged as ''possibly extinct'' or ''possibly extinct in the wild''.&lt;ref name=IUCNDATA&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Red List version 2016-2|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/|website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IUCNPE&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 9: Possibly Extinct and Possibly Extinct in the Wild Species (IUCN Red List version 2016-2)|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/summary-statistics|website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|publisher=Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11% of all evaluated plant species are listed as critically endangered. &lt;!-- 2493 / 21898 --&gt;
The IUCN also lists 89 subspecies and 70 varieties as critically endangered.

Additionally 1674 plant species (7.6% of those evaluated) are listed as ''[[data deficient]]'', meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status. As these species typically have small distributions and/or populations, they are intrinsically likely to be threatened, according to the IUCN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limitations of the Data|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/mammals/description/limitations|website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|publisher=Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the category of ''data deficient'' indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa, the IUCN notes that it may be appropriate to give them "the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 Categories &amp; Criteria (version 3.1)|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1|website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|publisher=Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a complete list of critically endangered plant species, subspecies and varieties evaluated by the IUCN. Species considered possibly extinct by the IUCN are marked as such.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">[[File:Rappbode3.jpeg|thumb|The [[Wendefurth Reservoir]]]]
In the '''[[Harz mountains]]''' there is a higher than average number of '''[[dams]]''' with their associated '''[[reservoir]]s'''. The reason is that the Harz is one of the regions with the heaviest rainfall in [[Germany]] and so its [[water power]] was utilised very early on. The first dam (on the [[Upper Harz Ponds]]) was built in order to drive water-powered [[pumps]] and [[stamp mill]]s used in the [[Mining|mine]]s.

At the present time the Harz reservoirs provide [[hydro-electricity]], [[drinking water]] and [[flood protection]], particularly when the snows melt in spring.

The following is a list of [[dams]] in the Harz:

* [[Ecker Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Ecker]]
* [[Grane Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Grane (river)|Grane]]
* [[Hassel Auxiliary Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Hassel (river)|Hassel]], is part of the [[Rappbode Dam|Rappbode Dam system]]
* [[Innerste Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Innerste]]
* [[Kelbra Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Helme]]
* [[Königshütte Dam]] impounds the waters of both the Warme and Kalte Bode, and is part of the Rappbode Dam system
* [[Mandelholz Dam]] (flood control basin) which impounds the waters of the [[Kalte Bode]]
* [[Neustadt Dam]] (or Nordhausen Dam) which impounds the waters of the Krebsbach
* [[Oder Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Oder (Harz)|Oder]]
* [[Oderteich]] which impounds the waters of the [[Oder (Harz)|Oder]]
* [[Oker Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Oker]]
* [[Rappbode Dam]] which impounds the waters of the Rappbode und Hassel, and is part of the Rappbode Dam system
* [[Rappbode Auxiliary Dam]] which impounds the waters of the Rappbode, and is part of the Rappbode Dam system
* [[Söse Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Söse]]
* [[Wendefurth Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Bode (river)|Bode]], and is part of the Rappbode Dam system
* [[Wippra Dam]] (or Wipper Dam) which impounds the waters of the [[Wipper (Harz)|Wipper]]
* [[Zillierbach Dam]] which impounds the waters of the [[Zillierbach]]

In addition, according to the definition of a [[dam]], 30 of the [[Upper Harz Ponds]] (''Teiche'') also count as dams in the Harz. These elements of the [[Upper Harz Water Regale]] belong to the oldest working dams in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11222">Listed below are the largest [[lake]]s and [[sea]]s on various worlds in the [[Solar System]]. The table includes single bodies of water or other liquid on or near the surface of a solid body (terrestrial planet, planetoid, or moon). All objects on this list are expected to be round, hence anything that is part of a belt or disc is expected to be a [[dwarf planet]].

Cold surface oceans or lakes are found on two worlds, Earth and [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Lakes of Titan|Titan]]. [[Lava lake]]s are found on Earth and [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. [[Subsurface ocean]]s or seas occur on the other Galilean moons of Jupiter, Saturn's moons Titan and [[Enceladus]], and are suspected to exist on the some of Saturn's other moons, the asteroid Ceres, the larger [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, and [[ice planet]]s in [[planetary system]]s. Recent analysis of the interior of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] (the largest moon of Jupiter), taking into account the effects of salt, suggests that it and some of the other icy bodies may not have a single interior global ocean but several stacked ones, separated by different [[phases of ice]], with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle below.&lt;ref name = "Clavin2014"&gt;

They form from the interaction between [[lava flows]] and water. [[Steam explosion]]s fragment the lava and the fragments can pile up and form a cone. Such cones usually form on [[aa lava]] flows, and typically require large lava flows to form. They have been found on [[Hawaii]] and elsewhere.

Littoral cones are semicircular cones which are breached in the direction of the [[lava flow]] that created them. They are formed by mounds of [[clast]]s that appear like cones without a [[Volcanic crater|crater]].{{sfn|Fisher|1968|p=839}} Littoral cones are constructed by [[volcanic ash]], [[lava bomb]]s and [[lapilli]].&lt;ref name="FisherSchmincke2012" /&gt; Their component material is usually poorly sorted and can feature agglutinated structures and layering.&lt;ref name="Green1982" /&gt; Sometimes [[spatter cone|spatter]]-fed lava flows occur on such cones.&lt;ref name="GreeleyFagents2001" /&gt; They are formed by degassed [[hyaloclastite]].{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=477}}{{sfn|Fisher|1968|p=839}} The most common form found on Hawaii involves two semicircles on both sides of the lava flow that generated them;{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=472}} some such cones on Hawaii form a complete rim with diameters of {{convert|200|-|400|m}}.{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=471}} Puu Ki on Hawaii has nested craters on top of a [[lava tube]].&lt;ref name="Walker1993" /&gt; Typically such cones are not larger than {{convert|800|m}} wide and {{convert|75|m}} high.&lt;ref name="Green1982" /&gt; Other smaller cones on Hawaii have diameters of {{convert|40|m}} and heights reaching {{convert|15|m}}.{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=478}}

Littoral cones not primary volcanic [[Volcano|vents]] and distinguishing between a littoral cone and a primary vent can be difficult.&lt;ref name="Green1982" /&gt; A littoral cone forms when [[lava]] flows from land into water. Interaction between the water and the lava leads to steam explosions. These explosions throw lava fragments into the air; under favourable circumstances these fragments pile up on land and form a cone.{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=3}} This activity may resemble that of [[Hawaiian eruption|fire fountaining]].{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=478}} Repeated phases of magma-water mixing lead to the formation of bedded deposits.&lt;ref name="FisherSchmincke2012" /&gt; The steam explosions can lead to the formation of [[Limu o Pele|Pele's hair]].&lt;ref name="MattoxMangan1997" /&gt; The forming lava flows need to be sufficiently large;{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=9}} the minimum size of lava flows that have formed such cones in Hawaii is {{convert|50,000,000|yd3|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=10}} Of these, about 5-6% of their volume is converted to fragments.&lt;ref name="Green1982" /&gt; Usually littoral cones are formed by aa lava as their fragmented nature allows ideal water-lava interactions, but [[pahoehoe]] and intermediary lavas can also form littoral cones.{{sfn|Fisher|1968|p=861}} Other properties such as the speed of the lava flow and the structure of the flow front also influence the formation of littoral cones.{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=10}} Larger lava flow rates generate larger cones.{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=481}} In some littoral cones on Hawaii that were formed by pahoehoe lava flows, the collapse of a [[lava bench]] and subsequent steam explosions formed the cones instead.{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=471}} [[Pyroclastic flow]]s can also form littoral cones, one such cone has been found on [[Lombok]] and formed during the [[1257 Samalas eruption]].&lt;ref name="Vidal2015" /&gt;

[[Pseudocrater]]s and littoral cones have been found on [[Iceland]], Hawaii, [[Cerro Azul (Ecuador volcano)|Cerro Azul]] in the [[Galápagos Islands|Gálapagos Islands]],{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=471}} [[Deception Island]], [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref name="Smellie2004" /&gt; and [[Medicine Lake Volcano]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="MedicineLake" /&gt; Sometimes the words "pseudocrater" and "littoral cone" are used as synonyms.&lt;ref name="Einarsson1982" /&gt; Littoral cones are usually quickly removed by [[Coastal erosion|sea erosion]]; thus littoral cones are rare.{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=3}}

Prehistorical littoral cones have been found on the coast of Hawaii, where the volcanoes [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Kilauea]] face the sea. They were named "littoral cones" by Wentworth in 1938.{{sfn|Fisher|1968|p=842}} About 50 large cones are found on these two volcanoes and only three of them were formed during historical times; no such cones have been found on the other Hawaiian volcanoes.{{sfn|Moore|Ault|1965|p=3}} The [[Puu Oo]] and [[Mauna Ulu]] eruptions of Kilauea have also formed small littoral cones.{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=471}}

Examples of littoral cones include Sand Hills (1840 eruption) on Kilauea in Hawaii,{{sfn|Fisher|1968|p=841}} 'Au'au, Nā Pu'u a Pele, Pu'u Hou (1868 eruption) and Pu'u Kī (eruption 1300 years ago) at Mauna Loa on Hawaii,{{sfn|Jurado-Chichay|Rowland|Walker|1996|p=472}} a cone close to [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Villamil]] at [[Sierra Negra]], Galapagos,&lt;ref name="ReynoldsGeist1995" /&gt; Eldborg (1800 years ago) at [[Hengill]] on Iceland,&lt;ref name="StevensonMitchell2009" /&gt; a cone in the Winter Water unit of the [[Columbia Plateau|Columbia Plateau Basalts]], [[Oregon]],&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt; a cone at [[Becharof Lake]], [[Alaska]],&lt;ref name="Lu2002" /&gt; Burilan and Devil Rock on [[Gaua]],&lt;ref name="Metrich2016" /&gt; and Ponta de Ferraria (eruption 840 ± 60 years ago) on [[São Miguel Island]], [[Azores]].&lt;ref name="LimaNunes2016" /&gt; The Speedwell Vent in [[Derbyshire]], [[United Kingdom]] may also be a littoral cone of [[Carboniferous]] age.&lt;ref name="CheshireBell1976" /&gt; [[Pleistocene]] littoral cones may also exist in [[Lake Tahoe]], California.&lt;ref name="Tahoe" /&gt;

The '''Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission''' ('''MMS''') is a [[NASA]] [[unmanned space mission]] to study the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]], using four identical spacecraft flying in a [[Tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] formation.&lt;ref name=MMSSpacecraft&gt;{{cite web |title=MMS Spacecraft and Instruments |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mms/spacecraft/index.html |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft were launched on 13 March 2015 at 02:44&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]].&lt;ref name=MMSLaunch&gt;{{cite web |title=MMS Launch |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mms/launch/index.html |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to gather information about the [[microphysics]] of [[magnetic reconnection]], energetic particle acceleration, and [[turbulence]], processes that occur in many astrophysical [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mms.space.swri.edu/quick_facts.html |title=MMS-SMART: Quick Facts |publisher=[[Southwest Research Institute]] |first=W. S. |last=Lewis |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The mission builds upon the successes of the [[ESA]] [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster mission]], but will surpass it in spatial resolution and in temporal resolution, allowing for the first time measurements of the critical electron diffusion region, the site where magnetic reconnection occurs.  Its orbit is optimized to spend extended periods in locations where reconnection is known to occur: at the dayside [[magnetopause]], the place where the pressure from the [[solar wind]] and the planets' magnetic field are equal; and in the [[magnetotail]], which is formed by pressure from the solar wind on a planet's magnetosphere and which can extend great distances away from its originating planet.

Magnetic reconnection in [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] is one of the mechanisms responsible for the [[aurora]], and it is important to the science of controlled [[nuclear fusion]] because it is one mechanism preventing [[magnetic confinement]] of the fusion fuel. These mechanisms are studied in outer space by the measurement of motions of matter in stellar atmospheres, like that of the Sun. Magnetic reconnection is a phenomenon in which energy may be efficiently transferred from a magnetic field to the motion of charged particles.&lt;ref name="Vaivads2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microphysics of Magnetic Reconnection |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |first1=Andris |last1=Vaivads |first2=Alessandro |last2=Retinò |first3=Mats |last3=André |volume=122 |issue=1–4 |pages=19–27 |date=February 2006 |doi=10.1007/s11214-006-7019-3 |bibcode=2006SSRv..122...19V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft==
[[File:Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission - NASA.webm|thumb|left|MMS mission overview video]]
[[File:MMSPhase2b Pole Jan2May2017.UHD3840 2160p30.webm|thumb|Visualization of the spacecraft orbit transition]]

The MMS mission consists of four spacecraft. Each has a launch mass of {{convert|2998|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt; In their stowed launch configuration, each are approximately {{convert|11|by|4|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and when stacked together they have a total height of {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt; After being deployed in orbit, a total of eight axial and wire booms are deployed, increasing vehicle size to {{convert|369|by|94|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt;

The MMS spacecraft are spin stabilized, turning at a rate of three revolutions per minute to maintain orientation. Each spacecraft contains 12 thrusters connected to four hydrazine fuel tanks. Position data is provided by highly sensitive GPS equipment, while attitude is maintained by four [[star tracker]]s, two [[accelerometer]]s, and two [[sun sensor]]s.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt;

The mission is broken into three phases. The commissioning phase will last approximately five and a half months after launch, while the science phases will last two years. The first science phase will focus on the magnetic boundary between the Earth and Sun (day side operations) for one and a half years, with the spacecraft formation orbiting the Earth at {{convert|2550|by|70080|km|abbr=on}}. The second science phase will study reconnection in Earth's magnetic tail (night side operations) for half a year, increasing the orbit to {{convert|2550|by|152900|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt;

==Instruments==
Each spacecraft carries several experiments, divided into three suites: the Hot Plasma Suite, the Energetic Particles Detector Suite, and the Fields Suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mms/spacecraft/mms-instruments.html |title=Instruments Aboard MMS |publisher=NASA |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hot Plasma Suite measures [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle counts, directions, and energies during reconnection. It consists of two instruments:
*Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI), a set of four dual electron [[spectrometer]]s and four dual ion spectrometers.
*Hot Plasma Composition Analyzer (HPCA), detects particle speed in order to determine its mass and type.

The Energetic Particles Detector Suite detects particles at energies far exceeding those detected by the Hot Plasma Suite. It consists of two instruments:
*Fly's Eye Energetic Particle Sensor (FEEPS), a set of silicon solid state detectors to measure electron energy. Between two FEEPS per spacecraft, the individual detectors are arranged to provide 18 different view angles simultaneously; hence the term "fly's eye".
*Energetic Ion Spectrometer (EIS), measures energy and total velocity of detected ions in order to determine their mass. The EIS can detect helium and oxygen ions at energies higher than that of the HPCA.

The Fields Suite measures magnetic and electric field characteristics. It consists of six instruments:
*Analog Fluxgate [[magnetometer]] (AFG), determines the strength of magnetic fields.
*Digital Fluxgate magnetometer (DFG), determines the strength of magnetic fields.
*Electron Drift Instrument (EDI), measures electric and magnetic field strength by sending a beam of electrons into space and measuring how long it takes the electrons to circle back in the presence of these fields.
*Spin-plane Double Probe (SDP), consists of [[electrode]]s on the end of four {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wires booms that extend from the spacecraft to measure electric fields.
*Axial Double Probe (ADP), a set of electrodes on two {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} antennas mounted axially on the spacecraft.
*Search Coil Magnetometer (SCM), an induction magnetometer used to measure magnetic fields.

The principal investigator is [[James L. Burch]] of [[Southwest Research Institute]], assisted by an international team of investigators, both instrument leads and theory and modeling experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mms.space.swri.edu/team.html |title=The SMART Team |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Project Scientist is Thomas E. Moore of [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/sunearthsystem/main/tmoore-qanda.html |title=Q&amp;A: Missions, Meetings, and the Radial Tire Model of the Magnetosphere |work=NASA.gov |first1=Karen C. |last1=Fox |first2=Tom |last2=Moore |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education and public outreach is a key aspect of the mission, with student activities, data sonification, and planetarium shows being developed.

The mission was selected for support by NASA in 2005. System engineering, spacecraft bus design, integration and testing has been performed by [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Maryland]]. Instrumentation is being improved, with extensive experience brought in from other projects, such as the [[IMAGE]], [[Cluster mission|Cluster]] and [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] missions. In June 2009, MMS was allowed to proceed to Phase C, having passed a [[Preliminary Design Review]]. The mission passed its [[Critical Design Review]] in September 2010.&lt;ref name="magnetospheric1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/sunearthsystem/main/mms-cdr.html |title=NASA's Magnetospheric Mission Passes Major Milestone |work=NASA.gov |first=Susan |last=Hendrix |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft launched on an [[Atlas V]] 421 rocket,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/pages/News.shtml#/26 |title=United Launch Alliance Atlas V Awarded Four NASA Rocket Launch Missions |publisher=[[United Launch Alliance]] |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2015.&lt;ref name=MMSLaunch /&gt;&lt;ref name="spnews20111219"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/spending-lags-growing-recognition-heliophysics-contribution |title=Spending Lags Growing Recognition of Heliophysics' Contribution |work=Space News |first=Debra |last=Werner |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation flying==
In order to collect the desired science data, the four satellite MMS constellation must maintain a tetrahedral formation through a defined region of interest in a highly elliptical orbit. The formation will be maintained through the use of a high altitude rated [[GPS]] receiver, Navigator, to provide orbit knowledge, and regular [[Satellite formation flying|formation maintenance]] maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft.html |title=Magnetospheric Multiscale Spacecraft |website=mms.gsfc.nasa.gov |language=en |access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
In 2016 the MMS mission was the first to directly detect [[magnetic reconnection]], the phenomenon which drives [[space weather]] in the Earth's magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-probes-witness-powerful-magnetic-storms-near-earth/ |title=NASA Probes Witness Powerful Magnetic Storms near Earth |work=Scientific American |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aaf2939 |pmid=27174677 |bibcode=2016Sci...352.2939B |title=Electron-scale measurements of magnetic reconnection in space |journal=Science |volume=352 |issue=6290 |at=aaf2939 |date=June 2016 |last1=Burch |first1=J.

'''Marjory Stoneman Douglas''' (April 7, 1890&amp;nbsp;– May 14, 1998) was an American journalist, author, women's suffrage advocate, and conservationist  known for her staunch defense of the [[Everglades]] against efforts to drain it and reclaim land for development. Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', she became a [[freelance writer]], producing over a hundred [[short story|short stories]] that were published in popular magazines. Her most influential work was the book ''[[The Everglades: River of Grass]]'' (1947), which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp. Its impact has been compared to that of [[Rachel Carson]]'s influential book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962). Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami, enabling her to advance her causes.

As a young woman, Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of the [[women's suffrage]] and [[civil rights]] movements. She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79&amp;nbsp;years old. For the remaining 29&amp;nbsp;years of her life she was "a relentless reporter and fearless crusader" for the natural preservation and restoration of [[South Florida]].&lt;ref name="Grunwald"&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt; Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname "Grande Dame of the Everglades"&lt;ref&gt;Basse, Craig (May 14, 1998). "Grande dame of the Everglades." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;1A.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida. She received numerous awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], and was inducted into several halls of fame.

Douglas lived to 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' in London stated, "In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas."&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, Rupert (May 25, 1998).

Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7, 1890, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], the only child of Frank Bryant Stoneman (1857–1941) and Florence Lillian Trefethen (1859–1912), a concert violinist. One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe.&lt;ref name="Douglas42"&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', which she kept well into adulthood until "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back".&lt;ref name="Douglas42" /&gt; She visited Florida when she was four, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the [[Tampa Bay Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from [[Tampa]] to [[Havana]].&lt;ref name="duncan"&gt;Duncan, Scott (May 15, 1998). "Marjory, we loved you so." ''The Miami Herald''; Commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was six, Marjory's parents separated. Her father endured a series of failed entrepreneurial ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the Trefethen family house in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]. She lived there with her mother, aunt, and grandparents, who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father, to her dismay.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, whom Marjory characterized as "high-strung", was committed to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental sanitarium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] several times. Her parents' separation and the contentiousness of her mother's family caused her to suffer from [[night terror]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;47,&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her "a skeptic and a dissenter" for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, Marjory found solace in reading, and eventually she began to write. At sixteen she contributed to the most popular children's publication of the day, ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''—also the first publisher of 20th-century writers [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Rachel Carson]], and [[William Faulkner]]—with a puzzle titled "Double Beheadings and Double Curtailings". In 1907, she was awarded a prize by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' for "An Early Morning Paddle", a story about a boy who watches a sunrise from a canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; As her mother's mental health deteriorated, Marjory took on more responsibilities, eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and marriage===

Her dark hair is parted in the middle and piled on her head.|Marjory Stoneman in her senior year at [[Wellesley College]]]]

Marjory left for college in 1908, despite grave misgivings about her mother's mental state. Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns, but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a straight-A student at [[Wellesley College]],&lt;ref name="friends"&gt;[http://www.everglades.org/about_marjory "Marjory Stoneman Douglas."] Friends of the Everglades website. Retrieved on December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular success in a class on [[elocution]], and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected Class Orator, but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

After drifting with college friends through a few jobs to which she did not feel well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30&amp;nbsp;years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other matters. Douglas was married to Marjory while already married to another woman.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; While he spent six months in jail for [[fraud|passing a bad check]], she remained faithful to him. His scheme to [[scam]] her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 86,&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsmakers"&gt;"Marjory Stoneman Douglas."'' Newsmakers 1998'', Issue 4. Gale Group, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and end the marriage. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation. Shortly before that, her father had married Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, a great-great-granddaughter of [[Thomas Jefferson]] (her grandfather was [[Francis W. Eppes]]). Marjory later wrote that Shine "remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=Marjory Stoneman|title=Voice of the River|date=1987|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, FL|isbn=978-0-910923-33-0|pages=96–97|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xwume8AdOUC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22marjory+stoneman+douglas%22+and+jefferson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6scNhqX1Bg&amp;sig=TjLV1HwMq4HdzBWWMJfJKmqyDk8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ-M_phLrNAhVLPT4KHRTjA4YQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marjory%20stoneman%20douglas%22%20and%20jefferson&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 June 2016|ref=Voice of the River}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==

===''The Miami Herald''===
Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5,000&amp;nbsp;people lived in Miami and it was "no more than a glorified railroad terminal".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for [[United States federal judge|circuit judge]], Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman was referred to as "Judge" for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas joined the newspaper's staff in 1915. She began as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'".&lt;ref name="fichter"/&gt; When her father went on vacation less than a year after her arrival in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at ''[[The Miami Metropolis]]'' whose greater familiarity with Miami history gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman from Miami to join the [[US Naval Reserve]]. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas herself joined the Navy as a [[Yeoman (F)]] first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar, so she requested a discharge and joined the [[American Red Cross]], which stationed her in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 241–245.&lt;/ref&gt; She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the [[Rue de Rivoli]] when the Armistice was signed&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; and cared for war [[refugee]]s; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Douglas served as assistant editor at ''The Miami Herald''. She gained some renown for her daily column, "The Galley", becoming something of a local celebrity. She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem. "The Galley" was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose. She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|saw a population boom]] of 100,000&amp;nbsp;people in a decade. She wrote supporting women's suffrage, [[civil rights]], and better sanitation while opposing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and foreign trade tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the region's wealth as being in its "inevitable development", and she supplemented her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s she wrote "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now", a ballad lamenting the death of a 22-year-old [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] who was beaten to death in a [[labor camp]]. It was printed in ''The Miami Herald'', and read aloud during a session of the [[Florida Legislature]], which passed a law banning [[Convict lease|convict leasing]] in large part due to her writing.&lt;ref name="fichter"/&gt; "I think that's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I've written", she wrote in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freelance writer===
After quitting the newspaper in 1923, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109&amp;nbsp;fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] magazine ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' for $600 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|600|1923|r=-1|fmt=c}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}). Forty of her stories were published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''; one, "Story of a Homely Woman", was reprinted in 1937 in the ''Post's'' best short stories compilation.&lt;ref name="scribner"&gt;Mason, Kathy. "Marjory Stoneman Douglas." ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Volume 5: 1997–1999. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring settings in her fiction were South Florida, the Caribbean, and Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent, quirky women or youthful underdogs who encountered social or natural injustices.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 313–315.&lt;/ref&gt; The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings. "Plumes", originally published in the ''Saturday Evening Post'' in 1930, was based on the murder of [[Guy Bradley]], an Audubon Society game warden, by [[Poaching|poacher]]s. "Wings" was a nonfiction story, also first appearing in the ''Post'' in 1931, that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers. Her story "Peculiar Treasure of a King" was a second-place finalist in the [[O. Henry Award]] competition in 1928.&lt;ref name="scribner"/&gt;

During the 1930s, she was commissioned to write a [[pamphlet]] supporting a [[botanical garden]] called "An argument for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden in South Florida." Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area, then to serve on the board to support the [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden|Fairchild Garden]]. She called the garden "one of the greatest achievements for the entire area".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas became involved with the [[Miami Theater]], and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, "The Gallows Gate", was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;183.&lt;/ref&gt; With William W. Muir, husband of reporter [[Helen Muir (reporter)|Helen Muir]], she authored "Storm Warnings", a play loosely based on the life of mobster [[Al Capone]]. Some of Capone's henchmen showed up at the theater, "add[ing] an extra tingle for the audience that night", though no actual problems arose.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Helen (1990) [1953]. ''Miami, U.S.A.'' Miami: The Pickering Press, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas wrote the foreword to the [[Work Projects Administration]]'s guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the [[Federal Writers' Project]]'s [[American Guide Series]].&lt;ref name="WPA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project |year=1941 |title=A Guide to Miami and Dade County Including Miami Beach and Coral Gables |url=https://archive.org/stream/miamianddade00editmiss/miamianddade00editmiss_djvu.txt |location=New York |publisher=Rhode Printing-Publishing Company}} Retrieved on June 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas served as the book review editor of ''The Miami Herald'' from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the [[University of Miami]] Press from 1960 to 1963. She released her first novel, ''Road to the Sun'', in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several nonfiction books on regional topics including Florida [[birdwatching]] and [[David Fairchild]], a biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography, ''Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River'', was written with [[John Rothchild]] in 1987. She had been working on a book about [[W. H. Hudson]] for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Leposky, Rosalie (1997). "Marjory Stoneman Douglas: A Bibliography."

Early in the 1940s Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the [[Rivers of America Series]] by writing about the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]]. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about "an inch long",&lt;ref name="scribner"/&gt; but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher to allow her to write about them instead. She spent five years researching what little was known about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist [[Garald G. Parker|Garald Parker]], who discovered that South Florida's sole freshwater source was the [[Biscayne Aquifer]], and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the Everglades' essence, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 355–358.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Everglades: River of Grass]]'' was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing in a month.&lt;ref name="newsmakers"/&gt; The book's first line, "There are no other Everglades in the world", has been called the "most famous passage ever written about the Everglades",&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt; and the line welcomes visitors to the [[Everglades National Park]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm "Everglades National Park."] National Park Service. Retrieved on December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas characterized the Everglades as an ecosystem surrounding a river worthy of protection, inescapably connected to South Florida's people and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter, "The Eleventh Hour":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cattlemen's grass fires roared uncontrolled. Cane-field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke. Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette butts, and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before every wind leaving only blackness&amp;nbsp;... There was no water in the canals with which to fight [the fires]&amp;nbsp;... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or had shrunk far down into its strange holes and cleavages.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas (1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;374–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Everglades: River of Grass'' galvanized people to protect the Everglades and has been compared to [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 exposé of the harmful effects of [[DDT]], ''[[Silent Spring]]''; both books are "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice".&lt;ref&gt;Hauserman, Julie (October 14, 2007). "Paradise down the drain." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;9L.&lt;/ref&gt; Its impact is still felt as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists,&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Edna (March 15, 2003). "Miami advice; If you're wondering why so many people flock to Florida, Edna Buchanan nominates three books to explain its unique allure." ''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada); p.&amp;nbsp;D19.&lt;/ref&gt; and "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Pamela (July 16, 2001). "Women who made a difference." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;3D.&lt;/ref&gt; It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000&amp;nbsp;copies since its original publication. The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote of it in 1997, "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Richey, Warren (September 3, 1997). "Reviving Florida's Fragile 'River of Grass'." ''Christian Science Monitor''; p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; The downside of the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her [[metaphor]] of a River of Grass is so predominant that the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades is oversimplified. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas's "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Women's suffrage was an early interest of Douglas, and although she tended to shy away from polemics in her early work at ''The Miami Herald'', on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 229–231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s wife, and two other women to [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to [[Idolatry|graven images]]. They never paid attention to us at all."&lt;ref name="byers"/&gt; Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.

Using her influence at ''The Miami Herald'', Douglas wrote columns about poverty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept&amp;nbsp;... but if you have a weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value.&lt;ref name="davisgreen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s were connected to the [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the [[referendum]] passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC95A_10.htm "Elizabeth Virrick's work in Coconut Grove's black community: Interview with Marjory Stoneman Douglas."] Florida International University. June 16, 1983. Retrieved on January 5, 2008. Douglas claims in this oral history that the Committee served in the early 1920s. However, according to the websites of [http://www.coconutgrovecares.org/about.htm Coconut Grove Cares]—an updated name for the organization—and the [http://www.jlmiami.org/our-history/ Junior League of Miami], the Committee did not begin its service until 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everglades work===
Stoneman Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by [[Ernest F. Coe]] and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969—at the age of 79—Douglas founded [[Friends of the Everglades]] to protest the construction of a [[Environmental Impact of the Big Cypress Swamp Jetport|jetport in the Big Cypress]] portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, "It is a woman's business to be interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping."&lt;ref name="fichter"/&gt;

She toured the state giving "hundreds of ringing denunciations" of the airport project,&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;257–258.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3,000 within three years. She ran the public information operation full-time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport's developers and backers, who called her a "damn butterfly chaser".&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]], however, scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups.

Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on [[Restoration of the Everglades|restoring the Everglades]] after declaring that "Conservation is now a dead word... You can't conserve what you haven't got."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades. A coalition of [[sugarcane]] growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting [[Lake Okeechobee]] by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, which served as the fresh water source for the [[South Florida metropolitan area|Miami metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC930_11.htm "Pollution caused by growing sugar in Florida."] ''Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale'', Florida International University. May 6, 1983. Retrieved on January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the [[West Indies]], which, she claimed, was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC930_12.htm "Damages caused by the Army Corps of Engineers and Big Sugar."] ''Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale", Florida International University. May 6, 1983. Retrieved on January 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Big Sugar, Douglas spoke about the damage the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central &amp; South Florida Project (C&amp;SF), run by former members of the Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt; "What a liar I turned out to be!" remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement".&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;241,&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in attendance dropped his pen on the floor. As he was stooping to pick it up, Douglas stopped her speech and said to him, "Colonel! You can crawl under that table and hide, but you can't get away from me!"&lt;ref&gt;Hauserman, Julie (April 19, 1999). "Leaving an environmental hot seat." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;1B.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]], and was observed by John Rothchild:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like [[Scarlett O'Hara]] as played by [[Igor Stravinsky]]. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes&amp;nbsp;... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.&lt;ref name="friends"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Douglas was not well received by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, she was the only opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. "Can't you boo any louder than that?" she chided, eventually making them laugh. "Look. I'm an old lady. I've been here since eight o'clock. It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat," she told them.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she wrote, "They're all good souls—they just shouldn't be out there."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;232.&lt;/ref&gt; Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.

Florida Governor [[Lawton Chiles]] explained her impact, saying, "Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life. She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement, she was a prophet, calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren."&lt;ref name="fichter"/&gt;

===Other causes===
Douglas also served as a charter member of the first [[American Civil Liberties Union]] chapter organized in the South in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; She lent her support to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect [[migrant workers#United States|migrant farm workers]] who were centered on [[Belle Glade, Florida|Belle Glade]], and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor [[Bob Graham]] in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8&amp;nbsp;million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in [[Crandon Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, Theodora.

==Personal life==

===Religious views===
Although Douglas grew up in an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] household, she described herself as agnostic throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial.&lt;ref name="fichter"&gt;Fichter, Margaria (May 14, 1998). "Pioneering environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas dies at 108." ''The Miami Herald''; Domestic news.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers when her mother was dying.&lt;ref name="davisgreen"&gt;Davis, Jack (Summer 2001). "Green Awakening: Social activism and the evolution of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's Environmental Consciousness." ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''80''' (1), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she credited the motivation for her support of [[women's suffrage]] to her [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] paternal grandparents whose dedication to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] she admired, and proudly claimed [[Levi Coffin]], an organizer of the [[Underground Railroad]], was her great-great-uncle.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Jack (January 2003). "'Conservation is now a dead word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the transformation of American environmentalism." ''Environmental History'' '''8''' (1) pp.&amp;nbsp;53–76.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that his wife was a friend of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' fleeing slavery because Douglas' great-great-aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony, and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life, even after converting to Episcopalianism. Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen Muir suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas' use of "Friends" in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries.&lt;ref name="davisgreen"/&gt;

===Mental health===
As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents' separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her mother's death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at ''The Miami Herald'', in the 1920s, she suffered the first of three [[nervous breakdown]]s.&lt;ref name="byers"&gt;Byers, Stephen (January 3, 1999). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EEDA143FF930A35752C0A96F958260 "The Lives They Lived: Marjory Stoneman Douglas."] ''The New York Times''; p.&amp;nbsp;46. Retrieved on May 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas suggested she had what she referred to as "blank periods" before and during her marriage, but they were brief. She connected these lapses to her mother's insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;167.&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually quit the newspaper, but after her father's death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown, when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming. She realized she had a "[[father complex]]", explaining it by saying, "Having been brought up without him all those years, and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal habits===

Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades, Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. "To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there&amp;nbsp;... It's too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable", she wrote. Instead, she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;

Despite Douglas' demure appearance—she stood at {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} and weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg}}, and was always immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had an uncanny ability to get her point across. She was known for speaking in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' who interviewed and wrote several stories about Stoneman Douglas, wrote of her, "She had a tongue like a [[switchblade]] and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen."&lt;ref name="conserving"/&gt; Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.&lt;ref name="klink obit"&gt;Klinkenberg, Jeff. "Though expected, the loss of a hero still stings." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;6A.&lt;/ref&gt;

She enjoyed drinking [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] and [[sherry]]; as friend and neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, "She would come up and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, and we would have another sherry. What fun she was."&lt;ref name="fichter"/&gt; Novelist [[Hervey Allen]] called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir "the Stewart Avenue Gang".&lt;ref name = "babygrace"&gt;Muir, Helen (2004). ''Baby Grace Sees the Cow: A Memoir.'' The Prologue Society (Miami).&lt;/ref&gt; The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and the role of women in South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another.&lt;ref name="The Helen Muir Collection"/&gt; Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no [[air conditioning]], electric stove, or dishwasher.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;16,&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was attached to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, she said she did not believe in [[extramarital sex]] and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying "I wasn't a wild woman".&lt;ref name="conserving"&gt;Klinkenberg, Jeff (August 21, 2006). "Conserving the conservationist." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&amp;nbsp;1E.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work.&lt;ref name="Grunwald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; "People don't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways", she wrote in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards, death, and legacy==

===Honors===
Douglas began accruing honors in her early days writing for ''The Miami Herald''. In the 1980s, the awards became more prestigious, and her reactions to them mixed. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (now the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]]) named its headquarters in Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she considered a dubious honor. She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building. During her polite acceptance speech, she railed against [[Ronald Reagan]] and the then-Secretary of the Interior [[James G. Watt|James Watt]] for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 553–554.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the [[National Parks Conservation Association]] established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award, which "honor(s) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the [[National Park System]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npca.org/media_center/press_releases/2005/page-27601043.html "Grand Canyon Advocate Receives National Parks Award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703231708/http://www.npca.org/media_center/press_releases/2005/page-27601043.html |date=July 3, 2008 }} (Press release). National Parks Conservation Association. October 31, 2005. Retrieved on December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite blindness and diminished hearing, Douglas continued to be active into her second century, and was honored with a visit from [[Queen Elizabeth II]], to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of ''The Everglades: River of Grass'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of gifts and celebrations, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, resulting in over 100,000 planted trees across the state and a bald cypress on the lawn of the governor's mansion. The [[South Florida Water Management District]] began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 572–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, when she was 103, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Douglas the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honor granted by the United States of America. The citation for the medal read, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Marjory Stoneman Douglas personifies passionate commitment. Her crusade to preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation's respect for our precious environment, reminding all of us of nature's delicate balance. Grateful Americans honor the 'Grandmother of the Glades' by following her splendid example in safeguarding America's beauty and splendor for generations to come."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Douglas donated her medal to Wellesley College. Most of the others she received she stored at her home.&lt;ref name="conserving"/&gt;

Douglas was posthumously inducted into the [[National Wildlife Federation]] Hall of Fame in 1999, and the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=50 "Marjory Stoneman Douglas."] National Women's Hall of Fame website. Retrieved on December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; John Rothchild declared her a [[feminism|feminist]] before the word existed. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?"&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character [[Lisa Simpson]] made a papier-mâché bust of her with [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]] in [[Bart vs. Thanksgiving|an early episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Douglas's stories were collected by [[University of Florida]] professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: ''Nine Florida Stories'' in 1990 and ''A River In Flood'' in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas's short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her as an environmentalist but did not know about her career as a freelance writer. "Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove", McCarthy wrote in the introduction to ''A River in Flood''.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Kevin (1998). "Introduction". ''A River in Flood''. University Press of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remembrances===
Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on May 14, 1998. John Rothchild, who helped write her autobiography, said that her death was the only thing that could "shut her up" and added, "The silence is terrible."&lt;ref name="usatoday obit"&gt;Watson, Tracy. (May 15, 1988). "Douglas, Everglades' lifesaver, dies at 108 'River of Grass' spoke for marshes." ''[[USA Today]]''; p.&amp;nbsp;8A.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Hiaasen]] eulogized her in ''The Miami Herald'', writing that ''The Everglades: River of Grass'' was "monumental", and praised her passion and her resolve; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a [[photo opportunity]], she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.&lt;ref&gt;Hiaasen, Carl (May 18, 1998). "A fierce advocate for the Everglades." ''The Miami Herald''; Commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in [[Coral Gables]], which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life-size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered.&lt;ref name="conserving"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, David (September 2, 2007).

'''''Missen''''' (singular: ''misse'') are small, shallow, forest [[bog]]s in [[pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris'')-dominated woods that form on [[hill ridge|crests]], [[saddle (landform)|saddles]], [[Valley#Hollows|hollows]] or [[plateau]]s in the hills or mountains. They only have a thin layer of [[peat]] of between 30 and 100 centimetres thick. The term ''misse'' is local to the [[Northern Black Forest]] and also surfaces as '''''Miß''''', '''''Müsse''''' or '''''Müß'''''. These names probably derive from the German ''Moos'' ("moss") because [[peat moss]]es (''Sphagnum'') play a key role in their development. Due to the poor tree growth associated with them, however, it could also stand for ''mies'' ("bad").

''Missen'' are most common on plateaus where the precipitation is heavy and the drainage is poor. But event silted-up [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] and shallow tarn soils may have ''missen'' on their hillsides ([[Bog#Hillside bog|Hillside or swamp bogs]]). [[Floristically]] and depending on location, ''missen'' may transition into [[raised bog]]s, whereby  ombrotrophes, i.e. areas exclusively fed by rainwater, (initially) are formed, albeit they only have a small surface area.

== Formation ==

''Missen'' are formed on base-poor soils that have a tendency to become waterlogged. In addition, other climatic factors such as high levels of precipitation, a relatively short vegetation period and a cool, moist, montane climate are basic pre-requisites. Human exploitation may also favour the emergence of ''missen''. The introduction of stall feeding in the 19th century forced forest farmers to use the ground vegetation as [[bedding (animals)|bedding]]. On poor [[bunter sandstone]] soils [[raw humus]] is laid down as a result of the constant removal of nutrients. The [[European blueberry|blueberry]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus''), an indicator of acidicism, becomes the dominant type of dwarf shrub. [[Moor grass]] (''Molinia caerulea'', ''M. arundinacea'') colonises the shore areas in dense [[tussock (grass)|tussocks]].

'''Modern flat Earth societies''' consist of individuals who promote the erroneous idea that the [[flat Earth|Earth is flat]] rather than a [[Figure of the Earth|sphere]]. Such groups date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by [[pseudoscience]].

Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups, many of which have members from several countries.&lt;ref name=Ambrose/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dure/&gt;

==Historical context==
{{See also|Biblical literalism}}
Modern [[flat Earth]] hypotheses originated with the English writer [[Samuel Rowbotham]] (1816–1884). Based on conclusions derived from the [[Bedford Level experiment]], Rowbotham published a pamphlet ''Zetetic Astronomy.'' He later expanded into a book ''Earth Not a Globe'', proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, [[Antarctica]]. Rowbotham further held that the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] were 3,000 miles (4,800&amp;nbsp;km) above Earth and that the "cosmos" was 3,100 miles (5,000&amp;nbsp;km) above the Earth.&lt;ref name="Schick 1995" /&gt; He also published a leaflet titled ''The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures'', which argued that the "Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowbotham and followers like [[William Carpenter (flat Earth theorist)|William Carpenter]] gained attention by successful use of [[pseudoscience]] in public debates with leading scientists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 7 April 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title =The Form of the Earth—A Shock of Opinions |journal=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 August 1871 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/10/78770850.pdf |accessdate= 2 November 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, John (1870): The Bedford Canal swindle detected &amp; exposed. A. Bull, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York, shipping over a thousand copies of ''Zetetic Astronomy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount established a Universal Zetetic Society, whose objective was "the propagation of knowledge related to Natural [[Cosmogony]] in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation". The society published a magazine, ''The Earth Not a Globe Review'', and remained active well into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="speakvenusian"/&gt; A flat Earth journal, ''Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science'', was published between 1901–1904, edited by Lady Blount.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=155–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Flat Earth Research Society==
In 1956, [[Samuel Shenton]] created the International Flat Earth Research Society as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society, running it as "organising secretary" from his home in [[Dover]], England.&lt;ref name="speakvenusian"&gt;{{cite book |last= Moore |first= Patrick |authorlink= Patrick Moore |title= Can You Speak Venusian? |date= 1972 |isbn= 0-352-39776-4 |chapterurl= http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/library/books/Better%20and%20Flatter%20Earths%20%28Patrick%20Moore%29.pdf |chapter-format= PDF |chapter= Better and Flatter Earths }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore 1967"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484882/the_cincinnati_enquirer|title=So now we know: The Earth is not only flat—it's motionless, too|last=Gilmore|first=Eddy|date=26 March 1967|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|access-date=15 February 2018|dead-url=|page=26-I|subscription=y|via=Newspapers.com}}  {{free access}} Readable clippings in four parts: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484925/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ 1] • [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484950/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ 2] • [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484958/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ 3]
• [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17484965/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Given Shenton's interest in alternative science and technology, the emphasis on religious arguments was less than in the predecessor society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=220–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; When satellite images showed Earth as a sphere, Shenton remarked: "It's easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schadewald|first=RJ |url= http://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer |title= Six "flood" arguments creationists can't answer |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later asked about similar photographs taken by astronauts, he attributed curvature to the use of [[wide-angle lens]], adding, "It's a deception of the public and it isn't right".&lt;ref name="Gilmore 1967" /&gt;

In 1969, Shenton persuaded [[Ellis Hillman]], a [[University of East London|Polytechnic of East London]] lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the [[Science Fiction Foundation]] he helped to establish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garwood|2007|pp=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shenton died in 1971. [[Charles K. Johnson]] inherited part of Shenton's library from Shenton's wife, and established and became president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People's Church in California. Over the next three decades, under his leadership, the Flat Earth Society grew to a reported 3,500 members.&lt;ref name="Martin 2001"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/us/charles-johnson-76-proponent-of-flat-earth.html |title= Charles Johnson, 76, Proponent of Flat Earth |date= 25 March 2001 |accessdate= 27 December 2013 |work= The New York Times |first= Douglas |last= Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson issued many publications and handled all membership applications. The most famous publication was ''Flat Earth News,'' a quarterly, four-page [[Paper size#Loose sizes|tabloid]].&lt;ref name="Schadwald 1980" /&gt; Johnson paid for these publications through annual member dues costing [[United States dollar|US$]]6 to US$10 over the course of his leadership.&lt;ref name="Schadwald 1980" /&gt; Johnson cited the Bible for his beliefs, and he saw scientists as pulling a hoax which would replace religion with science.&lt;ref name="Martin 2001" /&gt;

The Flat Earth Society's most recent planet model is that humanity lives on a disc, with the [[North Pole]] at its centre and a 150-foot (45 m) high wall of ice, [[Antarctica]], at the outer edge.&lt;ref name="whirling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/library/newsletters/Flat%20Earth%20Society%20Newsletter%20-%201979%20March.pdf |title=Is the Earth a Whirling Globe? |first=Wilbur Glenn |last=Voliva |date=March 1979 |work=Flat Earth News |publisher=International Flat Earth Research Society |location=Lancaster, CA |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[map]] resembles the [[Flag of the United Nations|symbol of the United Nations]], which Johnson used as evidence for his position.&lt;ref name="fesn_d78p2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/library/newsletters/Flat%20Earth%20Society%20Newsletter%20-%201978%20December.pdf |title=Flat Earth News: News of the World's Children |first=Charles K. |last=Johnson |date=December 1978 |publisher=International Flat Earth Research Society |location=Lancaster, California |page=2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] are each 32 miles (52&amp;nbsp;km) in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/library/newsletters/Flat%20Earth%20Society%20Newsletter%20-%201978%20December.pdf|title=Sun is a light 32 miles across|last=Johnson|first=Charles K.|date=December 1978|work=Flat Earth News|access-date=1 January 2018|dead-url=|publisher=International Flat Earth Research Society |location=Lancaster, California|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat Earth Society recruited members by speaking against the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] and all its agencies, particularly [[NASA]]. Much of the society's literature in its early days focused on [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpreting the Bible]] to mean that the Earth is flat, although they did try to offer scientific explanations and evidence.&lt;ref name="Schadwald 1980" /&gt;

===Criticism and decline===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|alt=A photograph of the Earth taken from Apollo 17|left|thumb|A photograph of the Earth taken from Apollo 17]]

[[Eugenie Scott]] called the group an example of "extreme Biblical-literalist theology: The earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat, regardless of what science tells us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Eugenie|year=1997|title=Antievolution and Creationism in the United States|url=http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Scott.history%20of%20creat.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=26|pages=263–289|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.263|authorlink=Eugenie Scott|accessdate=8 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605065015/http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Scott.history%20of%20creat.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles K. Johnson the membership of the group rose to 3,500 under his leadership, but began to decline after a fire at his house in 1997 which destroyed all of the records and contacts of the society's members. Johnson's wife, who helped manage the membership database, died shortly thereafter. Johnson himself died on 19 March 2001.&lt;ref name="president1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=John R.|url=http://ncse.com/rncse/21/3-4/flat-earth-society-president-dies |title=Flat Earth Society President Dies|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |year=2001 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Flat Earth Society Logo.png|thumb|Logo of the 2013 Flat Earth Society]]

===Relaunch===

In 2004, Daniel Shenton (not related to Samuel)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2010/03/19/tentaciones/1269026579_850215.html|title=Miedo a un planeta esférico|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; resurrected the Flat Earth Society, basing it around a web-based discussion [[internet forum|forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/ |title=The Flat Earth Society forum|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the official relaunch of the society in October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/library/pressreleases/flat_earth_society_press_release.pdf |title=Relaunch of the Flat Earth Society (press release)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of a new website, featuring a public collection of flat Earth literature and a [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/ |title=The Flat Earth Society Homepage|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the society began accepting new members for the first time since 2001, with musician [[Thomas Dolby]] becoming the first to join the newly reconvened society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of July 2017, over 500 people have become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flat Earth Society – Membership Register|url=http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/index.php/about-the-society/membership-register|website=''theflatearthsociety.org''|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013, part of this society broke away to form a new web-based group also featuring a forum and wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flat Earth Society|url=http://www.tfes.org/|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian society==
Flat Earth Society of Canada was established on 8 November 1970 by philosopher [[Leo Ferrari]], writer [[Raymond Fraser]] and poet [[Alden Nowlan]];&lt;ref name=nbl-encyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Charles Ferrari|url=http://w3.stu.ca/stu/sites/nble/f/ferrari_leo_charles.html|work=New Brunswick Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=St. Thomas University|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was active until 1984.&lt;ref name=ferrari-fond-series2&gt;{{cite web|title=Series No. 2 The Flat Earth Society of Canada|url=http://www.lib.unb.ca/archives/finding/ferrari/s2.html|work=Leo C.

They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories "on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses."&lt;ref name=ferrari-fond-series2 /&gt; The parodic intention of the Society appeared in the writings of Ferrari, as he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the [[spherical Earth]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrari|first=Leo Charles|year=1975|title=Feminism and education in a Flat Earth perspective|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/download/7006/4948|journal=McGill Journal of Education|volume=X|issue=1|pages=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrari even claimed to have nearly fallen off "the Edge" of the Earth at Brimstone Head on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador|Fogo Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John R|title=Canadian Literary Landmarks|date=1984|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-0888820730|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-media artist [[Kay Burns]] re-created the Flat Earth Society of Canada as an art project with her [[alter ego]] Iris Taylor&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; as its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Earth Society|url=http://www.itaylorresearch.com/|website=Iris Taylor Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns created an installation entitled the Museum of the Flat Earth, which included some artefacts from the 1970 group. It was exhibited in 2016 at the Flat Earth Outpost Café in [[Shoal Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Shoal Bay]], Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

==In popular culture ==

* [[Richard A. Lupoff]]'s novel ''Circumpolar!'' (1984) describes a flat Earth, with a hole at the centre instead of a North Pole, and the underside contains fictional lands such as [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/l/richard-a-lupoff/circumpolar.htm |title=Circumpolar!

* California-based [[punk rock]] band [[Bad Religion]] include a song titled "Flat Earth Society", by [[Brett Gurewitz]], on their album ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'' (1990).

* In 1984, English musician [[Thomas Dolby]] released an album called ''[[The Flat Earth]]''. This became the name for his fan club and subsequent website forums. Daniel Shenton credited this album as his introduction to the theory, and offered the first membership of the reopened Society.

Modern flat earthers generally embrace some form of [[conspiracy theory]] out of the necessity of explaining why major institutions such as governments, media outlets, schools, scientists, and airlines all assert that the world is round. They tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves, and often distrust or disagree with each other.&lt;ref name="takes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the speakers at the 2018 UK's Flat Earth UK Convention, believers in a flat Earth vary widely in their views. While most agree upon a disc-shaped Earth, some are convinced the Earth is diamond shaped. Furthermore, while most believers do not believe in [[outer space]] and none believe mankind has ever traveled there, they vary widely in their views of the universe.&lt;ref name=Marshall2018conference&gt;{{cite web |last1=Michael |first1=Marshall|authorlink1=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |title=The universe is an egg and the moon isn't real: notes from a Flat Earth conference |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/may/02/the-universe-is-an-egg-and-the-moon-isnt-real-notes-from-a-flat-earth-conference |website=Science, Notes &amp; Theories |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2018, [[Steven Novella]] analyzed the modern belief in a flat Earth, and concluded that, despite what most people think about the subject, the believers are being sincere in their belief that the Earth is flat, and are not  "just saying that to wind us up". He stated that:
{{Quote|text= In the end that is the core malfunction of the flat-earthers, and the modern populist rejection of expertise in general. It is a horrifically simplistic view of the world that ignores (partly out of ignorance, and partly out of [[motivated reasoning]]) to real complexities of our civilization. It is ultimately lazy, childish, and self-indulgent, resulting in a profound level of ignorance drowning in motivated reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|authorlink1=Steven Novella|title=What the Flat-Earth Movement Tells Us|url=https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/what-the-flat-earth-movement-tells-us/|website=TheNess.com|publisher=NESS|accessdate=5 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505031721/https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/what-the-flat-earth-movement-tells-us/|archivedate=5 May 2018|date=3 May 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British skeptical activist [[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] attended the UK's annual Flat Earth UK Convention between 27-29, April 2018 and noted disagreement on several views of the believers' in a Flat Earth. To Marshall, one of the most telling moments at the convention was the "Flat Earth Addiction" test that was based on a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a [[cult]], without the convention attendees realizing the possibility of themselves being in a cult.&lt;ref name=Marshall2018conference/&gt;

{{citations missing|date=November 2008}}
'''Nepheloid layer''' or '''nepheloid zone''' is a layer of water in the deep ocean basin, above the [[ocean floor]], that contains significant amounts of suspended sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Geology, 5th Edition (American Geological Institute)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from 200 to 1000 m thick. The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''nephos'', "cloud".   The particles in the layer may come from the upper ocean layers and from stripping the sediments from the ocean floor by currents. Its thickness depends on bottom current velocity and is a result of balance between gravitational settling of particles and turbulence of the current.

In a similar way, a '''surface nepheloid layer (SNL)''' may be created, due to particle flotation, while '''intermediate nepheloid layers (INL)''' may be formed at the slopes of the ocean bed due to the dynamics of [[internal wave]]s. These intermediate nepheloid layers are derived from '''bottom nehpeloid layers (BNL)''' after the layers become detached and spread along isopycnal surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pak|first=Hasong|last2=Zaneveld|first2=J. Ronald V.|last3=Kitchen|first3=J.|date=1980-11-20|title=Intermediate nepheloid layers observed off Oregon and Washington|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/JC085iC11p06697|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|language=en|volume=85|issue=C11|doi=10.1029/jc085ic11p06697|issn=2156-2202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the nepheloid layer complicates [[bathymetry]]: one has to take into account the reflections of [[lidar]] or ultrasonic pulses from the upper interface of this layer, as well as their absorption within the layer.

==Gulf of Mexico==
A prominent nepheloid layer exists in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] extending from the delta of the [[Brazos River]] to [[South Padre Island]]. The layer of [[turbid]] water can begin as shallow as 20 meters and is caused mostly by clay run-off from multiple rivers. The silty bottom of the gulf also contributes to the high turbidity. Due to the blockage of light by this nepheloid layer, [[algae]] and [[coral]] are sparse, resulting in an animal-dominated community. This community is largely composed of [[infauna]] and consists of a [[detrital]]-based food chain. Many species of [[polychaete]] worms, [[amphipod]]s, and [[brittle star]]s inhabit the [[benthic surface]] and can also be accompanied by some secondary consumers such as [[flounders]], [[shrimp]], [[crab]]s, and [[starfish]]es.

==Porcupine Bight==
A prominent nepheloid layer exists also in the [[Porcupine Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;Dickson RR, McCave IN (1986) ''Nepheloid layers on the continental slope west of Porcupine Bank''. Deep Sea Res 33:791–818&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nnewi''' is the second largest city in [[Anambra State]] in southeastern [[Nigeria]]. Nnewi as a [[metropolitan city]] encompasses 2 [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|local government areas]], [[Nnewi North]], [[Nnewi South]]; Nnewi North is commonly referred to as Nnewi central, and comprises four autonomous quarters: [[Otolo]], [[Uruagu]], [[Umudim]], and [[Nnewichi]]. Nnewi North also includes '''Ichi''', an autonomous neighbouring town.

{{As of|2006}}, Nnewi has an estimated population of 391,227 according to the Nigerian census. The city spans over {{convert|1076.9|sqmi|sqkm}} in Anambra State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacuk.org/factfile.htm Nnewi Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt; Nnewi Metropolitan Area and its satellite towns is home to nearly 2.5&amp;nbsp;million residents {{as of|2005}}. Dimensionally, Nnewi has an edge over all other units, being recognized by the 1953 census figures as the largest inland town of all others in the Eastern states of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Vide the Nigerian census figures of 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In Nnewi [[oral history]] and [[mythology]], the 'ewi' ({{Lang-ig|bush rat}}) played a great role in saving the founders of Nnewi during [[war]]s. Throughout its history, Nnewi has used its military might to maintain its borders and because of this, the killing or eating of ewi in Nnewi is forbidden to the present day. Nnewi existed as an independent kingdom from the 15th century to 1904, when [[British Empire|British colonial administration]] occupied the kingdom.

Nnewi kingdom was founded on four quarters (large villages), namely [[Otolo]], [[Uruagu]], [[Umudim]], and [[Nnewichi]]. Each village was divided into family units called 'umunna'. Each umunna had a first family known as the 'obi'.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Nnewi:"&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction to Nnewi: | work = Nnewi Union Atlanta | url = http://www.nnewiunionatlanta.8m.com/index.html | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four quarters were these original names of the Sons of Edo: Otolo being the eldest and Nnewichi being the youngest of the sons [[Obi of Nnewi]]

===The Place of Nnewi in Igbo History===

Originally when the Igbos or Ibos settled in the present day Eastern Nigeria, they arrived with three leaders, two were spiritual leaders and the youngest of the three a hereditary King known as [[King|Obi]] a King by birthright. The first was the [[Priest King|Eze Nri]] of Awka a Priest King, the second the [[Priest King|Eze Aro]] of Arochukwu a  King and the third the [[Obi of Nnewi]] a political and war ruler. The Obi of Onitsha was well qualified to become an Obi being disputably the first among the two sons of the Oba of Benin. The Onitsha people are visitors and later settlers in Igbo land. [[Arochukwu|The Aros]] know this history (Nnewi being a relation and a leader among the Igbos) and this is part of the reason why there are no [[Arochukwu|Aro]] settlements in Nnewi. [[The Obi of Nnewi Obi Okoli]] in1780s lost his throne when inside palace politics that hinged on tradition edged him out. Traditional royal law had it that the Crown Prince must perform the funeral rights of the late Obi before he can be crowned, Obi Okoli was absent and arrived home only after the late Obi Okoli 1st was buried. His Uncle (The late Obi Okoli the 1st younger brother) performed the funeral rights in his stead and took over as [[Igwe of Nnewi kingdom|Igwe Nnewi]] he could not be enthroned as an Obi (which means the first son). The Obi Okoli royal lineage  was forced into exile, they got refuge at Umune-Alam in Umudim, Nnewi where they still are to this day. The Obi Okoli family still bears the [[Ofor A Spiritual Political symbol of power|Ofor]] Nnewi till this day.

Edo is the [[Supreme Being|supreme deity]] of all the [[Alusi]] (Igbo: ''deity'') in the Anaedo country. The central shrine of this unifying Alusi is at Nkwo Nnewi, the central Market. There are four other deities in Nnewi: Ana, Ezemewi, Eze and Ele. [[Christianity]] was introduced by the Europeans in 1885 and many Nnewi people now practice Christianity.

Nnewi, Ichi and Oraifite made up the Anaedo state. Anaedo communities have common ancestries, beliefs and traditional value systems. Nnewi is a major trading and manufacturing center in Nigeria. Due to its high commercial activities, the city has attracted millions of migrants from other [[States of Nigeria|states]] and countries.

The [[Ofala Festival|Ofala Nnewi]] is a cultural festival held every year to celebrate the coronation of the Igwe of Nnewi. [[Nnewi Afiaolu Festival|Afiaolu]] ([[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|New yam festival]]) and Ikwuaru are also among traditional festivals held annually in Nnewi.
Nnewi Kingdom is also known as ''Anaedo'' meaning the Land of Gold (The supreme deity and [[goddess]] of Nnewi).

==Geography==
Geographically, Nnewi falls within the [[tropical rain forest]] region of [[Nigeria]]. Though it suffers from soil leaching and [[erosion]] which has reduced the soil in some areas to a porous sandy terrain, it remains an area of rich agricultural produce and the epicenter of business trade. The city is located east of the [[Niger River]], and about 22 kilometers south east of [[Onitsha]] in [[Anambra State]], [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="bioline.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Case Study of Some Locations of Anambra State, Southeastern Nigeria | work = A Case Study of Some Locations of Anambra State, Southeastern Nigeria | url = http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ja06048 erosion  | accessdate = 2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

The traditional monarch of Nnewi is called the [[Igwe of Nnewi kingdom|Igwe]]. The Igweship in Nnewi kingdom predates the arrival of Europeans, making it a unique [[monarchy]] in [[Igbo people|Igbo]] land. The Igbos are known for not having kings, hence the popular Igbo saying ''Igbo é nwě Eze'', meaning 'the Igbos have no king'. In other Igbo clans, the British colonial administrators created warrant chiefs who then assumed the office and title of Igwe and are elected to this day.
In Nnewi, the Igwe is the isi obi (head of the [[Obi (ruler)|Obis]]) and hence the Igwe, which literally translates as the heavenly one or highness as he is the holder of the [[Ofo in Igboland|Ofo]], the religious and political symbol. He is born and not made or elected, and the institution of inheritance is the traditional right and privilege.
The position is neither transferable nor negotiable. He is also an Obi. Obi is the title held by ruling [[Tribal chief|chief]]s; it is the equivalent of a [[duke]] in the [[nobility]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Igwe nnewi.jpg|thumb|The 20th Obi of [[Otolo]] and Igwe ([[King]]) of Nnewi Kingdom, His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III]]
The present reigning monarch is [[His Royal Highness Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu III]]; he is the longest serving monarch in Nigeria&lt;ref name="Igwe of Nnewi"&gt;{{cite web |title = Nnewi Monarch|work = The Official Nnewi City Portal|url = http://www.nnewi.info/nnewi-monarch|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is currently the 20th monarch in the Nnofo Royal lineage. Igwe Kenneth Orizu III is the first class chief in [[Anambra state]] from Nnewi as well as the vice Chairman of the [[Anambra State]] House of Chiefs. [[File:IgweAndObis.jpg|thumb|The traditional rulers of Nnewi]]

There are Obis in the four clans that make up Nnewi. The highest and the most senior obi is the Obi of Otolo, who is also the [[Igwe of Nnewi kingdom|Igwe of Nnewi]]. Chief Nnamdi Obi, Obi Bennett Okafor and Obi George Onyekaba are the current obis of Uruagu, Umudim, and Nnewichi, respectively. These three obis with Igwe Orizu, III as chairman constitute the Igwe-in-Council and they deliberate on the spiritual, traditional, and communal matters, in Nnewi.

There is also an active town union called the [[Nzuko-Ora Nnewi]]. It is a forum through which adult Nnewi indigenes (18 years or older) can contribute to the development of Nnewi. This union was set up to encourage and promote the establishment of structures and facilities that will promote and improve the quality of life of the residents of Nnewi.

===Legal system===
The ancient [[legal system]] of Nnewi was not based upon a written [[law]]. It was purely a [[natural law]], involving custom, tradition, and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal]] cases. The legal process in Nnewi passed through the labyrinth of extended family system. A report against an offender or a [[criminal]] in the first instance, had to be made to the head of his family at his ancestral home known as obi. The head of the family would invite elders and minor obis from his extended family unit to sit in judgment, while the complainant would also invite the elders and minor obis from his extended family side, if both of them were not from the same family. This obi would serve as the court of the first instance, depending, of course, on the nature of the offense or crime allegedly committed. The trial might end here, if both the complainant and the accused were satisfied with the judgment given, or they might take the case to the next senior obi of the same extended' family, in ascending order, until, probably, the matter got to the highest obi in the lineage. If the complainant was not satisfied at this point, he would appeal to the obi of the quarter and the leaders of his family could be summoned to defend their judgment.&lt;ref name="Nnewi.info"&gt;{{cite web |title = Ancient Legal System|work = Ancient Legal System in Nnewi|url = http://www.nnewi.info/nnewi-ancient-legal-system|accessdate = 2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this legal procedure, guilt or innocence could easily be established, as the decision was based purely on natural justice. Punishments for offenses and criminal acts were given in relation to their gravity. A man who was found guilty of a serious crime might have no option than to be sold into slavery or expelled from the community for life. He would not be killed because the killing of human beings was against the injunction of Edo Goddess.
The [[judicial system]] in Nnewi seems to have recognized three classes of cases, the minor offenses, the true criminal case, and the civil suits of debt, bride price and land. The breaking of by-laws was really an offence against some particular juju and as such was to be expiated by a sacrifice. It was, for example, forbidden to kill an "eke" [[snake]], a type of python, or to eat "ewi," rodent of rabbit family. It is probable these laws were never broken willingly and if broken by accident, the offender would automatically perform a sacrifice without any form of judicial trial being held.
The criminal code, with regard to serious crimes, appears to have been more developed in Nnewi than elsewhere in Igboland. There were seven main classes of offences, which were known as "ori-obi," offenses against the obi, as their investigation was always carried out in the obi of the quarter.

===Politics===
Nnewi has contributed its fair share of key players in Nigerian politics. A. A. [[Nwafor Orizu]]; president of the Nigerian Senate in the First Republic and later, the Acting President before the first coup d’etat of 1966, M.C.K.

Nnewi is also the ancestral home of prominent Nigerians including the esteemed individuals listed below. See (People).

==Economy==

Agbo Edo, a [[forest]] land which belonged to Edo Nnewi deity, was cleared to make way for a new market called Nkwo Nnewi market. The development of this market propelled the fast development of the local economy.

As a fast developing city and a major industrial and commercial hub in [[Africa]], Nnewi experiences voluminous financial activities, therefore hosts major [[bank]]s, and other financial institutions. Industries are dotted around the city and adjoining towns. [[Palm oil]], [[cosmetics]], [[Engine|motor]], and motorcycle spare parts, books, and stationery, textiles, electric cables, and so on are produced in commercial quantity in the area.

===Agriculture and forestry===
The main occupation of Nnewi people is trading and farming, therefore they depend mainly on [[agriculture]] and commerce for their daily livelihood. Most Nnewian have mbubo (home gardens) and ubi (out-station gardens) where they usually cultivate their [[farm products]]. These crops when they are harvested are usually taken to the [[Market (place)|market]] for sale. Most of the prime cash crops include oil palm, raffia palm, groundnut, melon, cotton, cocoa, rubber, maize, et cetera. Food crops such as yam, cassava, cocoyam, breadfruit, and three-leaf yam are also produced in large quantities. The location of Nnewi within the tropical rainforest gives it the ecological basis for production of a wide range of tropical agriculture crops with widespread potential for industrial convention.

===Industries===
Nnewi is home to many major indigenous manufacturing industries including Ibeto Group of Companies, Cutix and ADswitch, Uru Industries Ltd, Omata Holdings Ltd, Cento Group of Companies, Coscharis of Companies Group, [[Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing|Innoson Group of Companies]], Ebunso Nig. Ltd, John White Industries, Ejiamatu Group of Companies, Chicason Group, Louis Carter Group, etc.
The great majority of [[industrialists]] in the cluster of spare parts factories in Nnewi are also traders, and most of these traders are producing one or more of the products they specialize in marketing as traders (usually motor vehicle parts), and most began by distributing their products through their preexisting distribution networks. Nnewi is part of eastern Nigeria's industrial axis. The town has through culturally grounded institutions that act as sophisticated networks expanded to include an international dimension through trading relations with exporters from Asia. Over the last decade, the town of Nnewi has experienced relatively rapid industrialization. In excess of 20 medium-to-large-scale industries have been established across a variety of sectors. Since 1970, Nnewi residents have controlled approximately 80 to 90 percent of the motor-parts trade in Nigeria. [[Nkwo Nnewi]] Market is the major import and wholesale point for motor spare parts in Nigeria. The industrialists of Nnewi are adapting foreign technology to local needs, providing employment to thousands, and making available goods and services which are relevant actual needs of the Nigerian citizens. The first indigenous car manufacturing plant is located in the city, while the first wholly Made-in-Nigeria motorcycle was manufactured in Nnewi by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI).

====Auto parts====

Nnewi is known for the vibrant auto industry in the city, the first [[Igbo people|Igbo]] man to own and drive a car was SIR LOUIS OJUKWU, the father of Dim CHUKWUEMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU in 1912.
By 1940, Nnewi residents were at the center of an international trading network that dominated the supply of motor spare parts in Nigeria. The town subsequently became a center for commerce and industry, and has one of the largest automotive parts markets in Africa. Nnewi Township is an authentic "manufacturing miracle." Small and medium-sized industries have set up in the town and are producing not only for the Nigeria markets but&amp;nbsp;– albeit still to a limited extent&amp;nbsp;– for markets abroad.

Industrialization of the town began around 1970 when Nnewi motor parts traders began marketing their own brand name products instead of the reproductions of "original" parts. There are a several auto and motorcycle spare parts dealers in Nnewi; the Nnewi Motorcycle spare parts market is well known throughout [[West Africa]]. There is also new auto plant, the first of its kind in Nigeria, owned by an Nnewi businessman, Innocent Chukwuma, Ono and a Chinese auto Company.&lt;ref name="Nnewi Auto Fair Opens "&gt;{{cite web | title = Nnewi Auto Fair Opens | work by = | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200911300471.html | accessdate = 2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival attracts all sorts of activities and celebrations which Nnewi residents hold in the highest esteem.

In the average home of any Nnewi citizen, they usually keep kola nuts, garden egg and peanut butter in their refrigerator in case any stranger or visitor should visit their home. Every visitation to their home begins with the offering of the kola nuts to the visitor. The kola nut is indicating that the visitor is very much welcomed. The ritual of the offering of kola nut is inspired with the giving in prayers and blessing or lobby to the supreme God and other deities, for the protection of the visitor and the host. It seems to be a custom to the people of Nnewi in any of their traditional ceremonies.

Other instruments include [[opi (instrument)|opi]], a wind instrument similar to the flute, igba, and ichaka.

'''Traditional marriage'''
[[File:Traditional Wedding Nnewi.jpg|thumb|upright|Igbo traditional marriage]]

There are three types of [[marriages]] in Nnewi as also practiced across the [[Nigerian]] society: the traditional marriage held in the house of the woman; the official [[wedding]], held in a registry office and which allows only one wife; and the religious marriage.

The official marriage ceremony is called "Igbankwu", which is the Igbo word for the traditional marriage ceremony. Nnewi do not have an "engagement" ceremony. Rather, the Igbankwu is preceded by a series of events during which the potential bride's and groom's families engage each other to discuss the terms of the [[marriage]]. Perhaps this can be characterized as an engagement.. Please note that [[Nigeria]] has 250 ethnic groups and each varies on [[marriage]] traditions. Further, within groups there can be even greater differentiation.

===Cultural attire===
[[File:Women Attire Nnewi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Igbo people|Igbo]] women attire]]

The [[traditional]] attire for the men is an overflowing jumper or a long-sleeved shirt worn over the gooji wrapper, which is tied around the waist, curving down to the ankles. This dress is matched with a cap and a walking stick, which aids as an instrument of support and defense. The traditional wear for the women is a blouse, worn over a loin cloth. This female attire goes with a head-tie ear rings and necklaces or traditional necklaces.&lt;ref name="everyculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Mauritania-to-Nigeria/Igbo.html |title=Traditional Igbo Attire |publisher=everyculture.com|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Yam Festival===
{{See also|New Yam Festival of the Igbo}}
In Nnewi, the occasion of Iri-ji ohuu (new-yam eating) is a cultural festival because of its significance. Nnewi people celebrate their [[new yam festival]] usually at the end of August during which assortment of festivities mark the eating of new yam. These festivities normally include a lot of variety entertainment including performance of ceremonial rites by the Igwe (King), cultural dances by Igbo men, women and their children as well as a display of Igbo cultural activities in the form of contemporary shows, masquerade dance, and feasting at a grand scale on a wide variety of food making up the menu of the Igbos.

The first day of the festival the Igwe of Nnewi will officiate the Harvest thanksgiving ceremony at his palace where the yams are offered to gods and ancestors first before distributing them to the villagers. After the prayer of thanksgiving to god, The Igwe eats the first yam because it is believed that his position gives him the privilege of being intermediaries between Nnewi communities and the gods of the land. The rituals involved in the new yam eating are meant to express the community's appreciation to the gods for making the harvest of their yams possible. This therefore explains the three aspect of Igbo worldview, that they are pragmatic, religious and appreciative.
This ceremony has been celebrated for centuries and as has always presented the right conditions for all and sundry, family and friends to come together to demonstrate their commitment and solidarity to their local community. Due to this fact, the Igbos every where in the world do celebrate this event in a highly captivating manner in order to protect and celebrate the enriched cultural heritage of her people.

==Religion==
Religion occupies a central place in the heart of Nnewi people. This counts for the huge churches and religious practices in the city. The people of Nnewi are 96% [[Christian]], with small fractions of other faiths: 2% traditionalist, 0.2% [[Jews]], 0.3% [[Muslims]]  and 1.5% others.
Among the Christian community, the [[catholic]] and [[Anglican Communion]] shares a greater number of followers followed by other Pentecostal Christian groups.
[[Christianity]] first came on the Southeastern part of Nigeria with the arrival of the Holy Ghost missionaries from Gabon to Onitsha under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Lutz late on Saturday December 5, 1885. Fr. Joseph Shanahan (The Apostle of Igboland) joined them in 1902 and when the mantle of leadership fell on him in 1905, history was set to record the evangelization of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nnewi]]. The stream of this evangelization was to flow through two main courses almost concurrently: one having Nnewi as its source and the other Ozubulu/Ihiala.

Though individuals from various communities have come in contact with the faith as they traveled to Onitsha and other places for trade and in quest of western education, the actual planting of the seed of the gospel in Nnewi Diocese from the Catholic perspective sprang from the treks of Fr. Victor Duhaze to Ozubulu through Oguta (1906) and to Nnewi through Umuoji, Ojoto Mili Agu down to Odida Nnewichi in 1906.

However, the [[Anglican]] Church was established in Nnewi from [[Obosi]] in 1893. But the seed of what is today Nnewi Diocese was sown in 1809. Requests were made by Odida. Community in Nnewichi inviting Fr. [[J. Shanahan]]. In the same year, some Ozubulu indigenes had registered the same requests for establishing a Church station at Ozubulu. Nnewi people are proud of there traditional [[Odinani]] as well as the new religion of Christianity.
@(Note:The Church Missionary Society CMS under the leadership of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and Reverend Henry Townsend arrived Onitsha on July 27, 1857)

'''{{IAST|Nyāya}}''' ([[Sanskrit]]: न्याय, ''nyā-yá''), literally means "rules", "method" or "judgment".&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyabri&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/423058/Nyaya Nyaya: Indian Philosophy] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of one of the six orthodox (''[[astika]]'') schools of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=nyabri/&gt; This school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy was systematic development of the theory of [[logic]], methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;B Gupta (2012), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge and Freedom, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 171-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya school's [[epistemology]] accepts four out of six ''[[Pramana]]s'' as reliable means of gaining knowledge – ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''Anumāṇa'' (inference), ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy) and ''Śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; In its [[metaphysics]], Nyaya school is closer to [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism than others.&lt;ref name=nyabri/&gt; It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance).&lt;ref&gt;Vassilis Vitsaxis (2009), Thought and Faith, Somerset Hall Press, {{ISBN|978-1935244042}}, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Nyaya to concern itself with epistemology, that is the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyyayikas, it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding true nature of soul, self and reality.&lt;ref&gt;BK Matilal (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807174}}, pages 353-357&lt;/ref&gt;

Naiyyayika scholars approached philosophy as a form of direct [[Philosophical realism|realism]], stating that anything that really exists is in principle humanly knowable. To them, correct knowledge and understanding is different than simple, reflexive cognition; it requires ''[[Anuvyavasaya]]'' (अनुव्यवसाय, cross-examination of cognition, reflective cognition of what one thinks one knows).&lt;ref name=olil/&gt; An influential collection of texts on logic and reason is the [[Nyaya Sutras|Nyayasutras]], attributed to [[Aksapada Gautama]], variously estimated to have been composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bkmxiv&gt;B.

Nyaya school shares some of its methodology and human suffering foundations with [[Buddhism]]; however, a key difference between the two is that Buddhism believes that there is neither a soul nor self;&lt;ref&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards;&lt;br /&gt;Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; Quote: "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";&lt;br /&gt;Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}}, pages 2-4&lt;br /&gt;Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now;&lt;br /&gt;John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt; Nyaya school like other schools of Hinduism believes that there is a soul and self, with liberation (moksha) as a state of removal of ignorance, wrong knowledge, the gain of correct knowledge and unimpeded continuation of self.&lt;ref name=bkm&gt;[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|BK Matilal]] (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807174}}, pages 354-355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ambeul (1998), Ontology in Indian Philosophy, in Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Editor: Edward Craig), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415073103}}, pages 118-127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Nyaya'' (न्याय) is a Sanskrit word which means method, rule, specially a collection of general or universal rules.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; In some contexts, it means model, axiom, plan, legal proceeding, judicial sentence, or judgment. In the theory of logic, and Indian texts discussing it, the term also refers to an argument consisting of an [[enthymeme]] or sometimes for any [[syllogism]].&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html nyAya] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophical context, ''Nyaya'' encompasses propriety, logic and method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|XtUhAQAAMAAJ|The Spectator}}, ''Hindu Philosophy'', Volume 32, page 1260&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nyaya'' is related to several other concepts and words used in Indian philosophies: ''Hetu-vidya'' (science of causes), ''[[Anviksiki]]'' (science of inquiry, systematic philosophy), ''Pramana-sastra'' (epistemology, science of correct knowledge), ''Tattva-sastra'' (science of categories), ''Tarka-vidya'' (science of reasoning, innovation, synthesis), ''Vadartha'' (science of discussion) and ''Phakkika-sastra'' (science of uncovering sophism, fraud, error, finding fakes).&lt;ref&gt;N Sinha (1990), The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807488}}, see Introduction, pages i-ii&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these subsume or deploy the tools of ''Nyaya''.

The historical development of Nyaya school is unclear, although ''[[Nasadiya sukta|Nasadiya]]'' hymns of Book 10 Chapter 129 of [[Rigveda]] recite its spiritual questions in logical propositions.&lt;ref name="Christian2011"/&gt; In early centuries BCE, states [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Clooney]], the early Nyaya scholars began compiling the science of rational, coherent inquiry and pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt; By 2nd century CE, Aksapada Gautama had composed ''Nyayasutras'', a foundational text for Nyaya school, that primarily discusses logic, methodology and epistemology.&lt;ref name=bkmxiv/&gt; The Nyaya scholars that followed refined it, expanded it, and applied it to spiritual questions. While the early Nyaya scholars published little to no analysis on whether supernatural power or God exists, they did apply their insights into reason and reliable means to knowledge to the questions of nature of existence, spirituality, happiness and [[moksha]]. Later Nyaya scholars, such as Udayana, examined various arguments on theism and attempted to prove existence of God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt; Other Nyaya scholars offered arguments to disprove the existence of God.&lt;ref name=fxc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Jha (1919), Original atheism of the Nyaya, in Indian Thought - Proceedings and Transactions of the First Oriental Congress, Vol ii, pages 281-285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1979), Indian Philosophy Since Independence, Volume 1, BR Grüner Netherlands, {{ISBN|978-9060321133}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to Hindu thought has been its treatises on [[epistemology]] and [[system of logic]] that, subsequently, has been adopted by the majority of the other Indian schools.&lt;ref name=olil&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Nyaya, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 405-407&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixteen ''Padārthas or Categories''==
The Nyaya metaphysics recognizes sixteen ''padartha''s or categories and includes all six (or seven) categories of the [[Vaisheshika]] in the second one of them, called ''prameya''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; These sixteen categories are ''pramāṇa'' (valid means of knowledge), ''prameya'' (objects of valid knowledge), ''saṁśaya'' (doubt), ''prayojana'' (aim), ''dṛṣṭānta'' (example), ''siddhānta'' (conclusion), ''avayava'' (members of syllogism), ''tarka'' (hypothetical reasoning), ''nirṇaya'' (settlement), ''vāda'' (discussion), ''jalpa'' (wrangling), ''vitaṇḍā'' (cavilling), ''hetvābhāsa'' (fallacy), ''chala'' (quibbling), ''jāti'' (sophisticated refutation) and ''nigrahasthāna'' (point of defeat).&lt;ref&gt;Hiriyanna, M. (1993, reprint 2000). ''Outlines of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-1099-6}}, pp.245,245n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ch&gt;Chattopadhyaya, D. (1986), ''Indian Philosophy: A Popular Introduction'', People's Publishing House, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-7007-023-6}}, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}
[[File:4 Pramanas, epistemology according to ancient Nyayasutras.svg|thumb|The Nyaya school considers perception, inference, comparison/analogy, and testimony from reliable sources as four means to correct knowledge, holding that perception is the ultimate source of such knowledge.&lt;ref name=jag/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt;]]
The Nyaya school of Hinduism developed and refined many treatises on [[epistemology]] that widely influenced other schools of Hinduism. Nyaya treated it as theory of knowledge, and its scholars developed it as ''[[Pramana]]-sastras''. ''Pramana'', a Sanskrit word, literally is "means of knowledge". It encompasses one or more reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge.&lt;ref name=jalo&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Pramana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 520-521&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of Pramana is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref name="dpsb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kp&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naiyayikas (the Nyaya scholars) accepted four valid means (''pramaṇa'') of obtaining valid knowledge (''pramana'') - perception (''pratyakṣa''), inference (''anumāna''), comparison (''[[upamāna]]'') and word/testimony of reliable sources (''śabda''). The Nyaya scholars, along with those from other schools of Hinduism, also developed a theory of error, to methodically establish means to identify errors and the process by which errors are made in human pursuit of knowledge. These include ''Saṁśaya'' (समस्या, problems, inconsistencies, doubts) and ''[[Viparyaya]]'' (विपर्यय, contrariness, errors)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073842}}, page 422&lt;/ref&gt; which can be corrected or resolved by a systematic process of ''Tarka'' ( तर्क, reasoning, technique).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), Logical Theory &amp; Gangesa &amp; Other chapters, in The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073842}}, page 69-81, 178-201, 462-466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larson and Ram Bhattacharya, The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (Editor:Karl Potter), Volume 4, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073019}}, pages 361-362&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pratyaksha aka Perception===
''Pratyakṣa'' (perception) occupies the foremost position in the Nyaya epistemology. Perception can be of two types, ''laukika'' (ordinary) and ''alaukika'' (extraordinary).&lt;ref name=tror&gt;Troy Organ, Philosophy and the Self: East and West, Associated University Presse, {{ISBN|978-0941664806}}, pages 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary perception is defined by Akṣapāda Gautama in his ''Nyaya Sutra'' (I,i.4) as a 'non-erroneous cognition which is produced by the intercourse of sense-organs with the objects'.

Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary perception to Nyaya scholars was based on direct experience of reality by eyes, ears, nose, touch and taste.&lt;ref name=tror/&gt; Extraordinary perception included ''yogaja'' or ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref name=tror/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

====Determinate and indeterminate perception====
The Naiyyayika maintains two modes or stages in perception. The first is called ''[[nirvikalpa]]'' (indeterminate), when one just perceives an object without being able to know its features, and the second ''[[savikalpa]]'' (determinate), when one is able to clearly know an object.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt; All laukika and alaukika pratyakshas are ''savikalpa'', but it is necessarily preceded by an earlier stage when it is indeterminate. Vātsāyana says that if an object is perceived with its name we have determinate perception but if it is perceived without a name, we have indeterminate perception. [[Jayanta Bhatta]] says that indeterminate perception apprehends substance, qualities and actions and universals as separate and indistinct something and also it does not have any association with name, while determinate perception aprrehends all these together with a name. There is yet another stage called ''Pratyabhijñā'', when one is able to re-recognise something on the basis of memory.&lt;ref name=c&gt;C Sharma, A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pages192-196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anumāna aka Inference===
''Anumāna'' (inference) is one of the most important contributions of the Nyaya. It can be of two types: inference for oneself (''Svarthanumana'', where one does not need any formal procedure, and at the most the last three of their 5 steps), and inference for others (''Parathanumana'', which requires a systematic methodology of 5 steps). Inference can also be classified into 3 types: ''Purvavat'' (inferring an unperceived effect from a perceived cause), ''Sheshavat'' (inferring an unperceived cause from a perceived effect) and ''Samanyatodrishta'' (when inference is not based on causation but on uniformity of co-existence). A detailed analysis of error is also given, explaining when anumana could be false.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

====Theory of inference====
The methodology of inference involves a combination of induction and deduction by moving from particular to particular via generality. It has five steps, as in the example shown:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* There is fire on the hill (called ''Pratijñā'', required to be proved)
* Because there is smoke there (called ''Hetu'', reason)
* Wherever there is smoke, there is fire, e.g. in a kitchen (called ''Udāhārana'', example of vyāpti)
* The hill has smoke that is pervaded by fire (called ''Upanaya'', reaffirmation or application)
* Therefore, there is fire on the hill (called ''Nigamana'', conclusion)

In Nyāya terminology for this example, the hill would be called as ''paksha'' (minor term), the fire is called as ''sādhya'' (major term), the smoke is called as ''hetu'', and the relationship between the smoke and the fire is called as ''[[vyapti]]'' (middle term). Hetu further has five characteristics: (1) It must be present in the Paksha, (2) It must be present in all positive instances, (3) It must be absent in all negative instances, (4) It must not incompatible with the minor term or Paksha and (5) All other contradictions by other means of knowledge should be absent. The fallacies in Anumana (''hetvābhasa'') may occur due to the following:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

#''Asiddha'': It is the unproved hetu that results in this fallacy. [Paksadharmata]
#*''Ashrayasiddha'': If Paksha [minor term] itself is unreal, then there cannot be locus of the hetu. e.g. The sky-lotus is fragrant, because it is a lotus like any other lotus.
#*''Svarupasiddha'': Hetu cannot exist in paksa at all. E.g. Sound is a quality, because it is visible.
#*''Vyapyatvasiddha'': Conditional hetu. `Wherever there is fire, there is smoke'. The presence of smoke is due to wet fuel.
#''Savyabhichara'': This is the fallacy of irregular hetu.
#*''Sadharana'': The hetu is too wide. It is present in both sapaksa and vipaksa. `The hill has fire because it is knowable'.
#*''Asadharana'': The hetu is too narrow. It is only present in the Paksha, it is not present in the Sapaksa and in the Vipaksha. `Sound is eternal because it is audible'.
#*''Anupasamhari'': Here the hetu is non-exclusive. The hetu is all-inclusive and leaves nothing by way of sapaksha or vipaksha. e.g. 'All things are non-ternal, because they are knowable'.
#''Satpratipaksa'': Here the hetu is contradicted by another hetu. If both have equal force, then nothing follows. 'Sound is eternal, because it is audible', and 'Sound is non-eternal, because it is produced'. Here 'audible' is counterbalanced by 'produced' and both are of equal force.
#''Badhita'': When another proof (as by perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term (hetu). 'Fire is cold because it is a substance'.
#''Viruddha'': Instead of proving something it is proving the opposite. 'Sound is eternal because it is produced'.

===Upamāna aka Comparison, Analogy===
''Upamāna'' (उपमान) means comparison and analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name="gflood"/&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamānam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''sāmānya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, explains [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier Williams]], if a boy says "her face is like the moon in charmingness", "her face" is ''upameyam'', the moon is ''upamānam'', and charmingness is ''sāmānya''. The  7th century text [[Bhaṭṭikāvya]] in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not.&lt;ref name=mw457/&gt; In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of ''Upamāna'' and their value in epistemology are debated.

===Śabda aka Word, Testimony===
''Śabda'' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;
*Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;
*John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Hiriyanna explains ''Sabda-pramana'' as a concept which means testimony of a reliable and trustworthy person (''āptavākya''). The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Testimony can be of two types, ''Vaidika'' ([[Vedas|Vedic]]), which are the words of the four sacred Vedas, and ''Laukika'', or words and writings of trustworthy human beings. ''Vaidika'' testimony is preferred over ''Laukika'' testimony.  Laukika-sourced knowledge must be questioned and revised as more trustworthy knowledge becomes available.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Comparison with other schools of Hinduism===
Each school of Hinduism has its own treatises on epistemology, with different number of ''[[Pramana]]s''. For example, compared to Nyaya school's four ''pramanas'', [[Carvaka]] school has just one (perception), while [[Advaita Vedanta]] school recognizes six means to reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name="jag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliottjag"/&gt;

==The Nyaya theory of causation==
{{Quote box |width=26em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Metaphysics'''&lt;br&gt;
Nyaya-Vaisheshika offers one of the most vigorous efforts at the construction of a substantialist, realist ontology that the world has ever seen. It provides an extended critique of event-ontologies and idealist metaphysics. (...) This ontology is Platonistic, realistic, but neither exclusively physicalistic nor phenomenalistic.
|source =— [[Karl Harrington Potter|Karl Potter]], The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A ''cause'' is defined as an unconditional and invariable antecedent of an ''effect'' and an effect as an unconditional and invariable consequent of a cause. The same cause produces the same effect; and the same effect is produced by the same cause. The cause is ''not'' present in any hidden form whatsoever in its effect.

The following conditions should be met:
# The cause must be antecedent [Purvavrtti]
# Invariability [Niyatapurvavrtti]
# Unconditionality [Ananyathasiddha]

Nyaya recognizes five kinds of accidental antecedents [Anyathasiddha]

# Mere accidental antecedent. E.g., The colour of the potter's cloth.
# Remote cause is not a cause because it is not unconditional. E.g., The father of the potter.
# The co-effects of a cause are not causally related.
# Eternal substances, or eternal conditions are not unconditional antecedents, e.g. space.
# Unnecessary things, e.g. the donkey of the potter.

Nyaya recognizes three kinds of cause:

# ''Samavayi'',  material cause, e.g. thread of a cloth.
# ''Asamavayi'', colour of the thread which gives the colour of the cloth.
# ''Nimitta'', efficient cause, e.g. the weaver of the cloth.

==Anyathakyativada of Nyaya==
The Nyaya theory of error is similar to that of Kumarila's Viparita-khyati (see [[Mimamsa]]). The Naiyyayikas also believe like Kumarila that error is due to a wrong synthesis of the presented and the represented objects. The represented object is confused with the presented one. The word 'anyatha' means 'elsewise' and 'elsewhere' and both these meanings are brought out in error. The presented object is perceived elsewise and the represented object exists elsewhere. They further maintain that knowledge is not intrinsically valid but becomes so on account of extraneous conditions (''paratah pramana'' during both validity and invalidity).

==Nyaya on God and salvation==
Early Naiyyayikas wrote very little about [[Ishvara]] (literally, the Supreme Soul). Evidence available so far suggests that early Nyaya scholars were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later, and over time, Nyaya scholars tried to apply some of their epistemological insights and methodology to the question: does God exist? Some offered arguments against and some in favor.&lt;ref name=fxc/&gt;

===Arguments that God does not exist===
In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1, verses 19-21, postulates God exists, states a consequence, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;

{{Quote|
The Lord is the cause, since we see that human action lacks results.&lt;br&gt;
This is not so since, as a matter of fact, no result is accomplished without human action.&lt;br&gt;
Since this is efficacious, the reason lacks force.
|Nyaya Sutra|IV.1.19 - IV.1.21 &lt;ref name=fxc2&gt;Original Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/details/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series Nyayasutra] Anand Ashram Sanskrit Granthvali, pages 290-292;&lt;br&gt;English translation: Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A literal interpretation of the three verses suggests that Nyaya school rejected the need for a God for the efficacy of human activity. Since human action and results do not require assumption or need of the existence of God, sutra IV.1.21 is seen as a criticism of the "existence of God and theism postulate".&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt; The context of the above verses includes various efficient causes. Nyayasutra verses IV.1.22 to IV.1.24, for example, examine the hypothesis that "random chance" explains the world, after these Indian scholars had rejected God as the efficient cause.&lt;ref name=fxc/&gt;

===Arguments that God exists===
[[Udayana]]'s ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'' gave the following nine arguments to prove the existence of creative God:&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp.209-10&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kāryāt'' (lit. "from effect"): The world is an effect, all effects have efficient cause, hence the world must have an efficient cause. That efficient cause is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Āyojanāt'' (lit., from combination): Atoms are inactive. To form a substance, they must combine. To combine, they must move. Nothing moves without intelligence and source of motion. Since we perceive substance, some intelligent source must have moved the inactive atoms. That intelligent source is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Dhŗtyādéḥ'' (lit., from support): Something sustains this world. Something destroys this world. Unintelligent ''Adrsta'' (unseen principles of nature) cannot do this. We must infer that something intelligent is behind. That is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Padāt'' (lit., from word): Each word has meaning and represents an object. This representational power of words has a cause. That cause is God.
*''Pratyayataḥ'' (lit, from faith): Vedas are infallible. Human beings are fallible. Infallible Vedas cannot have been authored by fallible human beings. Someone authored the infallible Vedas. That author is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Shrutéḥ'' (lit., from scriptures): The infallible Vedas testify to the existence of God. Thus God exists.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Vākyāt'' (lit., from precepts): Vedas deal with moral laws, the rights and the wrongs. These are divine. Divine injunctions and prohibitions can only come from a divine creator of laws. That divine creator is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Samkhyāviśeşāt'' (lit., from the specialty of numbers): By rules of perception, only number "one" can ever be directly perceived. All other numbers other than one, are inferences and concepts created by consciousness. When man is born, his mind is incapable of inferences and concepts. He develops consciousness as he develops. The consciousness development is self-evident and proven because of man's ability with perfect numerical conception. This ability to conceive numerically perfect concepts must depend on something. That something is divine consciousness. So God must exist.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Adŗşţāt'' (lit., from the unforeseen): Everybody reaps the fruits of his own actions. Merits and demerits accrue from his own actions. An Unseen Power keeps a balance sheet of the merit and demerit. But since this Unseen Power is Unintelligent, it needs intelligent guidance to work. That intelligent guide is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;

===Liberation===
The Naiyyayikas believe that the bondage of the world is due to false knowledge, which can be removed by constantly thinking of its opposite (''pratipakshabhavana''), namely, the true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975). ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Vol. I, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0412-8}}, p.365&lt;/ref&gt; So the opening aphorism of the ''{{IAST |Nyāya Sūtra}}'' states that only the true knowledge lead to ''niḥśreyasa'' (liberation).&lt;ref name=ch/&gt; But the Nyaya school also maintains that the God's grace is essential for obtaining true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jayanta Bhatta|Jayanta]], in his ''Nyayamanjari'' describes salvation as a passive stage of self in its natural purity, unassociated with pleasure, pain, knowledge and willingness.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975). ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Vol. I, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0412-8}}, p.366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature of Nyaya==
The earliest text of the Nyāya School is the ''{{IAST |Nyāya Sūtra}}'' of [[Akṣapāda Gautama|{{IAST |Akṣapāda Gautama}}]]. The text is divided into five books, each having two sections. [[Vātsāyana|{{IAST |Vātsāyana}}]]'s ''{{IAST |Nyāya Bhāṣya}}'' is a classic commentary on the ''{{IAST |Nyāya Sūtra}}''. [[Udyotakara]]'s ''{{IAST |Nyāya Vārttika}}'' (6th century CE) is written to defend {{IAST |Vātsāyana}} against the attacks made by  {{IAST |Dignāga}}. [[Vacaspati Misra|{{IAST |Vācaspati Miśra}}]]'s  ''{{IAST |Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā}}'' (9th century CE) is the next major exposition of this school. Two other texts, ''{{IAST |Nyāyaṣūcinibandha}}'' and ''{{IAST |Nyāyasūtraddhāra}}'' are also attributed to him. [[Udayana]]'s (984 CE) ''{{IAST |Nyāyatātparyapariśuddhi}}'' is an important commentary on {{IAST |Vācaspati}}'s treatise. His ''{{IAST |Nyāyakusumāñjali}}'' is the first systematic account of theistic ''{{IAST |Nyāya}}''. His other works include ''{{IAST |Ātmatattvaviveka}}'', ''{{IAST |Kiraṇāvali}}'' and ''{{IAST |Nyāyapariśiṣṭa}}''. [[Jayanta Bhatta]]'s ''{{IAST |Nyāyamañjari}}'' (10th century CE) is basically an independent work. {{IAST |Bhāsavarajña}}'s  ''{{IAST |Nyāyasāra}}'' (10th century CE) is a survey of ''{{IAST |Nyāya}}'' philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, pp.36-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The later works on ''{{IAST |Nyāya}}'' accepted the ''{{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}}'' categories and {{IAST |Varadarāja}}'s ''{{IAST |Tārkikarakṣā}}'' (12th century CE) is a notable treatise of this syncretist school. {{IAST |Keśava Miśra}}'s ''{{IAST |Tārkabhaṣā}}'' (13th century CE) is another important work of this school.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST |Gangeśa Upādhyāya}}'s ''{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇi}}'' (12th century CE) is the first major treatise of the new school of ''{{IAST |[[Navya-Nyāya]]}}''. His son, {{IAST |Vardhamāna Upādhyāya}}'s ''{{IAST |Nyāyanibandhaprakāśa}}''  (1225 CE), though a commentary on [[Udayana]]'s ''{{IAST |Nyāyatātparyapariśuddhi}}'', incorporated his father's views. Jayadeva wrote a commentary on ''[[Tattvacintāmaṇi|{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇi}}]]'' known as ''{{IAST |Āloka}}'' (13th century CE). {{IAST |Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma}}'s  ''{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇivyākhyā}}'' (16th century CE) is first great work of [[Nabadwip|Navadvipa]] school of  {{IAST |[[Navya-Nyāya]]}}. [[Raghunatha Siromani|{{IAST |Raghunātha Śiromaṇi}}]]'s ''{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti}}'' and ''{{IAST |Padārthakhaṇḍana}}'' are the next important works of this school. [[Visvanatha Panchanana Bhattacharya|{{IAST |Viśvanatha}}]]'s  ''{{IAST |Nyāyasūtravṛtti}}'' (17th century CE) is also a notable work.&lt;ref name="Radhakrishnan, S. 2006, p.41"&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; The Commentaries on ''{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti}}'' by Jagadish Tarkalankar (17th century CE) and Gadadhar Bhattacharya (17th century CE) are the last two notable works of this school.

[[Annambhatta|{{IAST |Annaṁbhatta}}]] (17th century CE) tried to develop a consistent system by combining the ancient and the new schools, ''{{IAST |Prācina nyāya}}'' and ''{{IAST |[[Navya-Nyāya]]}}'' and ''{{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}}'' to develop the ''{{IAST |nyāya-vaiśeṣika}}'' school. His ''{{IAST |Tarkasaṁgraha}}'' and ''{{IAST |Dīpikā}}'' are the popular manuals of this school.&lt;ref name="Radhakrishnan, S. 2006, p.41"/&gt;

[[Image:OSPAR logo.png|right|thumb|The official logo of the OSPAR Convention]]

The [http://www.ospar.org/site/assets/files/1290/ospar_convention_e_updated_text_in_2007_no_revs.pdf '''Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic'''] or '''OSPAR Convention''' is the current [[legislation|legislative]] instrument regulating international cooperation on environmental protection in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North-East Atlantic]]. It combines and up-dates the 1972 [[Oslo Convention]] on dumping waste at sea and the 1974 Paris Convention on land-based sources of marine pollution. Work carried out under the convention is managed by the '''OSPAR Commission''', which is made up of representatives of the [[Government]]s of the 15 signatory nations, and representatives of the [[European Commission]], representing the [[European Union]].

The OSPAR Convention was concluded at [[Paris]] on 22 September 1992.

[[Image:OSPAR Convention.png|thumb|right|200px|{{legend|#007f00|signatory states}}
{{legend|#00ff00|European Union}}]]

==History==
The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic was opened for signature at the [[Minister (government)|Ministerial Meeting]] of the Oslo and Paris Commissions in [[Paris]] on 22 September, 1992. The Convention has been signed and ratified by all of the Contracting Parties to the original Oslo or Paris Conventions ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the European Community, [[Finland]],{{#tag:ref|Finland is not on the western coasts of Europe, but some of its rivers flow to the [[Barents Sea]], and historically it was involved in the efforts to control the dumping of [[hazardous waste]] in the [[Atlantic]] and the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.ospar.org/content/content.asp?menu=00010100000000_000000_000000 About OSPAR]&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]) and by [[Luxembourg]]{{#tag:ref|Luxembourg and Switzerland are Contracting Parties due to their location within the catchments of the [[River Rhine]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;|name="Rhine"}} and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Rhine"/&gt; The OSPAR Convention entered into force on 25 March, 1998, and replaced the Oslo and Paris Conventions, but decisions and other agreements adopted under those conventions remained applicable unless they are terminated by new measures adopted under the OSPAR Convention. 

[[Image:OSPAR Commission area map.svg|right|250px|Map of the OSPAR area]]
The first Ministerial Meeting of the OSPAR Commission at [[Sintra]], Portugal, in 1998 adopted Annex V to the Convention, extending the cooperation of the signatory parties to cover ''"all human activities that might adversely affect the marine environment of the North East Atlantic"''. Nevertheless, programmes and measures cannot be adopted under the Convention on questions relating to fisheries management, which are currently coordinated by European nations in the north east Atlantic and [[North Sea]] by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES). The OSPAR convention now regulates European standards on [[biodiversity|marine biodiversity]], [[eutrophication]], the release of [[pollution|hazardous]] and [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] substances into the seas, the [[North Sea oil|offshore oil and gas industry]] and baseline monitoring of environmental conditions.

In 2000, the OSPAR Commission published a comprehensive report on the quality of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. This was supported by five smaller reports on the different parts of the OSPAR maritime area –the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], the Greater [[North Sea]], the Celtic Seas, the [[Bay of Biscay|Bay of Biscay/Golfe de Gascogne]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian waters]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Wider Atlantic]].

According to the [[:fr :Association pour le contrôle de la radioactivité dans l'Ouest]], if tritium and iodine 129 discharges from the [[La Hague site]] into the [[Alderney Race]] do not diminish significantly, it will be difficult to achieve the objective of zero radioelement concentrations in the North Atlantic by 2020&lt;ref&gt;(fr)  [http://www.acro.eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rad_lit13.pdf Discharges of radioactive elements] website acro.eu.org, located in [[Caen]], [[France]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]]. Two practical methods for this are [[reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) and
[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

In 1954, Pattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431|bibcode=1954Natur.174..660P}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753|bibcode=1975Sci...189..654L}}&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined.

The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;^ Israel Patent Application 42658 of July 3, 1973.

He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions (the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other) that was going to waste in this natural mixing process.&lt;ref&gt;^ Weintraub, Bob.

The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions. They are being developed into commercial use in the Netherlands (RED) and Norway (PRO). The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle. A new, lower cost membrane, based on an electrically modified [[polyethylene]] plastic, made it fit for potential commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20OSMOTIC%20ENG_tcm4-7797.pdf History of osmotic power (PDF) at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)&lt;/ref&gt; All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the "chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to "pump" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es300060m | pmid=22463483 | volume=46 | issue=9 | title=Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis | year=2012 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=5230–5239 | last1 = Yin Yip | first1 = Ngai | last2 = Elimelech | first2 = Menachem| bibcode=2012EnST...46.5230Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

===Pressure-retarded osmosis===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&amp;_user=607017&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=607017&amp;md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211414/http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf |date=2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |title=The world's first osmotic power plant from Statkraft |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024125/http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} Statkraft-osmotic-power&lt;/ref&gt; on November 24, 2009. It aims to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis. At first, it will produce a minuscule 4 kilowatts – enough to heat a large electric kettle, but by 2015 the target is 25 megawatts – the same as a small wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8377186.stm BBC News Norway's Statkraft opens first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |title=Is PRO economically feasible? Not according to Statkraft &amp;#124; ForwardOsmosisTech |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118220928/http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s&lt;ref name="Brogioli" /&gt; capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO &amp; RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity &amp; the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called "salinity gradient [[solar pond]]" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an "insulator" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&amp;nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028032447/http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |title=Energy from Water |accessdate=2017-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202195525/http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.&lt;ref name=Montague&gt;Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.

In principle, four different isomers can form. Cis-1,4-polyisoprene, which is also called isoprene rubber, is a major ingredient of [[natural rubber]]. Trans-1,4-polyisoprene is a major ingredient of [[gutta-percha]]. Annual worldwide production of polyisoprene was 13,000 kilotonne in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Koltzenburg, Michael Maskos, Oskar Nuyken, ''Polymere: Synthese, Eigenschaften und Anwendungen'', Springer, Berlin, 2012, S. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of repeating units of polyisoprene is dependent on the reaction mechanism.

Anionic chain polymerization, which is initiated by [[n-Butyllithium]], produces cis-1,4-polyisoprene dominant polyisoprene. 90–92% of repeating units are ''cis''-1,4-, 2–3% ''trans''-1,4- and 6–7% 3,4-units.&lt;ref name="CDRömpp"&gt;Jürgen Falbe, Manfred Regitz (Hrsg.): ''CD Römpp Chemie Lexikon'', Thieme, Stuttgart, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Praxithea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|æ|g|ˈ|z|ɪ|θ|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Πραξιθέα) was a name attributed to five women.

* Praxithea, a [[Naiad]] nymph. According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' Praxithea married [[Erichthonius of Athens]] and by him had a son named [[Pandion I]]. Praxithea's sister [[Zeuxippe]] married her nephew Pandion, and to them were born [[Erechtheus]], [[Butes]], Procne and [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.14.8&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3. 14. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Praxithea, daughter of [[Phrasimus]] and [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Diogeneia]], daughter of the river-god [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]]. She married [[Erechtheus]] and bore him [[Cecrops II|Cecrops]], [[Pandorus]], [[Metion]], [[Thespius]], Eupalamus, [[Sicyon]], [[Orneus]], [[Procris]], [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], [[Merope (mythological figure)|Merope]], [[Chthonia]], [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]], [[Pandora (Greek myth)|Pandora]] and [[Protogeneia]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus.

* Praxithea (or Phrasithea), daughter of [[Leos]]. Along with her sisters, Theope and Eubule, she sacrificed herself in order to save [[Athens]]. In another version, their father was the one who offered them up to sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Ap3d.html Theoi Project - Apollodorus]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:PeruvianDesert00.jpg|300px|right|thumb|An inland portion of the Peruvian desert.]] --&gt;
The '''Sechura Desert''' is located south of the [[Piura Region]] of [[Peru]] along the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast and inland to the foothills of the [[Andes Mountains]]. Its extreme aridity is caused by the upwelling of cold coastal waters and subtropical atmospheric subsidence, but it is also subject to occasional flooding during [[El Niño]] years. In 1728, the town of [[Sechura]] was destroyed by a [[tsunami]] and was later rebuilt in its present location. In 1998, runoff from flooding rivers caused the formation of a temporary lake some {{convert|90|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long filling the Bayóvar Depression. Short rivers flowing across the desert from the Andes support intensive [[irrigation]]-based agriculture.

==Location and extent==
Within Peru, the desert is described as the strip along the northern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of Peru in the southern [[Piura Region|Piura]] and western [[Lambayeque Region|Lambayeque regions]], and extending from the coast 20–100&amp;nbsp;km inland to the secondary ridges of the [[Andes Mountains]]. At its northern end near the city of [[Piura]], the Sechura Desert transitions to the [[Tumbes-Piura dry forests]] ecoregion.  Comprising much of eastern Lambayeque Region, this habitat is composed of [[dry forest|equatorial dry forests]]. The total area of the Sechura Desert is 188,735 km².

[[File:Desiertos del Perú - Deserts of Peru.jpg|thumb|Desiertos del Perú - Deserts of Peru]]

==History==
While a desert, the Sechura has been subject to flooding from rivers and to storms driven in from the Pacific Ocean.  In 1728, a [[tsunami]] generated from an [[earthquake]] swept inland, destroying the town of [[Sechura]], then located closer to the water.  Survivors moved inland and re-established the town in its current location.

During ''[[El Niño]]'' years, flooding in the desert regularly occurs.  In 1998, the runoff from the flooding rivers poured into the coastal Sechura Desert. Where there had been nothing but arid, hardscrabble waste for 15 years, suddenly, the second-largest lake in Peru had developed: 90 mi (145 km) long, 20 mi (30 km) wide, and 10 ft (3 m) deep, with occasional parched domes of sand and clay poking up from the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suplee|first1=Curt|title=El Niño/La Niña: Nature’s Vicious Cycle|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/elnino/mainpage.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=5 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810224546/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/elnino/mainpage.html|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The Peruvian Desert has a low range of temperature changes due to the moderating effect of the nearby Pacific Ocean.  Because of the upwelling of cold coastal waters and subtropical atmospheric subsidence, the desert is one of the most arid on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Ron|title=Desert Geomorphology |year=1996 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1-85728-017-2 |page=442 |edition=2nd|author2=Warren, Andrew |author3=Goudie, Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer (December through March) is warm and sunny with temperatures above {{convert|35|C|F}} during the day, and temperatures that average over {{convert|24|C|F}}. In the winter (June through September) the weather is cool and cloudy with temperatures that vary from {{convert|16|C|F}} at night to {{convert|30|C|F}} during the day.

==Geography==
The Bayóvar Depression, which is the lowest point in Peru and all of the [[Southern Tropics]], is located in this desert.

The numerous short rivers that cross the Sechura supported [[prehistoric]] [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous]] human settlements for millennia. A number of urban cultures flourished here, including the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]]. The Moche survived on a diet of fish, [[guinea pig]]s, [[Camelid|camelids]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peanut]]s. The [[Sican Culture]] (''circa'' 800–1300 [[Common Era|CE]]) succeeded the Moche, and developed refined techniques of [[lost wax]] goldsmithing. 

Today, the rivers support intensive [[irrigation|irrigated]] agriculture on the fertile [[bottomlands]]. Two of Peru's five largest cities, including [[Piura]] and [[Chiclayo]], lie within the agricultural region in the north.

Since then soil scientists have continued to study glomalin and its interactions with soil leading to a fundamental new understanding of soil building&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1144429.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This article makes no reference glomalin and is based on out of date soil science.|heading=Out of date as of 1996. This article fails to fully reflect the paradigm shifting discovery of glomalin proteins in soil.}}

==Overview==
Soil carbon is present in two forms: inorganic and organic. '''Soil inorganic carbon''' consists of mineral forms of C, either from [[weathering]] of [[parent material]], or from reaction of soil minerals with atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Carbonate minerals]] are the dominant form of soil carbon in [[desert climate]]s. '''Soil organic carbon''' is present as [[soil organic matter]].  It includes relatively available C as fresh plant remains and relatively inert C in materials derived from plant remains: [[humus]] and [[charcoal]].&lt;ref name=Lal-2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lal |first=R.|date= February 2007 |title=Carbon Management in Agricultural Soils |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227593261_Carbon_Management_in_Agricultural_Soils |journal=Mitigation and Adaption Strategies for Global Change |publisher=Springer |volume=12 |issue= |pages=303–322 |doi=10.1007/s11027-006-9036-7 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global carbon cycle==
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Of the 2,700 Gt of C stored in soils worldwide, 1550 GtC is organic and 950 GtC is inorganic carbon, which is approximately three times greater than the current atmospheric C and 240 times higher compared with the current annual fossil fuel emission.&lt;ref&gt;Balal Yousaf, Guijian Liu, Ruwei Wang, Qumber Abbas, Muhammad Imtiaz, Ruijia Liu: Investigating the biochar effects on C-mineralization and sequestration of carbon in soil compared with conventional amendments using stable isotope (δ13C) approach. GCB Bioenergy 2016; {{DOI|10.1111/gcbb.12401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of soil carbon is held in [[peat]] and wetlands (150 GtC), and in [[plant litter]] at the soil surface (50 GtC). This compares to 780 GtC in the [[atmosphere]], and 600 GtC in [[biomass|all living organisms]]. The oceanic pool holds 38,200 GtC.

About 60 GtC/yr is added to soil. This 60 GtC/yr is the balance of 120 GtC/yr [[carbon fixation|taken out of the atmosphere]] by terrestrial plant [[photosynthesis]] reduced by 60 GtC/yr plant [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. An equivalent 60 GtC/yr is respired from soil, joining the 60G tC/yr plant respiration to return to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Lal-2008&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b809492f | title = Sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in global carbon pools | last = Lal | first = Rattan |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200736458_Sequestration_of_atmospheric_CO2_in_global_carbon_pools| journal = Energy and Environmental Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–100 | year = 2008 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=U&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to the Global Carbon Cycle|publisher=University of New Hampshire|url=http://globecarboncycle.unh.edu/CarbonCycleBackground.pdf |year=2009 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic carbon==
Soil organic carbon is divided between living [[soil biology|soil biota]] and dead [[biotic material]] derived from biomass.  Together these comprise the [[soil food web]], with the living component [[energy flow (ecology)|sustained]] by the biotic material component. Soil biota includes [[earthworms]], [[nematodes]], [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and different [[arthropods]].

[[Detritus]] resulting from [[plant senescence]] is the major source of soil organic carbon. Plant materials, with [[cell wall]]s high in [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]], are decomposed and the not-[[cellular respiration|respired]] carbon is retained as [[humus]]. Cellulose and starches are easily degraded, resulting in relatively short residence times. More persistent forms of organic C include lignin, humus, organic matter encapsulated in soil aggregates, and charcoal. These resist alteration and have long residence times.

Soil organic carbon tends to be concentrated in the topsoil. [[Topsoil]] ranges from 0.5% to 3.0% organic C for most [[highland|upland]] soils. Soils with less than 0.5% organic C are mostly limited to [[desert]] areas. Soils containing greater than 12 - 18% organic C are generally classified as [[histosol|organic soils]]. High levels of organic C [[pedogenesis|develop in soils]] supporting [[hydric soil|wetland ecology]], [[sediment|flood deposition]], [[fire ecology]], and [[anthrosol|human activity]].

Fire derived forms of carbon are present in most soils as unweathered [[charcoal]] and weathered [[black carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Bird|author-first=M.|chapter=Test procedures for biochar in soil|title=Biochar for Environmental Management|editor-last1=Lehmann|editor-first1=J.|editor-last2=Joseph|editor-first2=S.|page=679|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-70415-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skjemstad|first=Jan O.|date=2002 |title=Charcoal carbon in U.S. agricultural soils|journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1249–1255 |doi=10.2136/sssaj2002.1249|bibcode=2002SSASJ..66.1249S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil organic C is typically 5 - 50% derived from char,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Schmidt|author-first1=M.W.I.|author-last2=Skjemstad|author-first2=J.O.|author-last3=Czimczik|author-first3=C.I.|author-last4=Glaser|author-first4=B.|author-last5=Prentice|author-first5=K.M.|author-last6=Gelinas|author-first6=Y.|author-last7=Kuhlbusch|author-first7=T.A.J.|year=2001|title=Comparative analysis of black C in soils|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=15|pages=163–168| url=http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~mschmidt/downloads/Schmidt_Czimczik.pdf|doi=10.1029/2000GB001284|bibcode=2001GBioC..15..163S}}&lt;/ref&gt; with levels above 50% encountered in [[mollisol]], [[chernozem]], and [[terra preta]] soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Mao|author-first1=J.-D.|author-last2=Johnson|author-first2=R.

===Soil health===
[[File:SRS1000 being used to measure soil respiration in the field..jpg|thumb|right|350px|A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux]]{{Main|Soil health}}
Organic carbon is vital to soil capacity to provide [[edaphic]] [[ecosystem services]]. The condition of this capacity is termed [[soil health]], a term that communicates the value of understanding soil as a living system as opposed to an [[abiotic component]]. Specific carbon related benchmarks used to evaluate soil health include CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release, humus levels, and microbial metabolic activity.

===Losses===
The exchange of carbon between soils and the atmosphere is a significant part of the world carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-06/there-s-a-climate-change-bomb-under-your-feet |title=There’s a Climate Bomb Under Your Feet; Soil locks away carbon just as the oceans do. But that lock is getting picked as the atmosphere warms and development accelerates. |author=Eric Roston |date=October 6, 2017 |website=[[Bloomberg.com]] |access-date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon, as it relates to the organic matter of soils, is a major component of soil and [[catchment]] health. Several factors affect the variation that exists in soil organic matter and soil carbon; the most significant has, in contemporary times, been the influence of humans and agricultural systems.

Although exact quantities are difficult to measure, human activities have caused massive losses of soil organic carbon.&lt;ref name=ruddiman-2007&gt;{{Cite book | title = Plows, Plagues, and Petroleum: How Humans Took Control of Climate | last = Ruddiman | first = William | year = 2007 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, NJ | isbn = 978-0-691-14634-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGUVHAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; First was the use of [[fire]], which removes soil cover and leads to immediate and continuing losses of soil organic carbon. [[Tillage]] and [[drainage]] both expose soil organic matter to oxygen and oxidation. In the [[Netherlands]], [[East Anglia]], [[Florida]], and the [[California Delta]], subsidence of [[peat]] lands from oxidation has been severe as a result of tillage and drainage. [[Grazing]] management that exposes soil (through either excessive or insufficient recovery periods) can also cause losses of soil organic.

===Managing soil carbon===
Natural variations in soil carbon occur as a result of [[climate]], [[organism]]s, [[parent material]], time, and relief.&lt;ref name=young-young-2001&gt;{{Cite book | title = Soils in the Australian landscape | last = Young | first = A. |author2=Young, R.  | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Melbourne | isbn = 978-0-19-551550-3 | url = http://www.oup.com.au/content/General.asp?ContentID=1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest contemporary influence has been that of humans; for example, carbon in [[Australia]]n [[Agriculture|agricultural]] soils may historically have been twice the present range that is typically from 1.6 to 4.6 per cent.&lt;ref name=charman-murphy-2000&gt;{{Cite book | title = Soils, their properties and management | edition = 2nd edn | last = Charman | first = P.E.V. |author2=Murphy, B.W.  | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Melbourne | isbn = 978-0-19-551762-0 | url = http://au.oup.com/content/general.asp?ContentID=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long been encouraged that farmers adjust practices to maintain or increase the organic component in the soil. On one hand, practices that hasten oxidation of carbon (such as [[stubble burning|burning crop stubbles]] or over-cultivation) are discouraged; on the other hand, incorporation of organic material (such as in [[Manure|manuring]]) has been encouraged. Increasing soil carbon is not a straightforward matter; it is made complex by the relative activity of soil biota, which can consume and release carbon and are made more active by the addition of [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]]s.&lt;ref name=young-young-2001/&gt;

====Data available on soil organic carbon====

=====Europe=====
The most homogeneous and comprehensive data on the organic carbon/matter content of [[Europe]]an soils remain those that can be extracted and/or derived from the [[European Soil Database]] in combination with associated databases on [[land cover]], climate, and [[topography]]. The modelled data refer to [http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ESDB_Archive/octop/octop_data.html carbon content (%) in the surface horizon] of soils in Europe. In an inventory on available national datasets, seven [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] have available datasets on organic carbon. In the article  "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.07.020 Estimating soil organic carbon in Europe based on data collected through an European network]" (Ecological Indicators 24,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Hiederer|first2=Roland|last3=Liedekerke|first3=Marc Van|last4=Bampa|first4=Francesca|title=Estimating soil organic carbon in Europe based on data collected through an European network|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.07.020|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=24|pages=439–450|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;439–450), a comparison of national data with modelled data is performed.

====Managing for catchment health====

Much of the contemporary literature on soil carbon relates to its role, or potential, as an atmospheric [[carbon sink]] to offset [[climate change]]. Despite this emphasis, a much wider range of soil and [[drainage basin|catchment]] health aspects are improved as soil carbon is increased. These benefits are difficult to quantify, due to the complexity of [[natural resource]] systems and the interpretation of what constitutes soil health; nonetheless, several benefits are proposed in the following points:

*Reduced [[erosion]], [[sedimentation]]: increased soil aggregate stability means greater resistance to erosion; mass movement is less likely when soils are able to retain structural strength under greater moisture levels.
*Greater productivity: healthier and more productive soils can contribute to positive socio-economic circumstances.
*Cleaner [[waterway]]s, nutrients and [[turbidity]]: nutrients and sediment tend to be retained by the soil rather than leach or wash off, and are so kept from waterways.
*[[Water balance]]: greater soil water holding capacity reduces overland flow and recharge to [[groundwater]]; the water saved and held by the soil remains available for use by plants.
*Climate change: Soils have the ability to retain carbon that may otherwise exist as atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and contribute to [[global warming]].
*Greater [[biodiversity]]: soil organic matter contributes to the health of soil flora and, accordingly, the natural links with biodiversity in the greater [[biosphere]].

===Forest soils===
[[Forest]] soils constitute a large pool of carbon. Anthropogenic activities such as [[deforestation]] cause releases of carbon from this pool, which may significantly increase the concentration of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2000. [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]. IPCC Special Report. United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), countries must estimate and report GHG emissions and removals, including changes in carbon stocks in all five pools (above- and below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil carbon) and associated emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry activities, according to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s good practice guidance.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2003. Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry. Kanagawa, Japan, National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2006. Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. Kanagawa, Japan, National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme.&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical deforestation represents nearly 25 percent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide.&lt;ref name=Pan-2011&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Pan Y. | year = 2011 | title = A Large and Persistent Carbon Sink in the World's Forests | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6045 | pages = 1201609 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201609 |name-list-format=vanc | author2 = Birdsey R. | author3 = Fang J. | author4 = Houghton R. | author5 = Kauppi P. | author6 = Kurz W. | author7 = Phillips O. | author8 = [[Shvidenko|Shvidenko A.]] | display-authors = 8 | last9 = Lewis | first9 = S.

For these reasons, reliable estimates of soil organic carbon stock and stock changes are needed for [[REDD|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] and GHG reporting under the UNFCCC.

The government of [[Tanzania]]—together with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/nfma/77232/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial support of the government of [[Finland]]—have implemented a forest soil carbon monitoring program&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2012.

[[India]] possesses a wide spectrum of dimensional stones that include [[granite]], [[marble]], [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[slate]], and [[quartzite]], in various parts of the country. 

The Indian [[stone industry]] has evolved into the production and manufacturing of blocks, flooring slabs, structural slabs, monuments, [[tomb stone]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[Cobblestone|cobbles]], [[pebble]]s and landscape garden stones.

==Tradition of stones==
India's history, dating back to [[32nd century BC|3200 BC]] has been influenced considerably by the disposition, development and use of stones and other construction materials. [[Dimension stone]]s have also left deep imprints on the architectural heritage of the country. Innumerable [[temple]]s, [[fort]]s and [[palace]]s of [[History of India|Ancient Indian Civilisation]] have been carved out of locally available stones. The [[Taj Mahal]] at [[Agra]] was constructed from Indian marble. Some of the rock-cut structures include  [[Khajuraho|Khajuraho Temple]], [[Elephanta Caves]], and [[Konark|Konark Temple]]. Besides, all major [[Archaeological Survey of India|archeological excavations]] have revealed exquisitely carved [[statuette]]s and [[Stone carving|carvings]] in stone. Ancient [[Buddhist]] [[monument]]s like the [[Sanchi Stupa]] of 3rd century BC have also been carved out of stone.

This tradition of Stone Architecture has continued to the present era, with most of the important modern buildings in India like the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan|Presidential House]], [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House]], and [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] made from high quality [[sandstone]] of [[Rajasthan]]. The [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] of [[New Delhi]] stands testimony to the relevance of marble in modern [[Indian architecture]].

Stones are still the mainstays of [[Civil engineering|civil construction]] in India, with stones being used extensively in [[public building]]s, [[hotel]]s, and temples. It is increasingly being used in homes, with the use of stones now penetrating amongst the growing [[middle class]] of India.

The success of commercial stone industry solely depends upon defects in rock/stone. Natural defects in [[Ornamental stone|ornamental]]/commercial [[List of rock types|rock deposits]] adversely affect the quality of rock deposit. Detection of natural defects in decorative and dimensional stone industry play vital role in the [[quality assessment]].

India is pioneer in the exploration, mining of commercial rock deposits and in establishing a firm base for stone industry. India, with an estimated resource of about 1,690 million cu m, comprising over 160 shades of [[Dimension Stone Granite]]s (DSG), accounts for about 205 of the world resources. Of the 300 varieties being traded in the world market, nearly half of them are from India. Commercially viable granite and other rock deposits are reported from [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], and others.

==Deposits==
===Marble===
Marble was used for building tombs, temples and palaces. For a time it was considered as ''Royal Stone''. It is, however, now used in hotels and homes too. There are many varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marble remains best flooring option|url=http://www.hindu.com/pp/2009/01/17/stories/2009011750230300.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 January 2009|location=Hyderabad, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Makrana]]: Makrana is the source of the marble used in the Taj Mahal. It is situated at a distance of 60&amp;nbsp;km from Kishangarh and falls in the Nagaur district of Rajasthan. The region has various mining ranges, mainly Doongri, Devi, Ulodi, Saabwali, Gulabi, Kumari, Neharkhan, Matabhar, Matabhar kumari, Chuck doongri, Chosira and Pahar Kua amongst others. 
* [[Rajnagar Marble]]: World's largest marble-producing area, with over 2,000 gang saw units located in the nearby town of [[Udaipur]] to process the material produced. [[Agraria marble|Agaria]] is the best variety of this area, with numerous other varieties and patterns, primarily in white base. The marble is [[Dolomite|dolomitic]] and often has [[quartz]] intrusions.
* [[Andhi Marble]]: Located near the capital city of the state of [[Jaipur]] (also known as the 'Pink City'), it is dolomitic marble with intrusions of [[tremolite]], and is commonly known by the name of [[Pista marble|pista]] (pistachio) marble, because of the green coloured tremolite against an off-white background. One of the famous varieties of this area was known as Indo-Italian, owing to its resemblance with [[Satvario Marble]]. Most of the mining of this famous field is now banned by the [[Supreme Court of India]] because of the vicinity of the area to the [[Sariska Tiger Reserve]].
* [[Salumber Marble]]: Also known as [[Onyx|Onyx Marble]], it has thick bands of green and pink hint. A resemblance to Onyx Marble from [[Pakistan]] gives it this name. This is also highly dolomitic.
* [[Yellow Marble]]: Jaisalmer stone is found in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan. Though not been [[Metamorphosis|metamorphosed]] and hence is still a [[limestone]], it is known as [[Yellow Marble]] in trade circles. It is mined in the [[Jaisalmer District]].
* Bidasar: These are ultra basic rocks in shades of brown and green colour found in [[Rajasthan]]. The criss-cross linear pattern given it a remarkable resemblance to a photograph of dense forest. These are also known as forest green/brown or fancy green/brown.
* [[Morwad]]: Kishangarh Marble
* Gujarat - [[AmbaJi White Marble]]: It is one of the finest marble produced in India. It can be easily compared with [[Makrana|Makarana Marble]]. It is highly calcic and is produced in a town called [[Ambaji]] (famous for its temple of [[Durga|Durga Devi]]). The marble has a very soft and waxy look, and is often used by sculptors.
*Rajasthan - [[Abu Black]]: This is one of the rare Black textured marble available. Only produced in the mines of Abu road, this amazing Black textured stone is the finest decorative marble ideal for homemakers, temples, sculptures and corporate houses.
* Madhya Pradesh - [[Katni Range]]: It is famous for its beige coloured marble which is dolomitic but highly [[crystalline]], with very fine grain size and some quartz intrusions. The marble accepts excellent polish. Another variety of the same range is red/maroon-coloured marble.
*'Jabalpur range' contains dolomitic marble of excellent whiteness. It is more often used as dolomite lumps for chemical and industrial uses.
*[[Indian Green Marble]]:It is found in Rajasthan India, Indian Green Marble's most quarries is situated in Kesariyaji it is 60&amp;nbsp;km far from Udaipur rajasthan India. This Indian green marble is famous by name in all over the world. In Europe people know Indian green marble as a Verde Guatemala. Many varieties are available in Indian green marble. Indian Green Marble is exported to Africa, Europe, Australia, Middle East and many Asian countries. It is found in [[Rishabhdeo]] town of [[Udaipur District]] state Rajasthan of India.

===Granite===
India has varieties of granite in over 200 shades. As of 2005, Granite reserves in India was 37,426 million cubic metres and ranked fifth in export of processed product. Resources are found in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibm.nic.in/imyb2010_granite.pdf|title=Granite - Indian Minerals year book - 2010|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Bureau of Mines|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903112706/http://ibm.nic.in/imyb2010_granite.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandstone===
[[Sandstone]] reserves in [[India]] are found over the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Karnataka]], [[Odisha]], [[Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[West Bengal]]. Over 90[[%]] of the deposits of [[sandstone]] are in [[Rajasthan]], spread over the districts of [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]], [[Dholpur]], [[Kota district|Kota]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Sawai-Madhopur district|Sawai-Madhopur]], [[Bundi]], [[Chittorgarh]], [[Bikaner]], [[Jhalawar district|Jhalawar]], [[Pali]], [[Shivpuri]], [[Khatu]]  and [[Jaisalmer]].

[[India]] is among the [[leading countries when it comes to mining and export of sandstone]]. The best part with [[Sandstone]] from [[India]] is that it is available in different [[colors]] and considered best for interior as well as exterior use. Few most popular sandstone products from [[India]] include names like Tint Mint, White Mint, Mint Fossils, Modak, Agra Red, Rainbow Sandstone, Raj Green, Teak, Buff Brown, Dhoplur Chocolate, Beige, Dholpur Pink, Lalitpur Pink, Mandana Red, Jodhpur pink, Jodhpur red, Jaisalmer yellow etc.

These [[sandstone]] are available in a number of finishes and come with great strength. However, [[Sandstone]] like Rainbow is only available in layered form and so is not suitable when good thickness is required and [[Jodhpur sandstone]] is best when used in front elevation and high comprehensive strength. To illustrate it clearly, you can't have cobbles out of Rainbow sandstone in particular as it is usually available in the slabs form.

===Slate===
[[Slate]] reserves in India are found in [[Rajasthan]][[Haryana|, Behror, Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]],  [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Deposits in Rajasthan are spread over the districts of [[Alwar district|Alwar]], [[Ajmer district|Ajmer]], [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]], [[Tonk district|Tonk]], [[Sawai Madhopur district|Sawai Madhopur]], [[Pali district|Pali]], [[Udaipur district|Udaipur]], [[Churu district|Churu]], and [[Chittorgarh district|Chittorgarh]].

Few important names in slate are Jak Black, Silver Shine, Silver grey, Panther, Deoli Green, Peacock, Peacock Multi, Kund Black, Kund Multi and so on. Being to some extent fragile in nature, it is good for interior use only and can be used in even as washboards.

===Flaggy limestone===
[[Kotastone]] of Kota district and [[Yellow Limestone]] of Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan are the prime [[limestone]] occurrences in India. Other deposits include the [[Shahabad Stone]] of [[Gulbarga]] and the Belgaum districts of [[Karnataka]], [[Kadappa Stone]] of [[Kadapa]], [[Kurnool]] and the [[Anantapur district|Anantapur]] &amp; [[Guntur]] districts of Andhra Pradesh, [[Milliolitic Limestone]] from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] Region, [[Gujarat]], and 'Yellow Limestone' of [[Kutch]] district of Gujarat, amongst others.

====Limestone deposits====
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana put together possess 32% of the country's total reserves of limestone. world renowned Narzi limestone is available in kadapa district. Commercial grade limestone deposits are being exploiting from [[Bethamcherla]], [[Macherla]], [[Neereducherla]], [[Tandur]], ((shahabad)), [[Mudimanikyam]] of [[Kurnool]], [[Guntur]], [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Anantapur]], [[Rangareddy district|Rangareddy]], and [[Nalgonda]] districts are widely used in our country for panelling, and flooring purposes. [[Sullavai limestone]] of [[Karminagar]] and [[Warangal]] districts, massive limestones of [[Mudimanikyam]], [[Nalgonda]] districts. Total India's limestones are estimated about 93,623 million tonnes. Limestones are extensively utilised for manufacturing of [[cement]] and also building stones, particularly flooring and roofing .

===Other dimensional stones===
There are some other dimensional stones being quarried and used in consumption, in addition to the dimensional stones already detailed above. [[Laterite]] bricks are quarried in huge quantities and are utilised as bricks in the construction of houses and for [[sidewalk|pavement]]s in the states of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Karnataka]], [[Goa]], and in other parts of coastal states. The [[Felspar|felspathic]] sandstone occurring with the [[coal]] seams as overburden is also used as building stone. The huge deposits of [[basalt]] in the states of [[Maharashtra]], Karnataka, and [[Gujarat]] are used as building stones since ancient times. Other quartzitic bands, occurring with [[phyllite]]s and [[schist]]s, are also utilised for building purposes. [[Khondelite]]s from Eastern coast are being used widely in [[sculpture]]s and as a building material. [[Felsite]] from Karnataka is being extensively used as a dimensional stone as well.India also contains many stones which are semiprecious like-zoisite, apophyllite, cavansite, muscotive mica, almandine, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16106">The '''synoptic scale''' in [[meteorology]] (also known as '''large scale''' or '''cyclonic scale''') is a horizontal length scale of the order of 1000 kilometers (about 620 miles) or more.&lt;ref&gt;American Meteorological Society. [http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cyclonic_scale Cyclonic scale.] Retrieved on 21 January 2017. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160428104004/http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cyclonic_scale Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to a horizontal scale typical of mid-latitude [[Depression (meteorology)|depressions]] (e.g. [[extratropical cyclone]]s).  Most [[high-pressure area|high]] and [[low-pressure area|low-pressure]] areas seen on [[weather map]]s such as [[Surface weather analysis|surface weather analyses]] are synoptic-scale systems, driven by the location of [[Rossby wave]]s in their respective hemisphere.  Low-pressure areas and their related frontal zones occur on the leading edge of a trough within the Rossby wave pattern, while surface highs form on the back edge of the trough.  Most [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] areas occur near frontal zones.  The word ''synoptic'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|συνοπτικός}} (''{{transl|grc|synoptikos}}''), meaning ''seen together''.

The [[Navier–Stokes equations]] applied to atmospheric motion can be simplified by [[scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] in the synoptic scale. It can be shown that the main terms in horizontal equations are [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] and [[pressure gradient]] terms; therefore, one can use [[geostrophic wind|geostrophic approximation]].  In vertical coordinates, the momentum equation simplifies to the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] equation.

==Surface weather analysis==
[[Image:Surface analysis.gif|thumb|250px|A surface weather analysis for the United States on October 21, 2006.]]
{{Main|Surface weather analysis}}
A [[surface weather analysis]] is a special type of [[weather map]] that provides a view of [[weather]] elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.&lt;ref&gt;''Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather.''  University of Chicago PressChicago: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as [[sea level pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[cloud cover]] onto a [[geographical map]] to help find [[synoptic scale]] features such as [[weather fronts]].

The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems.&lt;ref name="MILLER"&gt;Eric R. Miller. [http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/061/mwr-061-07-0189.pdf American Pioneers in Meteorology.] Retrieved on 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the advent of the [[telegraph]], simultaneous [[surface weather observation]]s became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses.  Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s.  Use of the [[Norwegian cyclone model]] for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during [[World War II]].

Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], or other important information.  For example, an ''H'' represents [[high-pressure area|high pressure]], implying good and fair weather.  An ''L'' represents [[low pressure]], which frequently accompanies precipitation.  Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map.  Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.  Mesoscale systems and boundaries such as [[tropical cyclone]]s, outflow boundaries and [[squall line]]s also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.  Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the [[horse latitudes]] poleward, while streamline analyses are used in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Meteorology.

{{main|Extratropical cyclone}}
An extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure]] weather system that has neither [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] nor [[polar cyclone|polar]] characteristics, being connected with [[Surface weather analysis|fronts]] and horizontal [[gradients]] in [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] otherwise known as "baroclinic zones".&lt;ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni"&gt;{{cite web

The descriptor "extratropical" refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle latitudes of the planet. These systems may also be described as "mid-latitude cyclones" due to their area of formation, or "post-tropical cyclones" where [[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] has occurred,&lt;ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExtratropicalPhases"&gt;{{cite web

High pressures that build to the north and extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed) which helps prevent clouds from forming.

==Weather fronts==

The Arctic front separates Arctic from Polar air masses, while the Polar front separates Polar air from warm air masses. (cA is continental arctic; cP is continental polar; mP is maritime polar; cT is continental tropic; and mT is maritime tropic.)]]
A [[weather front]] is a boundary separating two [[air mass|masses of air]] of different [[density|densities]], and is the principal cause of [[meteorological phenomenon|meteorological phenomena]]. In [[surface weather analysis|surface weather analyses]], fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols, depending on the type of front.  The air masses separated by a front usually differ in [[temperature]] and [[humidity]].
Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s. [[Warm front]]s are usually preceded by [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.&lt;ref name=stm&gt;{{cite web|author=Author unknown |title=Lesson 7: Clouds and Precipitation |year= |accessdate=2007-04-29 |url=http://www.ccrc.sr.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Teaching/STEC521/STEC521_7.html |publisher=Self-published |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111070558/http://www.ccrc.sr.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Teaching/STEC521/STEC521_7.html |archivedate=January 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cold fronts and [[occluded front]]s generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move [[Geographical pole|poleward]]. Because of the greater density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. [[Mountain]]s and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a front becomes  [[stationary front|stationary]], and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline.  This is most common over the open ocean.

The '''Tropical Eastern Pacific''' is one of the twelve [[marine realm]]s that cover the shallow oceans of the world. The Tropical Eastern Pacific extends along the Pacific Coast of the [[Americas]], from the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]] in the north to northern [[Peru]] in the south. It also includes a number of islands and island groups, including the [[Galápagos]], [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo]], [[Cocos Island|Cocos]] and [[Clipperton Island|Clipperton]].

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[Nature Conservancy]] divide the Tropical Eastern Pacific realm into two [[marine province]]s, [[Tropical East Pacific]] and Galápagos, which are further subdivided into [[marine ecoregion]]s.

[[File:Rectified waves.png|thumb|Different types of wave with varying rectifications]]
In [[physics]], a '''wave''' is a disturbance that transfers [[energy]] through [[matter]] or space, with little or no associated [[mass]] transport([[Mass transfer]]). Waves consist of [[oscillation]]s or [[vibration]]s of a physical [[Transmission medium|medium]] or a [[field (physics)|field]], around relatively fixed locations. From the perspective of mathematics, waves, as functions of time and space, are a class of [[signal|signals]].&lt;ref&gt;Pragnan Chakravorty, "What Is a Signal? [Lecture Notes]," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 175-177, Sept. 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of waves: [[Mechanical wave|mechanical]] and [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic]]. Mechanical waves propagate through a physical matter, whose substance is being deformed. [[Restoring force]]s then reverse the deformation. For example, [[sound]] waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbours. When the molecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium. Instead, they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a [[vacuum]]. These types vary in [[wavelength]], and include [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared radiation]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s.

Waves are described by a [[wave equation]] which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time. The mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave. Further, the behavior of particles in [[quantum mechanics]] are described by waves. In addition, [[gravitational radiation|gravitational waves]] also travel through space, which are a result of a vibration or movement in [[gravitational field]]s.

A wave can be [[transverse wave|transverse]], where a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer, or [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]]: the oscillations are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the direction of energy propagation. While mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal, all electromagnetic waves are transverse in [[free space]].

== General features ==
[[File:2006-01-14 Surface waves.jpg|thumb|[[Surface wave]]s in [[water]] showing water ripples]]
  
A single, all-encompassing definition for the term ''wave'' is not straightforward. A [[vibration]] can be defined as a ''back-and-forth'' motion around a reference value. However, a vibration is not necessarily a wave.  An attempt to define the necessary and sufficient characteristics that qualify a [[phenomenon]] as a ''wave'' results in a blurred line.

The term ''wave'' is often intuitively understood as referring to a transport of spatial disturbances that are generally not accompanied by a motion of medium occupying this space as a whole. In a wave, the [[energy]] of a [[vibration]] is moving away from the source in the form of a disturbance within the surrounding medium {{Harv|Hall|1982| p=8}}. However, this motion is problematic for a [[standing wave]] (for example, a wave on a string), where [[energy]] is moving in both directions equally, or for electromagnetic (e.g., light) waves in a [[vacuum]], where the concept of medium does not apply and interaction with a target is the key to wave detection and practical applications. There are [[water waves]] on the ocean surface; [[Gamma rays|gamma waves]] and [[light waves]] emitted by the Sun; [[microwaves]] used in microwave ovens and in [[radar]] equipment; [[radio waves]] broadcast by radio stations; and [[sound waves]] generated by radio receivers, telephone handsets and living creatures (as voices), to mention only a few wave phenomena.

It may appear that the description of waves is closely related to their physical origin for each specific instance of a wave process.  For example, [[acoustics]] is distinguished from [[optics]] in that sound waves are related to a mechanical rather than an electromagnetic wave transfer caused by [[vibration]].  Concepts such as [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[inertia]], or [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], become therefore crucial in describing acoustic (as distinct from optic) wave processes. This difference in origin introduces certain wave characteristics particular to the properties of the medium involved. For example, in the case of air: [[vortex|vortices]], [[radiation pressure]], [[shock waves]] etc.; in the case of solids: [[Rayleigh waves]], [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]]; and so on.

Other properties, however, although usually described in terms of origin, may be generalized to all waves. For such reasons, wave theory represents a particular branch of [[physics]] that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical origin.&lt;ref name=Ostrovsky&gt;{{cite book |title = Modulated waves: theory and application |url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801873258 |author1=Lev A. Ostrovsky  |author2=Alexander I. Potapov  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn = 0-8018-7325-8 |year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, based on the mechanical origin of acoustic waves, a moving disturbance in space–time can exist if and only if the medium involved is neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely pliable. If all the parts making up a medium were rigidly ''bound'', then they would all vibrate as one, with no delay in the transmission of the vibration and therefore no wave motion. On the other hand, if all the parts were independent, then there would not be any transmission of the vibration and again, no wave motion. Although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium, they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin: within a wave, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a vibration (that is, its position within the vibration cycle) is different for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times repeatedly .

The form or shape of ''F'' in [[d'Alembert's formula]] involves the argument ''x − vt''. Constant values of this argument correspond to constant values of ''F'', and these constant values occur if ''x'' increases at the same rate that ''vt'' increases.  That is, the wave shaped like the function ''F'' will move in the positive ''x''-direction at velocity ''v'' (and ''G'' will propagate at the same speed in the negative ''x''-direction).&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;

In the case of a periodic function ''F'' with period ''λ'', that is, ''F''(''x + λ'' − ''vt'') = ''F''(''x '' − ''vt''), the periodicity of ''F'' in space means that a snapshot of the wave at a given time ''t'' finds the wave varying periodically in space with period ''λ'' (the [[wavelength]] of the wave). In a similar fashion, this periodicity of ''F'' implies a periodicity in time as well: ''F''(''x'' − ''v(t + T)'') = ''F''(''x '' − ''vt'') provided ''vT'' = ''λ'', so an observation of the wave at a fixed location ''x'' finds the wave undulating periodically in time with period ''T = λ''/''v''.&lt;ref name="McPherson0"&gt;

{{See also|Frequency modulation|Phase modulation}}

The amplitude of a wave may be constant (in which case the wave is a ''c.w.'' or ''[[continuous wave]]''), or may be ''modulated'' so as to vary with time and/or position. The outline of the variation in amplitude is called the ''envelope'' of the wave. Mathematically, the [[Amplitude modulation|modulated wave]] can be written in the form:&lt;ref name=Jirauschek&gt;

=== Phase velocity and group velocity ===
{{Main article|Phase velocity|Group velocity}}
{{See also|Envelope (waves)#Phase and group velocity}}
[[Image:Wave group.gif|thumb|frame|right|The red square moves with the [[phase velocity]], while the green circles propagate with the [[group velocity]]]]

There are two velocities that are associated with waves, the [[phase velocity]] and the [[group velocity]]. 

Phase velocity is the rate at which the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the wave [[Wave propagation|propagates in space]]: any given phase of the wave (for example, the [[crest (physics)|crest]]) will appear to travel at the phase velocity. The phase velocity is given in terms of the [[wavelength]] {{mvar|λ}} (lambda) and [[Wave period|period]]  {{mvar|T}} as

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\lambda}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Wave opposite-group-phase-velocity.gif|thumb|frame|right|A wave with the group and phase velocities going in different directions]]

Group velocity is a property of waves that have a defined envelope, measuring propagation through space (i.e. phase velocity) of the overall shape of the waves' amplitudes—modulation or envelope of the wave.

==Sine waves==
{{main|Sine wave}}
{{duplication|section=y|dupe=Sinusoidal wave|dupe2=Frequency|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Simple harmonic motion animation.gif|thumb|right|Sinusoidal waves correspond to [[simple harmonic motion]].]]

Mathematically, the most basic wave is the (spatially) one-dimensional [[sine wave]] (also called ''harmonic wave'' or ''sinusoid'') with an amplitude &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; described by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t)= A \sin (kx- \omega t + \phi) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum [[amplitude]] of the wave, maximum distance from the highest point of the disturbance in the medium (the crest) to the equilibrium point during one wave cycle. In the illustration to the right, this is the maximum vertical distance between the baseline and the wave.
*&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the space [[coordinate]]
*&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time coordinate
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]]
*&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]]
*&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase (waves)|phase constant]].

The units of the amplitude depend on the type of wave. Transverse mechanical waves (e.g., a wave on a string) have an amplitude expressed as a [[distance]] (e.g., meters), longitudinal mechanical waves (e.g., sound waves) use units of pressure (e.g., pascals), and electromagnetic waves (a form of transverse vacuum wave) express the amplitude in terms of its [[electric field]] (e.g., volts/meter).

The [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between two sequential crests or troughs (or other equivalent points), generally is measured in meters. A [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the spatial frequency of the wave in [[radian]]s per unit distance (typically per meter), can be associated with the wavelength by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[period (physics)|period]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the time for one complete cycle of an oscillation of a wave. The [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the number of periods per unit time (per second) and is typically measured in [[hertz]] denoted as Hz. These are related by:

:&lt;math&gt;
f=\frac{1}{T}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the frequency and period of a wave are reciprocals.

The [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; represents the frequency in radians per second. It is related to the frequency or period by

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega = 2 \pi f = \frac{2 \pi}{T}. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a sinusoidal waveform traveling at constant speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;ref name=Cassidy&gt;

{{cite book |title = Understanding physics |author1=David C. Cassidy |author2=Gerald James Holton |author3=Floyd James Rutherford |url = https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&amp;pg=PA340 |pages = 339 ''ff'' |isbn = 0-387-98756-8 |year = 2002 |publisher = Birkhäuser }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{v}{f},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is called the phase speed (magnitude of the [[phase velocity]]) of the wave and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the wave's frequency.

Wavelength can be a useful concept even if the wave is not [[periodic function|periodic]] in space. For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, the incoming wave undulates with a varying ''local'' wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height. The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.&lt;ref name=Pinet2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arbitrary wave shapes will propagate unchanged in lossless [[linear time-invariant system]]s, in the presence of dispersion the [[sine wave]] is the unique shape that will propagate unchanged but for phase and amplitude, making it easy to analyze.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book |title = Communication Systems and Techniques |author1=Mischa Schwartz |author2=William R.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s, a linear medium with dispersion also exhibits loss, so the sine wave propagating in a dispersive medium is attenuated in certain frequency ranges that depend upon the medium.&lt;ref name=Tielens&gt;

The sinusoid is defined for all times and distances, whereas in physical situations we usually deal with waves that exist for a limited span in space and duration in time. An arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves by the use of [[Fourier analysis]]. As a result, the simple case of a single sinusoidal wave can be applied to more general cases.&lt;ref name=Stein2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many media are [[linear]], or nearly so, so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the [[superposition principle]] to find the solution for a general waveform.&lt;ref name=Jewett&gt;

== Plane waves ==

== Standing waves ==
{{Main article|Standing wave|Acoustic resonance|Helmholtz resonator|Organ pipe}}

[[File:Standing wave.gif|thumb|right|300px|Standing wave in stationary medium. The red dots represent the wave [[Node (physics)|nodes]]]]

A standing wave, also known as a ''stationary wave'', is a wave that remains in a constant position. This phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the opposite direction to the wave, or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two waves traveling in opposite directions.

The ''sum'' of two counter-propagating waves (of equal amplitude and frequency) creates a ''standing wave''.  Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave.  For example, when a [[violin]] string is displaced, transverse waves propagate out to where the string is held in place at the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]], where the waves are reflected back.  At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in [[antiphase]] and cancel each other, producing a [[node (physics)|node]]. Halfway between two nodes there is an [[antinode]], where the two counter-propagating waves ''enhance'' each other maximally. There is no net [[Energy transfer|propagation of energy]] over time.

== Physical properties ==

[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr°0125.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Light beam exhibiting reflection, refraction, transmission and dispersion when encountering a prism]]

Waves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations, e. g.

=== Transmission and media ===
{{Main article|Rectilinear propagation|Transmittance|Transmission medium}}

Waves normally move in a straight line (i.e. rectilinearly) through a ''[[transmission medium]]''. Such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories:
* A ''bounded medium'' if it is finite in extent, otherwise an ''unbounded medium''
* A ''linear medium'' if the amplitudes of different waves at any particular point in the medium can be added
* A ''uniform medium'' or ''homogeneous medium'' if its physical properties are unchanged at different locations in space
* An ''anisotropic medium'' if one or more of its physical properties differ in one or more directions
* An ''isotropic medium'' if its physical properties are the ''same'' in all directions

=== Absorption ===
{{Main article|Absorption (acoustics)|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
Absorption of waves means, if a kind of wave strikes a matter, it will be absorbed by the matter.  When a wave with that same natural frequency impinges upon an atom, then the electrons of that atom will be set into vibrational motion. If a wave of a given frequency strikes a material with electrons having the same vibrational frequencies, then those electrons will absorb the energy of the wave and transform it into vibrational motion.

=== Reflection ===
{{Main article|Reflection (physics)}}

When a wave strikes a reflective surface, it changes direction, such that the angle made by the [[incident ray|incident wave]] and line [[perpendicular|normal]] to the surface equals the angle made by the reflected wave and the same normal line.

=== Refraction ===
{{Main article|Refraction}}

[[File:Wave refraction.gif|thumb|right|200 px|Sinusoidal traveling plane wave entering a region of lower wave velocity at an angle, illustrating the decrease in wavelength and change of direction (refraction) that results.]]

Refraction is the phenomenon of a wave changing its speed. Mathematically, this means that the size of the [[phase velocity]] changes. Typically, refraction occurs when a wave passes from one [[Transmission medium|medium]] into another. The amount by which a wave is refracted by a material is given by the [[refractive index]] of the material. The directions of incidence and refraction are related to the refractive indices of the two materials by [[Snell's law]].

=== Diffraction ===
{{Main article|Diffraction}}

A wave exhibits diffraction when it encounters an obstacle that bends the wave or when it spreads after emerging from an opening. Diffraction effects are more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.

=== Interference ===
{{Main article|Interference (wave propagation)}}

Waves that encounter each other combine through [[superposition principle|superposition]] to create a new wave called an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]]. Important interference patterns occur for waves that are in [[phase (waves)|phase]].

=== Polarization ===
{{Main article|Polarization (waves)}}

[[File:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light Circular.Polarizer Creating.Left.Handed.Helix.View.svg|thumb|left]]

The phenomenon of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two [[orthogonal]] directions. [[Transverse wave]]s can be polarized, for instance. When polarization is used as a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of [[linear polarization]]. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as "horizontal" for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. [[Electromagnetic waves]] propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a [[polarizer|polarizing filter]].

Longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, do not exhibit polarization. For these waves there is only one direction of oscillation, that is, along the direction of travel.

=== Dispersion ===

[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|right|270 px|Schematic of light being dispersed by a prism. Click to see animation.]]

{{Main article|Dispersion relation|Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion (water waves)}}

A wave undergoes dispersion when either the [[phase velocity]] or the [[group velocity]] depends on the wave frequency.
Dispersion is most easily seen by letting white light pass through a [[prism (optics)|prism]], the result of which is to produce the spectrum of colours of the rainbow. [[Isaac Newton]] performed experiments with light and prisms, presenting his findings in the ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704) that white light consists of several colours and that these colours cannot be decomposed any further.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical waves ==
{{Main article|Mechanical wave}}

=== Waves on strings ===
{{Main article|Vibrating string}}

The speed of a transverse wave traveling along a [[vibrating string]] ('' v '') is directly proportional to the square root of the [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the string ('' T '') over the [[linear mass density]] ('' μ ''):

:&lt;math&gt;
v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the linear density ''μ'' is the mass per unit length of the string.

=== Acoustic waves ===
Acoustic or [[sound]] waves travel at speed given by

:&lt;math&gt;
v=\sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho_0}}, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

or the square root of the adiabatic bulk modulus divided by the ambient fluid density (see [[speed of sound]]).

=== Water waves ===
[[File:Shallow water wave.gif|thumb|right|400px]]

{{Main article|Water waves}}

* [[ripple tank|Ripples]] on the surface of a pond are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves; therefore, the points on the surface follow orbital paths.
* [[Sound]]—a mechanical wave that propagates through gases, liquids, solids and plasmas;
* [[Inertial waves]], which occur in rotating fluids and are restored by the [[Coriolis effect]];
* [[Ocean surface wave]]s, which are perturbations that propagate through water.

=== Seismic waves ===
{{Main article|Seismic waves}}
Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through the Earth's layers, and are a result of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, magma movement, large landslides and large man-made explosions that give out low-frequency acoustic energy.

=== Shock waves ===
[[File:Transonico-en.svg|thimb|right|300 px|Formation of a shock wave by a plane.]]

{{Main article|Shock wave}}

A shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance. When a [[wave]] moves faster than the local [[speed of sound]] in a [[fluid]], it is a shock wave.  Like an ordinary wave, a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium; however, it is characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in [[pressure]], [[temperature]] and [[density]] of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Electromagnetic waves ==
[[File:Onde electromagnétique.png|thumb|right|300 px]]

{{Main article|Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic spectrum}}

An electromagnetic wave consists of two waves that are oscillations of the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields. An electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields. In the 19th century, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that, in [[vacuum]], the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the [[wave equation]] both with speed equal to that of the [[speed of light]]. From this emerged the idea that [[visible light|light]] is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies (and thus wavelengths), giving rise to various types of radiation such as [[radio waves]], [[microwaves]], [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-rays]], and [[Gamma rays]].

== Quantum mechanical waves ==
{{Main article|Schrödinger equation}}
{{See also|Wave function}}

=== Schrödinger equation ===
The [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the wave-like behavior of particles in [[quantum mechanics]]. Solutions of this equation are [[wave function]]s which can be used to describe the probability density of a particle.

=== Dirac equation ===
The [[Dirac equation]] is a relativistic wave equation detailing electromagnetic interactions. Dirac waves accounted for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way.  The wave equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, antimatter, previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed.  In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin-½ particles.

=== de Broglie waves ===
{{Main article|Wave packet|Matter wave}}

[[Louis de Broglie]] postulated that all particles with [[momentum]] have a wavelength

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], and ''p'' is the magnitude of the [[momentum]] of the particle. This hypothesis was at the basis of [[quantum mechanics]]. Nowadays, this wavelength is called the [[de Broglie wavelength]]. For example, the [[electron]]s in a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] display have a de Broglie wavelength of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; m.'''

A wave representing such a particle traveling in the ''k''-direction is expressed by the wave function as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf{r}, \ t=0) =A\  e^{i\mathbf{k \cdot r}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the wavelength is determined by the [[wave vector]] '''k''' as:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac {2 \pi}{k} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and the momentum by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

However, a wave like this with definite wavelength is not localized in space, and so cannot represent a particle localized in space. To localize a particle, de Broglie proposed a superposition of different wavelengths ranging around a central value in a [[wave packet]],&lt;ref name=Marton&gt;

{{cite book |title = Advances in Electronics and Electron Physics |page = 271 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=g5q6tZRwUu4C&amp;pg=PA271 |isbn = 0-12-014653-3 |year = 1980 |publisher = Academic Press |volume = 53 |editor1=L. Marton |editor2=Claire Marton |author = Ming Chiang Li |chapter = Electron Interference }}

&lt;/ref&gt; a waveform often used in [[quantum mechanics]] to describe the [[wave function]] of a particle. In a wave packet, the wavelength of the particle is not precise, and the local wavelength deviates on either side of the main wavelength value.

In representing the wave function of a localized particle, the [[wave packet]] is often taken to have a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian shape]] and is called a ''Gaussian wave packet''.&lt;ref name=wavepacket&gt;

Allan Bromley |page = 60 |isbn = 3-540-67458-6 |edition = 2 |year = 2007 |publisher = Springer }} and {{cite book |title = Electronic basis of the strength of materials |author = John Joseph Gilman |url = https://books.google.com/?id=YWd7zHU0U7UC&amp;pg=PA57 |page = 57 |year = 2003 |isbn = 0-521-62005-8 |publisher = Cambridge University Press }},{{cite book |title = Principles of quantum mechanics |author = Donald D. Fitts |url = https://books.google.com/?id=8t4DiXKIvRgC&amp;pg=PA17 |page = 17 |isbn = 0-521-65841-1 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1999 }}.

&lt;/ref&gt; Gaussian wave packets also are used to analyze water waves.&lt;ref name=Mei&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a Gaussian wavefunction ψ might take the form:&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;

{{cite book |title = Quantum Mechanics |author1=Walter Greiner |author2=D. Allan Bromley |page = 60 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=7qCMUfwoQcAC&amp;pg=PA60 |edition = 2nd |year = 2007 |publisher = Springer |isbn = 3-540-67458-6 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(x,\ t=0) = A\  \exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2} + i k_0 x \right) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

at some initial time ''t'' = 0, where the central wavelength is related to the central wave vector ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2π / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It is well known from the theory of [[Fourier analysis]],&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;

{{cite book |page = 23 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=VM4GFlzHg34C&amp;pg=PA23 |title = The picture book of quantum mechanics |author1=Siegmund Brandt |author2=Hans Dieter Dahmen |isbn = 0-387-95141-5 |year = 2001 |edition = 3rd |publisher = Springer }}

&lt;/ref&gt; or from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] (in the case of quantum mechanics) that a narrow range of wavelengths is necessary to produce a localized wave packet, and the more localized the envelope, the larger the spread in required wavelengths. The [[Fourier transform]] of a Gaussian is itself a Gaussian.&lt;ref name=Gaussian&gt;

{{cite book |title = Modern mathematical methods for physicists and engineers |author = Cyrus D. Cantrell |page = 677 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=QKsiFdOvcwsC&amp;pg=PA677 |isbn = 0-521-59827-3 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 2000 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Given the Gaussian:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^{-x^2 / (2\sigma^2)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

the Fourier transform is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{ f} (k) = \sigma e^{-\sigma^2 k^2 / 2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The Gaussian in space therefore is made up of waves:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ \tilde{f} (k) e^{ikx} \ dk \ ; &lt;/math&gt;

that is, a number of waves of wavelengths λ such that ''k''λ = 2 π.

The parameter σ decides the spatial spread of the Gaussian along the ''x''-axis, while the Fourier transform shows a spread in [[wave vector]] ''k'' determined by 1/σ. That is, the smaller the extent in space, the larger the extent in ''k'', and hence in λ = 2π/''k''.

== Gravity waves ==

[[Gravity waves]] are waves generated in a fluid medium or at the interface between two media when the force of gravity or buoyancy tries to restore equilibrium. A ripple on a pond is one example.

== Gravitational waves ==

{{Main article|Gravitational wave}}

[[gravitational radiation|Gravitational waves]] also travel through space. The first observation of gravitational waves was announced on 11 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational waves detected for 1st time, 'opens a brand new window on the universe'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ligo-gravitational-wave-1.3443697|publisher=CBC|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of [[spacetime]], predicted by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">{{Unreferenced|date=September 2008}}[[Image:Whangee umbrella.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Whangee umbrella handle]]'''Whangee''' refers to any of over forty Asian [[grasses]] of the genus ''[[Phyllostachys]]'', a genus of [[bamboos]].  They are a hardy evergreen plant from Japan, China and the Himalayas whose woody stems are sometimes used to make [[Walking stick|canes]] and [[umbrella]] handles. The word derives from the Chinese (Mandarin) huáng lí. It can also refer to a cane made from whangee.

[[John Steed]], the dapper secret agent from television's ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', was known for carrying an umbrella with a whangee handle. Charlie Chaplin's character, [[The Little Tramp]], is famously known for his whangee [[walking stick|cane]].

The firm of [[Alfred Dunhill|Dunhill]] created  custom smoking pipes and [[cigarette holder]]s out of whangee, lacquering the  surface of the plant stems and adding a black plastic or [[Bakelite]] mouthpiece. [[Terry-Thomas]], the well-known British comedic actor, habitually used an 8-inch (200&amp;nbsp;mm)-long custom black lacquered whangee cigarette holder. It became his trademark and is seen in most of his publicity photographs. His collection included a valuable holder that had a spiral of diamonds set in gold over the black lacquered whangee. It was stolen from his dressing room, and was recovered in a damaged state.

[[Bertie Wooster]] in ''[[The Inimitable Jeeves]]'' says, "Then bring me my whangee, my yellowest shoes, and the old green [[Homburg (hat)|Homburg]]. I'm going into the park to do pastoral dances." The author, [[P.G. Wodehouse]], does not elaborate on the meaning of whangee, assuming that any of his audience would immediately know to what it referred. (The Inimitable Jeeves, ch.1)

[[File:Stift Lilienfeld - Bibliothek - Xylothek II.jpg|thumb|Volumes in a xylotheque in Lilienfeld, Austria]]
[[Image:Xilo99b.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Xiloteque Manuel Soler, in [[Dénia]] ([[Spain]])]]
A '''xylotheque''' or '''xylothek''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and "theque" meaning "repository") is special form of [[herbarium]] that consists of a collection of authenticated wood specimens.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; It is also known as a  '''xylarium''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and Latin "arium" meaning "separate place"). Traditionally, xylotheque specimens were in the form of book-shaped volumes, each made of a particular kind of wood and holding samples of the different parts of the corresponding plant. While the terms are often used interchangeably, some use ''xylotheque'' to refer to these older collections of wooden 'books' and ''xylarium'' for modern collections in which some or all of the specimens are in simpler shapes, such as blocks or plaques with information engraved on their surfaces.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; Many countries have at least one xylotheque with native [[flora]], and some also house flora from other parts of the world. They are valuable to specialists in forestry, botany, conservation, forensics, art restoration, [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and other fields.&lt;ref name=kerala/&gt;

==History==
Xylotheques date back to the later 17th century, when wood specimens began to appear in [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Over time, they grew larger and more systematic, with hundreds of individual volumes in a single collection. The oldest extant collection was established in 1823 at the University of Leningrad, and by the middle of the century they had been established in many European countries.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; Australia now houses 12 xylaria holding 11% of the world's wood specimens,&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; while the Oxford Forestry Institute's xylarium holds about 13%.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;

In older xylotheques, the wooden volumes were typically made out of the same wood as the specimens inside and sometimes decorated with tree bark and associated lichens and mosses.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Each volume housed seeds, flowers, twigs, and leaves from the corresponding tree or bush, along with a written description hidden in a small compartment set into the inner spine. An alternative form of xylotheque found in Japan and elsewhere featured paintings of the plant parts rather than actual field specimens.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;  

Even a modest collection of wood samples has value, as each of its samples has a particular history. Xylotheques provide comparison samples for [[xylotomy]], art historical studies, and scientific studies of the physical and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of wood, such as durability and preservation. Xylotheques are also useful for anyone who needs to make a morphological-visual analysis of wood.

The xylotheque with the largest number of samples is the [[Samuel James Record]] Collection in the United States, which holds 98,000 samples. Formerly housed at the Forestry School of [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, it was transferred to the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory in 1969.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FPL/&gt; The second largest xylotheque belongs to the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] in [[Tervuren]], Belgium, with 57,000 samples.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; The Thünen Institute of Wood Research in [[Hamburg]] has more than 37,000 samples.&lt;ref name=thuenen/&gt;

==In popular culture==
For [[documenta]] 13 in 2012, American artist [[Mark Dion]] created a new hexagonal display chamber for the Schildbach Xylotheque at the Natural History Museum in Kassel, Germany. As part of the project, he created six new volumes made of wood from each of the continents (excluding Antarctica).&lt;ref name=dion/&gt;

The lack of anything remotely close to contemporary documentary evidence has led to some controversy over the historicity of Yu. Proponents of the historicity of Yu theorise that stories about his life and reign were transmitted orally in various areas of China until they were recorded in the Zhou dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China | first = Sarah | last = Allan | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-7914-9449-3 | page = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  while opponents believe the figure existed in legend in a different form - as a god or mythical animal - in the Xia dynasty, and morphed into a human figure by the start of the Zhou dynasty. Many of the stories about Yu were collected in [[Sima Qian]]'s famous ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  Yu and other "sage-kings" of Ancient China were lauded for their virtues and morals by [[Confucius]] and other Chinese teachers.&lt;ref name="tonsi36"&gt;戴逸, 龔書鐸. [2002] (2003) 中國通史. 史前 夏 商 西周.

Yu is one of the few Chinese rulers posthumously honored with the [[epithet]] "[[List of people known as The Great|the Great]]".

==Great Yu Controls the Waters==
{{main|Great Flood (China)}}

During the reign of king [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]], the Chinese heartland was frequently plagued by [[Great Flood (of China)|floods]] that prevented further economic and social development.&lt;ref name="Lu"&gt;Lu, Xing. Rhetoric in ancient China, fifth to third century, B.C.E.: a comparison with classical Greek rhetoric. [1998] (1998). Univ of South Carolina Press publishing. {{ISBN|1-57003-216-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-216-5}}. p 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yu's father, Gun, was tasked with devising a system to control the flooding.  He spent more than nine years building a series of dikes and dams along the riverbanks, but all of this was ineffective, despite (or because of) the great number and size of these dikes and the use of a special [[Xirang|self-expanding soil]].  As an adult, Yu continued his father's work and made a careful study of the river systems in an attempt to learn why his father's great efforts had failed.

Collaborating with [[Houji]], a semi-mythical agricultural master about whom little is concretely known, Yu successfully devised a system of flood controls that were crucial in establishing the prosperity of the Chinese heartland.  Instead of directly damming the rivers' flow, Yu made a system of [[Surface irrigation|irrigation canal]]s which relieved floodwater into fields, as well as spending great effort [[dredging]] the riverbeds.&lt;ref name="tonsi38" /&gt;   Yu is said to have eaten and slept with the common workers and spent most of his time personally assisting the work of dredging the silty beds of the rivers for the thirteen years the projects took to complete.  The dredging and irrigation were successful, and allowed ancient Chinese culture to flourish along the [[Yellow River]], [[Wei River]], and other waterways of the Chinese heartland.  The project earned Yu renown throughout Chinese history, and is referred to in Chinese history as '''"Great Yu Controls the Waters"''' ({{zh|c=大禹治水|p=Dà Yǔ Zhì Shuǐ}}).  In particular, [[Mount Longmen (Shanxi)|Mount Longmen]] along the [[Yellow River]] had a very narrow channel which blocked water from flowing freely east toward the ocean.  Yu is said to have brought a large number of workers to open up this channel, which has been known ever since as "Yu's Gateway" ({{zh|c=禹門口}}).&lt;ref name="tonsi38" /&gt;

===Apocryphal stories===
In a mythical version of this story, presented in [[Wang Jia]]'s 4th-century AD work ''[[Shi Yi Ji]]'', Yu is assisted in his work by a yellow dragon and a black turtle (not necessarily related to the [[Black Tortoise]] of Chinese mythology).&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{citation

Traditional stories say that Yu sacrificed a great deal of his body to control the floods. For example, his hands were said to be thickly [[callus]]ed, and his feet were completely covered with callus. In one common story, Yu had only been married four days when he was given the task of fighting the flood. He said goodbye to his wife, saying that he did not know when he would return. During the thirteen years of flooding, he passed by his own family's doorstep three times, but each time he did not return inside his own home. The first time he passed, he heard that his wife was in [[Childbirth|labor]]. The second time he passed by, his son could already call out to his father. His family urged him to return home, but he said it was impossible as the flood was still going on. The third time Yu was passing by, his son was older than ten years old. Each time, Yu refused to go in the door, saying that as the flood was rendering countless number of people homeless, he could not rest.&lt;ref name="history18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history19"&gt;王恆偉.

Yu supposedly killed [[Gong Gong]]'s minister [[Xiangliu]], a nine-headed snake monster.

==The Nine Provinces==

King [[Emperor Shun|Shun]], who reigned after Yao, was so impressed by Yu's engineering work and diligence that he passed the throne to Yu instead of to his own son. Yu is said to have initially declined the throne, but was so popular with other local lords and chiefs that he agreed to become the new emperor, at the age of fifty-three.  He established a capital at Anyi ({{zh|c=安邑}}), the ruins of which are in modern [[Xia County]] in southern [[Shanxi Province]], and founded what would be called the [[Xia Dynasty]], traditionally considered China's first dynasty.&lt;ref name="history21"&gt;王恆偉.

Yu's flood control work is said to have made him intimately familiar with all regions of what was then [[Han Chinese]] territory.  According to his ''[[Yu Gong]]'' treatise in the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', Yu divided the Chinese "world" into nine ''[[Zhou (country subdivision)|zhou]]'' or provinces. These were [[Jizhou (ancient China)|Jizhou]] (冀州), [[Yanzhou]] (兗州), [[Qingzhou]] (青州), [[Xuzhou]] (徐州), [[Yangzhou]] (揚州), [[Jingzhou]] (荊州), [[Yuzhou (nine ancient provinces)|Yuzhou]] (豫州), [[Liangzhou]] (梁州) and [[Yong Province|Yongzhou]] (雍州).&lt;ref name="n3"&gt;Ng Saam-sing 吾三省.

According to the [[Rites of Zhou]] there was no Xuzhou or Liangzhou, instead there were [[Youzhou]] (幽州) and [[Bing (province)|Bingzhou]] (并州), but according to the ''[[Erya]]'' there was no Qingzhou or Liangzhou, instead there was Youzhou (幽州) and Yingzhou (營州).&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt; Either way there were nine divisions.

A number of emperors in imperial times travelled there to perform ceremonies in his honor, notably [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref name="cculture1" /&gt;

==Historicity==
Because no documentary evidence about Yu survives, there is some controversy as to the historicity of the figure. No inscriptions on artifacts dated to the supposed era of Yu, or the later oracle bones, contain any mention of Yu. The first archeological evidence of Yu comes from vessels made about a thousand years after his supposed death, during the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty.

The [[Doubting Antiquity School]] of early 20th-century historians, for example, theorised that Yu was not a person in the earliest legends, but a god or mythical animal, who was connected with water and possibly with the mythical [[Dragon King]]s and their control over water. According to this theory, Yu (as god or animal) was represented on ceremonial bronzeware by the early Xia people, and by the start of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the legendary figure had morphed into the first man, who could control water, and it was only during the Zhou Dynasty that the legendary figures that now precede Yu were added to the orthodox legendary lineage. According to the Chinese legend Yu the Great was a man-god.

Archaeological evidence of a large outburst flood on the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BCE. This coincides with new cultures all along the Yellow River. The water control problems after the initial flooding could plausibly have lasted for some twenty years. Wu et al. suggest that this supports the idea that the stories of Yu the Great may have originated from a historical person.&lt;ref&gt;Outburst flood at 1920 BCE supports historicity of China’s Great Flood and the Xia dynasty.
