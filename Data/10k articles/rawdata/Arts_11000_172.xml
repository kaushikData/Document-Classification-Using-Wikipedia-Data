'''Adina Bar-On''' ({{lang-he|עדינה בר-און}}), born December 19, 1951, in Kibbutz [[Kfar Blum]], Israel, is a pioneer [[performance artist]], considered to be the first performance artist in Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Active for four decades, Bar-On's work continuously explores the relationship between [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and presence, and most importantly "conflict of identity and conflicting identities".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smfa.edu/news/show/title/ADINA-BAR-ON&lt;/ref&gt; Her performances consist of unique use of human body and voice expression, close to modern dance and experimental sound techniques. Adina's work emphasizes strong connection of art and non-structural ethics of behavior, and introduces it by activating audience's high levels of attention and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;see: Idit Porat, Adina Bar-On, Performance Artist, the Herzliya Museum of Art, 2001, p.124-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Bar-On began her first performances in the early 1973 as a third year student at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. Bar-On is now a performance art teacher at Bezalel Academy's Visual Arts Department. Bar-On studied to become a painter, although was deeply involved in [[conceptual art]] movement. Her early performances took place when the notion of "performance" as a medium of art expression was not yet known in Israel. Her first performances were still called "shows"and the invitations for these events were only saying her name, time and place of the event. Those days most art critics considered performance to be a junk-art, this genre of art was not understood nor [[Process art|acknowledged by art historians and critics]].

==Controversy==
After the first performance at the courtyard of Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem, Bar-On was asked to stop doing this kind of things and academy professors called a school psychologist to examine the performer and to express professional opinion about the work. After the second performance, "Birds" (June–July 1973), Adina received a warning letter from the directors on te Academy, informing that if she wants to continue to study she has to go back to conventional mediums.&lt;ref&gt;see: Porat, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family Background==
Bar-On's parents were [[Zionism|Zionist]] American Jews who came to Israel at the beginning of this state, to set a country for a free nation to live in their own state (not in a ghetto in other nations' state). They did not come from Europe and did not escape from after-[[Holocaust]] Germany or Eastern Europe, but from free country of USA. Adina Bar-On was born in [[kibbutz]], and after some years in Israel went to America to go to secondary school. She later conceptualized her identity status in a talk "Is my Performance an Israeli Culture Manifestation?" in 2011 at Dar al- Kalima College of Art, [[Bethlehem]].

==Influences==
At the Bezalel Academy (then in the center of Jerusalem, now on the [[Mount Scopus]]) Adina was focused on painting and studied [[conceptual art]], which was becoming the most important approach in contemporary practice. During the seventies she was interested mostly in new forms of [[communication in art|communication art]] and her work was influenced by American happenings, [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], the new theater (as defined by Michael Kirby),  [[Vito Acconci]].

Bar-On found inspiration for her aesthetics in film, precisely in [[Giulietta Masina|Giulietta Masina's]] actors work, as well as in the new manner introduced by Fellini, Antonioni and Godard of seeing film-life (art-life) relationship problem.
She studied dance for some time and experimented with mime (an episode in Swiss mime actor and clown [[Dimitri (clown)|Dimitri]] in 1976 at the Dimitri School of Theatre, Vercio, Switzerland).

During these years Adina worked as therapeutist, social worker, gave courses for school art teachers, as well as performed in many different contexts: at the industry for workers, old people's houses, nurseries, private homes.
Her work was described as "strong" and "subtle" at the same time (her name, "Adina Bar-On", in Hebrew means "delicate with power") and some people recognized her new aesthetics, exceptional way of creating art as a means of human communication.

She was 23 years old when she decided to complete her academic diploma at the Bezalel despite the professors' "advice" to quit making performances, and she prepared a special, highly [[Conceptual photography|conceptual photographic work]] (black and white photographs of her color, post-expressionist paintings hung on the walls of a middle class conservative Israeli living room of her mother's house). This work already signaled some of the subjects she will be exploring later: public and private, black-and-white and color, representation and performance.

In 1974 Adina Bar-On married Daniel Davis, a [[pottery|potter]] and author of Judaica art, with whom she later often worked on some of her performances (ex. A Woman of the Pots), and made her private life a subject of the art work. Their children, Shahar Davis and Yasmin Davis, were also engaged in the preparation of "Woman of the Pots". 
Bar-On wrote in 2000 about a necessity and ethical motivation of her work: "I felt that art was losing its connection with what characterizes the human being, the ability to connect intellect with emotions".&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected performances==

==="Performance", 1973===
Adina's first performance took place in the plaza of old Bezalel Academy building, in early May 1973. Going beyond contemporary aesthetics, risking social position and artistic status, extending possibilities of communication - all these interpretations of Adina Bar-On's early performance places it on the border between avant-garde art and post-artistic performance art practice.&lt;ref&gt;described by Jerzy Ludwinski in: Jerzy Ludwiński, "Epoka Błękitu" (The Epoch of Blue), Pracownia Otwarta, Krakow 2003, {{ISBN|83-89280-05-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An incident of being mistaken for a mentally ill by Academy professors (other artists, see: section "Controversy"), showed Bar-On that her performance was indeed touching a deep level of human psyche of the audience and caused an aesthetic shock of a certain kind. At the time, most of the interpretations of art history, even aware of [[anti-psychiatric]] movement in Europe, psychoanalytical writings about [[Antonin Artaud]], experience with [[surrealism]], [[counterculture]] movement, Beuys's idea of [[social sculpture]] etc., were only taken intellectually, and misunderstood. Adina's experiment was recognized by the audience: "Very, very strong. (...) I am stired by the approach which I think should guide all of us - to touch the truth, and not in all kinds of formal, aesthetic, etc., pseudo-intellectiuallism. I don't know what art is, for I've heard from "professional connoisseurs" that this is not art. ( ... ) And I don't care if it is or it is not  if art does touch upon these problems but in a different way that enables distance, form, material, causality, inner logic (formal as well)." (Fragments of a letter Adina Bar-On received after the performance).&lt;ref&gt;Porat, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Walking On a Thin Line", 1979===
In this performance was prepared in collaboration with Ronit Land (Israeli dancer and choreographer, disciple of [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Anna Halprin]]) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dancevoices.com/index.php/he/the-dance-voices-team/160-dr-ronit-land&lt;/ref&gt; as movement consultant. It was performed at The Israel Museum of Art, Jerusalem, as well as at the Tel-Hai '80, a contemporary art event.

==="Salute", 1983===
Working in a collaboration with Ronit Land, this time Bar-On prepared a theatrical performance, moving on the edge of modern dance, theatre expression and performance art. Daniel Davis's environmental design was introduced. The premiere took place at Tel Hai, 83, Contemporary Art Event.

==="On Getting High", 1986===
"Getting high" as a goal of theater and ritual throughout the ages, the idea of inexpressible, were motifs of this six scenes of movement-play performance. Musical part of the performance involved early computer-based composition (using 3 connected synthesiser) composed by Yossi Marchaim and wordless vocalization of Adina and Robert Flantz.

==="Woman of the Pots", 1990–1991===
One of Bar-On's masterpieces, combining image, movement/dance and voice interplay. Originally performed In 1990 performance was filmed by [[Naomi Perlov]] and screened at Israel Museum. Playing with an important Israeli iconographical motive, "Woman of the Pots" was a most important collaboration with Daniel Davis.

==== Leaving "Acconci dilemma" ====
At this phase of Bar-On's development an important methodological change was: leaving art as conceptual art, and leading towards contextual art (everyday life questions raised to be subjects of the art). Saying that she left "the Acconci [[Vito Acconci]] dilemma" in performance art, Bar-On emphasised the need for new approach in performance art, where strong relations between art and life should be introduced when talking about live-art paradigm.

===''Breath'', 1994===
Performed in The Tel Aviv Museum of Art [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]. Video work for the performance was prepared by Alon Eilat.
&lt;ref&gt;Invitiation for the performance leaflet, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sacrifice", 1991===
Based on an experimental voicework (recorded and mastered later in ToTamTo Studios, Warsaw),&lt;ref&gt;Recording of voicework for "Sacrifice": https://soundcloud.com/jan-taki-jaki-jest/adina-bar-on-voicework&lt;/ref&gt; "Sacrifice" is a turning point in Bar-On's aesthetics and an example of highly sophisticated work using voice, body and image of the body. Voice is a leading creative element of not only expressing, but first of all transforming emotions (like pain) in the work of art.

A documentary film was made from the performance in Quimper, France, witnessing Adina's visit at the Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper.

Subtle level of communication is crucial for  Bar-On's performances, working with "quantum level" of emotions. Laszlo Beke (director of Research Institute of Art History,  Hungarian Academy of Science) wrote on "Sacrifice": "At the beginning after an intensive internal meditation she faced the audience (or one of its members) and waited, doing nothing, until this nothing ("tense nothing") became nearly unendurable. This is a kind of address that prepares the audience mentally and spiritually for the reception of forthcoming events".

"I'm engaged in tikkun, not from above, but in a language that everybody understands. Empathy to yourself. If you don't love and it's difficult for you now, at least have empathy."- wrote Bar-On in her autobiographical essay "A Soliloquy". "Sacrificed was performed for ten years in places including the Kuhsthalle, Budapest, Catalyst Arts Gallery: Belfast,  Para/Site Art Space: Hong-Kong,  Chasama Arts Space: New York.

==="Rest", 1999–2005===
As Bar-On described it later: "Rest is a paraphrase of a popular and old Israeli lullaby that has become mythological – "Rest For The Weary". In the Shopping Mall, Opera House [[Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center]] and Central Bus Station suspended in a vertical elevated bed, way above the heads of passers by, I move as if in a state of sleep. As in a dream, out of the subconscious, I create images by my movement and my own vocal adaptation of the old Jewish Pioneer’s song.

Placing myself in these locations I had become a provocation but more than that an image of a plea or a cry for time-out, for rest, detached from ideological idioms".&lt;ref&gt;Artist's description of the performance, available at Adina Bar-On's Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="About Love", 2004===
In ''About Love'' (close to previous "Vision") the performer was the creator of the image, and at the same time emanating certain "aura", direct communication with the audience, often felt as intervention in an intimate level of viewer's psyche, although he/she was a stranger or a passer-by. This performance was described by Bar-On's biographer, Idit Porat, as "transforming suffering into beauty".

In discussing this phase of her performance history, Adina has said: "II want to put questions of emotion on the pyre. I think this is an acute issue. I think it is what is lacking, not alienated discussions."&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 135&lt;/ref&gt;
The form of Bar-On's performances always explored delicacy, subtlety of meaning, allusions, conxeptualism, intellectual poetry, intellectual and spiritual signals going beyond symbolic levels of interpretation. In 2005, after a work "Dreamy", As Bar-On described it: "Emotions can be a material, it is my material. What do people usually do with emotions?"&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==="40x40/Sentenced to Life"===
(lacking description)

==="Disposition", Performance Series 2001-2010===
This site-specific performance  is structured to be a journey or a walk through urban space, where Bar-On, dressed in red, is a  guide or a leader. Playing with this motif of a woman leadership and multiple meanings of space when observed through artist's eyes, mostly the borders, no-mans land's, areas of former conflicts or places of "hidden history" to be reveiled.

"Dispositions" were performed in Nachshon, Israel; Hong-Kong; Quimper, France; Helsinki, Finland; Toronto, Canada; Belfast, Northern Ireland, Oswiecim (city of Auschwitz) and Lublin, Poland.

==="Sacred", 2011-2012 and "NO MATTER", 2013 ===
After Daniel Davis's death in 2010, the artist sharpened her massage and became more direct in performance art communication process. Making performances for no more than 30 people, she focused on building strong mental contact with each spectator/witness through all channels of human expression, but now transgressing symbolism and conceptual methods. This almost "mystical strategy", [[Apophasis|apophatic]] method is now extending [[existentialism|existentialist]] implications of Bar-On's art and use of pre-expressive level in performance.&lt;ref&gt;see: entry "Pre-expressivity": "The Secret Art of Performer. A Dictionary of Theater Anthropology", ed. Eugenio Barba, Nicola Savarese, Center of Performance Research (Cardiff), Routledge (London-New York)&lt;/ref&gt;

==New ways of creating engaged art==
To create new performances in the mid-2010s, Bar-On merged everyday life situation with social symbolism, religious iconography, dream visions and mass media images. From this time Israeli and Palestinian dialogue is often a subject of the artist's work, as well as is Bar-On's own private life themes which are transported into performance art; ex. widows of the war on both sides of the conflict - Adina Bar-On's husband, Daniel Davis, died of brain tumour caused by military service in the Israeli Army. For five years he was able to express himself only by saying  "Lo!" ("No!" in Hebrew).

Starting from early performances shown at the time of [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, through 1989 when Bar-On conducted a workshop at "The Peace Frontier. International Symposium for Sculpture and  Painting", the performer is active in transporting her main subject of art - "conflict of identity and conflicting identities" - into constant [[existentialism|existential]]  practice.

Engaged in politics of the body, social role and gender from the very beginnings of her career in the 1970s, give Adina Bar-On a significant (although unconventional) role in [[feminism|feminist art]].

==Relationships and art==
Bar-On is a close friend of major performance artists and thinkers: [[Jan Swidzinski]], [[Zbigniew Warpechowski]], [[Boris Nieslony]], [[Marlyn Arsem]], with whom she is often meeting on art festivals and developed an informal group of performance artists who create [[contextual art]] in uncompromising way, with no support of the "art world" establishment, yet recognized and respected by its representatives. Her intent on working on a most fundamental level of human communication changed Bar-On's relationships with other artists and non-artists into live-art itself.

==Festivals==
As a performer Bar-On presented her work on the most important performance art festivals in the world, including  Blurr, Biennale of Performance Art: Jaffa/Tel-Aviv (many times under curatorship of Sergio Edelstein), Israel, In the Context of Art/ Differences: Warsaw, Interaction Festival: [[Piotrków Trybunalski]], Asiatopia International Performance Festival; Bangkok,  Social Art Forum: Paris, Epipederme / Performance Art event, Lisbon, Portugal, Tupada Action and Media Art, 2009/The 6th Tupada International Visual Performance Festival; Manila, Philippines, Asiatopia, International Performance Art Festival; Bangkok, Chiangmai, Thailand, Navinki 2001, Performance-Art Festival: Minsk, Belarus, International Performance Art Festival, "Castle of Imagination": Ustka-Slupsk, Poland, Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper, France, The 5th Asian Performance Art Series + Shinshu Summer Seminar 2000: Macau, Hong-Kong, and Negoya, Tokyo, Nagano in Japan, and many others.

==Later work and educational projects==
Early in her career Adina Bar-On started to teach and worked on various art educational projects focused on the language of [[visual communication]] and live-art. She has been giving numerous workshops in Israel (including Tel Aviv University, Kalisher Art School, Camera Obscura School of Art, School of Visual Theater Jerusalem, el-Hai College, Omanut La'am Art Education Organization, Holon School For The Education of Technology, Dar al- Kalima College of Art, The Academy od Dance and Music Jerusalem, [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]],  Yasmin Goder Dance Group) as well as around the world as visiting professor: at the Wroclaw Art Academy, Oswiecim Jewish Center (at the [[Oświęcim Synagogue]], [[Mobius Center in Boston|Mobius Artists Group]],  Performance Art Conference: Essen, Braunschweig University/ Department of Fine Arts, Germany, and workshop leader: Arsenal Gallery in Bialystok, Wei Wei Dance Company, Hong Kong).

One of recent major projects, such as "Aesthetics and Bias" involve institutions such as [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel Academy]], [[Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Fine Arts]] in Wrocław, [[University of Fine Arts in Poznań]], [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Warsaw Academy]], [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]], to work together in a process of developing new aesthetics.

==Adina Bar-On on film==
Starting with the performance based film "A Woman of the Pots", Bar-On prepared a number of films and [[video installation]] which are important for understanding her approach to the art: "Portrait" (1999), "View" (2001) (as an aftermath of a performance under the same name), "Room" and "Motherland" (both in 2001). 
A relationship between live-art and film/video image was already explored in "Breath" (1994) and possibly this performance leaves a trace of what the artist thinks about film representation of live-art.

Bar-On played an important role in [[Amos Gitai]] 1990 film "Birth of a Golem" (Naissance d'un golem: Carnet de notes),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=47&amp;lang=1&lt;/ref&gt; giving an expressive improvised performance in the movie, and appearing on a screen in the moment when the story of a Golem is told. She also helped to direct [[Annie Lennox]] in her role as Golem's figure in the cave scene.

Adina Bar-On's full documentation of work on film in now hosted by The Art of Action Archives, organization focused on anthropological research and preservation of performance art masterpieces.

==Students' work==
During the years of teaching about visual communication, Bar-On managed to contact young artists of different sensitivity and working on future aesthetics of a new era. Still not theoretically described nor defined aesthetics of Bar-On is an inspiration for new generation of artists.

The '''Baptistery of Albenga''' is a paleochristian religious structure in [[Albenga]],  province of Savona, in the region of [[Liguria]] of northern [[Italy]]. It is an example of 5th-century late-[[Ancient Roman]] architecture with mosaic decoration, and stands adjacent to the [[Albenga Cathedral]] of San Michele Arcangelo.

==Description==
Inscriptions date construction to the 5th century under a Flavio Costanzo. The layout is that of a decagon with an octagonal drum. The building still retains an octagonal baptismal font and 6th century mosaics with allegorical symbols of Christ such as the [[Labarum]] (Chi - Rho) and the [[Alpha and Omega]]. The walls have traces of 15th-century frescoes. The interior houses two [[Lombards|Lombard]] burial monuments. The original foundations are lower than the present one. The roof was remodeled and replaced in 1898 by a wooden structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.albenga.sv.it/servizi/Menu/dinamica.aspx?idSezione=152&amp;idArea=153&amp;idCat=2738&amp;ID=2740&amp;TipoElemento=categoria Comune of Albenga], entry on baptistery.&lt;/ref&gt; The baptistery is now part of the town Museo Diocesano&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amei.biz/musei/museo-diocesano-di-albenga-e-battistero-paleocrist Museo Diocesano official site].&lt;/ref&gt;

The niche with late-Roman Empire Christian mosaics depicts an Alpha-Omega within three concentric circles symbolizing the Trinity, and surrounded by 12 doves symbolizing the apostles who disseminated the teachings under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Finally two sheep stand in a field around a cross. The Latin inscription of the arch recalls relics held in the church.

'''''All About Anna''''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] film released in 2005, directed by [[Jessica Nilsson]] and starring [[Gry Bay]] and Mark Stevens. The film is explicit in its exploration of sexual relationships.

It is a co-production between [[Innocent Pictures]] and [[Lars von Trier]]'s [[Zentropa|Zentropa Productions]], and is the third of Zentropa's sex films for women, following ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998) and ''[[Pink Prison]]'' (1999). All three films were based on the Puzzy Power Manifesto developed by Zentropa in 1997.

== Plot ==
''All About Anna'' tells the story of Anna ([[Gry Bay]]), a single woman who seeks to maintain an active sex life while staying clear of emotional involvement, after having been jilted by the love of her life, Johan (Mark Stevens). She has a relationship with Frank (Thomas Raft), but refuses to let him move in with her. When Johan shows up again after five years absence, she starts wondering how much longer she can maintain her emotional independence, and if that is what she wants. She has sex with him, loses his telephone number and cannot contact him. She ends her affair with Frank and when she is offered a job as costume designer in a French theatre, she decides to move to [[Paris]]. She leaves her flat to her flatmate Camilla ([[Eileen Daly]]) who asks her permission to rent out the now empty room to a friend of hers. This friend turns out to be Johan, and Anna meets him as she leaves for Paris, where the local stage actors Pierre ([[Morten Schelbech]]) and Sophie ([[Ovidie]]) offer new amorous temptations, but she worries about Johan finding a new love. In the end she returns to [[Copenhagen]] and, after mistakenly thinking that Johan has been unfaithful to her, she faces her fears of commitment and is reunited with Johan.

== Release and distribution ==

The film was originally released in November 2005 on a Scandinavian 3-disc DVD. This was the first Danish pornographic film to be released with subtitles for the hearing-impaired, which was enthusiastically received by the deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doevblevne.dk/meddelelser/artikler_meddelelser/Diverse/porno-for-doeve.htm |title=Døvblevne Forum: 'Porno for døve og hørehæmmede!' |publisher=Doevblevne.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deaf.dk/system/files/Doevebladet_december_2006.pdf |title=Døvebladet 12.06.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US theatrical premiere was held on January 18, 2007, in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where it was included in the series ''Cinematic Sexualities in the 21st Century'', arranged by [[Doc Films]] in collaboration with [[The University of Chicago]] Film Studies Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2007/01/09/from-socialists-to-cineasts-doc-celebrates-75-years/|title=From socialists to cineasts, Doc celebrates 75 years|date=9 January 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Doc-Films-Presents-U-S-Theatrical-Premiere-of-i-All-About-Anna-i-29662.html|title=AVN - Doc Films Presents U.S. Theatrical Premiere of ''All About Anna''|first=David Sullivan,|last=AVN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-disc US DVD was released on January 29, 2008.

''All About Anna'' was officially selected for [[Zurich Film Festival]] and [[Io Isabella International Film Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zff.com/en/programme/movies/3115/all-about-anna/|title=All About Anna - Zurich Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ioisabellafilmweek/295638850/|title=Festival Café|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, it was released theatrically in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as a double bill with [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'' (also a [[Zentropa]]-film with sexually explicit images).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kpn.dk/film/article1823790.ece |title="Antichrist" og porno vises sammen |publisher=KPN.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and awards==
In 2006 it was nominated for two EroticLine Awards in the categories Best International Newcomer ([[Gry Bay]]) and Best International Actor (Mark Stevens).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 2007 it won three Scandinavian Adult Awards, including Best Scandinavian Couples Film, Best Scandinavian Actor ([[Thomas Raft]]) and Best Selling Scandinavian Star of 2006 ([[Gry Bay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/i-All-About-Anna-i-Wins-Three-Scandinavian-Adult-Awards-30409.html|title=AVN - ''All About Anna'' Wins Three Scandinavian Adult Awards|first=Vance Kingsley,|last=AVN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Germany's biggest weekly magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' identified women's pornography as one of 50 trends, placed an image from ''All About Anna'' on the cover of its cultural supplement ''Stern Journal'', and commented:

{{Quotation|"Women too like to see other people having sex. What they don't like is the endless close-ups of hammering bodyparts without a story. Lars von Trier is the first to have realized this and produced valuable quality porn films for women."|Stern #40, 27.9.2007&lt;ref&gt;Stern #40, 27.9.2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book ''Secrets of Porn Star Sex'' (Infinite Ideas, 2007), British author [[Marcelle Perks]] includes a chapter on female-friendly porn, in which she concludes: "Rather than being intimidated by porn, do a bit of research and find something that you can have fun with. An ideal introduction movie is the hit film ''All About Anna'', a mainstream film that features real sex".

In April 2008, the U.S. trade journal ''[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]'' gave the film an AAAAA Editor's Choice Review. It was one of only four films to receive the journal's highest rating that month. Critic [[Jared Rutter]] wrote:

{{Quotation|"It is beautifully crafted and constantly entertaining. [...] The question is, why can't mainstream American films move on up to this grown-up degree of sexual explicitness? Retailing: This title can be sold as either mainstream or adult–the best of both worlds."|Jared Rutter|AVN Magazine, April 2008&lt;ref&gt;AVN Magazine, April 2008, page 154: ''Editor's Choice&amp;nbsp;– All About Anna''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In May 2008, French trade journal ''[[Hot Vidéo]]'' #208 placed ''All About Anna'' highest in the category "la crème du porno feminine".&lt;ref&gt;Hot Video, nr. 208 (May 2008), page 110-119: ''Réalisatrices la nouvelle vague''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Danish lifestyle magazine ''Woman'' #112 had asked a group of female readers to rate a selection of erotic product, including books, websites, CDs etc. The highest score went to ''All About Anna''.&lt;ref&gt;Woman, nr. 112 (May 2008), page 66-68: ''Porno for pæne piger''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the trade journal ''AVN Europe'' gave the film an 8 out of 10 rating, and wrote:

{{Quotation|"A good couples' flick for those who like a nice storyline. [...] Visually and musically, the movie is also well made and the packaging includes two extra discs with additional material such as an alternative version, outtakes and bloopers. So all in all, a good movie for couples and perhaps, dare I say it, a good movie for guys wanting to turn their wife/girlfriend on to saucy DVD pleasures."|Angel Swede|AVN Europe, June 2008&lt;ref&gt;Angel Swede: DVD Reviews, AVN Europe, June 2008, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Anne Whateley''' is the name given to a woman who is sometimes supposed to have been the intended wife of [[William Shakespeare]] before he married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]. Most scholars believe that Whateley never existed, and that her name in a document concerning Shakespeare's marriage is merely a [[clerical error]]. However, several writers on Shakespeare have taken the view that she was a real rival to Hathaway for Shakespeare's hand. She has also appeared in imaginative literature on Shakespeare and in [[Shakespeare authorship question|Shakespeare authorship]] speculations. Shakespeare's biographer Russell A. Fraser describes her as "a ghost", "haunting the edges of Shakespeare's story".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Fraser, ''Shakespeare: A Life in Art'', Transaction Publishers, 2007, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been called "the first of the Shakespearean Dark Ladies".&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Brown and George Fearon, ''Amazing monument : a short history of the Shakespeare industry'', Heinemann, 1939, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Whateley's existence has been deduced from an entry in the Episcopal register at [[Worcester]] which states in Latin "Anno Domini 1582...Novembris...27 die eiusdem mensis. Item eodem die supradicto emanavit Licentia inter Wm Shaxpere et Annam Whateley de Temple Grafton." The entry states that a marriage licence has been issued to Shakespeare and Anne Whateley to marry in the village of [[Temple Grafton]]. The day afterwards, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], signed a [[surety]] of £40 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of "William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey".&lt;ref name = "sam"&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life'', Oxford University Press, 1977, pp.84-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Chambers, ''William Shakespeare: A Study of the Facts and Problems'', Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.41-42. The marriage was registered in Worcester because William had killed someone important[[Anglican Diocese of Worcester]], which included southern Warwickshire.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry in the register was discovered in the late nineteenth century by Reverend T.P. Wadley. Various explanations were offered. Initially it was assumed that Whateley was an alternative surname for Anne Hathaway herself. Wadley believed that it was probably an alias, used by Hathaway in order to keep the date of the marriage secret to obscure the fact that she was already pregnant. Another suggestion was that Anne Hathaway might legitimately have used the name, either because her father Richard Hathaway was in fact her step-father, her mother having previously been married to a man called Whateley, or because Anne herself may have previously been married to a man named Whateley.&lt;ref name = "gray"&gt;Joseph William Gray, ''Shakespeare's Marriage: His Departure from Stratford and Other Incidents in His Life'', Chapman and Hall, 1905, pp.13-18; 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; None of these suggestions gained support, since they contradicted other existing evidence.

[[File:Whateley note.JPG|thumb|left|The names of Shakespeare and Whateley in the note in the Episcopal register at Worcester]]
The Whateley note is discussed in [[Sidney Lee]]'s 1898 book ''A Life of William Shakespeare''. Lee argues that the "William Shakespeare" who is engaged to Whateley is probably a different person from the playwright, as there were "numerous William Shakespeares, who abounded in the diocese of Worcester".&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, ''A life of William Shakespeare'', 1915 edition, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Joseph William Gray in ''Shakespeare's Marriage'' gave a detailed argument for clerical error due to the existence of lawsuits involving Whateleys that were being written up by the same scribe.&lt;ref name = "gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ing&gt;William Ingram, ''The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London'', Cornell University Press, 1992, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; However in 1909 [[Frank Harris]] in his book ''The Man Shakespeare'' ignored Gray's argument and dismissed Lee's suggestion that there were two William Shakespeares as wildly implausible. He insisted that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two separate women.  He intended to marry Anne Whateley, but, when this became known, he was immediately forced by Anne Hathaway's family to marry their relative, since he had already made her pregnant. Harris believed that Shakespeare despised his wife, and that his forced marriage was the spur to his creative work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Shakespeare had married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play. Shakespeare's hatred of his wife and his regret for having married her were alike foolish. Our brains are seldom the wisest part of us. It was well that he made love to Anne Hathaway; well, too, that he was forced to marry her; well, finally, that he should desert her. I am sorry he treated her badly and left her unsupplied with money; that was needlessly cruel; but it is just the kindliest men who have these extraordinary lapses; Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harris, ''The Man Shakespeare'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2007, (reprint) p.362. Harris's spelling "Whatley" with one "e" is followed by several other authors, sometimes with the "e" before the "l". However, "Whateley" is the most common form of the name.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some biographers, notably [[Ivor Brown]] and [[Anthony Burgess]], followed Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown argued that she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold kidskin cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. Something, perhaps, quite different from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.&lt;ref name = "sam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Burgess, ''Shakespeare'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1970, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Stanley Wells]] in the ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', most modern scholars take the same view as Gray, that the name Whateley was "almost certainly the result of clerical error".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells, "Whateley, Anne". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p.185; p.518. See also Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: a life'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have arisen because the clerk was also recording information about a tithe appeal by a vicar, which included a reference to a person named Whateley.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levi, ''The Life and Times of William Shakespeare'', London: Macmillan, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a Whateley family in the area, no independent evidence has ever been found of the existence of an Anne Whateley in Temple Grafton or anywhere else nearby. As for Lee's claim that there were "numerous" other William Shakespeares in the diocese, later researchers have found no surviving records of any other William Shakespeares of marriageable age in the diocese of Worcester.&lt;ref name = ing/&gt;

==Authorship speculations==
{{main|Shakespeare authorship question}}
After Harris's initial argument a number of imaginative claims were made about Anne Whateley, most dramatically that she was the true author of Shakespeare's works. This argument was made by William Ross in his book ''The Story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere'' (1939),&lt;ref name = "quart"&gt;''Shakespeare Quarterly'', 1950-1, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; in which he asserted that Whateley was a nun who was his "lover and consort in their spiritual union". She was born in 1561, the daughter of the well-known seafarer [[Anthony Jenkinson]]. She was living a secluded life among the nuns of the [[Poor Clares|Order of St. Clare]] when she met Shakespeare. They fell in love, and Anne was about to leave the order to marry him when Hathaway revealed her pregnancy. Her authorship can be deduced from [[Shakespeare's sonnets|the sonnets]], which she wrote as gifts to Shakespeare. They describe the history of her spiritual relationship with him. Hathaway is the [[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the sonnets, while Shakespeare himself is the [[Fair Youth]]. Their intimate friendship continued after his marriage to Hathaway; its deepening spirituality is explored in the later sonnets. Eventually the friendship was broken up by Hathaway's jealousy, and Shakespeare left for London. She wrote ''[[A Lover's Complaint]]'', which was appended to the sonnets, to express Anne Hathaway's point of view.

Whateley wished to dedicate the sonnets to Shakespeare, but wrote the dedication to [[Mr W.H.]] instead of "W.S", so that the identity of her lost love should remain mysterious. "W.H" was preferred because it was the initials of both her own surname and Hathaway's, implying that Shakespeare was, in a sense, both their husbands: Mr W and Mr H. According to Ross, "the initials therefore represent all three, and no better selection was possible".&lt;ref name = "ross"&gt;William Ross,''The story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere as revealed by 'The sonnets to Mr. W.H.' and other Elizabethan poetry'', Holmes, 1939, p.122; p.207&lt;/ref&gt; She gave him the full collection when he left for London, which explains the dedication to the "well-wishing adventurer in setting forth". She later wrote ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' to commemorate their spiritual union.

Ross emphasises that his discovery removes all suggestion of homoeroticism from the sonnets, and thus "the taint of perversion, so odious to all lovers of Shakespeare, has been dissipated". He has very little to say about the plays, but states that Whateley probably wrote Shakespeare's plays to help him make a living. Nevertheless he describes the playwriting as a "collaboration", though Shakespeare's role was probably "passive". Ross portrays Shakespeare himself as a talented writer, a worthy assistant to Whateley's "genius". After Anne's death he wrote "The Twenty-First and Last Book of the Ocean, to Cynthia", hitherto attributed to [[Walter Raleigh]].

Ross argues that the sonnets reveal that Whateley also knew [[Edmund Spenser]] and helped him to write ''[[The Shepherd's Calendar]]''. She was also the sole author of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[Amoretti]]''. In the 1580s she met and helped [[Michael Drayton]] and [[Philip Sidney]], probably inspiring the sonnet revival of the period. The poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', usually attributed to [[Christopher Marlowe]], describes her relationship with Shakespeare. She also wrote Marlowe's plays. After her death in 1600 her unpublished works were published in the book ''Poetical Rhapsody'', attributed to "A.W."&lt;ref name = "ross"/&gt;

Ross's speculations were developed by his friend W.J. Fraser Hutcheson in his book ''Shakespeare's Other Anne'' (1950).&lt;ref name ="hut"&gt;W.J. Fraser Hutcheson, ''Shakespeare's Other Anne: a short account of the life and works of Anne Whateley or Beck, a Sister of the Order of St. Clare, who nearly married William Shakespeare in November 1582 A.D.'', William MacLellan, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; He follows Ross's claim that Whateley's father was Jenkinson, adding that Whateley's real name was Elizabeth Anne Beck and that her mother was an Anne Beck who died in childbirth. She used the name Whateley because of the household in which she grew up. Falling in love with Shakespeare, she was broken-hearted when he married Hathaway. She fled to Italy, where she acquired the knowledge that would later be used in Shakespeare's Italian plays. Many of her works were published under the name "Ignotus".&lt;ref name = "quart"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="hut"/&gt; Hutcheson also claims to have identified a portrait of Whateley, the work of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the several copies of which attest to the esteem in which she was held. Hutcheson suggests that Whateley is portrayed as Rosalind and other female characters in Shakespeare's plays. While insisting that she inspired the plays, he does not explicitly assert that she wrote them.

Neither Ross nor Hutcheson provide documentary evidence to support their theories.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Boas, ''The Year's Work in English Studies'', Vol. XXXI, 1950, OUP, 1952, p.113; George L. McMichael, Edgar M. Glenn, ''Shakespeare and his rivals: a casebook on the authorship controversy'', Odyssey Press, 1962, p.145ff&lt;/ref&gt; Ross relies on his readings of the poems while Hutcheson finds coded messages in texts and images. The portrait he identifies as Whateley is generally believed to depict the courtier and poet Girolamo Casio.&lt;ref name = "pea"/&gt; It is  attributed to [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]], rather than Anguissola, and its likely depiction of Casio was accepted long before he wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Herbert Baily 
(ed), ''The Connoisseur'', 1908, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of other alternative authorship theories have also used Frank Harris' version of the Anne Whateley story, typically to portray Shakespeare as a duplicitous scapegrace, traits which are supposed to disqualify him as an author of great poetry.&lt;ref&gt;H. N. Gibson, ''The Shakespeare Claimants'', Routledge, 2005, pp.41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Frazer, who believed that [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] wrote the canon, argued that Shakespeare actually married Whateley, not Hathaway.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frazer, The Silent Shakespeare, Philadelphia, (1915), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Anne has also appeared in imaginative literature about Shakespeare, typically portrayed as Shakespeare's true love, in contrast to a less appealing Anne Hathaway. Anne appears in [[Hubert Osborne]]'s play ''The Good Men Do'' (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne Hathaway and Anne Whateley. Hathaway is depicted as viciously shrewish and spiteful, in contrast to her noble-minded former rival. Both women portray Shakespeare's life as an actor and playwright as morally degrading, Whateley insisting that he would have been saved from this shameful profession had he married her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/anthology/good_men_do.pdf ''The Good Men Do''.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivor Brown]] also published a play, ''William's Other Anne'' (1947) in which Shakespeare returns from London to meet Anne Whateley eight years after their broken engagement, just as Anne is about to marry a priggish schoolmaster. Shakespeare and Anne are reconciled, and Shakespeare saves his father from bankruptcy at the hands of Anne's vengeful mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Drama: the quarterly theatre review'', Issues 1-15, British Theatre Association, 1946, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was broadcast on BBC television in 1953 starring [[Irene Worth]] as Anne and [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whateley is mentioned in ''Late Mister Shakespeare'' (1998) by [[Robert Nye]], a novel in which an elderly actor who knew Shakespeare in his youth reconstructs the poet's life. He speculates about whether or not she actually existed. She also appears in Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'' (2005), in which she is portrayed as an innocent girl with a "sweet nature", "perfect figure, perfect teeth...perfectly shaped nose, clear blue eyes and creamy skin".&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'', 2005, BeWrite Books, 2005, pp.21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; She is devastated by the discovery that her beloved William has made Hathaway pregnant. She and William are soulmates who plan to work together to improve William's father's leather-making business. Anne hangs herself with a leather rope after the manipulative Hathaway forces Shakespeare to abandon her. The image of his lost love haunts Shakespeare throughout his life. He leaves for London to become a front man for [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s playwriting. He eventually finds a new love who is the mirror image of Whateley.

Laurie Lawlor's novel ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'' (2006) depicts a teenage Shakespeare who seduces willing girls with his wit and charm. He is asked by his friend [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]] to help him woo the beautiful and devout Anne Whateley, but falls in love with her himself. He tries to reform his ways to become worthy of her, but cannot resist his sexual urges, getting Hathaway pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Lawlor, ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'', Holiday House, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karen Harper]]'s novel ''Mistress Shakespeare'' (2008) Anne Whateley is the central character. She is once more portrayed as Shakespeare's true love. She narrates the story of her life as the dusky-skinned daughter of a Stratford businessman and an Italian acrobat. She and Shakespeare are married in a "[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfast]]" ceremony which is known only to them. In London she carries on a secret parallel marriage with him while Hathaway and her children stay in Stratford. She inspires many of his works and shares his feelings, triumphs and fears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karenharperauthor.com/mistress_shakespeare.html Karen Harper's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaic mother''' (primal mother or ''Ur-mutter'') is the mother of earliest infancy, whose continuing influence is traced in [[psychoanalysis]], and whose (repressed) presence is considered to underlie the [[horror film]].

==In psychoanalysis==
[[Sigmund Freud]] recognised in his writings the power of the archaic mother as “first nourisher and first seducer”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Gail S. |editor-last1=Reed |editor-first2=Howard B. |editor-last2=Devine |title=On Freud's "Screen Memories" |date=2015 |publisher=Karnac |location=London |page=98 |isbn=978-1-78220-055-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mS2BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaic mother as seductress became widespread in psychoanalysis in his wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Leticia G. |editor-last1=Fiorini |editor-first2=Graciela Abelin-Sas |editor-last2=Rose |title=On Freud's "femininity" |publisher=Karnac |location=London |date=2010 |page=75 |isbn=978-1-85575-701-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hC5bzLqw02cC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung too was absorbed in his writings by the concept of the archaic mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Coline |editor-last1=Covington |editor-first2=Barbara |editor-last2=Wharton |title=Sabina Spielrein:: Forgotten Pioneer of Psychoanalysis |date=2015 |orig-year=2003 |edition=2nd |page=175 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-81748-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOYjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his followers have warned of the danger of that [[imago]] being re-activated in the [[transference]] by the female therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Polly |editor-last1=Young-Eisendrath |editor-first2=Terence |editor-last2=Dawson |title=The Cambridge Companion to Jung |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-47309-8 |date=1997 |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2t1TWvRYeAC&amp;pg=PA236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Jacques Lacan]], the primitive, untrammelled power of the archaic mother could only be contained by the emergence and consolidation of the [[Oedipus complex|paternal metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Shepherdson |title=Vital Signs: Nature, Culture, Psychoanalysis |publisher=Routledge |date=2000 |page=72 |isbn=0-415-90879-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1iSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist analysts like [[Luce Irigaray]] have subsequently attempted to reclaim the archaic mother as an empowering force for female identity. Sceptics, however, have accepted [[Julia Kristeva]]'s warning about the Utopian, indeed [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] perils of attempting to circumvent society, and the cultural sphere, by regressing to a phantasisised merger with the archaic, undifferentiated mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Margaret |last=Whitfield |title=Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine |publisher=Routledge |date=2014 |isbn=0-415-05968-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fx3HBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva also considered the Jungian approach as a “dead end with its archetypal configurations of libidinal substance taken out of the realm of sexuality and placed in bondage to the archaic mother”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Julia |last=Kristeva |title=Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=1980 |page=276 |isbn=0-231-04806-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2BaPShWHR8C&amp;pg=PA276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Art Gallery of South Australia''' (AGSA), located on the cultural [[boulevard]] of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] in [[Adelaide]], is one of three significant visual arts museums in the [[Australia]]n state of [[South Australia]]. It has a collection of over 38,000 works of art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/About/visit.html Art Gallery of South Australia &gt; Visit] Retrieved 20 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; making it, after the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], the second largest state art collection in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archmedia.com.au/aa/aaissue.php?issueid=199605&amp;article=1&amp;typeon=1&amp;highlight=Adelaide Adelaide: Art Gallery of SA Extensions], ''Architecture Australia'', May/June 1996. Accessed on 2007-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was known as the National Gallery of South Australia until 1967 when the current name was adopted.

The Art Gallery is located adjacent to the [[State Library of South Australia]], the [[South Australian Museum]] and the [[University of Adelaide]]. AGSA is part of [[Adelaide]]'s North Terrace cultural precinct and had 712,994&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/About/docs/Annual_Report_2010_2011.pdf Annual Report of the Art Gallery of South Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; visitors in the year ended 30 June 2011. As well as its permanent collection, AGSA displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/|title=Art Gallery of South Australia :: Exhibitions :: Past Exhibitions|website=www.artgallery.sa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/touring_exhibitions.html AGSA Touring Exhibitions 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103171644/http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Exhibitions/touring_exhibitions.html |date=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gallery was established in 1881 and opened in two rooms of the public library by [[Prince Albert Victor]] and Prince George, later [[George V of Great Britain]]. The present building dates from 1900 and was extended in 1936 and 1962.&lt;ref name =C&amp;M&gt;Barbara Cooper and Maureen Matheson, ''The World Museums Guide'', McGraw-Hill, (1973) {{ISBN|9780070129252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent renovations and a significant extension of the building which opened in 1996 added contemporary display space without compromising the interior of the original Victorian building.

In 2016, the gallery participated in the large "Biennial 2016" art festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adelaidereview.com.au/arts/visual-arts/biennial-2016-a-thread-runs-through-it/ "Biennial 2016: A Thread Runs Through It"]. ''The Art Review'', May 10, 2016 by Annie van der Walt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Art and Documentation''''' ({{lang-pl|Sztuka i Dokumentacja}}) is a scholarly journal on art published in the years 2009-2017 by the Art and Documentation Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.art.pl/ Art and Documentation Association]&lt;/ref&gt; in Lodz (Poland). Since 2018 the journal is published by Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk. It appears twice a year. Scholarly articles are peer-reviewed. All content is published under the Creative Commons licenses. The journal is a platform aiming at shaping views, posing questions and initiating research. It gathers scholars, artists, art critics and curators. ''Art and Documentation'' focuses on works of an ephemeral nature, i.e. conceptual or post-conceptual works and related issues and documentation and documenting of [[contemporary art]] as well as creating art based on documentation. It also publishes [[primary source]]s - gallery timelines, manifestos, artists' statements etc. The journal's aim is to include research on art within the broader field of performance studies, strengthen the relationship between academic research on art and contemporary art practices, and combine theory and practice in a more direct way. This is reflected in the topics presented in the journal and the extended scope of research and methodologies that are becoming more diverse and interdisciplinary.

The '''Baharestan Carpet''', or '''Bahār-e Kasrā''' ({{lang-fa|بهار کسری}}, from [[Middle Persian]] ''Vahār-i Khosrow''; meaning "The spring of [[Khosrow I|Khosrow]]"), also known as '''Farš-e zamestānī''' ("Winter carpet"), and '''Bahārestān''' ("Spring garden"), was a large, late [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] royal carpet, that is now lost, but known from historical accounts. It most likely covered the floor of the great audience hall of [[Taq Kasra]], an [[iwan]] in the Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]]. 

The carpet was 27m long and 27m wide. Woven of silk, gold, silver, and rare stones, the carpet depicted a splendid garden akin to paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Musical Observations, Inc. |url=http://www.musicalobservations.com/recordings/cp2_102.html |title=CP2 102 Morton Feldman &amp; Artur Schnabel |publisher=Musicalobservations.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ctesiphon [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|fell]] to the [[Arabs]] in 637, the carpet was too heavy for the [[Iranian people|Iranians]] to carry away, and which resulted in the carpet being seized by the Arabs. [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]], who led the Arab troops during the capture of Ctesiphon, sent the carpet to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] [[caliph]] [[Umar]], who was in [[Medina]]. There the carpet was cut into small fragments and divided among the Arabs. One of the Arabs who received a piece of the carpet was [[Ali]] who, although he did not receive the best piece, managed to sell it for 20,000 [[dirham]]s.{{sfn|Morony|1988|p=479}}{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985–2007|loc=v. 12: pp. 29-36}}

A '''''crux gemmata''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for: '''jewelled cross''') is a form of [[Christian cross|cross]] typical of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and Early [[Medieval art]], where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] or other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;As on the Cross of Lothair. The Cross of Justin II has silver [[repoussé]] figures on the reverse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples in metalwork are the [[Cross of Justin II]] (6th century, in the [[Vatican Museums]]), the 'crumpled cross' in the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] (8th century), the [[Cross of Lothair]] (10th century, [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]), the Iberian [[Cross of the Angels]] and [[Victory Cross]], and the [[Cross of Cong]] (1120s?, [[National Museum of Ireland]]).

==History of use==
In the [[Late Antique]] and Early Medieval periods, many objects of great significance, such as [[reliquaries]], were studded with jewels in a style that in recent centuries has been restricted to crowns and other [[coronation regalia]] and small pieces of [[jewellery]]. In the case of the cross, such decorative embellishment was especially common, and the jewelled cross is a specific type that was represented in paint, [[mosaic]], carved [[ivory]] and other media. The cross very often has splayed ends to its arms, but the proportions of the vertical axis to the horizontal one depends entirely on the needs of the composition, and varies greatly. [[Pendilia]], or hanging jewels or ornaments, may hang from the arms, especially the letters [[alpha and omega]] shaped in gold. The motif is first seen in a [[sarcophagus]] fragment from the late 4th century; the splayed ends of the arms are present from the earliest examples.&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 100-101. Lateran sarcophagus number 106 is the earliest work.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|The front side of the [[Cross of Lothair]] (ca. 1000 AD)]]
In depictions of the cross, such as that in the mosaic in [[Santa Pudenziana]], Rome (384–9), the jewelled cross stands on a hill or mound with a backdrop of a panoramic view representing [[Jerusalem]], with the cross itself representing the [[New Jerusalem]] or "heavenly city".&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104 and 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelled cross also served as a symbol of the Christian version of the [[Tree of Life]], especially when the arms are shown putting out shoots from their corners. The Staffordshire Hoard 'crumpled cross' has vine leaves showing at the corners and represents Jesus the vine. It is sometimes shown on a mound representing [[paradise]], with four rivers flowing down it (the four rivers were understood as representing the [[Four Gospels]]);&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104; see Hellemo 93, note for an example of the four rivers symbolism.&lt;/ref&gt; a stepped base represents the hill in actual crosses or more confined depictions. The link of the cross generally with the Tree of Life appears frequently in the hymns of [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wernher, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp (2016) has shown the interlace on the front of the Staffordshire Hoard cross corresponds with the river or tree of life described in Revelation 22. 1-2.

For much of the period, a large jewelled cross is recorded as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been built. It was presented by the [[Eastern Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] (reigned 408–450).&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10; Wernher, 36 has further details&lt;/ref&gt; The crux gemmata first appears after what was believed to be the finding of the [[True Cross]] by the [[Helena (Empress)|Empress Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in the early 4th century, when interest in the cross greatly increased. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is clear that the cross was associated with Christians from a very early period, and the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians, it is rarely seen in the earliest Christian art, such as that in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], where there are only about 20 crosses, though the [[anchor]], which appears more commonly, was a disguised cross symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; There was resistance to representations of the cross with the body of Christ on it, a practice that did not begin until the 5th century, becoming more common in the 6th.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at the foot of his. The fierce [[Christology|Christological]] disputes of the period saw the [[Monophysites]], who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced the use of the empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as [[Ravenna]], where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]], another [[heresy|heretical]] force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 108 and 145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In so-called "mystical" images, such as the apse mosaic at the [[Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe]], Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as a symbol for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;See Syndicus, 139–140 and Schiller, I, 148 for slightly different interpretations in detail&lt;/ref&gt; A poem by St [[Paulinus of Nola]] allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St [[Felix of Nola]] at [[Cimitile]] in the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the basilica survives, but not the decorations.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole [[Trinity]] was shown, represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for [[God the Father]] at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a circular frame, so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the [[Holy Spirit]]. At the bottom of the [[semi-dome]] were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed [[Lamb of God]] on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 138-9, with drawing reconstructing the Nola apse. For much more detail, see Hellemo, 90ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solidus Marcian RIC 0509.jpg|thumb|A gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Marcian]], 450–457.]]

The crux gemmata is commonly seen on coins, often held by a figure of Victory, especially in the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See Hellemo, 98-101 for the interplay between imperial imagery of victory and the earliest images of the cross&lt;/ref&gt; Another common Byzantine coin type shows a cross with a stepped base, which should be understood as a ''crux gemmata'' even though scale does not normally allow any indication of gems.

[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Reverse.png|thumb|Victory Cross at the reverse of the [[Curmsun Disc]], Wolin, 980s]]

Contrary to the assertion of [[Dan Brown]] in ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, it probably does symbolize [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and His twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]]. The apse mosaic in the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual to use the term "crux gemmata" for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.

'''''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood''''' (or simply '''''Don't Be a Menace''''') is a 1996 American [[crime film|crime]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[parody film]] directed by [[Paris Barclay]] in his feature film directorial debut, and produced by [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], and also written by Wayans brothers [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]] and [[Marlon Wayans]], who also both starred in the lead roles. The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.

Similar to ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', the film spoofs a number of [[African Americans|African-American]], [[coming-of-age]], [[hood film]]s such as ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever (film)|Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Higher Learning]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[New Jack City]]'', ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', and most prominently ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', ''[[Menace II Society]]'' and ''[[Above the Rim]]''. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.

== Plot ==
Ashtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. At a picnic Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick. While Ashtray and Loc Dog head to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his posse confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint, until Loc Dog threatens them with a missle mounted in the back of his van, stamped with the letters “USSR” Loc Dog claims it is in fact a nuclear device. Toothpick and his gang then flee the scene.

Loc Dog and Ashtray get harassed in a Korean store by the owners and Loc Dog shoots at the owners when a remark is made about his mother. The two are then confronted by 'The Man' (a mysterious white, government figure) who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves.

Meanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins.

Ashtray visits Dashiki where they engage in [[sexual intercourse]] and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpick's posse threatens Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School. This tactic fails as Toothpick performs another drive-by and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog being arrested, and the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned. Ashtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by and he and Loc Dog clash as Ashtray flees and trips and is knocked out as Loc and Toothpick continue to shoot at each other. They are saved when Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car as Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past afterwards toothpick and his gang are arrested.

Afterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes a host and introduces himself with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down and perform sexual intercourse, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had dreamed of, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, "still Grandma" (showing her smoking [[marijuana]]).

==Cast==
* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ashtray, the [[everyman]], trying to make his way through a confusing world, is sent by his mother to live in the [[ghetto]] where his father might teach him how to become a man. Based on Tre Styles from ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' and Caine Lawson from ''[[Menace II Society]]''.
* [[Vivica A. Fox]] as Ashtray's mother, whose one-scene, one-line cameo at the beginning ends with her son asking: "So will I see you again?" and her reply, "Sorry baby. You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies." Based on Reva Devereaux-Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Lahmard Tate as Ashtray's father, Ashtray's temperamental role model who dispenses sage advice to his son. According to Ashtray, he is only "a couple years older than I am." Although many references were made to Ashtray possibly being older than he was, such as Ashtray attending a party that his father is not old enough to attend. Based on Furious Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Loc Dog: Ashtray's cousin and gangsta/drug dealer/criminal. He drives a [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] delivery truck which is loaded in the back with ballistics, including a nuclear weapon. Based on O-Dog from ''Menace II Society'' and Doughboy from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Helen Martin]] as Grandma, Ashtray and Loc Dog's grandmother; a marijuana-smoking, foul-mouthed, church-going woman.
* [[Chris Spencer (actor)|Chris Spencer]] as Preach, Ashtray's friend and former gang member turned 'politically conscious' activist, resembling a [[Nation of Islam]] member, but is now just "confused"; he has a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for white girls. Based on Sharif from ''Menace II Society'' and Ali from ''South Central''.
* [[Suli McCullough]] as Crazy Legs: Ashtray's friend; was paralyzed in a [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by]]. Has a dream to be a professional dancer. Based on Chris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Tracey Cherelle Jones as Dashiki, the object of Ashtray's affections. A "hood mother" with seven kids by seven different men. Dashiki's address is [[69 (sex position)|6969]] [[sexual intercourse|Penetration]] Avenue. Based on Ronnie from ''Menace II Society'' and Justice from ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.
* Isaiah Barnes as Doo Rag: Dashiki's oldest son and the only one of her kids who has more than one line of dialogue. He pulls a gun on Ashtray after losing a video game. When he admits he learned about guns from "cartoons and 'hood movies'", Ashtray passionately declares that he and Doo Rag are an endangered species—not because their lives are in danger, but because "rappers are taking all the good acting jobs!". The kid rolls his eyes as Ashtray lectures him about the values of education. Based on Anthony from ''Menace II Society''
* Darrell Heath as Toothpick, Dashiki's ex-boyfriend, who was just released from prison and still acts like he's incarcerated. He swears he will kill Ashtray for romancing Dashiki. Based on Ferris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Antonio Fargas]] as Old School
* [[Bernie Mac]] as Officer Self Hatred, a cop who harasses Ashtray and Loc Dog. As he has Ashtray pinned against his squad car, he goes on and on about how much he hates black people and anything black. Based on the bully cop from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Terri J. Vaughn]] as Keisha: A possessed woman that Loc Dog met at the late night party and takes to the cargo hold of his truck. While proceeding to have sex with her, she morphs into a demonic version of herself and proceeds to force Loc Dog to have sex with her. It is unknown what happened after this. Based on Abby the 1974 blaxploitation horror film about a woman who is possessed by an African sex spirit.
* Benjamin N. Everitt as The Man, a pale white man with red hair and glasses, who systematically robs a [[convenience store]] while the Korean owners are keeping a close, racist eye on Ashtray and Loc Dog and completely ignore his crimes. When Loc Dog is firing his gun at the owners and not hitting them, The Man fires his gun once and hits a hanging light that falls on the owners and kills them. He then tosses his gun to an unwitting Ashtray and Loc Dog, who mistakenly catch it as he scratches their names off his list of black men whom he's framed for crimes and peels off a single glove (a reference to the [[O.J. Simpson]] case).
* Fozeyl Fuzz Atcha as Dave the Crackhead, a drug user apparently going through withdrawal who offers to perform [[fellatio]] in return for spare change or directions to a person's house. Based on the nameless "Basehead" character from ''Menace II Society''.
* [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] as The Mailman; he appears various times throughout the film shouting "Message!" whenever a moral lesson is expressed without subtlety in dialogue. At the end of the film, when Loc Dog gives a rambling speech to Ashtray, the Mailman appears, and says, "What the fuck is he talking about?"
*[[LaWanda Page]] as Old School's mom

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">The '''''Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario''''' ("International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario") is an artistic event celebrated every year, since 1993, in [[Rosario]], [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. It is organized by the Sculptors Association of Rosario.

This event is attended by sculptors from Argentina and a number of other countries, and lasts about a week. It is always celebrated outdoors and before the eyes of the public. The artists must work on a roughly 180&amp;times;50 cm trunk, or an irregular-shaped stone over 0.25 m³, or pieces of [[iron]], in order to create a sculpture. Stone and iron works are then placed in public places of the city.

Directed by [[Aisling Walsh]], it stars [[Sally Hawkins]], [[Imelda Staunton]], [[Elaine Cassidy]], [[Rupert Evans]] and [[Charles Dance]].&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

The mini-series was nominated for Best Drama Serial at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2006|2006 British Academy Television Awards]].

==Plot==
The lives of two young women collide in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England when a group of thieves concoct an elaborate scam to defraud a young heiress of her inheritance. The story alternates between the twisting back alleyways of Dickensian [[London]] and the cloistered gloom of a Gothic mansion in 1862.

===Part One===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MaudeSue.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Elaine Cassidy]] as Maud Lilly &amp; [[Sally Hawkins]] as Sue Trinder]] --&gt;
Since she was orphaned, Sue Trinder ([[Sally Hawkins]]) has been brought up amongst thieves and [[charlatan]]s. She has been protected and cared for by Mrs Sucksby ([[Imelda Staunton]]) and taught to become a fingersmith (a pickpocket). But when Mrs Sucksby's old friend Richard Rivers ([[Rupert Evans]]), known as Gentleman, offers 20-year-old Sue £2,000 to assist him in one of his scams, she cannot resist.

Passing himself off as a proper gent, Rivers has befriended a young lady, Maud Lilly ([[Elaine Cassidy]]), who stands to inherit a fortune when she marries. However, Maud's maid has recently left her service and, without a chaperone, Rivers' access to Maud is limited. He wants Sue to be accepted as the new maid and to help him win Maud over. Once married, Rivers plans to have Maud committed to an asylum and he will then take her fortune for himself.

Arriving at Briar, the estate where Maud lives with her wealthy bookish Uncle Lilly ([[Charles Dance]]), Sue enters another world. Maud and Sue are of a similar age and appearance but their experience of life couldn't be further apart. Maud's existence is one of wealth and prosperity inside a grand house, where she is her uncle's secretary and also has the duty of reading to her uncle and his friends. Over the course of a few months, Sue and Maud become friends and, briefly, lovers. Despite Sue's growing feelings for Maud, she is convinced to proceed with Rivers' scam. On Sue's advice, Maud accepts Rivers' proposal of marriage as a way of gaining her freedom from her uncle. 

Once married to Maud, Rivers' next plan is to get her admitted to the asylum. But in a dramatic twist, Sue is taken to the madhouse as "Mrs Rivers" and she realises that Maud has been in on the plan from the very beginning.

===Part Two===

Having disposed of Sue, Rivers takes Maud to London to Mrs Sucksby's house. There Maud learns that Mrs Sucksby is the mastermind behind her escape and Sue's downfall. Maud is plagued by doubts over her treatment of Sue and the fake life that she presented.

In reality Maud was orphaned and brought up by her uncle, a cruel man, who hardened her heart. The nightly readings in his library were not as innocent as it appeared to Sue. Maud was forced to read pornography to her uncle and his friends. Tormented by the cruelty of her existence, Maud found in Rivers a way out.

By marrying him, she could escape the prison of her uncle's house. But what Maud hadn't expected was to be so affected by her friendship with Sue - or indeed that she would fall in love with her. In order to save herself from her uncle, Maud had to reconcile herself to hurting Sue.

But even Maud couldn't have imagined that her world would be further turned upside down. Mrs Sucksby reveals that through a series of twists and turns Maud and Sue were [[babies switched at birth|switched at birth]] — they have been living each other's lives. Mrs. Sucksby arranged the whole scheme. Marianne Lilly, before being incarcerated in the asylum by her evil brother, changed her will, leaving one half of her wealth to her own daughter, Susan, and the other half to Maud.

Mrs Sucksby explains to Maud that she has no choice but to comply with the rest of the plan. Maud is further devastated to learn that they have no intention of rescuing Sue from the asylum.

Acknowledging the wrong she has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue. She manages to get out and finds her way to an old business associate of her uncle's, but he refuses to help and sends her away. Alone in the alleyways and streets of London and unaware of the dangers that lurk, Maud realises she has no choice but to return to [[Lant Street]]. Mrs Sucksby is overjoyed to see her and Maud discovers that she is in fact Mrs Sucksby's own daughter.

Meanwhile, employing all the underhanded tricks that her childhood has taught her, Sue escapes from the asylum. She heads for London where she plans to get her revenge on Maud for what she sees as betrayal.

At Mrs Sucksby's, Sue confronts Maud, Mrs Sucksby and Rivers; a huge row ensues and in a struggle Rivers is killed. Despite Maud being guilty of Rivers' murder, Mrs Sucksby confesses to protect both girls and soon after is executed for the crime.

Maud disappears and Sue, realising that Maud was just an innocent in Mrs Sucksby's scheme, sets off to find her. Acknowledging their feelings for one another, the two women are reunited.

'''Georg Friedrich Meier''' (26 March 1718 – 21 June 1777) was a German philosopher and aesthetician. A follower of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], he reformed the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] by introducing elements of [[John Locke]]'s empiricist theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name=CHECP&gt;{{Citation | last=Thiel | first=Udo | year=2006 | contribution=Meier, Georg Friedrich | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1202–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier studied philosophy and theology at the [[University of Halle]], where he was a pupil of Baumgarten. Meier succeeded Baumgarten as extraordinary professor, and became a full professor at Halle in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/meier-georg-friedrich-17181777-eoph/ "Meier, Georg Friedrich"], ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Reference, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference songs ==
Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first interval of a popular song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mayfield, Connie E. | year=2002 | title=Theory Essentials, Volume I: An Integrated Approach to Harmony, Ear Training, and Keyboard Skills | publisher=Schirmer | location=New York | isbn=0-534-57231-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=I can't find any mention of songs in connection with intervals in this book.

In addition, there are various [[solmization]] systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

==Activism==
Lumley is also known for her support for [[Gurkha]]s, the [[Tibetan independence movement|exiled Tibetan people and government]], the [[Kondha]] indigenous people of India and the Prospect Burma charity, which offers grants to Burmese students, for whom she broadcast a BBC Radio 4 charity appeal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectburma.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=2|title=Home - Prospect Burma|work=prospectburma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a commanding officer of a troop of Gurkhas who fought in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

===Gurkha Justice Campaign===
[[File:Guka Joanna Lumley 1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Lumley with [[David Cameron]], [[Bob Russell (UK politician)|Bob Russell]] and the Liberal Democrat leader, [[Nick Clegg]], celebrating the Gurkha vote against the government]]
{{Main article|Gurkha Justice Campaign}}
In 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all [[Nepalese people|Nepalese origin]] [[Gurkha]] veterans who served in the [[British Army]] before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission, but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all-party group including Gurkhas starting from [[Parliament Square]] to [[10 Downing Street]] with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the [[Gurkha Justice Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurkhajustice.org.uk/about_us.html "About the Gurkha Justice Campaign: Campaign Organisers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001173054/http://gurkhajustice.org.uk/about_us.html |date=1 October 2013 }} Gurkha Justice web site&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2009, she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK and access to housing, social security and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8014265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Fury over Gurkha settlement plan | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8019745.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lib Dems challenge Gurkha ruling | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm|title=BBC 'Brown defeated over Gurkha rules'|accessdate=29 April 2009 | date=29 April 2009 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Government defeat, the [[Minister of State for Borders and Immigration|Minister for Immigration]] [[Phil Woolas]] announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.

On 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from "a senior member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8034131.stm|title= No 10 denies Lumley 'Gurkha snub'|publisher= BBC News|date= 5 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended a meeting with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] at [[10 Downing Street]] the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Mr Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8036036.stm|title= Lumley 'trusts' Brown on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 6 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Lumley confronted [[Phil Woolas]] at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after her pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8037181.stm|title= Lumley in public clash on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 7 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[Home Affairs Select Committee|Commons Home Affairs Committee]] meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Home Office]] on 19 May, [[Gordon Brown]] announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 20 May that the [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] would make a statement on the issue the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5360033/Gurkhas-in-Britain-a-timeline-of-their-campaign-to-stay.html|title= Gurkhas in Britain: a timeline of their campaign to stay|work= The Daily Telegraph|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm|title= Gurkhas win right to settle in UK|publisher= BBC News|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of her campaigning skills, there were calls for Joanna Lumley to stand as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|forthcoming general election]]. However, she has dismissed the suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/lindy-mcdowell/lindy-mcdowell-how-joanna--lumley--is-leading-the-charge-14312324.html|work= The Belfast Telegraph|first= Lindy|last= McDowell|title= How Joanna Lumley is leading the charge|date= 23 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an appearance on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' on 29 May, she reiterated that she had no desire to run for election to the House of Commons.

In July 2009, Lumley went on a visit to Nepal. Upon her arrival at [[Tribhuvan International Airport]], she was greeted by crowds of Gurkha supporters. Lumley said in a statement, "I feel so humbled by the fact I'm going to meet so many ex-Gurkhas and their families, and see where they are and how they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8169319.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lumley mobbed by crowds in Nepal | date=26 July 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Lumley was hailed 'Daughter of Nepal' by the crowds of fans at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8169641.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lumley greeted as 'daughter of Nepal' | date=26 July 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010 | first=Joanna | last=Jolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work for Survival International===
{{Main article|Survival International}}
Lumley has long been a supporter of [[Survival International]] and the cause of indigenous rights, and narrated Survival's documentary, ''Mine: story of a sacred mountain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433152/|title=Mine: Story of a Sacred Mountain|date=1 April 2009|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4604|title=London protesters vow to stop British mine and destruction of tribe in India|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells the story of the remote [[Kondha|Dongria Kondha]] tribe in India and their battle to stop a vast [[bauxite]] mine from destroying their land and way of life. In defence of the Dongria, she has said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"It greatly disturbs me that a British company will be responsible for the destruction of these wonderful people. I urge the public to support the Dongria, who simply want to be allowed to live in peace. Unlike so many of India's rural poor, the Dongria actually live very well in the Niyamgiri hills, and it's a terrible irony that what [[Vedanta Resources|Vedanta]] is proposing to do in the name of 'development' will actually destroy this completely self-sufficient people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4403|title=Joanna Lumley narrates new film about remote tribe|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Lumley also contributed her writing for the book ''We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples'', released in October 2009 with profits going in support of Survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/weareone|title=We Are One|first=Survival|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of photographs, statements from tribal people and essays from international authors, the book explores the richness of the cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] around the world and the risks to their existence. In her essay for the book, Lumley speaks of the Dongria way of life and the threats they face in the name of corporate interests, and calls for action to stop such decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=We are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples |last=Eede |first=Joanna |publisher=Quadrille Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=1-84400-729-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposals foundered at a cost of over £40 million of public money.&lt;ref name="OCeallaigh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ultratravel/the-next-big-thing/10120636/A-Garden-Bridge-across-the-Thames.html|title=A 'Garden Bridge' across the Thames|last=O'Ceallaigh|first=John|date=14 June 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/24/joanna-lumley-role-boris-johnson-thames-garden-bridge-london-thomas-heatherwick|title=How Joanna Lumley charmed 'dear Boris' to back her garden bridge dream|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=23 May 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/13/why-is-londons-garden-bridge-worth-as-much-as-five-lancashire-museums-ask-joanna-lumley|title=Why is London's Garden Bridge worth as much as five Lancashire museums?

In May 2009 she supported the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Elections]] campaign. For Lumley, the work of Green MEPs in the [[European Parliament]] in pursuing human rights and animal rights made the Green Party "the obvious choice" and urged UK voters "to cast a positive vote for a better future by voting Green in the European Elections."&lt;ref name='Independent_09-05-28'&gt;{{cite news | first = Nigel | last = Morris | title = Lumley goes Green in European elections | date = 28 May 2009 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lumley-goes-green-in-european-elections-1691811.html | work = The Independent |location=London | accessdate =17 January 2012 | quote = "I urge you to cast a positive vote for a better future by voting Green in the European elections"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lumley also appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from [[first-past-the-post]] to [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] for electing Members of Parliament to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|Alternative Vote referendum]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12950712 | title= Benjamin Zephaniah 'airbrushed from Yes to AV leaflets' | publisher=BBC News | date=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 she donated [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to [[Caroline Lucas]]'s campaign to become the first [[Green Party (UK)|Green]] MP during the 2010 General Election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Hattenstone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/03/joanna-lumley-interview |title=Joanna Lumley: 'I'm a happy person.

'''Jules Semon Bache''' (November 9, 1861 – March 24, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], [[art collector]] and [[philanthropist]].

== Early life ==
Julius Bache was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-history/2008/best-friends-jewish-society-in-old-palm-beach New York Social Diary: "Best Friends: Jewish Society in Old Palm Beach"] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1xAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=jules+bache#v=onepage&amp;q=jules%20bache&amp;f=false The American Hebrew: "Jule S.

==Career==
In 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn &amp; Co., a [[stockbroker]]age firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it [[Bache &amp; Co.|J. S. Bache &amp; Co.]] Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by [[Merrill Lynch]]. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.

During [[World War I]], Jules Bache donated money to the [[American Field Service]] in [[France]] and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the "War Babies' Cradle," a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and [[Belgium]] to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.

Jules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his [[Bahamas]] based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled "''Release business from the slavery of taxation''." A major shareholder in [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines Limited]], Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of [[Dillon, Read &amp; Co.]] acquired the [[Dodge]] Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in [[Chrysler Corporation]].

[[File:Jules Bache Mausoleum 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|The mausoleum of Jules Bache]]In addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of "''[[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]]''," then attributed to [[Raphael]]. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] (including ''[[The Bache Madonna]]''), [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Gerard David]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

=== Gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ===
Bache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Preston_Remington_records_b18157099.pdf Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925–1970], Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, Sunday, April 1, 1945, p. 20 'Jules S. Bache Art Collection is Going on Sale: Works Not Donated to the Metropolitan Museum To Be Sold April 19, 20, 21.' The auction was held at the Kende Galleries of Gimbel Brothers. The New York Times, Sunday, April 1, 1945 adds that 'oil paintings and terracotta statuary' were to be sold on April 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist [[Wilhelm Viktor Krausz]] (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.

The following is a list of fiction employing [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes or alternate realities]].

==Books==
* [[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle, wrote ''[[The Blazing World]]'' (1666), a book far ahead of its time, in which the heroine passes through a portal near the North Pole to a world with different stars in the sky and talking animals.
* [[Ludvig Holberg]], Danish-Norwegian author, historian and philosopher, wrote ''[[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]'' (in Latin as Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum, 1741). The hero Niels Klim slips into a cave and reaches Nazar, a planet inside the hollow Earth, where societies and beings represent  satirical comments to existing contemporary ones.
* [[Edwin Abbott Abbott|Edwin Abott Abbott]], mathematician and theologian, wrote ''[[Flatland]]'' (1884), also known as ''Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions''. It recounts the story of a two-dimensional world inhabited by living geometric figures: triangles, squares, circles, etc., and explores concepts of other dimensions (or universes) including Pointland, Lineland, and Spaceland. A feature film adaptation of this novella was made in 2007, called ''[[Flatland (2007 film)|Flatland]]''.
* [[H. G. Wells]] wrote what is apparently the first explicit paratime novel, ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923), complete with a multiverse theory and a paratime machine.
* [[Murray Leinster]]'s story "[[Sidewise in Time]]" (1934), showing different parts of the Earth somehow occupied by different parallel universes, was influential in science fiction.
* [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]'' from 1937 describes God (called the Star Maker) evolving by creating many cosmoses, each more complex than the previous.
*In [[C. S. Lewis]]' classic ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series (1950–1956) children come and go between our world and Narnia, a land populated by talking animals. In ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' the Wood between the Worlds gives access to several worlds.  In ''[[The Last Battle]]'' it transpires that all the worlds are joined together by a form of [[heaven]].
* [[Ward Moore]]'s ''[[Bring the Jubilee ]]'' describes  the Confederacy winning the American Civil War. This 1953 novel was well received and influenced Philp K. Dick’s Man in a High Castle.
* [[Andre Norton]]'s ''[[The Crossroads of Time]]'' is a science-fiction novel written by Andre Norton and first published in 1956 by Ace Books. The story takes its protagonist through several versions of Earth as it might have been if history had gone a little differently. The book has been translated into Spanish, Italian, and German. Tacitly postulating a kind of two-dimensional time, Norton anticipated Hugh Everett III's many-worlds interpretation of the quantum theory by one year. She called it the "possibility worlds" theory of history.
* [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' (1962) is an alternate history novel.
*In ''[[The Man Who Folded Himself]]'' (1973) by [[David Gerrold]], paradoxes caused by [[time travel]] result in the creation of multiple universes.
* [[Piers Anthony]] wrote the "[[Of Man and Manta]]" series (''Omnivore'', ''Orn'', and ''Ox'', 1968–76) in which a group of three scientists explores worlds in parallel universes.
* [[Tonke Dragt]]'s novel "The Towers of February" (De torens van februari, 1973) is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] in diary form for young adults, about a boy who slowly discovers that his memory loss is due to having passed into a parallel universe. The difficulty to travel between both worlds can be seen as symbolic for reaching adulthood and can be taken literal at the same time.
* [[Michael Coney]] ''[[Charisma]]'' 1975 A murder mystery which involves the main character John Maine traveling to different parallel worlds, but the only worlds he can travel to are the ones in which his 'other self' is dead.
* [[Michael Ende]]'s novel ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' (De unendliche Geschichte, 1979) is a portal-story where the detoriation of fantasy (and of lies) among humans of Earth both influates (and stem from) what happens in the magical world of Fantastica. The protagonist reads the story of this world in a book until he understands that he may take part in and save it, and eventually the imagination of Earth. 
* [[David Brin]] wrote ''[[The Practice Effect]]'' (1984), which is the story of a scientific researcher who finds themselves stranded in an alternate dimension that has unique natural laws that allow objects to become improved as they are used, rather than degrade.
* [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] wrote ''[[The Long Earth]]'' (2012), the first of a series of novels about a (possibly infinite) series of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth.
* [[H. Beam Piper]], the author of the ''[[Paratime]]'' series, wrote several stories dealing with alternate realities based on points of divergence far in the past.  The stories are usually written from the perspective of a law-enforcement outfit from a parallel reality which is charged to protect the secret of temporal transposition.
* "[[Convolutions]]", a novella by [[Vashti Daise]], gradually reveals that the two main teenage characters exist in overlapping universes, and when they discover a paradise-like third universe, they can't help but be tempted to escape the struggles of their worlds.
* [[Fredric Brown]]'s ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' recounts the adventures of a science-fiction editor of the late 1940s who is thrown into a parallel universe that reflects the fantasies of his most annoying letter-to-the-editor writer (an adolescent male, naturally).
* [[Isaac Asimov]]'s novel ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' depicts scientists in our universe who find a way to "import" matter from another universe, with unforeseen consequences. "[[The End of Eternity]]," also by Asimov, likewise deals with the existence of and interactions between multiple timelines, though these multiple interacting universes are depicted as the result of meddling in a single timeline by outside entities (the "eternals"), and therefore do not exist simultaneously, as do those in "The Gods Themselves."
* [[K. A. Applegate]]'s series, ''[[Everworld]]'' (1999–2001): Several teenagers travel into a parallel world occupied by the mythological beings of Earth.
* [[Brandon Mull]]'s series, ''Beyonders'' (2011-2013): Depicts the multiverse as being divided into an enormous set of "normal" universes, including ours (the beyond), and one intelligently created universe set apart from all others (Lyrian). It's strongly implied in the novels that it's only possible to travel from the "beyond" to Lyrian, or from Lyrian to the beyond.
* [[Stephen King]]'s series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' has doors that send travelers to different parallel Earths, or, as termed in the story, different levels of the Tower. King also frequently utilizes this idea in other stories, such as ''[[The Mist]]'', ''[[From A Buick 8]]'', ''[[The Talisman (King &amp; Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'', ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''.
* [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' is focused around a 'time machine' that also proves to be able to travel sideways and other directions in time, allowing for crossing into other realities, even ones previously considered fictional by the protagonists.
* [[S. M. Stirling]]'s novel ''[[Conquistador (novel)|Conquistador]]'' is based on travel between parallel universes, with a group of 20th century Americans having found a means to secretly colonize a world where civilization never advanced past the classical era.
*''[[Globus Cassus]]'' is a book describing a [[utopian]] project for a universe contrary to ours, it describes an [[antipodes|antipode]] to the 'real' world.
*''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' by [[Robert Jordan]] series the world of dreams, and the Mirror Worlds which represent what could have been had various events in history happened in different ways.
* [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' ''[[Chrestomanci]]'' series revolves around the duty of the Chrestomanci to regulate magic in the twelve related worlds.  These worlds have alternate histories, in which some people may exist only in a few worlds. Other works of Jones' that include parallel universes: The ''Magid'' series; ''[[Deep Secret]]'' and ''[[The Merlin Conspiracy]]'' in which the multiverse is shaped like an infinity sign and contains Ayewards and Naywards.  The ''Derkholm'' series: ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'' and its sequel ''[[Year of the Griffin]]'' in which Pilgrims come from a parallel world for Mr. Chesney's offworld tours. In ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', though it does not play a major part in the plot, the wizard Howl is actually from our world. In ''[[A Tale of Time City]]'', the main character, Vivian, is kidnapped and taken to Time City, a city out of time and space. Along with her new friends and past kidnappers Jonathan and Sam, she hunts through time and space for the polarites that are gradually being stolen. In ''A Sudden Wild Magic'' a group of benevolent witches set out to stop the magicians of Arth who steal ideas, technology, and innovations from Earth. In ''[[Hexwood]]'', the machine Bannus sucks potential Reigners from all over the universe into the Wood. In ''[[The Homeward Bounders]]'' Jamie is made into a Homeward Bounder by "Them" which means he must constantly travel from world to world until he finds his home again.
* [[John DeChancie]]'s ''[[Castle Perilous]]'' series tells of a huge magical castle containing portals to 144,000 worlds, including Earth.
* [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[Mordant's Need]]'' series, which includes ''The Mirror of Her Dreams'' and ''A Man Rides Through'', follows a heroine who can pass into another world through mirrors.
*In ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]]'' series, also by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]], main character Thomas Covenant is transported to another world called [[The Land (Stephen R. Donaldson)|The Land]]. Each time he travels to The Land corresponds to an injury in the real world that leaves him unconscious.
* [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series (1995–2000) deals with two children who wander through multiple worlds, opening and closing windows between them.  The final book elaborates the same idea (as C.S. Lewis') that all the worlds share a common heaven, and in this case, [[underworld]].
* [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series is set in a parallel universe which is very similar to ours but has (amusingly) different history.  For example, Britain and Russia are still fighting the [[Crimean War]] in 1985.  As the story develops, the world of fiction also emerges as another parallel universe and the characters learn how to move between them.
*The German series ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' sometimes deals with parallel universes and "pararealities."  Each universe has a "strangeness" value that indicates to what extent its physical laws differ from those of our universe.  Travel to another universe results in a "strangeness shock" that can disable electronics and leave intelligent beings unconscious for some time.
*In [[L. Neil Smith]]'s ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' series of novels' characters from several different universes end up in one universe where American history took a different turn in the aftermath of the Revolution, with [[Albert Gallatin]] assisting the western Pennsylvania farmers of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], which culminates in [[George Washington]]'s execution and the rise of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] republic under a revised [[Articles of Confederation]].

In their world, Japan won World War II, and because of their strong religious Shinto beliefs, their Gods did not die out, and they were able to use this magic to help strengthen their technology. However, their sun died out prematurely, and so they have come to our world to steal the energy from our sun to save their world.
* [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novella [[Coraline]] deals with a parallel universe called the "Other World" in which Coraline's surroundings are the same but the people who are supposed to be her parents are actually evil impostors.  The novella spawned a [[Coraline (film)|film of the same name]] that deals with the same plot and use of parallel universes.
* [[Sergey Lukyanenko]]'s novel ''[[Rough Draft (novel)|Rough Draft]]'' (2005) takes place across the multiverse of at least 22 worlds (it was implied that there were actually more worlds that haven't been discovered yet) linked together by a series of tower-like transfer points.
*''[[I, Q]]'' is a 2000 [[Star Trek]] novel by [[Peter David]] and [[John de Lancie]] in which God attempts to destroy the multiverse in a large multi-universe maelstrom which the protagonists attempt to stop from within a newly created universe caused by the maelstrom.
*In [[D. J. MacHale]]'s ''[[The Pendragon Adventure]]'' series there are ten different parallel universes (including our own), called territories, that are part of Halla, which is described as being every time and place that ever existed. Certain people, called Travelers, are able to go between the territories through portals known as Flumes. It is claimed that by traveling through a Flume, Travelers land on their destination territory exactly when they need to be there, suggesting time travel.
*In [[Robert J Sawyer]]'s ''[[Neanderthal Parallax]]'' series (2003) a parallel historical universe exists in which it was [[Neanderthals]] not Homo sapiens who survived to become the dominant species. In a quantum physics experiment gone wrong a Neanderthal scientist is accidentally transported into the universe of Homo sapiens.
* [[Michael Lawrence (writer)|Michael Lawrence]]'s ''The Aldous Lexicon'' (2005–2007), comprising ''A Crack in the Line'', ''Small Eternities'' and ''The Underwood See'', concerns comings and goings between initially two, later many parallel realities.
*In ''Mirror Dreams'' (2002) and ''Mirror Wakes'' (2003) by [[Catherine Webb]], there are mirror universes, one a magical universe where technology barely works, the other a scientific universe where magic barely works. The inhabitants can physically visit each other's worlds in dreams.
*In the ''[[Stravaganza]]'' series by Mary Hoffman various people travel between present-day [[England]] and an alternative, somewhat magical [[Renaissance Italy]] called Talia.
*In the [[Alastair Reynolds]] novel ''[[Absolution Gap]]'', (2003) a race called the "Shadows" drives the action.

They have sent instructions to our world on how to build machinery to let them across.
*In ''[[The Divide trilogy]]'' by [[Elizabeth Kay]] (2002–2006), Felix Sanders crosses into a parallel universe where magic and magical beings exist while science and human beings are considered mythical.
* [[Andrew Crumey]]'s novel ''[[Mobius Dick]]'' (2004) features a parallel world in which Nazi Germany invaded Britain and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] failed to find the quantum theory equation that bears his name. The parallel worlds become connected due to experiments with quantum computers. The same alternate world (in which post-war Britain falls under Communist rule) also appears in his novels ''Music, in a Foreign Language'' (1994) and ''[[Sputnik Caledonia]]'' (2008).
*In [[Darren Shan]]'s ''[[Demonata]]'' series (2005–) a boy can open windows to parallel worlds with his hands. A part of the story also plays in one of these parallel worlds, the Demonata.
* [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Crosstime Traffic]]'' series of books (2003–2008) by [[Harry Turtledove]] centers on an Earth that has discovered access to alternate universes where history went differently. "Crosstime Traffic" is the name of the company with a global monopoly on the technology.
*''[[Pet Force]]'', a series of children's books by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] and a spinoff of [[Garfield]], one of his comic strips. The series contains five novels and takes place in a parallel universe and features alternate versions of the comic strip's main characters.
* [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'' (1999) tells the story of historians who travel to the Middle Ages to save a friend of theirs who already traveled back in time before them. The book follows in Crichton's long history of combining technical details and action in his books, addressing quantum physics and time travel. The time travel mechanism incorporates the concept of the multiverse.

* [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s ''[[Song of Albion]]'' trilogy (published in 1991) tells the tale of a pair of university students who stumble into an alternate world (Albion).
*The conceit of [[Charles Stross]]'s [[Merchant Princes]] series is that the ability to travel between worlds is a recessive trait possessed by a clan of narcotics runners from a medieval world. They travel to an alternate present where the northeast coast of North America has been settled by Norsemen.
*Dark Matter by Blake Crouch (2016)
* [[Daedalus Howell]]'s ''Quantum Deadline'' (published in 2015) finds a reporter helping a boy who claims to be from a parallel universe return using an Easter Egg hidden in a popular mobile phone game.

* ''[[Lost in Austen]]'' (2008):  A woman from modern London enters the world of the Jane Austen novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' through a portal in her bathroom.
* ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''{{'}}s 1963 episode "[[The Parallel]]" was one of the earliest examples of parallel universe as a key plot element on American television.
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television movie ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'' involves the discovery of an alternate universe.
* ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', the 1960s fantasy/horror soap opera, introduced the concept of "parallel time" when the main character, Barnabas, witnesses unexplainable changes in a closed off part of his family's house. During one of these changes, he becomes trapped for a time in a parallel world.
* ''[[Star Trek]]'' featured the recurring [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|mirror universe]], a dark reflection of the normal universe in which the regular characters are twisted, self-serving and more than willing to resort to torture and murder to achieve their goals. The mirror universe was introduced in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and it also appeared in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', but was featured most often in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]''. Other ''Star Trek'' episodes featuring parallel universes outside the Mirror Universe include "[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]" and "[[The Alternative Factor]]".
* ''[[Doctor Who]]'' occasionally featured parallel worlds. Examples include "[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]" (1970), where Great Britain has been a republic since at least 1943 (the Royal Family having been executed after a military coup) and is ruled by a totalitarian regime led by a figure reminiscent of [[Oswald Mosley]] who uses the title of "the Leader". The 1980–1981 "E-space" trilogy of episodes ("[[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]]", "[[State of Decay]]", and "[[Warriors' Gate]]"). The second series of the 2005 revival of the show made frequent use of the concept beginning with "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" and "[[The Age of Steel]]", postulating a parallel world with yet another Republic of Great Britain, [[Zeppelins]] filling the sky, and an alternate race of [[Cybermen]] are created. Since the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], travel between parallel universes is supposedly near-impossible, but a breach between the universes makes frequent visits easy in the second series finale "[[Army of Ghosts]]"/"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]". These visits cause increasing damage to the universes and the breach is permanently sealed.
* ''[[Sliders]]'' dealt with a group of mostly-unwilling travellers who ended up "sliding" between various parallel Earths in an attempt to find their way back to their own universe.

Most tribes, however, prefer to utilize other means of transportation and warfare – dinosaurs. As discovered by three modern-day scientists who are trapped in ParaWorld, dinosaurs never existed on our Earth, and all the bones found by archaeologists have somehow crossed over through the portals.

This is a list of visual artists who are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], categorized by primary media. [[Mestizo]] and [[Métis]] artists whose indigenous descent is integral to their art are included, as are [[Siberian Yup'ik]] artists due to their cultural commonalities with Alaskan [[Yup'ik]] people. This list includes notable [[visual artists]] who are [[Inuit people]], [[Alaskan Native]]s, [[Siberian Yup'ik]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s, [[First Nations]], [[Métis]], [[Mestizos]], and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]], the Caribbean, Central America, and [[Indigenous peoples in South America|South America]]. Indigenous identity is a complex and contested issue and differs from country to country in the Americas. Inclusion to this list is based on legal membership to an Indigenous community, when applicable, or recognition by the relevant indigenous community/communities of the individual as a member of that community.
&lt;!-- Please add only well-established artists who meet the requirements of  [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)]]. Thanks!--&gt;

'''Manda Best''' is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Josie Lawrence]]. Manda was introduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]], and made her first appearance on 6&amp;nbsp;March 2009 and her last on 12 February 2010.

The character was given a backstory linking her to two characters already established in the serial; she is an ex-girlfriend of [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and an old friend of [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]), the latter whom Manda was paired romantically with. Her family was extended when her disabled son, [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]), who suffers from [[spina bifida]], was introduced. Adam's introduction was scripted to cause discontent in Manda and Minty's relationship, with Adam taking an instant dislike to Minty. It was announced in November&amp;nbsp;2009 that Lawrence had quit ''EastEnders'' as she wanted to pursue other projects, making her final appearance on 12&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2010, after ending her relationship with Minty.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Lawrence revealed Manda's backstory in an interview on the official ''EastEnders'' website: "Manda lived in the Square over 20 years ago—she went out with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and knew [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]). She got married and left the area, but she's been divorced for five years. I don't think it was a very happy marriage—he was a bit of a philanderer. After the divorce she decided to reinvent herself. She's taken a course in teaching pottery and art and she's made life better for herself by becoming more spiritual."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/interviews/interview_josie_l.shtml#1|archivedate=13 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313183119/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/interviews/interview_josie_l.shtml#1|title=Josie Lawrence on joining EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=4 March 2009|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2010===
Manda first appears at Walford's community centre, where she is teaching a pottery class. There she meets her old acquaintance Minty Peterson. Minty reveals that while Manda was dating his friend Phil Mitchell years ago, he secretly used to hate her. However, they settle their differences and soon start dating. But the pace of the relationship is slow, and Minty wonders if Manda is really interested in him. In July&amp;nbsp;2009, Minty sees Manda kissing Phil. He reluctantly confronts her, and she explains that she was thanking Phil for allowing Minty a day off work (she was planning a secret trip to the theatre for Minty). Manda also assures him that she will never cheat on him. Manda's landlord evicts her from her flat, and after [[Garry Hobbs]] ([[Ricky Groves]]) and [[Dawn Swann]] ([[Kara Tointon]]) leave Walford, she moves into Minty's residence with her cat. Manda's son [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]) comes to stay in September&amp;nbsp;2009, and he takes an instant dislike to Minty. After Adam returns to [[Oxford University]], Manda tries to explain her son's hostility by saying he is over-protective. Minty responds by telling Manda that Adam is arrogant and rude, and he does not appreciate being treated like that in his own home. The pair make up, however, with Manda promising that Adam will be nicer in future. Manda discovers that [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) is secretly the father of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]])'s baby [[George Trott|George]], but agrees to keep it to herself. When the secret is revealed, Minty is angry with her for not telling him, as he was once married to Heather. They make up, but then Manda finds out that Minty has been hiding [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]), a fugitive, from the police. Adam tries to cause trouble, saying that Minty fantasises about Sam, but Manda accepts Minty's explanation that he and Sam are merely friends; Sam is imprisoned shortly after. When Minty starts disappearing regularly without saying where he is going, Manda suspects he is having an affair. Adam finds a letter Sam sent Minty from prison, and it transpires Minty is visiting Sam. When Manda confronts Minty about this, he admits to having feelings for Sam but wants to spend his future with Manda. Believing Minty does not love her, Manda pretends that she still has feelings for Phil and ends her relationship with Minty, leaving Walford. Several months later, Adam tells Minty that Manda is dating another man.

===Introduction and departure===
In January&amp;nbsp;2009, it was announced that comedian Lawrence would join ''EastEnders'' playing Manda Best, a character who had grown up in [[Walford]] and knew Phil and Minty over 20 years before moving back.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a142419/comic-josie-lawrence-joins-eastenders.html|title=Comic Josie Lawrence joins 'EastEnders'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Alex|last=Fletcher|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the show for a specific storyline involving Phil and Minty, however, a source at the BBC told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] that "there are plenty of potential storyline opportunities for her to able to stick around."&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt; ''EastEnders''{{'}} executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] said of Lawrence's casting, "I'm so excited Josie's joining us.

===Characterisation===
Lawrence described Manda as "Loving, strange (in a good way) and creative".&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; Lawrence based Manda's "new age" side on a couple of her friends who were into yoga and breathing relaxation techniques, saying, "there's a couple of times when you see Manda take a deep breath when she is getting irate."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; The BBC described Manda as "charismatic";&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; the ''EastEnders'' website called her "creative, vivacious and always up for a laugh" and suggesting that "underneath her merry exterior", Manda might have been "longing for love".&lt;ref name="Manda EE website"/&gt; The website goes on to say: "Bubbly, free-spirit Manda Best is well connected with her spiritual side and is a firm believer in solving life's problems through hugging. She is loving, creative and independent, but secretly yearns to meet that 'Mr Right'."&lt;ref name="Manda EE website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/manda-best.shtml|title=Amanda Best played by Josie Lawrence|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]'' described Manda as "crazed"&lt;ref name="crazed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SAILING+OFF+IN+SEA+OF+DRIVEL.-a0206877282|title=Sailing off in sea of drivel|last=O'Sullivan|first=Kevin|date=30 August 2009|publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "mad".&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/No+Ender+to+misery.-a0215263523|title=No Ender to misery|last=O'Sullivan|first=Kevin|date=27 December 2009|publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manda typically wore "hippy dresses"&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josie Lawrence set to leave EastEnders|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/091116-josie.shtml|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=16 November 2009|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large glasses.&lt;ref name="nerves"/&gt;

==Reception==
Lawrence, who was born in [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], came under criticism from a journalist of the ''[[Sunday Mercury]]''. According to the journalist, ''EastEnders'', a London-based soap opera, had too many actors from the Midlands at the time, and not enough from London.&lt;ref name="midland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Albert+Square+invaded!+Ad+EastEnders+celebrates+25+years+soap+is...-a0218895865|title=Albert Square invaded!

'''Michael Clark''' (born 1 April 1954) is a contemporary British artist. His work spans a broad range of media including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, photography, installation, video, performance and artist's books. Clark was born in Manchester and lives and works in London.

== Life and work ==
In 1977 Clark met [[Muriel Belcher]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in [[The Colony Room]] club in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p030kfnc|title='When Bacon is in your bloodstream he never leaves you', 24 August 2015, Today - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's portrait of Belcher on her deathbed (''Muriel Belcher Ill in bed'') was part of the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1981, and won the Charles Wollaston Award. At the suggestion of Valerie Beston, of [[Marlborough Fine Art]], Clark made the first of a series of portraits of Bacon, one of which is in the [[British Museum]]'s collection. "Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality".&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/10/art|title=The power and the passion|author=Peter Conrad|date=10 August 2008|work=The Observer|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vanitas'' (1990-1992), Clark's double-sided portrait of [[Lisa Stansfield]], was part of ''[[The Portrait Now]]''  exhibition held from 1993–1994 at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. "Both the theme of the wound and the title 'Vanitas' make references to mortality. Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting — also double-sided — by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder]]."&lt;ref name=CHowse&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-november-1993/40/arts|title=Beautiful Wounds|author= Christopher Howse|date=13 November 1993|work=The Spectator|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, Clark's ''Five Wounds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.tooveys.com/2013/12/francis-bacon/|title=Flesh and Bones Unites Oxford and Chichester – Toovey’s Blog|website=blog.tooveys.com|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been on permanent display at [[Chichester Cathedral]], alongside works by [[Graham Sutherland]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/art-the-word-made-flesh-michael-clarks-paintings-of-wounds-are-now-on-display-at-chichester-1432388.html|title=The word made flesh: Michael Clark's paintings of wounds are now on display at Chichester Cathedral.

Clark delivered ''Al-Jebr'', a kinetic assemblage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/glossary-of-art-terms/assemblage|title=Assemblage|last=Glossary of art terms|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'.&lt;ref name="RoegNPG"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw12329/Nicholas-Roeg-al-jebr|title=Nicholas Roeg ('al-jebr')|author=National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collection of Valerie Beston was sold at [[Christie's]] in February 2006 and included ten works by Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jan/29/art1|title=Harriet Lane reveals passions beneath calm exterior of Miss Valerie Beston, Francis Bacon's trusted gallery administrator|author=Harriet Lane|date=29 January 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying catalogue stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bacon’s influence threads through his [Clark's] works, reappearing even in his conceptual pieces. Be it in the appearance of wounds in his paintings, or in the location of a ‘sound sculpture’ outside a sex shop that Bacon used to frequent (only in part to cash his cheques), his ghostly spectre appears again and again, if only obliquely, in his figurative and conceptual works. For Clark is not a portraitist, although he has created many portraits of people ranging from film directors to the characters of [[Soho]] of yesterday to Royalty to Pop royalty. He is a conceptual artist, for whom the painstakingly accurate depiction of the human face is only one of his means or media, and conversation with him ranges from the diverse influences of [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Bruce Nauman|Nauman]] as well as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and [[Rembrandt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Christie's International Media Division|date=February 2006|title=The Collection of The Late Miss Valerie Beston: Artists from the London School|journal=Auction Catalogue|volume=|pages=72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, ''Francis Bacon in Your Blood,'' art historian [[Michael Peppiatt]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A feature article&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; came out a while ago in the ''Observer'' in which the author, [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]], interviewed three men who had been close to Francis Bacon in their youth. He described each of them as having been 'burnt' for life by their contact with the painter. The implication was that you did not survive the influence of a genius as dark and powerful as Bacon. The three men were the photographer [[Peter Beard]], the artist Michael Clark, and myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NlJFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;lpg=PT7&amp;dq=francis+bacon+in+your+blood+francis+bacon+michael+clark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tXzOQxChg&amp;sig=91xuEJowZpSMBqEHaTjFAbS0gP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit0oKnls7ZAhUsIcAKHaPMA7QQ6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20bacon%20in%20your%20blood%20francis%20bacon%20michael%20clark&amp;f=false|title=Francis Bacon in Your Blood|author=Michael Peppiatt|first=Michael|publisher=Bloomsbury Circus|year=2015|isbn=1408856247|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gawdawpalin Temple Bagan Myanmar.jpg|thumb|350x350px|alt=Ornate temple, lit by the sun|The [[Gawdawpalin Temple]] in [[Bagan]] was built during the 12th century.]]
The '''architecture of Myanmar''' (formerly known as [[Burma]]), in [[Southeast Asia]], includes architectural styles which reflect the influence of neighboring and Western nations and [[Modernization theory|modernization]]. The country's most prominent buildings include Buddhist [[Pagoda|pagodas]], [[Stupa|stupas]] and [[Temple|temples]], [[British Empire|British colonial]] buildings, and modern renovations and structures. Myanmar's traditional architecture is primarily used for worship, [[pilgrimage]], storage of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] relics, [[Activism|political activism]] and [[Tourism in Myanmar|tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and influences ==
=== Early Indian influence ===

Much of Myanmar's architecture is tied to ancient [[Architecture of India|Indian culture]], and can be traced to the country's earliest known inhabitants.&lt;ref name=worldbook&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myanmar|last=|first=|publisher=World Book Inc.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu period]], cylindrical [[stupa]]s with four [[Torana|archways]]—often with a [[hti]] (umbrella)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|title=The State and the City|url=|journal=Pacific Affairs|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; on top&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stupas and Stupa-Shrines|last=Myer|first=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;—were built. The [[Mon people|Mon]] and Pyu people were the first two influential groups to migrated to Myanmar, and the first [[Indo-Chinese]] adherents of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=worldbook/&gt; Beikthano, one of the first Pyu centers, contains urbanesque foundations which include a monastery and [[stupa]]-like structures. These Pyu stupas, the first Indian foundations in Myanmar, were built from 200&amp;nbsp;BC to 100 CE and were sometimes used for burial. Early stupas, temples and pagodas are topped with ''htis'' and [[finial]]s or spires symbolizing Theravada Buddhist transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|date=|title=A Sacred and Public Place|url=|journal=Meio University|volume=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 9th century, the [[Bamar people]] had established a kingdom centered at [[Bagan]]. During the 11th century, King [[Anawrahta]] unified the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy Valley]] region and founded the [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Empire]]. Bagan, with over 10,000 of Myanmar's red brick [[stupa]]s and pagodas, had become a center of [[Buddhist architecture]] by the mid-12th century.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myanmar|last=|first=|publisher=World Book, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=The Pagan Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Pyu-style stupas were transformed into monuments reminiscent of alms bowls or gourd-shaped [[Dome|domes]], unbaked [[brick]], tapered and rising roofs, Buddha niches, polylobed [[Arch|arches]] and ornamental doorways influenced by India's [[Pala Empire]] and its monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myer|first=|title=Stupas and Stupa-Shrines|url=|journal=Artibus Asaie|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stucco]] was widely used in Bagan, especially by the Mon people. Stucco features of Bagan structures include garlands, flames or rays of the sun, peacock tail feathers and mythical creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dhammayazika Pagoda]] has a plan similar to the Tantric [[Paharpur, India|Paharpur]] stupa in India. It does not have a square base like many Bagan stupas; instead, it has a pentagonal base with radial halls and low [[Molding (decorative)|skirting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myer|title=Stupas and Stupa-Shrines|url=|journal=Artibus Asiae|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ananda Temple]] (finished in 1090), one of the first temples erected in Bagan, was influenced by Indian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/sid/513/myanmar/bagan/ananda-pahto-temple|title=Ananda Pahto Temple, Bagan, Myanmar|last=Fiala|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] temple represents the [[Theravada]] branch of Buddhism, Bagan's official religion when it was built. Architectural features of the temple include brick vaulted halls, Buddha statues, tapered roofs and the absence of [[Terrace (building)|terraces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myer|title=Stupas and Stupa-Shrines|url=|journal=Artibus Asiae|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple has one of the first uses of the [[pyatthat]], or tiered roof, which indicates the presence of a throne within. With both royal and religious symbolism, many of the temple's images depict the Buddha seated before an odd number of pyatthat tiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace: An Interim Report on Aspects of Design|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Bagan's historical monuments are well-preserved, due to the dry climate. Bagan, with one of the largest concentrations of temples in the world, is one of Myanmar's most important [[pilgrimage]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|title=Cultural Resilience vs. Historic Preservation|url=|journal=Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the temples' paintings and murals are still visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Today’s Pagan: Conservation Under the Generals|last=Pichard|first=Pierre|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=2013|isbn=978-3-642-35869-2|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable architectural sites in Bagan include the [[Bupaya Pagoda]], the [[Dhammayangyi Temple|Dhammayangyi]], [[Gawdawpalin Temple|Gawdawpalin]] and [[Htilominlo Temple]]s, the Inn-hpaya Stupa, the [[Mahabodhi Temple, Bagan|Mahabodhi Temple]], the [[Mingalazedi Pagoda]], the Minochantha stupa group, the Taung Kyaung monastery, the [[Nathlaung Kyaung Temple]], the Nga-kywe-na-daung Stupa, the Pahto Thamya and [[Shwegugyi Temple]]s, the [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and the [[Sulamani Temple|Sulamani]] and [[Thatbyinnyu Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/cid/131/myanmar/bagan|title=Bagan, Myanmar|last=Fiala|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burma was part of the British Empire by the end of the 1880s, and this ushered in a period of [[colonial architecture]]. Rangoon, now known as [[Yangon]], became a multi-ethnic capital.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Sacred and Public Space|last=Seekins|first=|publisher=Meio University|year=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As large, colonial buildings were built throughout the city, social disruption in Burma spawned nationalist rallies and anti-colonial protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myanmar|last=|first=|publisher=World Book, Inc.|isbn=|chapter=The Konbaung Dynasty and the Anglo-Saxon Burmese Wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yangon's [[Downtown Yangon|central business district]], along the [[Yangon River]], contains many colonial-era buildings. One example is the [[Ministers' Building]], built as the Secretariat Building in 1902 to house the British administration. Other downtown structures are the [[Bogyoke Market]] (formerly Scott Market) and the [[Strand Hotel]], built in 1896 by Aviet and Tigran Sarkie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|title=The State and the City: 1988 and the Transformation of Rangoon|url=|journal=Pacific Affairs|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent buildings include [[Yangon City Hall]], built between 1926 and 1936; the Customs House; the [[High Court Building (Yangon)|High Court Building]] (built in 1914 and converted to the High Court head office in 1962); the 1920 Inland Water Transport Authority Building, and the former Myanmar Railways headquarters.

== Notable structures ==
=== Shwedagon Pagoda ===
[[File:Shwedagon Pagoda 2017.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, spired building, surrounded by smaller spires|The Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon]]
[[File:Tachiliek Pagoda.jpg|thumb|The replica of Shwedagon pagoda in [[Tachileik]], [[Myanmar]]]]
The [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in Yangon is a [[stupa]] and a focal point of Buddhism in Myanmar. At 99.4 meters high,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the stupa is covered with [[gold leaf]] and [[Gilding|plate]].&lt;ref name="Seekins 5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|date=|title=A Sacred and Public Place|url=|journal=Meio University|volume=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded by smaller shrines, and is topped with a gem-encrusted ''seinbu'' (diamond bud)&lt;ref name="Seekins 5"/&gt; and a seven-tiered ''hti''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|date=|title=A Sacred and Public Place|url=|journal=Meio University|volume=|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing Burmese spirituality. Every four or five years, its gold is repaired or replaced. The stupa, built by a Theravada Buddhist society, is said to contain strands of the Buddha's hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|title=Grounds for protest|journal=The Institute of Postcolonial Studies|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seekins 2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|date=|title=A Sacred and Public Place|url=|journal=Meio University|volume=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built to be walked around, visitors pass astrological representations of the eight days of a Burmese week. The platform includes devotional centres at the [[cardinal direction|cardinal compass points]]&lt;ref name="Seekins 5"/&gt; and dozens of smaller stupas, including the Golden Elder. [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi trees]], images of the Buddha and other spiritual figures, and the 16-ton [[Singu Min Bell]] (formerly known as the Maha Ganda Bell) decorate the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|first=|date=|title=A Sacred and Public Place|url=|journal=Meio University|volume=|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pagoda has been a centre of Buddhist devotion and a forum for political activism. During the anti-colonial demonstrations of the nationalist [[Thakins|Thakin Party]] in 1938 and 1939, "strike centres" were set up around the pagoda. In 1988, as the [[Burmese Socialist Programme Party]] was [[8888 Uprising|collapsing]], Shwedagon was a platform for pro-democracy political demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Seekins 2"/&gt; On 26 August 1988, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] spoke before a large audience about democracy at the pagoda's west gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|title=The State and the City|url=|journal=Pacific Affairs|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandalay Palace ===
[[File:Great Audience Hall, Mandalay.jpg|thumb|alt=Ornate building with a bicycle parked outside|Great Audience Hall, [[Mandalay Palace]], 1903]]

The [[Mandalay Palace]] is an example of wooden architecture in Myanmar, which emphasizes exterior aesthetics rather than interior space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the late 1850s, some characteristics of the palace (such as cardinally-placed gates and a central palace structure) can be traced back to the early Pyu period. The primary east-west axis was constructed from the palace buildings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations from 11th century Pagan depict wooden buildings similar to those at the palace, and handiwork later found at Mandalay.

Only a section of the original palace remained after a 1945 fire, with examples of traditional [[stucco]] used in Burmese construction. The palace's Flower Distribution Centre contains several wooden, semicircular arches which may have been inspired by 19th-century European buildings. The stucco on these arches appears to represent rays of sunlight or [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its wood carvings and stucco, tiered roofs (''[[pyatthat]]'') are a feature of the palace. Inside, covered hallways lead to a small throne room which is topped by a ''pyatthat''. Many ''pyatthats'' on the palace, like those other Burmese structures, are parallel to monasteries and throne rooms. There is also a ''pyatthat'' over the Great Audience Hall. Due to the tropical climate, frequent renovations of the wood-and=stucco palace have been necessary; some of its original [[teak]] has been reinforced with concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Architectural features}}Features ==
=== Stucco and wood carving ===
[[File:Shwenandaw Kyaung, Mandalay 06.jpg|thumb|alt=Monastery exterior, with intricately-carved wood|[[Teak]] carvings of the [[Shwenandaw Monastery]]]]
[[Stucco]], introduced during the Bagan period, is strongly tied to [[Mon people|Mon]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wood carving]] in Myanmar is a traditional art which has survived for centuries. Due to its tropical climate (necessitating the reconstruction of many buildings), the craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Without these renovations, the art of wood carving would have been lost and it would have been impossible to reconstruct traditional features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|title=The Reconstruction of Mandalay Palace|url=|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|pages=335 &amp; 343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of gold ===
Gold cladding is a feature of traditional Burmese architecture, usually prominent in [[Gilding|gilded]] or gold-plated exteriors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The [[Bupaya Pagoda|Bupaya]], [[Shwedagon Pagoda|Shwedagon]], [[Shwezigon Pagoda|Shwezigon]] and [[Lawkananda Pagoda]]s have gold features.

== {{anchor|Threats to architecture}}Threats ==
During [[World War II]], many historical structures were lost or damaged; much of the Mandalay Palace was destroyed in a fire near the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandawunshwebagan.com/mandalay/palace.html|title=Mandalay Palace - Myanmar Travel|website=www.gandawunshwebagan.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, on alleged orders from [[Ne Win]], the [[University of Yangon|Rangoon University]] Students' Union was [[1962 Rangoon University protests|demolished]] (although the main campus still contains lecture and residence halls from the colonial period).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|title=The State and the City|url=|journal=Pacific Affairs|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, many colonial structures (including a block of cinemas) have been razed for new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seekins|title=The State and the City|url=|journal=Pacific Affairs|pages=270–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yangon Heritage Trust]], formed in 2012, is a non-governmental organization committed to preserving Yangon's historic architecture. The trust has had several preservation successes, due to its public-awareness campaigns. Agreements with government officials have saved the former Indian and U.S. Embassy buildings and [[Gandhi Hall, Yangon|Gandhi Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girke|date=|title=The Yangon Court Buildings|url=|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|pages=72–104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National College of Art and Design''' ('''NCAD''') is Ireland's oldest art institution, offering the largest range of art and design degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate level in the country.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Originating as a drawing school in 1746, many of the most important Irish artists, designers and art educators have studied or taught in the college. NCAD has always been located in central Dublin, and in 1980 it relocated to the historic [[The_Liberties,_Dublin|Liberties]] area. The College has around 950 full-time students and a further 600 pursuing part-time courses,&lt;ref name="AboutNCAD"&gt;{{cite web |title=About NCAD - structure |url=https://www.ncad.ie/about/structure/ |website=National College of Art and Design |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NCAD's students come from more than forty countries. NCAD is a Recognised College of [[University_College_Dublin|University College Dublin]]. It is also a member of the [[European League of Institutes of the Arts]].

==History==
===Overview===
The National College of Art and Design can trace its origins in an unbroken line back to the drawing school set up by [[Robert West (painter)|Robert West]] in George's Lane, in 1746, and then sponsored by the Dublin Society. The institution has been influenced in turn by the French Enlightenment, the Victorian schools of design, including industrial design, the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], the search for Irish national identity and innovations in British art education in the 1960s.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The school has also played a role in Irish social and cultural developments - it had a significant influence on the eighteenth century Irish school of painting and sculpture and it also affected the standard of applied ornament in architecture and crafts. Most{{cn|date=November 2018}} Irish artists of importance have spent some time in the college, and in the twentieth century the teaching staff has included [[William Orpen|Sir William Orpen]], [[Oliver Sheppard]], Oswald Reeves, [[Harry Clarke]], [[Seán Keating]], Maurice MacGonigal, Laurence Campbell and Bernardus Romein.

The opening up of Irish culture in the 1960s had a profound effect on the college, resulting in years of student disturbances and closures by the government. Central to this was the debate about Modernism versus traditional discipline and the control exercised by the Department of Education and its predecessors. There was also the pressure for industrial design reform in face of the new economic future of an independent Ireland, and again within the Common Market. The consequence of all this revolution was a statute of 1971 which re-established the college, granting it freedom to run its own affairs academically. The college was further restructured in 1975 and a wide range of degree courses developed.

Following its relocation to Thomas Street in the early 1980s, the college expanded its offer of undergraduate courses and introduced a range of postgraduate courses and research based options up to PhD level.

===Timeline===
====The early years====
* 1746: The Dublin Society (subsequently the [[Royal Dublin Society]]) decided to subsidise Robert West's Drawing School in George's Lane (later Georges Street) by means of student premiums.
* 1750:  the Dublin Society set aside rooms for a drawing school at their premises in Shaw's Court off Dame Street - the stables there were converted into drawing schools. West was the Master of the ''Figure School'' and James Marrin was the Master of the ''Landscape and Ornamental School''. Later [[Thomas Ivory]] was Master of the ''Architectural School''. Throughout the 18th century, the Dublin Parliament gave an annual grant to the Dublin Society, which included support for the school. In fact this was the only state supported school in Great Britain and Ireland.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Society awarded prizes and medals to the best students annually, as well as to the Irish artistic community at large.
* 1767: the Society moved to a new building in [[Grafton Street]], to which the Drawing Schools were moved later from Shaw's Court.
* 1796: The Society and its Schools were established in Hawkins Street.
====After the Act of Union====
* 1800: From this year the State subsidy began to come from the United Kingdom parliament at Westminster. This led to a great deal of ongoing friction with the Treasury and other branches of government in London, as the Westminster establishment was much less sympathetic to the Society and its work and sought to centralise direct control from London.
* 1811: A fourth school — in addition to Figure Drawing, Landscape &amp; Ornamental Drawing, and Architectural Drawing — was added: the School of Modelling, to which the eminent Irish sculptor [[Edward Smyth (sculptor)|Edward Smyth]] was appointed as Head. All Schools, with the exception of the School of Modelling, offered only drawing — no painting. The method of teaching was by means of drawing the nude model, the antique, copying prints and drawings. The training in drawing ornamental patterns was a key element, becoming the chief element after 1854.
* 1815: The Society moved to [[Leinster House]] on Kildare Street and shortly afterwards converted stables for use as a drawing school. The stables were on a site later used by the [[National Library of Ireland|National Library]].
* 1820: The Dublin Society became the Royal Dublin Society.
* 1827: Permanent drawing schools were built beside Leinster House together with the gallery overhead which was used to exhibit the Society's teaching collection of sculpture and works of art generally. The schools were below, in the basement.
====London oversight====
* 1849: The Board of Trade in London took control of the School as a school of design (for industry) and gave it a direct vote of funding, which was managed by the Royal Dublin Society.
* 1854: Control of the School now passed to the newly established Department of Science and Art, based in South Kensington, London. The School was made to conform to the new London syllabus emphasising design education. Fine art education in the later 19th century in Ireland was the province of the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]].
====State institution====
* 1877: The School was bought out from the Royal Dublin Society by the British Government and becomes the '''Dublin Metropolitan School of Art''', a school wholly centrally-supported through the Department of Science and Art, dealing locally with the Director of Science and Art in Dublin, who was also responsible for the Library and Museum and certain other institutions. During the late 19th century design for lace was promoted in the School as well as throughout Ireland.
====Dublin oversight====
* 1900: Control passed to the newly-established Irish Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, established by [[Horace Plunkett]] and based on Merrion Street, albeit with the funding vote still coming from the Treasury in London. Major reforms were introduced before [[World War I|the Great War]], notably the development of craft classes, particularly in stained glass (students included [[Harry Clarke]], Michael Healy and Wilhelmina Geddes), enamels and metalwork, as well as life classes taught by [[William Orpen]].
* 1914: From this date onward the school experienced difficulties in terms of resources, which subsequent political instability only increased.
* 1924: The Department of Education of the indendent Irish state took over the control of the Metropolitan School of Art. 
====National College of Art====
* 1936: The Metropolitan School of Art became the '''National College of Art''', with professorships of Design, Painting, and Sculpture. Weaving and Ceramics departments were subsequently added.
* 1969: After a series of adverse reports asking for reform at the College, a crisis situation developed leading to periodic closures of the School by the Government.
====National College of Art and Design====
* 1971: The National College of Art and Design Act was passed by the Oireachtas - it was to be governed by a board (An Bord) appointed by the Minister for Education.
* 1972: May 1st was the ''establishment day'' of the '''National College of Art and Design''' (Coláiste Náisiúnta Elaíne is Deartha).
* 1974: Jonah Jones was appointed Director.
* 1975: The Faculty structure was adopted: Faculty of Fine Art (with departments of Painting, Printmaking, Sculpture); Faculty of Design (with departments of Craft, Fashion and Textiles, Industrial Design, Visual Communications); Faculty of History of Art and Design and Complementary Studies; Faculty of Education and Extra Mural Studies; Department of Pre-Diploma Studies (First year common course). 
* 1976: NCAD received designation under the Higher Education Authority. 
====Thomas Street====
* 1980: Noel Sheridan was appointed Director. Purchase of Powers Distillery premises at Thomas Street. Department of Visual Communication moved into the new buildings, with other departments moving to the campus over subsequent years. Degrees awarded for the first time. 
* 1984: Degree courses in Visual Communication and Industrial Design validated by the National Council for Education Awards with the designation Bachelor of Design (B Des).
* 1985: Degree courses in Fine Art, and in History of Art with Fine Art validated by the NCEA with the designation of BA.
* 1988: First MA Degree awarded. First Honorary ANCAD awarded.
* 1989: Noel Sheridan took a sabbatical to work in Australia, and for stability, a full Director was appointed, Professor John Turpin.
* 1994: Noel Sheridan returned as Director.
* 1995: December: Commencement of celebrations to mark NCAD's 250th anniversary, with an ecumenical service in Christ Church Cathedral attended by President Mary Robinson.
* 1996: NCAD 250 celebrations continued with the publication of Professor John Turpin’s History of the College and exhibitions of graduate work at a variety of city venues including the RHA Gallagher Gallery. The College became a Recognised College of the National University of Ireland.
* 1998: The College vacated the Leinster Lane premises, which it had occupied since 1827, and acquired the old Thomas Street Fire Station, renamed Harry Clarke House and now with lecturing and staff facilities. The new School of Design for Industry was completed and ready (dedicated Design For Industry Building commissioned). The College awarded its first PhD.

====NUI College====
* 1999: First intake of students under the NUI validation of courses.
* 2000: Formal signing ceremony of the College’s association with the National University of Ireland in January 2000 attended by An Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, T.D., the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland, Dr Garrett FitzGerald, members of the NUI Senate, the Department of Education and Science, Higher Education Authority and National Council for Educational Awards.
* 2001: New courses approved by the NUI: NUI Certificate in Drawing and Visual Investigation; NUI Higher Diploma in Community Arts Education; NUI Diploma in Art Teaching; MA in History of Art and Applied Arts; MA in Virtual Realities.
* 2006: Three taught Masters introduced: MA Design History and Material Culture; MA Art in the Digital World; MA Art in the Contemporary World.
* 2009: An Bord endorsed the Academic Council’s decision to move to a 3 year undergraduate degree structure with a progression of continuation to a two year Masters and beyond, a further three year Doctoral/PhD process.
* 2009: Opening of NCAD Gallery (with staff room and studio space overhead).
* 2010: NCAD entered into dialogue with both TCD and UCD regarding validation of the College’s awards, and on critical connections that could be developed between each of the institutions. In June 2010 An Bord took the strategic decision to pursue discussions only with UCD with a view to forming a strategic alliance with that university.

====UCD College====
* 2011: NCAD changed from being a Recognised College of NUI to being a Recognised College of UCD, and NCAD degrees are since then validated by UCD.
* 2018: January: Sarah Glennie, former director of IMMA, assumed the Directorship of NCAD
==Campus==
For most of its history NCAD was located in Kildare Street, in a series of buildings adjoining the [[Dail_Eireann|Dáil]] (Parliament) and the National Library of Ireland. With increasing student numbers and a requirement for additional space by the Dail, the College relocated to the Liberties in the early 1980s, to a site at 100 Thomas Street which was formerly the home of Power's Whiskey Distillery. 

The six acre campus is located next door to the landmark Church of St Augustine and St John, by Gothic revivalist Edward Welby Pugin (begun 1862) which features stained glass by NCAD graduates, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke (and his studio).

The campus comprises a mixture of 19th, 20th and 21st century buildings. The largest of the original Powers Distillery buildings is the five-storey Granary, crowned by a cupola with weather vane bearing the date 1817. Other original buildings utilised by the college include the Counting House and Offices (now housing College Administration), designed by C. W. Caroe (c.1876), the Clock Building, and the Distiller's Residence. Distinguishing features associated with the manufacture of whiskey include three of the original giant pot stills, once enclosed but now located on the periphery of Red Square (part of the original kiln building is now integrated into the Library annex), along with two of the original five engine houses, including the most notable, Engine House No. 5 with its 250 horse power beam engine, and the smaller of the original two chimney stacks. The majority of full-time students have dedicated studio space in either the Granary or in the Design For Industry Building (built 1998). The student café, which was originally Power's staff canteen, is located in the vaulted basement of the Counting House and Offices.

In the 1998 the College acquired the old Thomas Street Fire Station, Dublin's first motorised fire station, which was designed by Charles J. McCarthy (1911). Renamed Harry Clarke House, it now houses a lecture theatre, seminar rooms and staff offices. Between it and the Counting House is the modernist NCAD Gallery (with staff room and studio space overhead) which was designed by Murray O'Laoire and opened in 2009.

Since 2017 the College campus has featured in Dubline (Dublin Discovery Trail), the self-guided tour which introduces visitors to both the contemporary college and the history of the site and the buildings.

==Notable Facilities on Campus==
* The Edward Murphy Library, located in The Granary, is named after the College's long-serving Head Librarian and founder of NIVAL; it has an extensive collection of material relating to 19th, 20th and 21st century art, design and visual culture, and holds over 960,000 books. 

* NIVAL (National Irish Visual Arts Library) is located in the Clock Building on the campus and is a public research resource dedicated to the documentation of twentieth and twenty-first century Irish visual art and design. It collects, stores and makes accessible for research an unparalleled collection of documentation about Irish art and design in all media.

* The NCAD Gallery is a modernist exhibition space which has an ongoing programme of exhibitions by national and international artists as well as shorter displays of work by current students.

* Distillers Press is NCAD's typography and Letterpress printing workshop, located in the Department of Communications Design. The focus of the Press is on education and experimentation in typography and relief-based image making. The press holds a significant collection of printing equipment and wooden and metal type from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

* Origin8 is a centre for commercialisation and innovation, where campus spin-outs work to establish their business and design researchers collaborate with companies across a range of industries.

==Academic structure==
NCAD consists of four schools: Design, Fine Art, Visual Culture and Education which provide a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses, and research-based study up to PhD level.

==== Undergraduate ====
In the Schools of Fine Art, Design, and Education, students enter a common First Year to undertake a three year BA (Honours) degree which includes an inter-disciplinary first semester. BA Degree specialisms are available in Ceramics &amp; Glass, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interaction Design, Jewellery &amp; Objects, Media, Print, Product Design, Sculpture &amp; Expanded Practice, Textile Art &amp; Artefact, and Textile &amp; Surface Design. Additionally, in conjunction with School of Education, students may avail of a four year Joint Honours BA Degree (to qualify to teach at second level) in combination with any of the College's specialisms. Visual Culture is a component of all degree courses and the School of Visual Culture also offers a single (non studio-based) three year Degree pathway. There is also a Visual Culture Joint Honours option in combination with any of the College's specialisms.
From the academic year 2018/19 NCAD has stated its intention to introduce Studio+ which will allow all Fine Art and Design students to take an extended four year degree which will provide options to study abroad through the Erasmus programme or to gain practical work experience in the form of industry placement on live commercial, social, or community projects in Ireland or abroad. Students will be awarded a BA in Design or Fine Art or a BA International.

It was made into a television special, a book, and a [[compact disc]], all with the same title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900473.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1 Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer], review, Todd Everett, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', February 19, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74065814.html?dids=74065814:74065814&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT Beware The Mild Man!

== DVD ==
In 2005, the [[DVD]] ''Complete Denis Leary'' was released. A collection of his most famous stand-up performances including: ''No Cure for Cancer'' and ''[[Lock 'n Load (album)|Lock 'n Load]]''. Special features include: the music videos for "Asshole" and "Love Barge", and the ''Making of No Cure for Cancer'', a documentary with Leary and others.

== Accusations of plagiarism of Bill Hicks ==
Although Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]] for many years, when Hicks heard ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt that Leary had stolen his act. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several comedians have publicly stated they believe Leary stole Hicks' persona and attitude, in addition to his material.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92 | archivedate=2007-06-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes on the album about [[Keith Richards]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and "[[Jim Fixx|good men dying young]]" are frequently cited as bearing similarities to Hicks' routines.

In the August 2006 ''[[Playboy]]'', an interviewer told Leary, "Much has been written about you and comedian Bill Hicks...People have accused you of appropriating his persona and material." Leary replied:

{{cquote|That's a great story that people like to latch onto...Very quickly we got New York club owners saying, 'You guys are too alike,' while I was saying, 'What are they fucking talking about?' It's the same approach to the subject maybe, but it's not the same act...But as I've said many times, a fable is sometimes better than the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last=Leary | first=Denis | work=[[Playboy Magazine]] |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Cynthia True]]'s biography ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'', after listening to ''No Cure For Cancer'', Hicks was furious. "All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."&lt;ref name = "oouuos"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | first=Cynthia |last=True | year=2002 | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | isbn=0-380-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odessa's Philharmonic Theatre''' ({{lang-uk|Одеська державна філармонія}}, {{lang-ru|Одесская филармония}}) is a [[theater]] in [[Odessa, Ukraine]]. The design resembles the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite book

| publisher = Raduga Publishers | location = Moscow | id = | url =  http://www.2odessa.com/wiki/index.php?title=Odessa_a_guide}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation stone for the theater was laid September 3, 1894, a day after [[Odessa]]'s one-hundred-year birthday. The building was intended as the new stock exchange, or "New Exchange" to replace the old stock exchange, and the vast hall was decorated with six panels by the artist [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Karazin]] (1842-1908) &lt;!--full name and birthday/death from http://web.artprice.com/artistdetails.aspx?idArti=NjQxNTM1ODYwNDY1MDUyLQ==&amp;src=3--&gt; which depict commerce throughout various stages of history.&lt;ref name="guide2"&gt;Kononova p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pat1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Herlihy | first = Patricia| origyear = 1987| year = 1991 | title = Odessa: A History, 1794-1914
| publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-916458-15-6 }} p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Odessa Opera Theater]] before it, a world competition was announced for a conceptual design of a new Odessa stock exchange. The design of Czech architect V.J. Prohaska was considered the best. But this design did not meet all of the requirements, therefore it was modified and improved by [[Alexander Osipovich Bernardacci]].

Construction was completed in 1898. Since 1924 the building has housed the Odessa Philharmonic.

==Construction==
The theater can seat 1,000 people and is 15 meters high and 910 square meters. The large hall has no supporting columns, and because of this, it was one of the most expensive buildings in Odessa to build.&lt;ref name="guide4"&gt;Kononova, p.107, 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pat2"&gt;Herlihy, p. 267, states the main hall is 60 meters by 120 meters&lt;/ref&gt;

The main entrance is  by a large open-sided, roofed gallery, called a [[loggia]].  The ceiling of this open entry is painted with the twelve symbols of the [[Zodiac]].&lt;ref name="guide4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pat2" /&gt;

The interior is paneled with dark [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] cedar, and the windows are set in white [[Carrara]] marble.&lt;ref name="pat3"&gt;Herlihy, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interesting Mythology==
It is an enduring myth that everyone in the city knows (and continues to promulgate) that since the building was originally designed as a [[Stock exchange]] rather than a concert hall it was made to be sound-resistant, rather than sound-conducting, in order to provide more privacy to visitors. This supposedly explains why the acoustics are rather poor, as compared with other theaters and concert halls, and performers must use microphones and amplifiers to be heard adequately. The precise and technical reasons for the acoustic problems at the hall were reported by world famous acoustics consultant Russell Johnson, the specifics of which can be found on the Philharmonic's website (http://www.odessaphilharmonic.org/pages.php?page=conc)

'''Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds''' is a [[fictional character]] in the novels ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bUaYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;dq=Athos+three+musketeers+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r-elmbv8YG&amp;sig=XIZ8CzRUu9QwhPkbsSP4qzXBRks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzDCVNTiC8yVatPIgIAJ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Athos%20three%20musketeers%20analysis&amp;f=false|title=The Social Psychology of Communication|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other two [[musketeer]]s, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Aramis]], are friends of the novel's protagonist, [[d'Artagnan]].

In ''The Three Musketeers'' his [[family name]] is du Vallon. In ''Twenty Years After'', having made a financially advantageous marriage, he is first known as du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=20 Years After|publisher=The World's Classics|isbn=0-19-283074-0|pages=110–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he earns the title of [[Baron]].

Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers. His eating abilities even impress [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] during a banquet at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. As the story advances, he looks more and more like a giant, and his death is that of a [[titan (mythology)|titan]].

At the time of ''The Three Musketeers'' (ca. 1627) he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from. He was finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer's somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing and later married) to equip himself for the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].

The fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical [[musketeer]] [[Isaac de Porthau]].

'''Pre-Columbian art''' refers to the [[Visual arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|visual arts of indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]],  [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]]s until the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and the time period marked by [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Americas.

[[Pre-Columbian]] art thrived throughout the [[Americas]] from at least 13,000 BCE to the European conquests, and sometimes continued for a time afterwards. Many [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] did not have writing systems, so visual art expressed [[cosmology|cosmologies]], [[world view]]s, religion, and philosophy of these cultures, as well as serving as [[mnemonic]] devices.

During the period before and after [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] and conquest of the Americas, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. For many of these cultures, the visual arts went beyond physical appearance and served as active extensions of their owners and indices of the divine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J.

Moreover,
many societies used raw materials not available in the geographic location in which they were situated, suggesting difficulty of acquisition as a source of value.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
The Mesoamerican cultures are generally divided into three periods (see [[Mesoamerican chronology]]):

*Pre-classic (up to 200 CE)
*Classic (ca. 200–900 CE)
*Post-classic (ca. 900 to 1580 CE).

The Pre-classic period was dominated by the highly developed [[Olmec]] civilization, which flourished around 1200–400 BCE. The Olmecs produced [[jade]] figurines, and created heavy-featured, [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]], up to 2 meters (8&amp;nbsp;ft) high, that still stand mysteriously in the landscape. The Mesoamerican tradition of building large ceremonial centres appears to have begun under the Olmecs.

During the Classic period the dominant Civilization was the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Maya royalty commissioned artwork that commemorated their achievements and secured their place in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes depicting various rituals and historical events are embedded with hieroglyphic text to enable the viewer to identify the important figures, times and places instead of relying upon physical features that could be forgotten over time. The interpretation of the actions represented in the artwork goes hand in hand with  understanding the decorative text that is woven into the picture. Unlocking this hieroglyphic text is vital as it removes anonymity and mystery from the scenes and reveals detailed records of those who held power throughout the timeline of the civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mississippian peoples of North America such as the Choctaw and Natchez, the Maya organized themselves into large, agricultural communities. They practised their own forms of [[Maya hieroglyphics|hieroglyphic writing]] and even advanced [[astronomy]]. Mayan art consequently focuses on rain, [[agriculture]], and [[fertility]], expressing these images mainly in relief and surface decoration, as well as some sculpture. [[Glyphs]] and stylized figures were used to decorate architecture such as the pyramid temple of [[Chichén Itzá]]. Murals dating from about 750 CE were discovered when the city of Bonampak was excavated in 1946.

The Post-classic period (10th–12th centuries) was dominated by the [[Toltecs]] who made colossal, block-like sculptures such as those employed as free-standing columns at Tula, [[Mexico]]. The [[Mixtecs]] developed a style of painting known as Mixtec-Puebla, as seen in their murals and codices (manuscripts), in which all available space is covered by flat figures in geometric designs. The [[Aztec]] culture in Mexico produced some dramatically expressive examples of Aztec art, such as the decorated skulls of captives and stone sculpture, of which Tlazolteotl (Woods Bliss Collection, Washington), a goddess in childbirth, is a good example.

==South America==
In the [[Andean]] region of South America (modern-day [[Peru]]), the [[Chavin culture|Chavín civilization]] flourished from around 1000 BCE to 300 BCE. The Chavín produced small-scale pottery, often human in shape but with animal features such as bird feet, reptilian eyes, or feline fangs. Representations of jaguar are a common theme in Chavín art. The Chavin culture is also noted for the spectacular murals and carvings found its main religious site of [[Chavin de Huantar]]; these works include the [[Raimondi Stela]], the [[Lanzón]], and the Tello Obelisk.

Contemporary with the Chavin was the '''[[Paracas culture]]''' of the southern coast of Peru, most noted today for their elaborate textiles. These amazing productions, some of which could measure ninety feet long, were primarily used for as burial wraps for Paracas mummy bundles. Paracas art was greatly influenced by the Chavín cult, and the two styles share many common motifs.

On the south coast, the Paracas were immediately succeeded by a flowering of artistic production around the [[Nazca]] river valley. The '''[[Nazca]]''' period is divided into eight ceramic phases, each one depicting increasingly abstract animal and human motifs. These period range from Phase 1, beginning around 200 CE, to Phase 8, which declined in the middle of the eighth century. The Nasca people are most famous for the [[Nazca lines]], though they are usually regarded as making some of the most beautiful polychrome ceramics in the Andes.

On the north coast, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] succeeded the Chavin. The Moche flourished about 100–800 CE, and were among the best artisans of the Pre-Columbian world, producing [[Moche portrait vessel|delightful portrait vases]] (Moche ware), which, while realistic, are steeped in religious references, the significance of which is now lost. For the Moche, ceramics functioned as a primary way of disseminating information and cultural ideas. The Moche made ceramic vessels that depicted and re-created a plethora of objects: fruits, plants, animals, human portrais, gods, demons, as well as graphic depictions of sexual acts. The Moche are also noted for their metallurgy (such as that found in the tomb of the [[Lord of Sípan]]), as well as their architectural prowess, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca del Sol]] in the Moche River valley.

Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the [[Huari culture|Wari]] (or Huari) Empire, based in their capital city of the same name. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the [[Staff God]], an important deity in the Andes which during the Wari period had become specifically associated with the [[Lake Titicaca]] region on the modern Peru-Bolivia border. Similarly, the Wari's contemporaries of the [[Tiwanaku]] empire, also centered around a capital city of the same name, held the [[Staff God]] in similar esteem. Tiwanaku's empire began to expand out of  Titicaca around 400 BCE, but its "Classic Period" of artistic production and political power occurred between 375 and 700 CE. Tiwanaku is currently known for its magnificent imperial city on the southern side of Lake Titicaca, now in modern-day Bolivia. Especially famous is the [[Gate of the Sun]], which depicts a large image of the Staff God flanked by other religious symbols which may have functioned as a calendar.

Following the decline of the Wari Empire in the late first millennium, the [[Chimú]] people, centered out of their capital city of [[Chimor]] began to build their empire on the north and central coasts of Peru. The Chimú were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as [[Sican culture#Early Sican|Sicán]] (700-900 CE) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chimú in the early second millennium. The Chimú produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chimú also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chimú. The Chimú are best known for their magnificent palatial complex of [[Chan Chan]] just south of modern-day [[Trujillo, Peru]]; now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The Chimú went into decline very quickly due to outside pressures and conquest from the expanding [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-15th century.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the [[Inca Empire]] (Tawantinsuyu in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the "Land of the Four Quarters") was the largest and wealthiest empire in the world, and this was depicted in their art. Most Inca sculpture was melted down by the invading Spanish, so most of what remains today is in the form of architecture, textiles, and ceramics. The Inca valued gold among all other metals, and equated it with the sun god [[Inti]]. Some Inca buildings in the capital of [[Cusco]] were literally covered in gold, and most contained many gold and silver sculptures. Most Inca art, however, was abstract in nature. Inca ceramics were primarily large vessels covered in geometric designs. Inca tunics and textiles contained similar motifs, often checkerboard patterns reserved for the Inca elite and the Inca army. Today, due to the unpopularity of abstract art and the lack of Inca gold and silver sculpture, the Inca are best known for the architecture - specifically the complex of [[Machu Picchu]] just northwest of Cusco. Inca architecture makes use of large stone blocks, each one cut specifically to fit around the other blocks in a wall. These stones were cut with such precision that the Incas did not need to make use of mortar to hold their buildings together. Even without mortar, Inca buildings still stand today; they form many of the foundations for even modern-day buildings in Cusco and the surrounding area. The Incas produced thousand of large stone structures, among them forts, temples, and palaces, even though the Inca Empire lasted for only ninety-five years.

The '''Prague Provisional Theatre''' ({{lang-cz|'''Prozatímní divadlo'''}}, {{IPA-cs|ˈprozaciːmɲiː ˈɟivadlo}}) was erected in 1862 as a temporary home for Czech drama and opera until a permanent National Theatre could be built. It opened on 18 November 1862 and functioned for 20 years, during which time over 5,000 performances were presented. Between 1866 and 1876 the theatre staged the premieres of four of [[Bedřich Smetana]]'s operas, including ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. The Provisional Theatre building was eventually incorporated into the structure of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], which opened its doors on 11 June 1881.

==Origins==
[[File:Jan Nepomuk Mayr.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Nepomuk Maýr]], first Principal Conductor of the Prague Provisional Theatre]]
Before the early 1860s almost all cultural institutions in Prague, including theatre and opera, were in Austrian hands. [[Bohemia]] was a province of the [[Habsburg Empire]], and under that regime's absolutist rule most aspects of Czech culture and national life had been discouraged or suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 697&lt;/ref&gt; Absolutism was formally abolished by a decree of the [[Emperor Franz Josef]] on 20 October 1860, which led to a Czech cultural revival.&lt;ref name= Large114&gt;Large, pp. 114–15&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian ''Diet'' (parliament) had acquired a site in Prague on the banks of the [[Vltava]], and in 1861 announced a public subscription, which raised a sum of 106,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]].&lt;ref name= Large114/&gt; This covered the costs of building a small 800-seat theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 698&lt;/ref&gt; which would act as a home for production of Czech drama and opera while longer-term plans for a permanent National Theatre could be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;
The Provisional Theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of [[Vítězslav Hálek]]'s tragic drama ''King Vukašín''.&lt;ref name= Large124&gt;Large, pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was at the time no Czech opera deemed suitable, the first opera performed at the theatre, on 20 November 1862, was [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]]'s ''[[Les deux journées]]''.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt; For the first year or so of its life, the Provisional Theatre alternated opera with straight plays on a daily basis, but from the start of 1864 opera performances were given daily.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Bedrich Smetana.jpg|thumb|upright|Bedřich Smetana, who succeeded Maýr as Principal Conductor, and was in turn succeeded by him]]
The first principal conductor (or musical director) of the Provisional Theatre, appointed in the autumn of 1862, was Jan Nepomuk Maýr &amp;ndash; to the disappointment of Smetana, who had hoped for the position himself.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt; Maýr held the position until September 1866; his tenure was marked by a professional rivalry with Smetana, who criticised the theatre's conservatism and failure to fulfil its mission to promote Czech opera.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr retaliated by refusing to conduct Smetana's ''[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; A change in the theatre's management in 1866 led to Maýr's removal and replacement by Smetana, who held the post for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Ott&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlová|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedřich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr's bias in favour of Italian opera was replaced by Smetana's more balanced repertoire, which mixed Italian, German and French pieces with such Slavonic and Czech works as he could find.&lt;ref name= Large207&gt;Large, pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his own compositions (''The Bartered Bride'', ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'' and ''[[Dalibor (opera)|Dalibor]]'', Smetana introduced works by the Czech composers Lepold Eugen Měchura and [[Josef Rozkošný]],&lt;ref name= Large207/&gt; but was nevertheless attacked by some parts of the music establishment for giving insufficient encouragement to native talent. Efforts to remove him from his post, and to reinstate Maýr, were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Large, pp. 233–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Smetana was responsible for the establishment of an independent school attached to the theatre. He became the school's director and professor of theory.&lt;ref name= Large206&gt;Large, pp. 206–07&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1874 Smetana became afflicted with deafness, which forced him to yield his duties as principal conductor to his assistant Adolf Čech, and to resign his post later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr was reappointed to the conductorship;&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; he had no interest in the school, which subsequently closed.&lt;ref name= Large206/&gt; The Provisional Theatre continued as the main venue for Czech opera, several of [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s works being premiered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The historical development of Czech theatre|url= http://www.czech.cz/en/culture/czech-arts/theater/historical-development-of-czech-theater?i=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430142314/http://www.czech.cz/en/culture/czech-arts/theater/historical-development-of-czech-theater?i=|archivedate=30 April 2009|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]]|accessdate= 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the theatre was incorporated into the [[National Theatre (Prague)|Czech National Theatre building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The National Theatre|url= http://www.narodni-divadlo.cz/Default.aspx?jz=en&amp;dk=text.aspx&amp;it=39&amp;sb=0|publisher= Narodni divaldo|accessdate= 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened on 11 June.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the new building was badly damaged by fire and remained closed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 702&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Provisional Theatre continued to operate, using other theatre premises.

[[File:ReinaTodoslosSantos.jpg|thumb|Regalia accessories for ''Our Lady of All Saints''. Note the solid brass ''Aureola'' or halo. Spain, 2008.]] 
A '''''{{lang|es|santo}}''''' ([[English language|English]]: '[[Saint (Catholicism)|saint]]') is a piece of one of various religious art forms found in [[Spain]] and areas that [[Spanish Empire|were colonies]] of the [[Kingdom of Spain]], consisting of wooden or ivory statues that depict various saints, [[angel]]s, or [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] titles, or one of the personages of the [[Holy Trinity]]. A '''''{{lang|es|santero}}''''' (female: '''''{{lang|es|santera}}''''') is a craftsperson who makes the image. Some ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' which have gained greater public devotion among the faithful have also merited [[Pope|papal]] approval through [[canonical coronation]]s.  ''{{lang|es|Santos}}'' remain a living tradition of [[religious iconography]] and [[folk art]] in [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]] and some other [[Caribbean]] islands, [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], especially [[New Mexico]].

==History and terminology==
[[Icon]]s and other religious images were crucial for the conversions of indigenous peoples to [[Roman Catholic Church]], which was itself an integral part of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. However, long distances, inefficient methods of transportation, and high demand for such artworks limited the ability of ecclesiastical authorities to supply [[Diocese|parish]] churches, especially those in remote outposts, with works of religious art from the Kingdom of Spain.
 
The practice of creating ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' began in Spain, where [[mannequin]]-style religious images were commonly [[Vestment|vested]] in ornate religious clothing, often expensive and funded by religious devotees. An early known example is the 1555 statue of [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], already vested during the time of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]]. Customarily, jewels are various accessories were also added onto larger ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', a tradition still carried on today. While larger pieces are typically used in churches, many smaller ones are personal or family items of reverence, or kept as decorations.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt; ''{{lang|es|Santos}}'' are also common throughout [[Latin America]], the [[Spanish West Indies|Spanish Caribbean]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], as well as the [[Philippines]], with distinct styles and traditions in each area.

''{{lang|es|Santo}}'' statues and statuettes, carved [[Sculpture#Types of sculpture|in the round]], are commonly known as '''''{{lang|es|revultos}}''''' or informally as '''''{{lang|es|bultos}}'''''. They are usually made of wood.  Larger scenic pieces, including multiple statues or done in [[bas relief]], or simply painted on wood panels, and which may include non-figural iconography, are called '''''{{lang|es|retablos}}''''', originally [[Reredos|altar backboards or screens]], though today often adapted to secular artistic purposes in the [[Chicano art movement]] {{crossref|(for more information, see [[Retablo]])}}.

Among ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'', two distinct types are often noted, the '''''{{lang|es|bastidor}}''''' ('frame', 'structure') style, a mannequin intended to be dressed with clothing and accessories, and the '''''{{lang|es|detallado}}''''' ('detailed') style, with adornments painted on permanently (though sometimes also featuring added items). ''{{lang|es|Bastidores}}'' often have interchangeable or posable arms, and sometimes feature a cage-like lattice (thus the name) to hold and shape the vestments.

[[Ivory]] was often cited as the best and most expensive material for carving ''{{lang|es|santos}}''. [[Elephant ivory]], especially of African origin, has been restricted or banned from sale, distribution, or commercialization in Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and many other countries.  While exact laws vary by jurisdiction (from total bans to legal sale of antiques only), ivory is now rarely used.  While the most economical modern type of ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' are made of [[Synthetic resin|resin]] or [[fiberglass]], and mass-produced, traditional examples are still made primarily of wood, sometimes with metal accessories.

==In the Philippines==
[[File:Our Lady of La Naval de Manila.jpg|Our Lady of La Naval de Manila.jpg|thumb|Often called the "Grandest Marian icon" in the Philippines, the image of [[Our Lady of La Naval de Manila]] is an ivory statue, with gold bullion embroidered vestments and jeweled crowns among its regalia. ''{{lang|es|Santo}}'' collectors also own medium-sized replicas of this image.]]

The ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' culture in the Philippines is widely prevalent among [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]], having been influenced by [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|centuries of Spain colonial rule]] and various forms of [[folk Catholicism]]. The earliest recorded vested ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' in the Philippines is the [[Santo Niño de Cebu]], a baptismal gift given by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to [[Rajah Humabon]]'s [[Queen consort|consort]] in 1521.

In the Spanish period, only the nobility (such as the ''{{lang|es|[[Principalía]]}}'') and the rich could afford to have Santo, due to their elaborate ornamentation and design. The procurement and maintenance of Santo is today still considered costly, with the most expensive type of Santo are ones made of ''{{lang|es|marfil}}'' (ivory). From a religious perspective, the practice of owning and maintaining ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' images are often regarded as a mild [[Catechism]] for people, especially with regards to the iconographic attributes attached to specific images. A custodian or family of custodians of a ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' are termed ''{{lang|es|camarero}}'' (female: ''{{lang|es|camarera}}'', plural ''{{lang|es|camararos}}''), which in modern Spanish means '[[waiting staff]]'.

The most well-known ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' in the Philippines are often Marian titles, such Our Lady of Manaoag and [[Our Lady of La Naval de Manila]], while those of [[Jesus Christ]] are the [[Santo Niño de Cebu]] and the [[Black Nazarene]]. ''{{lang|tl|[[Santol (fruit)|Santol]]}}'' (cottonfruit, ''[[Sandoricum koetjape]]'') is a favorite material for the figures in the Philippines, as is the wood of ''[[Elaeocarpus calomala]]'', while ''{{lang|tl|batikulín}}'' (''Litsea leytensis'') wood is highly sought after and more expensive, given its resistance to [[termite]]s.

== In the United States ==
[[File:Bulto, Harwood.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' or ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' in a common style, with more [[caricature]]-like than realistic features; Harwood Museum, [[Taos, New Mexico]]]]
The tradition of wooden ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' carving was preserved as a folk art in [[Northern New Mexico]] and [[Colorado#Southern region|Southern Colorado]], where isolated villages remain relatively secluded to this day.  Of particular note is the village of [[Cordova, New Mexico]] which has produced several well-known ''{{lang|es|santeros}}''; one was [[George López]], who was awarded the [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1982.

In this region, traditional ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'', unless made for specific church needs, are usually small, and intended for the home, or for the local church or {{lang|es|[[Morada (building)|morada]]}}.  They are typically ''{{lang|es|detallados}}'', without many if any accessories (that is, with clothing and the like carved and painted on the statuettes, though often bearing a separate wooden staff or other bit of regalia).  They are most often made of [[Populus fremontii|cottonwood]], [[pine]] or [[aspen]].&lt;ref name="TourismBultos"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bultos |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=NewMexico.org |publisher=New Mexico State Tourism Department |location=Santa Fe |date=2011 |url= http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/learn/bultos.php |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110424071708/http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/learn/bultos.php |archive-date=April 24, 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=June 30, 2016}} {{tertiary source|date=June 2016|reason=This is a very weak source, just a couple of sentences obviously summarizing something else that is not cited there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are multi-piece, with hands, head, and other details carved separately and added to a body that is otherwise carved from single block of wood.  Nevertheless, the region also has a long tradition of larger, articulated, and often bloody [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] ''{{lang|es|bultos}}''.  A ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' usually carves a ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' with a knife or other [[wood carving]] tools, and then covers it with [[gesso]], a mixture of native [[gypsum]] and glue, to prepare it for painting.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt; Some contemporary ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' still use paints from homemade pigments.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt;

Some ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' supplement their income by making ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'' to sell to tourists, especially at the annual [[Santa Fe International Folk Art Market]] and [[Santa Fe Spanish Market|Spanish Market]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Santa Fe Spanish Market: Santa Fe Plaza |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=NewMexico.org |publisher=New Mexico State Tourism Department |location=Santa Fe |date=2016 |url= http://www.newmexico.org/event/?eid=28680 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160630120818/http://www.newmexico.org/event/?eid=28680 |archive-date=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including whimsical items, such as ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'' of [[Saint Patrick]], who does not figure in Spanish Catholicism.  One such ''{{lang|es|San Patricio}}'' figurine, by Santa Fe ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' [[Frank Brito Sr.]] (1022–2005) is in the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] since 1997,;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search Collections: Saint Patrick Missionary of Ireland |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=AmericanArt.SI.edu |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |location=Washington DC |date=2016 |url= http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=36143 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160630105741/http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=36143 |archive-date=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; many more traditional ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' and other carvings by him are in the [[Museum of International Folk Art]], along with those of other ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' from various parts of the world.  Entire [[Nativity scene]]s in ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' style are also popular tourist items.

==Attire and accessories==
[[File:Museummanaoagaajf.JPG|thumb|Regalia associated with the shrine of a ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' of [[Our Lady of Manaoag]], in the Ecclesiastical Museum of the Philippines. Many ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' collectors also seek accessories and vestments like these.]]
The wardrobe items of more elaborate ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', especially "'{{lang|es|bastidor}}'' mannequins, are often expensive, such as the ones woven with gold thread; the most expensive type is known in the Philippines as ''{{lang|tl|inuod}}'' (Tagalog: 'wormed'), which uses a form of French [[gold bullion]] thread to make embroidered floral patterns on the statue's clothing.

Headdresses are also an integral part of a ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', often encrusted with [[costume jewelry]] (such as paste and rhinestones) or real precious stones, to symbolize the spiritual wealth of the saint. The most common headdress for images is the ''{{lang|es|aureola}}'' ([[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) behind or above the head, while regal figures wear an additional ''{{lang|es|corona}}'' ([[crown (headgear)|crown]] or [[coronet]]).  A halo decorating the perimeter of the face, known as a ''{{lang|es|resplendor}}'' or ''{{lang|es|rostrillo}}'', is commonly found but not restricted to images of Mary, mother of Jesus. Images of Jesus are identified with the ''{{lang|es|Tres Potencias}}'', a set of three rays protruding from the head at acute angles, and these are never used for any other subject. Triangular haloes are exclusive to rare images of the Trinity, and some saints occasionally bear a ''{{lang|es|luna}}'', moon-shaped headband.  While there are cheap plastic crowns, haloes, and other metal accessories associated with ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', others are made of [[aluminium]] or, traditionally, [[tin]] ([[tinwork]] remains a major [[folk art]] form in general in Mexico and New Mexico). These adornments are sometimes [[Gilding|gold-plated]] for a richer effect. A more expensive type in the Philippines is made of solid brass, and ''{{lang|tl|pukpók}}'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for 'hammered') by an artisan. The costliest type of crowns are those made of solid [[sterling silver]] or [[gold]], often reserved for wealthy clerics and cathedrals.  Another style is called ''{{lang|es|estofado}}'', referring to dented holes placed on gold or silver foiling on the halos or the body of a statue, creating a reflective effect when placed in the light.

Other wooden, metallic, or composite accessories, which depend on the iconographic attributes of the subject, range from a long baton for some Marian images, a [[scepter]] or staff for various saints, a ''{{lang|la|[[globus cruciger]]}}'' (usually for images of the [[Christ Child]]), a [[rosary]], wings, flowers, a weapon or weapons used in a saint's [[martyrdom]], or some other object associated with the figure (e.g. small animals with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]).

Another costly item involved in the maintenance of a large ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' is the  ''{{lang|es|carroza}}'' (carriage), often used to bear the statute during religious processions in rural Mexico and the Philippines, such as those of a town [[festival|fiesta]], and [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]]. These often have embossed metal decorations, and cloths forming a skirt to hide the wheels of the carriage, along with scenery for [[Tableau vivant|tableaux]] representing episodes from the [[Gospels]], such as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] narrative.

'''Ṣàngó''' ([[Yoruba language]]: Ṣàngó, also known as '''Changó''' or '''Xangô''' in [[Latin America]]; and also known as '''Jakuta''' or '''Badé''') (from '=shan, 'to strike') is an [[Orisha]]. He is syncretized with either [[Saint Barbara]] or [[Saint Jerome]]. Historically, Shango is a royal ancestor of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] as he was the third [[Alafin of Oyo|Alafin]]  of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo Kingdom]] prior to his posthumous [[deification]]. Ṣàngó has numerous manifestations including Airá, Agodo, Afonja, Lubé, and Obomin.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William"/&gt; He is considered to be one of the most powerful rulers that [[Yorubaland]] has ever produced, and is noted for his anger.

==Historical figure==

Jakuta was the third Alafin of Oyo, following [[Oranmiyan]] and [[Ajaka]].&lt;ref name="William" /&gt; Jakuta brought prosperity to the [[Oyo Empire]].&lt;ref name="Anthony" /&gt; According to Professor Mason's ''Mythological Account of Heroes and Kings'', unlike his peaceful brother Ajaka, Jakuta (meaning: someone who fought with stones) was a powerful and violent ruler. He reigned for seven years which were marked by his continuous campaigns and many battles. His reign ended due to his inadvertent destruction of his palace by lightning. He had three wives, namely Princess [[Oshun]], Princess [[Oba (orisha)|Oba]], and Princess [[Oya]]. The Oyo Empire declined in the 19th century, which led to the enslavement of its people by the Fulani and the Fon. Among them were many followers of Ṣàngó, and worship of the deity thrives in the New World as a result. Strong devotion to Ṣàngó led to Yoruba religions in Trinidad and [[Recife]], Brazil being named after the deity.&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;

In Yorubaland, Sango is worshiped on the fifth day of the week in which is named Ojo Jakuta. Ritual worship foods include guguru, bitter cola, [[Amala (food)|àmàlà]], and gbegiri soup. Also, he is worshiped with the Bata drum. One significant thing about this deity is that he is worshiped using red clothing, just as he is said to have admired red attire during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="j"/&gt;

==Veneration of Sango==

=== Nigeria ===

Ṣàngó is viewed as the most powerful and feared of the orisha pantheon. He casts a "thundersone" to earth, which creates thunder and lightning, to anyone who offends him.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Worshippers in [[Yorubaland]] in [[Nigeria]] do not eat [[cowpea]] because they believe that the wrath of the god of iron would descend on them.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The Ṣàngó god necklaces are composed in varying patterns of red and white beads; usually in groupings of four or six which are his sacred numbers. Rocks created by lightning strikes are venerated by Ṣàngó worshipers; these stones, if found, are maintained at sacred sites and used in rituals. Ṣàngó is called on during coronation ceremonies in Nigeria to the present day.&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onifade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;

=== The Americas ===

Ṣàngó is venerated in [[Santería]] and [[Haiti]] as "Chango". As in the Yoruba religion, Chango is the most feared god in Santería.&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt;

In Haïti, he is from the "Nago" Nation, as [[Ogou]]. [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] recognizes him as "Siete Rayos".

====Candomblé====

Ṣàngó is known as Xangô in the [[Candomblé]] pantheon. He is said to be the son of [[Oranyan]], and his wives include [[Oya]], [[Oshun]], and [[Oba (Orisha)|Oba]], as in the Yoruba tradition. Xangô took on strong importance among slaves in Brazil for his qualities of strength, resistance, and aggression. He is noted as the god of lightning and thunder. He became the patron orixa of plantations and many Candomblé terreiros. In contrast [[Oko (Orisha)|Oko]], the orixá of agriculture, found little favor among slaves in Brazil and has few followers in the Americas. The main barracão of [[Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká]], or the terreiro Casa Branca, is dedicated to Xangô. Xangô is depicted with an ''oxê'', or double-sided ax similar to a [[labrys]]; a brass crown.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abril"/&gt;

====Characteristics====

*Consecrated day: Tuesday
*Colors: white and red
*Element: fire
*Sacred food: [[amalá]] (a stew of okra with shrimp and palm oil)
*Instruments: oxê, a double ax; bangles; brass crown
*Garment: red cloth with printed white squares
*Necklace: white and red beads
*Archetype: power, domain
*Sacred dance: ''alujá'', the ''roda de Xangô''. It speaks of his achievements, deeds, consorts, power, and dominion 
*Sacrificial animals: fresh water turtle, male goat, duck, sheep&lt;ref name="abril"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

Amalá, also known as ''amalá de Xangô'', is the ritual dish offered to the orixá. It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil. Amalá is served on Wednesday at the ''pegi'', or altar, on a large tray, traditionally decorated with 12 upright uncooked okra. Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered on a wooden tray or accompanied by [[garcinia kola|bitter kola]]. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared with the addition of beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than [[amala (food)|àmàlà]], a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

Xangô is depicted with an oxê, also known as the ''oxê de Xangô''. The oxê is a double axe similar to a [[labrys]] and originally made of wood.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
{{trivia|date=November 2018}}
The song "Mama Loi, Papa Loi" by Bahamian musician [[Exuma (musician)|Exuma]] includes the lines "Come on Shango, Satan come to me/Let me speak what I can't see".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkj1DDKSDUg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/exuma/mama+loi+papa+loi_21017880.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Shango is also a large theme in the [[Mighty Sparrow]] song, "congo Man".

Caliban invokes Shango in [[Aimé Césaire]]'s play ''[[Une Tempête]]'' (''A Tempest'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aspresolver.com/aspresolver.asp?BLD2;PL005436|title=A tempest|last=Césaire|first=Aimé|date=2010|publisher=[[Alexander Street Press]]|location=Alexandria, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shango appears as a minor character in [[The Iron Druid Chronicles]] by [[Kevin Hearne]].

In episode 28 of the telenovela "Celia," loosely based on the life of Celia Cruz (produced by Telemundo), the cultural ancestors of Celia's African heritage visit her in her dreams, chanting and invoking the presence of Chango.

Xango is mentioned in the song Canto de Ossanha by Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes. &lt;ref&gt;https://blogdobatman.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/translation-of-%e2%80%9ccanto-de-ossanha%e2%80%9d-by-baden-powell-and-vinicius-de-moraes/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">The '''Sharp Scale''' was devised by Henrietta Sharp Cockrell as an objective and scientific way to measure the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of paper, particularly of [[Folio|manuscript folios]], 'in the field'  without specialized equipment. A practical application of the technique could be done in a museum or library setting.  
To apply the method, the [[folio]] is first held at a distance of 15&amp;nbsp;cm from a 60 [[watt]] light source (such as an unshaded table lamp).  A [[dowel]] (or pencil) is held behind and against it, creating a [[silhouette]].  Folios are then added until the outline of the pencil is no longer visible. The number of the folios needed to obscure the silhouette of the pencil is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Smith, 2005, p. ???&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siegmund L’Allemand''' (8 March 1840, [[Vienna]] - 24 December 1910, Vienna) was an Austrian painter, known for history and war scenes, [[Genre art|genre]] works and portraits.

== Biography ==
His father, Thaddäus (1810-1872), was an engraver and his uncle was the history painter, {{ill|Fritz L’Allemand|de}}, who gave him his first lessons. His had his formal studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]], with [[Christian Ruben]] and [[Karl von Blaas]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|4|409||L’Allemand Siegmund|Schöny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, he became a member of the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]]. Later that year, he served as a battle painter in the [[Second Schleswig War]]. Two years later, he served in the same capacity in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], an offshoot of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], and participated in the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]]. His uncle, Fritz, died that same year and Siegmund completed his unfinished paintings.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

After 1883, he was a Professor at the Academy in Vienna. In October, 1907, he was a member of the Examination Board (chaired by [[Christian Griepenkerl]]) that voted to reject [[Adolf Hitler]]'s application for admission to the school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brigitte Hamann]]: ''Hitlers Wien. Lehrjahre eines Diktators''. Piper. München 1996. {{ISBN|3-492-03598-1}}; pg.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received numerous awards, including a medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]], the Reichel Prize from the Academy (1876) and the "[[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria|Karl Ludwig]] Medal" in 1879.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

He was interred at the [[Zentralfriedhof]]. Many of his works are on display at the [[Museum of Military History, Vienna]]; notably a monumental portrait of Ernst Gideon von Laudon that was created for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]].

[[File:Speculum75R.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacob's Ladder]] from a ''Speculum'' of c. 1430, pre-figuring the Ascension, right]]
[[File:Speculum 74v.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] from the same manuscript, see left. Danish Royal Library]]
The '''''Speculum Humanae Salvationis''''' or ''Mirror of Human Salvation'' was a bestselling anonymous illustrated work of popular theology in the [[late Middle Ages]], part of the genre of encyclopedic [[speculum literature]], in this case concentrating on the medieval theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], whereby the events of the [[Old Testament]] prefigured, or foretold, the events of the [[New Testament]].  The original version is in rhyming Latin verse, and contains a series of New Testament events each with three Old Testament ones that prefigure it.  It is one of the most common books found as an [[illuminated manuscript]], and also in early printing in both [[blockbook]] and [[incunabulum]] forms.

==Contents==
After a short Prologue (two pages) and Prohemium (four), both unillustrated, the first two chapters deal with the Creation, the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Fall of Satan]], the story of [[Adam and Eve]] and the [[Deluge (mythology)#Genesis:|Deluge]] in four pages.  Then follow forty more double-page chapters where a [[New Testament]] event is compared with three from the [[Old Testament]], with four pictures each above a column of text. Usually each chapter occupies one two page opening.  The last three chapters cover the Seven [[Stations of the Cross]], and the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|Seven Joys]] and [[Seven Sorrows of Mary|Sorrows]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], at double this length.  In all a complete standard version has fifty-two leaves, or 104 pages, and 192 illustrations (including a blank page at the beginning and end).  The blockbook editions were much shorter, with 116 pictures, two to a woodblock.&lt;ref&gt;Hind p.245&lt;/ref&gt;  

The writing of the text follows an exact scheme: twenty-five lines per column, with two columns per page, one under each miniature, so a hundred lines per standard chapter.  Sometimes there are captions over the pictures as well, of varying content.  Many copies reduced the original text, often by omitting the non-standard chapters at the beginning or end, whilst others boosted the content with calendars and commentaries, or extra illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson pp.27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and manuscript copies==
[[File:IRHT 126277-p.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Miniature from a manuscript ''Speculum''. [[Eleazar Maccabeus]] kills the elephant and is crushed.]]
The work originated between 1309, as a reference to the [[Avignon Papacy|Pope being at Avignon]] indicates, and 1324, the date on two copies.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  A preface, probably from the original manuscript, says the author does not give his name out of humility, though numerous suggestions have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  He was almost certainly a cleric, and there is evidence he was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ludolph of Saxony]] is a leading candidate for authorship, and [[Vincent of Beauvais]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first versions are naturally in [[illuminated manuscript]] form, and in Latin.  Many copies were made, and several hundred still survive (over 350 in Latin alone), often in translations into different vernacular languages; at least four different translations into French were made, and at least two into English.  There were also translations into German, Dutch, and Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.10; Hind p.602&lt;/ref&gt; 

Manuscript versions covered the whole range of the manuscript market: some are lavishly and expensively decorated, for a de luxe market, whilst in many the illustrations are simple, and without colour.  In particular, superb Flemish editions were produced in the 15th century for [[Philip the Good]] and other wealthy bibliophiles.  The ''Speculum'' is probably the most popular title in this particular market of illustrated popular theology, competing especially with the ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'' and the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' for the accolade.

==Printed editions==
[[File:LOC SHS.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Opening from a mixed [[blockbook]] and [[movable type]] Netherlandish edition, ca 1470]]
In the 15th century, with the advent of [[printing]], the work then appeared in four [[blockbook]] editions, two Latin and two in Dutch, and then in sixteen [[incunabulum]] editions by 1500. The blockbooks present unique questions as only editions of this work combine hand-rubbed [[woodcut]] pages with text pages printed in [[movable type]].  Further eccentricities include a run of twenty pages in one edition which are text cut as a woodcut, based on tracings of pages from another edition printed with movable type. Though the circumstances of production of these editions are unknown, two of the editions are in Dutch and the Netherlands was probably the centre of production, as with most blockbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Hind places them in Holland, from about 1470–75.&lt;ref&gt;Hind p.247&lt;/ref&gt;  It appears the ''Prohemium'' may have been sold separately as a pamphlet, as one version speaks of the usefulness of it for "poor preachers who cannot afford the entire book".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.120&lt;/ref&gt; 

The incunabulum editions, from eleven different presses, mostly, but not all, printed their [[woodcut]] illustrations in the [[printing press]] with the text.  Some seem to have been printed in two sessions for texts and images. [[Günther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], a specialist in popular illustrated works, produced the first one in 1473, in Latin and German, and with a metrical summary newly added for each chapter; this is considered an especially beautiful edition.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.207&lt;/ref&gt; Further incunabulum editions include Latin, German, French, Spanish and Dutch versions, and it was the first illustrated book printed in both Switzerland, at [[Basel]], and France, at [[Lyon]], which used the Basel picture blocks, later also used in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor nos.33–34, appears to contradict Hind p.602&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Speyer]] edition has woodcuts whose design has been attributed to the [[Master of the Housebook]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.208&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the first of the somewhat legendary editions supposedly produced by [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]], working earlier than [[Johannes Gutenberg]], was a ''Speculum''.  Even if the Coster story is ignored, the work seems to have been the first printed in the Netherlands, probably in the early 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.111 ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Editions continued to be printed until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which changed the nature of religious devotion on both sides of the Catholic/Protestant divide, and made the ''Speculum'' seem outdated.

==Iconographic influence==
The images in the ''Speculum'' were treated in many different styles and media over the course of the two centuries of its popularity, but generally the essentials of the compositions remained fairly stable, partly because most images had to retain their correspondence with their opposite number, and often the figures were posed to highlight these correspondences.  Many works of art in other media can be seen to be derived from the illustrations; it was for example, the evident source for depictions for the ''Vision of Augustus'' in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Bladelin Altarpiece]]'' and other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] works.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the work was used as a pattern-book for [[stained glass]], but also for [[tapestry|tapestries]] and [[sculpture]].

[[File:Robert the Bruce image.JPG|thumb|Image of the Bruce, the main focus of the poem]]
[[Image:John Barbour.JPG|right|210px|thumb|''A, fredome is a noble thing'', part of the most-cited passage from Barbour's 
'''''Brus'''''.]]

'''''The Brus''''', also known as '''''The Bruce''''', is a long narrative poem, in [[Early Scots]], of just under 14,000 [[octosyllabic]] lines composed by [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]] which gives a historic and [[chivalry|chivalric]] account of the actions of [[Robert the Bruce]] and the [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Black Douglas]] in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] during a period from the circumstances leading up the English invasion of 1296 through to Scotland's restored position in the years between the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton|Truce of 1328]] and the death of [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]] in 1332.

==Background== 
The poem's centre-piece (literally) is an extensive account of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] of 1314. Barbour's poetic account of these events is a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] in Scotland's [[National myth#Scotland|national story]]. The description of the battle is Barbour’s masterpiece.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;

The poem was written about 1375, "...to throw behind the new king, Robert II (who gave Barbour a pension) the weight of his grandfather's (Bruce's) achievements and reputation."&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/STELLA/STARN/poetry/BRUS/intro.htm Duncan, A., "Fredome is a noble thing", Barbour, John. ''The Brus'']&lt;/ref&gt; Barbour's work is a romance based upon a lost life of Douglas and a chronicle or chronicles which told of King Robert and his times. At the beginning of the poem, he conflates three Bruces into the single person of the hero, probably by design. [[Archie Duncan (historian)|Archie Duncan]] notes Barbour's fondness for exaggerated numbers for the size of any army.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Here and there the order of events is transposed. Despite this, it has been regarded from his own time as, in all details, a trustworthy source for the history of the period.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/212/0502.html "John Barbour:''The Bruce'', ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the piece, Bruce overshadows all his associates. In book nine, in recounting Edward Bruce's victories in Galloway, Barbour does not relate the whole story, but sums up his worthiness by remarking that "he might have rivaled any of his contemporaries ''excepting only his brother''".&lt;ref name=Macmillan/&gt;  The king is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance; [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] is a "noble thing" to be sought and won at all costs; the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require; but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind. The lines do not lack vigour; and there are passages of high merit, notably the oft-quoted section beginning ''"A! fredome is a noble thing"''.

Despite a number of errors of fact, the account has a greater degree of historical veracity than is usually associated with the verse-chronicle genre (for instance, [[Blind Harry]]'s [[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace|Wallace]] composed in the following century). But it is much more than a rhyming chronicle; it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the praises of freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe.  No one has doubted Barbour's authorship of the Brus, but argument has been attempted to show that the text as we have it is an edited copy, perhaps by John Ramsay, a [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] [[scribe]], who wrote out the two extant texts, one preserved in the [[Advocates Library, Edinburgh]], and the other in the library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]].

==Influence==
Barbour's influence on later Scottish writers can be seen in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Lord of the Isles'' and ''Castle Dangerous''.&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bruceofbannockbu00barbrich#page/n9/mode/2up MacMillan, Michael.

'''''The Merciful Knight''''' is a watercolour by the [[pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which was completed in 1863 and is currently housed at the [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;See the BM&amp;AG webpages on this work [http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973P84].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This picture is based on an 11th-century legend retold by [[Sir Kenelm Digby]] in ''Broadstone of Honour'', its hero is a [[Florence|Florentine]] [[knight]] named [[John Gualbert]] (an anglicisation of [[Giovanni Gualberto]]). The explanatory inscription provided by Burne-Jones tells the viewer ''of a knight who forgave his enemy when he might have destroyed him and how the image of Christ kissed him in token that his acts had pleased God.''&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Frantzen, ''Chivalry, Sacrifice &amp; The Great War: The Medieval Contexts of Edward Burne-Jones "The Miracle of the Merciful Knight"'' (from 'Speaking Images. Essays in Honor of V.A. Kolve'). Pegasus Press (20010, pp. 618–625.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Gualbert&lt;sup&gt;([[#See_also|see image below]])&lt;/sup&gt; was an Italian Roman Catholic saint, the founder of the [[Vallumbrosan Order]]. He was a member of the Visdomini family of [[Florence|Florentine]] nobility. One [[Good Friday]] he was entering [[Florence]] accompanied by armed followers, when in a narrow lane he came upon a man who had killed his brother. He was about to kill the man in revenge, when the other fell upon his knees with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and begged for mercy in the name of Christ, who had been crucified on that day. John forgave him. He entered the Benedictine Church at [[San Miniato]] to pray, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. John Gualbert was later canonised.

This arguably being Burne-Jones's most important early work,&lt;ref&gt;In the memorial biography of her husband, Georgiana Burne-Jones stated that it seemed: 'to sum up and seal the ten years that had passed since Edward first went to Oxford'. Cf. information at BM&amp;AG website [http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973P84]&lt;/ref&gt; it demonstrates a new and more personal style, evident in its design, technique and expression. It remained Burne-Jones's own favourite among his early works: this interest in knights and [[chivalry]] was aroused when painting the Arthurian Oxford Union murals in 1863 and was to remain with him throughout his life. In 1894 he tried to borrow ''The Merciful Knight'' to make a large oil version, and he was actually working on ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'' when he died in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'' is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in [[Puerto Rico]]. However, it was shown for a short time at the [[Tate Britain]] in London while the Ponce Museum underwent restoration in 2009–2010. The painting was also on view at the [http://www.museodelprado.es/ Prado Museum] in Madrid: ''The Sleeping Beauty. Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce'' (24 February 2009 – 31 May 2009). Cf. [[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon|Wiki entry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burne-Jones preliminary sketches for ''The Merciful Knight'', the kiss given by Christ is far more passionate, with strong [[homoerotic]] overtones. In this finished version, painted in [[gouache]], the kiss became protective and deeply caring, without any sexual implications.&lt;ref&gt;F. MacCarthy, ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination'', Faber and Faber (2011). See also entry for this painting, on C. Wood, ''Burne-Jones'', Phoenix Illustrated (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The beard of Christ provides a shield over the knight's forehead and inexpressibly sad face; the wounds in Christ's hands draw attention to the vulnerability of the knight's exposed hands – whose armoured gauntlets hang from his waist. Incidentally, the [[Tagetes|marigolds]] in the foreground came from the 'town garden' in [[Russell Square]], close to Burne-Jones' house opposite the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;See BM&amp;AG note [http://bmag.onlinegalleries.com/metadot/index.pl?isa=Metadot::SystemApp::AntiqueSearch;op=detail;id=35716] and their paper at [http://www.schoolsliaison.org.uk/2004/bmag/resources/pre_raphs_web.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Undefeated''''' is an American political documentary on [[Sarah Palin]], who was [[Governor of Alaska]] and later the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]]. The documentary is written and directed by [[Steve Bannon|Stephen K. Bannon]]. ''The Undefeated'' was released on {{nowrap|July 15}}, 2011.

==Synopsis==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}

The film is constructed in three acts. The film opens with a montage. The first act concerns itself with Palin's term as mayor of Wasilla. The second act is about Palin's half term as governor of Alaska. The third act, titled "From here, I can see November," revolves around her candidacy for vice-president and her rise to national prominence. It goes into detail how she became the darling of the [[Tea Party movement]]. The film ends with clips of the Madison rally where Palin challenged Republicans to: "Fight like a girl." The last shot is of Palin saying into the camera, "Mr. President, game on!"

==Production==
[[Steve Bannon|Stephen K. Bannon]] wrote and directed ''The Undefeated'', which was independently financed by Victory Film Group. Sarah Palin was familiar with Bannon because of his [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] documentary ''[[Generation Zero]]''. After the [[United States elections, 2010|United States elections in November 2010]], when the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] increased their seats in Congress, Palin asked her aide, Rebecca Mansour, to contact Bannon about creating a series of videos to explain Palin's stepping down as [[Governor of Alaska]] and to "protect her legacy" to set up for a potential campaign for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]]. Bannon instead decided to produce a feature film about Sarah Palin and provided {{nowrap|$1 million}} of his own financing. For the documentary, he interviewed Palin's supporters, including Alaskan residents and conservative bloggers like [[Andrew Breitbart]].&lt;ref name="june"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Powers | first=Lindsay | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sarah-palin-movie-undefeated-be-192338 | title=Sarah Palin Movie, 'The Undefeated,' To Be Released in June | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sarah Palin and her team were not part of the production, they gave Bannon's documentary their blessing.&lt;ref name="amc" /&gt; Bannon bought audio rights to Palin's book ''[[Going Rogue]]'' so he could include clips of Palin's voice in the documentary. While he considered titling the documentary ''Take a Stand'' after Palin's campaign slogan during the [[Alaska gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 Alaska gubernatorial election]], he chose ''The Undefeated'' as a "more triumphant" title.&lt;ref name="june" /&gt;

Wes Little of [[CNN]] describes some of the imagery in the film: "Clockwork Orange"-esque evocative images sprinkled throughout (shark attacks, bodies being buried, warfare both modern and ancient)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-18/politics/palin.film_1_sarah-palin-anti-palin-stephen-k-bannon?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=5 reasons why Sarah Palin may be ready to shake up 'uninspired' race | date=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Arc Entertainment released ''The Undefeated'' on {{nowrap|July 15}}, 2011 in [[AMC Entertainment|AMC]] theaters in [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Oklahoma City]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Atlanta]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Houston]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Before the commercial release, the documentary had one-night screenings at select theaters in the states of [[Iowa]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="amc"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=Ted | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038387 | title=AMC to distribute Palin documentary | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, the movie premiered to attendees of the [[RightOnline]] convention in [[Minneapolis]].

There are two versions of the documentary: one version rated PG-13 by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], and an unedited version featuring anti-Palin clips from [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Bill Maher]], [[David Letterman]], [[Howard Stern]] and [[Louis C.K]].&lt;ref name="june"/&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Politico]]'' reported that professional film critics greeted it with "a chorus of boos", describing the film as 'biased', '[[wikt:hagiographic|hagiographic]]', and "propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Molly|title=Palin movie: No thumbs up! Reviewers pan hagiography |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59188.html|newspaper=Politico|date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film currently holds a 0% approval rating on the movie review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Undefeated'|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771245638/|newspaper=Rotten Tomatoes|date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 32 out of 100 on the review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Undefeated 2011 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-undefeated |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John J. B. Wilson|John Wilson]], creator of the [[Golden Raspberry Award]], said in a pre-screening comment, "Sarah Palin is what the Razzies are all about." ''[[New York Post]]'' critic [[Kyle Smith]] described the film as "massively flawed", and said, "I don't know why Sarah Palin called her movie 'The Undefeated'. She lost the vice presidency, she quit the governorship of Alaska and she cut her bus tour short. The title makes no sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Pierce |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/07/sarah-palin-is-the-political-equivalent-of-what-the-razzies-are-all-about-says-founder.html |title=Sarah Palin is 'what the Razzies are all about,' award founder says |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic [[Richard Corliss]], who panned the film, stated "Bannon applies so much idolatrous airbrushing to his portrait of the divine Sarah that the movie might be called Going Rouge. But he is canny in identifying the 2½-year governor of Alaska as both a faultless heroine and, even better, a victim of the omnipotent American left... in Bannon's version of things, Palin fights the good fight, beats the fat cats and trumpets the pioneer independence of Alaskans from the predatory federal government — a government that, by the way, returns $1.84 in aid to the state for every dollar it sends to Washington..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2083284,00.html |title=The Undefeated: Her Holiness Sarah Palin |first=Richard |last=Corliss |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative political commentators generally praised the film.  Tony Lee wrote in ''[[Human Events]]'' that ''Undefeated'' will "reaffirm what Palin supporters like about her while presenting a solid case to those who may be on the fence about Palin that she cannot only be a strong executive but that she can and has had a history of winning over independents." He found the pivotal moment in the movie was when [[Mark Levin]] compared Palin to Ronald Reagan noting that Palin and Reagan share the same type of detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Lee |title="The Undefeated:" Documentary Seeks to Reset Conventional Wisdom on Palin |url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=43961 |website=[[Human Events]] |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jedediah Bila]] wrote in ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' that the film is "a compelling, thought-provoking journey through the accomplishments of a competent, ambitious, principled woman who entered the political arena for the right reasons and has consistently cut through the nonsense to get things done." She compliments Bannon on the segments dealing with Palin's [[2008 Republican National Convention]] and 2011 Wisconsin Tea Party rally speeches writing, "[the speeches] impact viewers with renewed meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jedediah |last=Bila |title=Palin's record takes center stage in 'The Undefeated' |url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/06/05/palins-record-takes-center-stage-in-the-undefeated |website=[[The Daily Caller]] |date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thunderstruck''''' is a 2012 [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[John Whitesell]] and starring [[Taylor Gray]], along with professional [[basketball]] player [[Kevin Durant]], [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Doc Shaw]] and [[Jim Belushi]]. It was released on August 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="DurantPremieres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Release" /&gt;

==Plot==
Brian is a 16-year-old living in [[Oklahoma]]. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, resigned to being [[water boy]] for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] game against the [[Detroit Pistons]] at [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City]].

At halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits [[Rumble the Bison|Rumble, the mascot]] in the process. Later on, he meets [[Kevin Durant]] and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.

The next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to "do better", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.

After making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.

Shortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.
