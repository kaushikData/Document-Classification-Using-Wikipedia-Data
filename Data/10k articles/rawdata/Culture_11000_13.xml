The '''Antequera Dolmens Site''' is a cultural heritage ensemble comprising 3 cultural monuments &lt;ref&gt;''Decree 25/2009 of 27 January, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of Andalusian Historical Heritage as an Heritage of Cultural Interest, with the typology of Archaeological Zone, the archaeological area of the dolmens of Antequera (province of Málaga).'' [http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2009/33/32 BOJA 18.02.09]&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Dolmen of Menga]], [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]] and [[Tholos de El Romeral|Tholos of El Romeral]]) and 2 natural mountain features (the [[Peña de los Enamorados]] and [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2014/8/14 Decree 222/2013, of November 5, declare  the Special Areas of Conservation Torcal de Antequera (ES0000032), Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja (ES6170004), Sierra Crestellina (ES6170005) and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes (ES6170003), expands the territorial scope of the Natural Park Torcal de Antequera and approves the Plan of Management of Natural Resources of the Natural Tourist Sites Torcal de Antequera, Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja, Sierra Crestellina and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes.]''&lt;/ref&gt;) in and near the city of [[Antequera]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. The cultural institution responsible for its protection is the [[Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera|CADA]] ({{ill|Conjunto Arqueológico Dólmenes de Antequera|es}}, Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera). It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2016.

==Outstanding Universal Value==
For something to be declared World Heritage Site, it must demonstrate exceptional universal value; that is, an extraordinary importance transcending national borders and of interest to present and future generations of all humanity.

[[UNESCO]] requires justification of at least one of the six criteria set for the cultural heritage by the ''Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'' (1972) to demonstrate the exceptional universal value of the site. The proposal of the Antequera Dolmens Site is based on one of them (i); the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] in its final report incorporates other two (iii, iv).

* Criterion (i): "represent a masterpiece of the human creative genius"

The [[Neolithic]] Dolmen of Menga represents one of the most important masterpiece of [[Megalith|megalithic]] architecture (Atlantic tradition) based on [[Post and lintel|post-and-lintel]] construction with an earthen covering, notable for its enormous dimensions that push the size possible in a corridor sepulcher by incorporating the unprecedented solution of intermediate pillars; likewise, the later, [[Chalcolithic]] [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] (beehive tomb) of El Romeral complements the two dolmens with its corridor and false dome of [[Dry stone|drystone masonry]] (Mediterranean tradition).

* Criterion (iii): "provide a unique testimony, or at least exceptional, on a cultural tradition or a living or dead civilization"

Both the Dolmen of Menga and the Tholos of El Romeral have anomalous orientations. The [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomer]] Michael Hoskin, who studied the site, noted that, whereas the axes of almost all [[dolmen]]s around the Mediterranean are oriented to a celestial feature, such as sunrise at dawn on the [[equinox]]es (as occurs in the [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]]), the [[Dolmen of Menga]] points to the striking nearby peak called the [[Peña de los Enamorados]]. This rises abruptly from the plain and contains the contemporaneous [[rock shelter of Matacabras]], in which cave paintings are found.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2011/150/23 Decree 245/2011 of 12 July, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of the Andalusian Historical Heritage as Bien de Interés Cultural, with the typology of archaeological site, the Archaeological site of Peña de los Enamorados, in the municipality of Antequera (Andalusia). BOJA nº150 de 02/08/2011]''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Tholos of El Romeral is oriented to the mountains of [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]], containing the [[Cave del Toro|Cave of the Bull]] (terrestrial orientation), as well as to the noon sun on the winter [[solstice]] (celestial orientation). El Torcal is noted for the extensive, otherworldly [[karst]] landscape at its summit. In addition, the Tholos of El Romeral lies along an axis from the Dolmen of Menga to the Peña de los Enamorados. Thus, the Dolmens of Antequera construct a unique megalithic landscape by their relationship with the surrounding natural elements.

* Criterion (iv): "be an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates one or several significant periods of human history"

The three megalithic monuments reflect a stage of human history in which the first ceremonial monuments in [[Western Europe]] were built, according to the two major building traditions of [[megalithic art]] ([[lintel]] and [[Beehive tomb|beehive]]). This is an unusual proposal on the List of World Heritage Sites as it is not being put forward as a mixed heritage site, in which its cultural value would be added to its natural value, but as an integration and close dialogue between the megalithic architecture and the [[landscape]]. A phenomenon of "landscape monumentalization" has occurred here by which the natural landmarks acquire the value of monuments while the manmade constructs present the appearance of a natural landscape.

Finally, the authenticity of the megaliths is well established, with the [[Dolmen of Menga]] dating to the [[Neolithic]] and the Tholos of El Romeral to the [[Chalcolithic]], and the structures retain high integrity, being in good condition and well maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Arts and Humanities Data Service''' ('''AHDS''') was a [[United Kingdom]] national service aiding the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and for research, teaching and learning in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]]. It was established in 1996 and ceased operation in 2008 (although the website and related digital collections are still accessible).

Organised via a Managing Executive at [[King's College London]] and five AHDS Centres, hosted by various UK Higher Education Institutions, the AHDS was funded until the end of March 2008 by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).  

However, in March 2007 the AHRC decided to cease funding for the AHDS beyond March 2008. As a result, the AHDS is now advising AHRC applicants to ensure their projects include a budget for the costs of preservation and sustainability (whether with the AHDS or another service).

Following the demise of AHDS, and the cessation of the [[Methods Network]], the [[Centre for e-Research (CeRch)]] was established at [[King's College London]] in 2008. The Centre's aims are to facilitate interdisciplinary, institutional, national and international collaboration.

The five subject-based AHDS Centres are:

*[[AHDS Archaeology]] — [[University of York]]
*[[AHDS History]] — [[University of Essex]]
*[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] — [[Oxford University]]
*[[AHDS Performing Arts]] — [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute|HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]
*[[AHDS Visual Arts]] — [[University for the Creative Arts]] (Farnham campus)

Specific areas of work that the Arts and Humanities Data Service covers include:

*[[digital preservation]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/ahds-preservation-documents.htm preservation handbooks] detailing specific preservation issues with various digital file formats and information on its [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/repository.htm digital repository]
*Advice on [[digitization]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/case-studies/ case studies] of existing digitization projects, [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/information-papers/ information papers] on specific issues in digitization, and longer [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides Guides to Good Practice] dealing with digitization topics in particular arts and humanities disciplines

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">An '''aside''' is a [[Glossary of theater terms|dramatic device]] in which a [[Character (arts)|character]] speaks to the [[audience]]. By convention the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. An aside is usually a brief comment, rather than a speech, such as a [[monologue]] or [[soliloquy]]. Unlike a public announcement, it occurs within the context of the play. An aside is, by convention, a true statement of a character's thought; a character may be mistaken in an aside, but may not be dishonest.

==Examples==
This technique is used by many playwrights, including [[William Shakespeare]]. For instance, in the play ''[[Macbeth]]'', Macbeth has the following aside:
{{cquote|Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.}}

Here is another example in the [[Shakespeare]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'':

{{cquote|A little more than kin, and less than kind.}}

This technique has frequently been used in film comedy, for example in the [[Bob Hope]] "Road" comedies, [[Woody Allen]] comedies and in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. The Jean-Luc Godard film ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' contains an early use of character aside.

More recently, it is used by [[Ian Richardson]]'s character [[Francis Urquhart]] in the 1990 [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', as well as [[Kevin Spacey]]'s character Frank Underwood in the 2013 [[Netflix]] [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|original series of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zach Seward|work=medium.com|url=https://medium.com/house-of-cards/b54a60143519|title=House of Cards' fourth wall|date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character's plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect.

==Uses==
Aside is used to gossip about characters or other characters without their consciousness, give audiences better understanding of matters, as well as make audiences laugh; this humour that may be generated is because the character or characters being talked about is or are not conscious of the fact they are being spoken of.

[[File:Bancroft Library.jpg|thumb|300px|Bancroft Library, September 2010.]]
The '''Bancroft Library''' in the center of the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], is the university's primary special-collections library. It was acquired from its founder, [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]], in 1905, with the proviso that it retain the name Bancroft Library in perpetuity. The collection at that time consisted of 50,000 volumes of materials on the [[history of California]] and the North American West. It is the largest such collection in the world. The building the library is located in, the Doe Annex, was completed in 1950.

==Inception==
The Bancroft Library's inception dates back to 1859, when William H. Knight, who was then in Bancroft's service as editor of statistical works relative to the [[Pacific coast]], was requested to clear the shelves around Bancroft's desk to receive every book in the store having reference to this country. Looking through his stock he was agreeably surprised to find some 50 or 75 volumes. There was no fixed purpose at this time to collect a library. Noticing accidentally some old pamphlets in an antiquarian book-store, he thought to add these to his nucleus; then looked more attentively through other stores and stalls in San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland and Victoria, purchasing a copy of every book relating to his great and growing subject. During his next visit to the eastern states, without special pains or search, he secured whatever fell under his observation in second-hand stores of New York, Boston and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Historical1911"&gt;{{cite book|work=The Historical Society of Southern California Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsI1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA163|edition=Public domain|year=1911|publisher=Historical Society of Southern California|pages=163– |title= Hubert Howe Bancroft: his work and his method |author=[[Rockwell D. Hunt]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hubert Howe Bancroft.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert H. Bancroft]], the library's founder and namesake]]
He had collected in all not far from a 1,000 volumes and had begun to feel satisfied. "When, however, (he declares) I visited London and Paris, and rummaged the enormous stocks of second-hand books in the hundreds of stores of that class, my eyes began to open. ... And so it was, when the collection had reached one thousand volumes, I fancied I had them all; when it had grown to 5,000, I saw it was but begun." (177) Finally, special journeys were made to all parts of Europe, as well as the Americas, in the interest of his collection. "And not only was every nook and corner of the world thus ramsacked, but whole libraries were purchased as opportunity offered." While his vague ideas of materials for writing a history gradually assumed more definite form, Bancroft had as yet no idea of writing a history himself. As the collecting proceeded his subject enlarged, until the territory covered was the entire western part of North America from Panama to Alaska, including the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, all Central America and Mexico, or about one-twelfth of the earth's entire surface.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

The bibliophile reached the settled determination to make his collection as complete as it was possible to make it. Neither time, nor money, nor personal attention would be spared. Agents were appointed in all the leading book marts of the world; no book must be lost because of its high price; no opportunity was to be missed to obtain everything in existence on the subject. By buying up at auction in European cities' individual collections, and even libraries, the Bancroft Library was enriched beyond measure. In 1869, it is reported that Bancroft held, including pamphlets, about 16,000 volumes. These were lodged on the fifth floor of the Market Street building, the original home of the library having been a corner of the second story of the building on Merchant Street.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

Bancroft now decided to begin literary work, but the collecting went rapidly forward without interruption. Trembling for the safety of the library through fear of fire, he lent a willing ear to his nephew's proposal to absorb the fifth floor for the purposes of the manufacturing department, of which he had charge. He would erect on some convenient spot a fireproof library building. Among the places considered were Oakland, San Rafael, Sonoma, San Mateo, and Menlo Park; but after a careful canvass and consideration, he selected the well known site on Valencia Street, near its junction with Mission. The library was moved to the building October 9, 1881. There the library stood for years.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

==State purchase==
When the question of State purchase was taken up, the Bancroft Library was said to contain from 50,000 to 60,000 volumes of books, pamphlets, maps and manuscripts. Prof. [[Joseph Cummings Rowell]], Librarian of the State University, after careful personal examination, estimated the number at 40,000 as a total. For many years, the collection had been offered for sale, Bancroft holding it at US$250,000, which is but a fractional part of the original cost and yet doubtless above the then market price, which Rowell estimated at about $140,000, if the complete subject index be included. In 1887, a bill was presented in the State Legislature to purchase the library for the State for $250,000, but the proposition was quickly defeated. Some years later, the [[University of Chicago]] considered buying it; naturally there was strong sentiment against permitting the Library to be removed from California and the Pacific States.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

In 1905, [[Reuben Gold Thwaites]], Librarian of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, and one of the foremost book experts in America, was invited to examine the Bancroft Library, "with a view to ascertaining its condition and, so far as may be, its marketable value." In his report, Thwaites characterized the collection of documents, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and other materials, estimating the total value at upwards of $300,000. The report itself was published November 14, 1905, as a 20-page pamphlet.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

The Report of the Secretary to the Regents of the University of California, year ending June 30, 1906 noted, "The Bancroft Library, incomparably superior to any other existing collection as a mine of primary historical material for all western America, a collection which could not even remotely be imitated, at no matter what cost, was acquired by the University on November 24, 1905, at a cost of $250,000. Of this amount Mr. H. H. Bancroft, whose ingenuity, perseverance and skill created this collection, donated $100,000. Of the remaining $150,000. $50,000 was paid by the Regents on November 24, 1905; $50,000 is to be paid November 24, 1906, and the remaining $50,000 in November 1907."  On June 11. 1907, the regents of the University approved the Constitution of the Academy of Pacific Coast History, submitted by the Bancroft Library Commission, thus making the Library itself "the indispensable nucleus of a great research library, like that of the British Museum," which has for its object "the promotion of the study of the political, social, commercial, and the industrial history, and the ethnology, geography, and literature of the Pacific Coast of America, and the publication of monographs, historical documents, and other historical material relating thereto.&lt;ref name=Historical1911 /&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Herbert Eugene Bolton 1905.jpg|thumb|Herbert Eugene Bolton, founding director]]
The university named history chairperson [[Herbert Eugene Bolton|Herbert E. Bolton]] its founding director, a position he held for the library's first 22 years. In his dual capacity, he made Bancroft Library a great research center for American history in congruence with the department's rise to prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of California: In Memoriam, April 1958|url = http://texts.cdlib.org/view?query=bancroft&amp;docId=hb6r29p0fn&amp;chunk.id=div00003&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;x=9&amp;y=11|website = texts.cdlib.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the decade of the 1960s, The Bancroft Library continued to focus exclusively on the history of the American West, particularly the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southern United States, from Florida to California, an area associated with the research interests of long-time directors Bolton (1918–1940) and [[George P. Hammond]] (1946–1966).

In the 1950s and 1960s Bancroft added the University of California archives and the [[Regional Oral History Office]], both significant to the history of California. In 1970, under new director [[James D. Hart]] (1970–1990), Bancroft's scope expanded dramatically when the University Library's Department of Rare Books and Special Collections was merged into it. These included the [[Tebtunis]] Archive of ancient papyri, excavated by an Egyptian expedition funded by [[Phoebe Apperson Hearst]] in 1899-1900 and the largest such collection in the Western Hemisphere; the papers of [[Mark Twain]], the object of the Mark Twain Project, which since 1965 has been editing everything written by him; a large collection of medieval manuscripts, incunabula, and rare printed books from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries; and the literary manuscripts of such California writers as [[Ina Coolbrith]] (California's first poet laureate), [[Jack London]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[George Sterling]], [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[C. S. Forester]], figures associated with the [[Beat Generation]] in San Francisco, such as [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Philip Lamantia]], [[Philip Whalen]], and [[William Everson]] (Brother Antoninus), and contemporary authors such as [[John Mortimer]], [[Seán Ó Faoláin]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]] and [[Joan Didion]].

From June 2005 to October 2008, the library underwent a total renovation and seismic retrofitting. Normal operations have resumed since  January 20, 2009. The library's director from 1995 through June 2011 was Charles B. Faulhaber, professor of medieval Spanish literature at Berkeley. In September 2011, Elaine Tennant, a medieval and early modern specialist in the German and Scandinavian departments at the University of California, Berkeley, became the James D. Hart Director of UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library.

==Holdings and services==
Bancroft is one of the largest special collections libraries in the United States. In 2009, it holds approximately 600,000 books, 55,000 linear feet of archival and manuscript collections, almost 8 million photographic prints and negatives (including the photographic morgues of the ''[[San Francisco Call-Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''), and over 20,000 historical maps.

Although the library itself is open to anyone who wishes to use it, access to some of its more valuable materials are restricted to researchers with a demonstrated need. The library website and the [[Online Archive of California]] offer access to online catalogs as well as to numerous collections in digital form.

The library's Bancroft Gallery offers changing public exhibits from the library's collections, including art, photographs, documents, letters, architectural drawings, illustrations, newspaper clippings, ephemera, and oral histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bancroft Gallery: On Exhibit|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/onexhibit.html|publisher=Bancroft LIbrary|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library's publications include ''Bancroftiana'', a newsletter published by the Friends of The Bancroft Library, and Keepsakes, a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications {{!}} UC Berkeley Library|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/bancroft-library/publications|website=www.lib.berkeley.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bribri language''' is a tonal [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language spoken by the [[Bribri]] people from [[Costa Rica]]. It belongs to the [[Chibchan language]] family.  Today there are about 11,000 speakers left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ethnologue.com///15/show_language.asp?code=bzd |title= Ethnologue|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Bribri, like its sister language [[Cabécar language|Cabécar]], has [[nasal harmony]].

== Writing System ==
The Linguistics Department at the University of Costa Rica has conceived a standardized spelling system, based on several earlier attempts{{sfn|Jara|García|2013}}.

Nasal vowels are indicated by a tilde:ã, ẽ, ĩ, õ, ũ (Previously indicated with a macron below: a̱, e̱, i̱, o̱, u̱), except after a nasal consonant (already indicating nasalisation of the vowel).

Tones are indicated by the grave accent for the high tone and the acute accent for the low tone; these can also be placed on the nasal vowels.

'''CareerScope''' is a standardized and timed interest and [[aptitude]] assessment for education and career guidance.  The system is  used in schools, job training programs, corrections, and in vocational rehabilitation. CareerScope delivers an objective assessment (as opposed to subjective self-report assessment) that is written at a fourth-grade reading level.  The process is student or client self-administered and takes one hour.  The system generates counselor and client/student report versions.  Career recommendations can be generated that are consistent with the Guide for Occupational Exploration, the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]], [[Occupational Information Network|O*NET]] as well as the U.S. DOE [[Career Clusters]] and Pathways.  It was developed by the nonprofit Vocational Research Institute, and is based on the US Department of Labor's General Aptitude Test Battery (G.A.T.B.).

[[File:The early paintings and drawings of John Constable cover.jpg|thumbnail|A volume from [[Graham Reynolds (art historian)|Graham Reynolds]]'s ''catalogue raisonné'' of [[John Constable]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Graham. ''The Early Paintings and Drawings of John Constable'', (London: [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale University Press]], 1996) {{ISBN|9780300063370}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''''catalogue raisonné''''' is a comprehensive, annotated listing of all the known [[Visual arts|artworks]] by an [[artist]] either in a particular medium or all media.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypl.org/node/29583 What is a Catalogue Raisonné?]", ''New York Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are described in such a way that they may be reliably identified by third parties.

There are many variations, both broader and narrower than "all the works" or "one artist". The parameters may be restricted to one type of art work by one artist or widened to all the works by a group of artists.

It can take many years to complete a ''catalogue raisonné'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' |title=One Art Lover’s Crusade To Catalog The World |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-art-lovers-crusade-to-catalog-the-world/ |first=Oliver |last=Roeder |date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Such a catalog can itself represent the life’s work of the scholar who compiles it. It took Jacob-Baart de la Faille 11 years to complete van Gogh’s catalog. Monet’s catalog was published over a span of 18 years by a French billionaire. And it took 46 years for all of Picasso’s catalog to be released, while its publisher sold his car and apartment to finance the project.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large teams of researchers are sometimes employed on the task. For example, it was reported in 2013 that the Dedalus Foundation (established by the abstract-expressionist painter [[Robert Motherwell]]) took 11 years to complete the three-volume catalogue raisonné of Motherwell’s work which was published by Yale University Press in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Flam, J.; Rogers, K.; and Clifford, T. (2012). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929215632/http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?K=9780300149159 |date=29 September 2014 |title=Robert Motherwell Paintings and Collages: A Catalogue Raisonné 1941–1991}}. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300149159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 25 people contributing to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Boroff and Kazakina (2013).

Early examples consisted of two distinct parts, a biography and the catalogue itself. Their modern counterpart is the critical catalogue which may contain personal views of the author.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt;

==Name==

The term ''catalogue raisonné'' is French, meaning "reasoned catalogue"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalogue+raisonne Catalogue raisonné]", ''Online Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the [[technical terminology]] of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |title=Car-Caz |website=ArtLex.com |date=13 July 2007 |access-date=26 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713171515/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |archive-date=13 July 2007 |quote=Although 'catalogue raisonné' was originally a French term, English speakers have used it for a long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQ, placing the Catalogue Raisonné in context with other types of art catalogues: {{cite web |url=http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909211530/http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-date= 9 September 2017 |title=
What Is a Catalogue? |website=ArtHistory.About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French pluralization "catalogues raisonnés" is used.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;{{efn|As seen in the CRSA homepage, [http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/ catalogueraisonne.org].}}

==Role in authentication of artistic work==
''[[The New York Times]]'' has described catalogues raisonnés as the definitive, scholarly compendia of an artist's work, the "supreme arbiter of the genuine and fake".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (19 June 2012).

Inclusion in or exclusion from a respected catalogue raisonné can have a considerable effect on the market price of a work, amounting in some cases to large sums of money. Inclusion has been called the difference between "great wealth and the gutter",&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and auction houses sometimes refuse to handle unlisted works.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; As a result, catalogue raisonné authors have been the targets of lawsuits, and allegedly of bribes and even death threats&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (2 February 2014).

In an edition of the television programme in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2011, the subject was the authenticity of the [[Claude Monet|Renoir]]  painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]''. The painting was submitted to the [[Wildenstein Institute]] which is the publisher of the catalogues raisonnés&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223132505/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-publications-liste&amp;lang=en |title="Catalogue of Publications", ''Wildenstein Institute'' |date=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most widely accepted as [[Wildenstein Index Number|authoritative]] on the subject of Renoir paintings. The result of this submission was that the Institute, acting in accordance with the wishes of a descendant of the original author of the catalogues, refused to include it in future editions. This decision was taken despite the fact that the Institute had been presented with considerable evidence of the painting's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936:fake-or-fortune?-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713074928/https://theartsdesk.com/?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936%3Afake-or-fortune%3F-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-date=13 July 2018 |title=Reviews |publisher=The Arts Desk |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}{{verify source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this decision the edition of the programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014 investigated one of a [[The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings|group of paintings]] reputedly by French post-impressionist [[Édouard Vuillard]] and on this occasion a committee of the Wildentstein Institute decided that the painting should be included in their catalogue raisonné for the artist.&lt;ref name="Huff vuillard"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Painting Bought For £3,000 On Ebay Actually Worth A Fortune |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/20/ebay-painting-fortune_n_4630252.html |accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art dealer and historian [[Philip Mould]] stated while presenting the programme that this painting would be worth approximately £250,000 if it was accepted for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné, but that if it was not accepted it would be worth approximately £1,500 'as a piece of decorative art' – less than 1% of the full value.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from BBC iPlayer: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03rmbqc ''Fake or Fortune?'' S3 E1/4: "Vuillard"], ''BBC.co.UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the ''New York Times'' reported that some scholars and artists' foundations have decided not to publish future catalogues raisonnés because they fear being sued by buyers or sellers unhappy with their conclusions.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; The question of whether producers of catalogues raisonnés should accept responsibility for determining authenticity of works was debated at a seminar on 29 March 2012 held at Christies, New York under the auspices of the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222195618/http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/programs/programs.html |title="Programs", ''Catalogue Raisonne Scholars Association'' |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of individual policies is given by the Wildenstein Institute's stated policy with regard to authentication of artworks which (at 8 February 2014) was as follows: 'After examination, and based on the opinion of the members of the committee, a recommendation is made in the form of the intention to include or not to include the work under study; a third possibility also exists, that of continuing the examination of the work. Under no circumstance is a recommendation to be considered as a certificate of authenticity or appraisal, and no justification will be provided for said recommendation.’&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |title=Catalogue Raisonné, Critical Catalogue |website=Wildenstein Institute |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223131620/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy contrasts with the text of the letter from the Institute which was read out on the television programme about the Monet painting, in which the Institute appeared to reject the authenticity of the work.

Difficulties can occur when more than one catalogue raisonné is published for the same oeuvre. The work of the artist [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] is the subject of at least five catalogues raisonnés.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gareth (2013). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404042512/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Modigliani-Institute-president-arrested/28490 |title="Modigliani Institute president arrested", ''The Art Newspaper'' |date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of paintings ===

Even if there is no published catalogue raisonné for an artist there may be an organisation which publishes authentications of work which are regarded as having the same effect as a formal catalogue. In the edition of ''Fake or Fortune?'' first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2014, an example of such a committee was featured. The subject of the programme was a painting which bore a signature reading "[[Marc Chagall]]" thus implying that it had been painted by the Russian-French artist of that name. It had been included in a reference work on the painter, but not in the most recent edition of that work, and forensic tests showed that it was painted with pigments not available at the time it was purported to have been executed. Despite this uncertain evidence of authenticity the makers of the programme submitted it to a group referred to as the "Chagall Committee", which includes descendants of the artist. This committee ruled that the painting is a fake and sought its destruction either with the agreement of the owner or, failing that, by court order under the French law of [[Droit moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya (1 February 2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/01/chagall-could-be-furnt-fortune-or-fake The man whose 'real Chagall' could now be burnt as a fake], ''Guardian.com'' (2014/02/01).&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Dr [[Bendor Grosvenor]] criticised the Chagall Committee's decision to seek the destruction of the painting, &lt;ref&gt;(2014). "[http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/2641_Mon_Dieu__le_feu_ctd Mon Dieu - le feu! (ctd.)]", ''Art History News''.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the policy of the Wildenstein Institute when works are submitted to it: 'Whatever the committee's recommendation, the work will be returned upon presentation of the consignment receipt'.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt; Presenter and art dealer [[Philip Mould]] said "I would now [think] three times or more before sending it to Paris. Ugly acts like the one proposed by the Committee can have the effect of damaging the progress of art history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10612704/Philip-Mould-burning-fake-paintings-could-damage-art-history.html |title=Burning fake paintings could damage art history |first=Philip |last=Mould |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2 Feb 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1972">'''Chivarreto boxing''', also known as '''Boxeo a puno limpio''', is a type of [[boxing]] that is practiced in the Chivarreto villa in [[San Francisco El Alto]], [[Totonicapan]], [[Guatemala]]. It is a popular activity in town and there is an annual tournament, held during [[Semana Santa]] every year, with fights held on [[good friday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guatevision.com/chivarreto-pelea-a-puno-limpio-en-semana-santa/|title=A "besar la lona" en Chivarreto 2015|date=2 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournaments began as a punishment to criminals who'd then have to fight it out amongst themselves; since 1900, it developed into an open contest in which anyone can participate, and winners receive trophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/totonicapan/tradicion-se-libra-a-golpes-en-chivarreto|title=Tradición se libra a golpes en Chivarreto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Chivarreto boxing rules differ from traditional, [[Amateur boxing|amateur]] or [[professional boxing]] rules in that, at Chivarreto, no [[boxing glove]]s are used, fighters instead fight bare-knuckled.

Typically, there are four referees present to enforce rules and protect fighters from unnecessary harm, instead of one as in other types of boxing. Bouts are held inside a ring, which is placed near Chivarreto's [[plaza]] in order so that all of Chivarreto's residents and also tourists from other areas can be spectators.

Unlike other types of boxing, knockouts are declared immediately after one contestant hits the floor due to a punch being connected on him or her. Knockouts are also declared if one of the contestants quits. If a knockout does not happen after a while, it is up to the contestants to decide when to finish their bout, after which the four referees decide upon a winner.

A '''coffeehouse''' is a [[social]] event, often held to raise funds for and/or generate [[awareness]] of a social cause or other event.

The name "coffeehouse" is derived from the limited menu which is typically available at the social event: [[coffee]] is usually the featured beverage, together with other non-alcoholic beverages such as [[Soft drink|soda]], juice and [[tea]]. Desserts and snack foods may round out the menu.

[[Folk music]] and other acoustic concerts are the primary activity at many coffee houses.  Other coffeehouses allow patrons to sing, dance, read poetry, perform stand-up comedy, or demonstrate other talents as entertainment during the event.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisburg Horizons Newspaper Article "A Cup of Cheer"&lt;/ref&gt;  Still other coffeehouses feature lectures and presentations to raise awareness about social issues such as [[political repression|political oppression]], food/[[freshwater]] shortages, and/or outbreaks of [[disease]] in various countries. Some coffeehouses may facilitate other activities such as a mass letter writing campaign or signing petitions.

Some coffeehouses have free admission, but others require a small entrance fee. If money is collected as an entrance fee, it is often donated in whole or in part to the social cause, after covering expenses.

Coffeehouses are often sponsored by a permanent, semi-commercial [[coffeehouse]] venue, such as the well-known [[Club Passim]] and [[Caffe Lena]]. Churches, non-profits, school groups, and other private groups also sponsor coffee houses in church meeting rooms, [[college]]s, and [[high school]]s. In particular, schools often sponsor coffeehouses to allow students to socialize in an explicitly non-alcoholic environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27414">{{Mythology}}
'''Comparative mythology''' is the comparison of [[myth]]s from different cultures in an attempt to identify shared themes and characteristics.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32"&gt;Littleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative mythology has served a variety of academic purposes. For example, scholars have used the relationships between different myths to trace the development of [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s, to propose common origins for myths from different cultures, and to support various [[psychology|psychological theories]].

==Comparativists versus particularists==
The [[anthropologist]] [[C. Scott Littleton]] defined comparative mythology as "the systematic comparison of myths and mythic themes drawn from a wide variety of cultures".&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; By comparing different cultures' mythologies, scholars try to identify underlying similarities and/or to reconstruct a "protomythology" from which those mythologies developed.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; To an extent, all theories about mythology follow a comparative approach: as the scholar of religion Robert Segal notes, "by definition, all theorists [of myth] seek similarities among myths".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, "The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars of mythology can be roughly divided into particularists, who emphasize the differences between myths, and comparativists, who emphasize the similarities. Particularists tend to "maintain that the similarities deciphered by comparativists are vague and superficial", while comparativists tend to "contend that the differences etched by particularists are trivial and incidental".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Theorizing About Myth'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative approaches to mythology held great popularity among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars. Many of these scholars believed that all myths showed signs of having evolved from athought which interpreted nearly all myths as poetic descriptions of the sun's behavior. According to this theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;Leonard&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern-day scholars lean more toward particularism, feeling suspicious of broad statements about myths.&lt;ref name="Northup 8"&gt;Northup, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A recent exception is the historical approach followed in E.J. [[Michael Witzel]]'s reconstruction of many subsequent layers of older mythologies &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E.J.M. Witzel, "The Origins of the World's Mythologies, New York : OUP 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Comparative mythologists come from various fields, including [[folklorist|folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], and [[religious studies]], and they have used a variety of methods to compare myths. These are some important approaches to comparative mythology.

===Linguistic===
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
Some scholars look at the linguistic relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, the similarities between the names of gods in different cultures. One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in different cultures of Europe and India. For example, the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] sky-god [[Zeus Pater]], the Roman sky-god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god [[Dyaus Pita|Dyauṣ Pitṛ]] have linguistically identical names.

This suggests that the Greeks, Romans, and Indians originated from a common ancestral culture, and that the names [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Dyaus]] and the Germanic [[Týr|Tiu]] (cf. English Tues-day) evolved from an older name, [[Dyēus|*Dyēus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ter]], which referred to the sky-god or, to give a perfect English cognate, the ''day-father'' in a [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural===
{{See also|Lévi-Strauss#The structuralist approach to myth|Structuralist theory of mythology|Structural anthropology|Vladimir Propp}}
Some scholars look for underlying structures shared by different myths. The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] proposed that many [[Russian language|Russian]] [[fairy tales]] have a common plot structure, in which certain events happen in a predictable order.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] examined the structure of a myth in terms of the abstract relationships between its elements, rather than their order in the plot. In particular, Lévi-Strauss believed that the elements of a myth could be organized into binary oppositions (raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, etc.). He thought that the myth's purpose was to "mediate" these oppositions, thereby resolving basic tensions or contradictions found in human life or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
{{See also|Oedipus complex|Analytical psychology|Jungian archetypes}}
Some scholars propose that myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological forces at work in those cultures. Some [[Freudian]] thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of [[Oedipus]] in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the [[Oedipus complex]] in those cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Price-Williams, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jungian]]s have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious levels]] of every person's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and comparative===
A new approach, which is both historical and comparative, has recently been proposed by E.J. [[Michael Witzel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He compares collections of mythologies of various cultures, from Iceland and Egypt to the Mayas, and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families (see above). The most prominent common feature is a story line that extends from the creation of the world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas ("[[Laurasia]]") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia ("[[Gondwana]]land"). The latter is the older one, going back to the dispersal of [[Homo sapiens]] out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions he offers some suggestions about the tales of the (genetic) "[[African Eve]]". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some suggestions about the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions.

===Phylogenetical===
It is speculated that like [[genes]], myths evolve by a process of descent with modification. The striking parallels between biological and mythological [[evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, 2013a, b&lt;/ref&gt; allow the use of [[computational statistics]] to infer evolutionary relatedness and to build the most likely [[phylogenetic tree]] for a mythological family. Mythological phylogenies constructed with [[mytheme]]s clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes pre-historic) diffusions and [[punctuated evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012b, c; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the protoversion could be statistically reconstructed. Mythological phylogenies also are a potentially powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among [[folklore|folktales]]&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013; Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some mythological parallels==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Deluge'', frontispiece to [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]], this engraving shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely attempting to save their children and cubs.]]
Comparative mythology has uncovered a number of parallels between the myths of different cultures, including some very widespread recurring themes and plot elements.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sluijs (2011) provides a detailed listing of parallels, see van der Sluijs, Marinus Anthony: ''Traditional Cosmologies. The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction''. 2011. London: All Round Publications ([http://www.mythopedia.info/traditionalcosmology-contents.pdf table of contents])&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples.

===Flood myth===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
Cultures around the world tell stories about a great flood.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, untitled, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the flood leaves only one survivor or group of survivors. For example, both the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the [[Hebrew Bible]] tell of a global flood that wiped out humanity and of a man who saved the Earth's species by taking them aboard a boat.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories of a single flood survivor appear in [[Hindu mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;Dimmitt and van Buitenen, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Greek]], [[Norse mythology]] and [[Aztec mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Urton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creative sacrifice===
Many cultures have stories about divine figures whose death creates an essential part of reality.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20"&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; These myths seem especially common among cultures that grow crops, particularly [[tubers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; One such myth from the [[Wemale people]] of [[Seram]] Island, [[Indonesia]], tells of a miraculously-conceived girl named [[Hainuwele]], whose murdered corpse sprouts into the people's staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 104–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] of [[Pangu]],&lt;ref&gt;Railsback, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[India]]n [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myth]] of [[Purusha]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rig Veda'' 10:90&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of [[Ymir]] all tell of a cosmic giant who is killed to create the world.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20" /&gt;

===The dying god===
[[File:Dumuzi aux enfers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient Sumerian [[cylinder seal]] impression showing the god [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] being tortured in the [[Kur|Underworld]] by ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons]]
{{Main|Life-death-rebirth deity}}

Many myths feature a god who dies and often returns to life.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, ''passim''; Tortchinov, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Such myths are particularly common in [[Near East]]ern mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Sir James Frazer]] compared these "dying god" myths in his multi-volume work ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Osiris]] and the [[Mesopotamian]] god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] are examples of the "dying god", while the Greek myths of [[Adonis]] (though a mortal) has often been compared to Osiris and the myth of [[Dionysos]] also features death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have noted similarities between polytheistic stories of "dying gods" and the [[Christian]] story of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structure of hero stories===
{{See also|Monomyth|Hero}}
A number of scholars have suggested that [[hero]] stories from various cultures have the same underlying structure. Other scholars, including [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan]] and, more recently, [[Joseph Campbell]], have also suggested that hero stories share a common structure.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt; Some comparative mythologists look for similarities only among hero stories within a specific geographical or ethnic range. For example, the [[Austrians|Austrian]] scholar [[Johann Georg van Hahn]] tried to identify a common structure underlying "[[Aryan]]" hero stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Hero Myths'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Campbell, propose theories about hero stories in general. According to Campbell's "[[monomyth]]" hypothesis, hero stories from around the world share a common plot structure.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its extremely comparative nature, the monomyth hypothesis is currently out of favor with some religious scholars such as Lesley Northup.&lt;ref name="Northup 8" /&gt;

===''Axis mundi''===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
{{See also|Yggdrasil|Omphalos|Mount Meru}}
Many mythologies mention a place that sits at the center of the world and acts as a point of contact between different levels of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; This "''[[axis mundi]]''" is often marked by a sacred tree or other mythical object. For example, many myths describe a great tree or pillar joining heaven, earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic]] [[India]], ancient [[China]], [[Mayans]], [[Incas]] and the [[Germanic peoples]] all had myths featuring a "Cosmic Tree" whose branches reach heaven and whose roots reach hell.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titanomachy===
[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'' (1596-98) by [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]]]]
{{See also|Titanomachy|Theomachy|Theogony}}
Many cultures have a [[creation myth]] in which a group of younger, more civilized gods conquers and/or struggles against a group of older gods who represent the forces of chaos.

In [[Hindu mythology]], the younger ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (gods) battle the older ''[[asura]]s'' (demons),&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt; though both are born from the same father, [[Kashyap]], the grandson of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manuscrypts.com/myth/2011/06/21/kashyapa-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek myth of the [[Titanomachy]], the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] defeat the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an older and more primitive divine race, and establish cosmic order.&lt;ref name="Squire 47"&gt;Squire, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, especially pp. 64–87&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic gods]] of life and light struggle against the [[Fomorians]], ancient gods of death and darkness.&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt;

This myth of the gods conquering demons - and order conquering chaos - is especially common in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythologies. Some scholars suggest that the myth reflects the ancient Indo-Europeans' conquest of native peoples during their expansion over Europe and India.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''deus otiosus''===
{{See also|Deus otiosus|Sky father|Urmonotheismus}}
Many cultures believe in a celestial [[Supreme Being|supreme being]] who has cut off contact with humanity. Historian [[Mircea Eliade]] calls this supreme being a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' (an "idle god"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is also used more broadly, to refer to any god who doesn't interact regularly with humans. In many myths, the Supreme Being withdraws into the heavens after the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93–98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baluba mythology]] features such a story, in which the supreme god withdraws from the earth, leaving man to search for him.&lt;ref&gt;Leslau, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the mythology of the [[Hereros]] tells of a sky god who has abandoned mankind to lesser divinities.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythologies of highly complex cultures, the supreme being tends to disappear completely, replaced by a strongly [[polytheistic]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding myths===
[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]
{{Main|Founding myth}}
{{See also|National myth}}
Many cultures have myths describing the origin of their customs, rituals, and identity. In fact, ancient and traditional societies have often justified their customs by claiming that their gods or mythical heroes established those customs.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 21–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the myths of the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Karadjeri]], the mythical [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers established all of the Karadjeri's customs, including the position in which they stand while urinating.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''construction loan''' (also called a '''home construction loan''' in the [[United States]] and '''self-build mortgage''' in the [[United Kingdom]]) is any value added [[loan]] where the proceeds are used to finance [[construction]] of some kind. In the United States [[Financial services|Financial Services]] industry, however, a [[construction loan]] is a more specific type of loan, designed for construction and containing features such as interest reserves, where repayment ability may be based on something that can only occur when the project is built. Thus, the defining features of these loans are special monitoring and guidelines above normal loan guidelines to ensure that the project is completed so that repayment can begin to take place.

==Underwriting of loans==
Almost all lenders are concerned that their money lent is repaid, so [[underwriting]] of construction loans usually focuses on how that might occur.

In the most basic situation, that of an individual building a home for themselves, a business building a property for business use, or an investor building a property to rent out, the fundamental guideline is for the lender to imagine once the loan has been fully extended and converted into a normal [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] and the building is occupied, whether the individual, business, or investor can afford to pay back the loan on a monthly basis. In the case of the individual, where the lender attempts to predict whether the individual can pay each month the loan payment that would occur once the person moves into the house, the lender would be primarily looking at the amount of income the individual receives. In the case of the business, a similar analysis would occur. In the case of an [[investor]] building rental property, a special appraisal would be ordered which would attempt to predict what the rents will be and whether they will be enough to pay back the loan, plus all expenses and still give the renter a certain minimum amount of income. The key point here is that no matter how valuable the building might be once completed, almost no lender would extend a loan for more than what the occupier could afford, because even though they will not have to make any payments during construction they would have to make monthly payments once completed and there can be no assurance that the owner would pay down the loan enough to make the monthly payments affordable once the project is completed.

Beyond this guideline, the next most common rule is a minimum cash injection requirement. Even if, for example, a business might be able to afford a monthly payment of a loan high enough to pay for the entire construction project, many lenders would require them to instead use a certain minimum portion of their own cash to complete the project. The reason for this is both to psychologically and economically tie in the owner with the project (hopefully making it less likely that they would walk away from the project if something goes wrong), and to give the lender a cushion whereby if something goes wrong they are more likely to be able to sell the real estate at a value that would better cover the loan amount. This guideline is often termed a "loan to cost" requirement, i.e. the lender will only loan up to 85% of the project costs.

The final major guideline is the maximum loan amount the lender will allow relative to the completed value of the project. This rule is designed to help ensure that, after the project is completed, if the borrower stops paying the payment, the lender can sell the property and hopefully recoup all the funds loaned.

Construction Loans are often extended for [[Real estate development|developers]] who are seeking to build something but sell it immediately after building it. In this case, a special [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] is ordered to attempt to predict the future sales value of the project. The first guideline above, affordability, is usually not used because the owner would immediately attempt to sell the property. However, it is used sometimes for example when a developer is building [[condominium|condominia]], the lender might evaluate whether if the project was changed from condominia to apartments if the rents received would more than repay the loan each month. Cash injection requirements are often higher due to the added risk (the immediate need to sell). The loan to value requirements however are often the most impactful. This is because the value is often calculated differently than how people might assume. For example, if a developer is building a 20 unit condominium project, a lender might not just loan a certain percentage of the predicted future total value of the condominia, but only a certain percentage of the value of the condominium project if, because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstance, the entire building had to be sold at once to one buyer (known as a bulk sale). Since the realizable sales price in this case might be much lower, the maximum loan many lenders would extend would be much lower.

==Usual arrangements==
Funds are taken from the loan through a process referred to as a "draw". A draw is the method by which funds are taken from the construction [[budget]] to pay material suppliers and contractors. Each lender has different requirements for processing a draw. For example, some allow the borrower to request draws online, while others require paperwork and periodic inspections. This process helps ensure that the loan proceeds are actually used for the construction and that the construction process is moving smoothly. The borrower is only charged interest on the amount borrowed at any one point.

Instead of paying each month during construction, almost all construction loans in the United States have extra funds borrowed right away and stored in a locked account known as an "interest reserve". Each month the monthly payments are taken from the account so that the borrower does not have to start paying out of pocket until the project is completed.

In Australia, progress draws are interest only to minimise the outgoings for the [[Debtor|borrower]]. Once the construction has been completed the loan reverts to the requested payment option the borrower selected at underwriting (either interest only or principal and interest).

==Construction Management==
Besides the [[Underwriting contract|underwriting]] guidelines detailed above, most lenders attempt to mitigate their risk in a variety of ways. The first involves due diligence on the general contractor, architect, soil upon which the property is to be built, environmental inspections, and appraisals. Then, while the construction process is ongoing, the lenders carefully inspect progress both to ensure construction is proceeding smoothly, as well as to ensure that all workers are being paid so that the security of the loan by the real estate is not violated by a [[mechanics lien]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2353">A '''dowager''' is a [[widow]] who holds a title or property—a "[[dower]]"—derived from her deceased husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriageoverview/a/dowager.htm|title=Queen as a Title - History of Titles for Female Rulers|author=|date=|work=about.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective, ''dowager'' usually appears in association with [[monarchy|monarchical]] and [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[Title#Aristocratic_titles|titles]].

In popular usage, the noun ''dowager'' may refer to any elderly widow, especially one of both wealth and dignity.

==Use==
[[File:Louis XIV of France and his family attributed to Nicolas de Largillière.jpg|thumb|The [[Madame de Ventadour|Dowager Duchess of Ventadour]] in full mourning attends the King of France.]]
[[File:L'impératrice Eugénie en deuil 1873.jpg|thumb|The dowager [[Eugénie_de_Montijo#Empress|Empress Eugénie]] of France in ''Grand Deuil'']]
===In the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the widow of a [[peerage|peer]] may continue to use the style she had during her husband's lifetime, e.g. "[[Count|Countess]] of [[placeholder name|Loamshire]]", provided that his successor, if any, has no wife to bear the plain title.  Otherwise she more properly prefixes either her [[given name|forename]] or the word ''Dowager'', e.g. "Jane, Countess of Loamshire" or "Dowager Countess of Loamshire" (In any case she would continue to be called "Lady Loamshire").

The term ''[[queen dowager]]'' is used in the United Kingdom and several other countries for the widow of a king.

{{Sangam literature}}
The '''Eighteen Greater Texts''', known as '''Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku''' ({{lang-ta|பதினெண்மேல்கணக்கு}}) in the literature, is the collection of the oldest surviving [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Tamil literature|poetry]]. This collection is considered part of the [[Sangam Literature]] and dated approximately between 100 BCE and 200 CE. A series of eighteen major anthologies, it contains the [[Eight Anthologies]] (''Ettuthokai'') and the [[Ten Idylls]] (''Pattupattu''). The songs in the Eighteen Greater Texts anthology are set in the ''[[Akaval]]'' style.

The Eighteen Greater Texts anthology contains 2,381 poems including the ten larger works belonging to the [[Ten Idylls]] collection. These poems are attributed to 473 poets. Sixteen of the 473 poets are responsible for 1,177 of the 2,279 poems for which the name of the author is known. In all, 102 of the poems are anonymous. Notably, the ''[[Patiṟṟuppattu|pathirruppathu]]'' collection exclusively collects poetry from the [[Chera_dynasty#Early_Cheras|Cheral]] kings (from Kerala), whereas the other collections contain a mix of poetry patronized by diverse Tamil kings.

==Anthology==
There is no information available on when these poems were collected or on the identity of the anthologist. These poems have passed through four stages of evolution. The poems were created by the bardic authors between 100 BCE and 200 CE. The poems were collected into the various anthologies; [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]] were added and the poems classified into various ''thinais'' around the eighth century CE. Still later, the invocatory poems were added to the collection. Finally, around the tenth century CE commentaries were written. The whole process occurred over many centuries. As these poems have no internal safeguard to preserve them intact, they probably have gone through some changes over these centuries.

The '''emblem of the Italian Republic''' ({{lang-it|emblema della Repubblica Italiana}}) was formally adopted by the newly formed [[Italian Republic]] on 5 May 1948. Although often referred to as a [[coat of arms]] (or {{lang|it|stemma}} in Italian), it is technically an [[emblem]] as it was not designed to conform to traditional [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules. The emblem comprises a white [[five-pointed star]], with a thin red border, superimposed upon a five-spoked [[cogwheel]], standing between an [[olive]] branch to the left side and an [[oak]] branch to the right side; the branches are in turn bound together by a red ribbon with the inscription "&lt;small&gt;REPVBBLICA ITALIANA&lt;/small&gt;" ("Italian Republic" written in Italian, but in an ancient Roman-style Latin alphabet). The emblem is used extensively by the [[Italian government]]. 
 
The armorial bearings of the [[House of Savoy]], [[blazon]]ed ''gules a cross argent'', were previously in use by the former [[Kingdom of Italy]]; the [[supporters]], on either side ''a lion rampant Or'', were replaced with ''[[fasces|fasci littori]]'' (literally bundles of the [[lictors]]) during the [[Italian fascism|fascist era]].

==Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Italy (1805-1814).svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Napoleon's Italy.]]
The [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] founded by [[Napoleon]] in 1805 had a peculiar coat of arms, formed by the [[House of Bonaparte]]'s one and symbols from various Italian regions, such as the [[biscione]], the keys representing the [[Pope|Papacy]], the [[Reichsadler]], and the [[flag of Savoy]], all surrounded by two axes, another Reichsadler the cape from the Bonaparte arms and a crown.

==Savoyard Kingdom of Italy==

Between 1848 and 1861, a sequence of events led to the independence and unification of Italy (except for [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], [[Rome]], [[Trento]] and [[Trieste]], or ''[[Italian irredentism|Italia irredenta]]'', which were united with the rest of Italy in 1866, 1870 and 1918 respectively); this period of Italian history is known as the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', or resurgence. During this period, the green, white and red ''tricolore'' became the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Ghisi, Enrico ''Il tricolore italiano (1796-1870)'' Milano: Anonima per l'Arte della Stampa, 1931; see Gay, H. Nelson in [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762(193207)37%3A4%3C750%3AITI1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 The American Historical Review] Vol. 37 No. 4 (pp. 750-751), July 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Flag of Italy|Italian tricolour]], [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]], was first adopted as war flag by the ''Regno di Sardegna-Piemonte'' ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]-Piedmont) army in 1848. In his Proclamation to the Lombard-Venetian people, [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]] said "… in order to show more clearly with exterior signs the commitment to Italian unification, We want that Our troops … have the Savoy shield placed on the Italian tricolour flag."&lt;ref&gt;"Per viemmeglio dimostrare con segni esteriori il sentimento dell'unione italiana vogliamo che le Nostre truppe ... portino lo scudo di Savoia sovrapposto alla bandiera tricolore italiana." See [[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence, D.H.]] (ed. Philip Crumpton) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQyA7yU6lbAC ''Movements in European History''] (p. 230) Cambridge University Press, 1989 for an overview&lt;/ref&gt; As the arms mixed with the white of the flag, it was ''fimbriated azure'', blue being the [[dynastic]] colour.&lt;ref&gt;Lo [[Statuto Albertino]] Art. 77, dato in Torino addì quattro del mese di marzo l'anno del Signore mille ottocento quarantotto, e del Regno Nostro il decimo ottavo&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 1861, when the ''Regno delle Due Sicilie'' ([[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]) was incorporated into the ''Regno d'Italia'', after defeat in the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], this flag and the armorial bearings of Sardinia were declared the symbols of the newly formed kingdom.
[[File:Greater coat of arms of the Kingdom of Italy (1929-1944).svg|thumb|200px|As modified during the Fascist regime, 1929-1943.]]
On 4 May 1870, nine years later, the [[Consulta Araldica]] issued a decree on the arms, as with the Sardinian arms, two ''lions rampant'' in gold supporting the shield, bearing instead only the Savoy cross (as on the flag) now representing all Italy, with a crowned helmet, around which, the collars of the [[Military Order of Savoy]], the [[Civil Order of Savoy]], the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]] (established 2 February 1868), the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]], and the Supreme [[Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]] (bearing the motto [[FERT]]) were suspended. The lions held lances flying the national flag. From the helmet fell a royal mantle, engulfed by a pavilion under the ''Stellone d'Italia'', purported to protect the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Deliberazione della Consulta Araldica del Regno d’Italia [http://www.cnicg.net/ca1870b.asp con cui si determina quali debbano essere gli ornamenti esteriori dello stemma dello Stato] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909052831/http://www.cnicg.net/ca1870b.asp |date=2007-09-09 }}, 4 maggio 1870; Regio Decreto n. 7282 del 27 novembre 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

After twenty years, on 1 January 1890, the arms' exterior were slightly modified more in keeping with those of Sardinia. The fur mantling and lances disappeared and the crown was taken from the helmet to the pavilion, now sewn with crosses and roses. The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] was placed on the helmet, under the traditional Savoyan [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] (a winged lionhead), which, together with the banner of Savoy from the former Sardinian arms, replaced the star of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnicg.net/stemmi.asp Armi della Real Casa d'Italia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718094055/http://www.cnicg.net/stemmi.asp |date=2011-07-18 }} [[Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana]]; Gli stemmi della Famiglia Reale sono regolati dal relativo Regio Decreto del 1 gennaio 1890 e gli stemmi dello Stato e delle Amministrazioni governative sono regolati dal Regio Decreto del 27 novembre 1890&lt;/ref&gt; These arms remained in official use for 56 years until the [[birth of the Italian Republic]] and continue today as the dynastic arms of the head of the House of Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://savoia.blastness.com/prerogative.htm Compiti, Prerogative e Responsabilità del Capo di Casa Savoia nell'Italia Repubblicana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214090343/http://savoia.blastness.com/prerogative.htm |date=2012-02-14 }} Reale Casa d'Italia (retrieved 24 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
On 11 April 1929, the Savoy lions were replaced by Mussolini with [[fasces]] from the [[National Fascist Party]] shield.&lt;ref&gt;Regio Decreto n. 504 del 11 aprile 1929 VII&lt;/ref&gt; After his dismissal and arrest on 25 July 1943 however, the earlier version was briefly restored until the emblem of the new ''Repubblica Italiana'' was adopted, after the institutional referendum on the form of the state, held on 2 June 1946. This is celebrated in Italy as [[Republic Day (Italy)|Festa della Repubblica]].
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Italian Social Republic.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of the Social Republic, 1944&amp;ndash;1945.]]

===Italian Social Republic===
{{See also|Fascist symbolism}}
The arms of the short-lived Nazi state in northern Italy, the ''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' ([[Italian Social Republic]]), or ''Republic of Salò'' as it was commonly known, was that of the governing [[Republican Fascist Party]], a silver eagle clutching a banner of the ''tricolore'' inverted on a shield charged with [[fasces]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foggia della bandiera nazionale e della bandiera di combattimento delle Forze Armate'' Decreto Legislativo del Duce della Repubblica Sociale Italiana e Capo del Governo n. 141 del 28 gennaio 1944 XXII EF (GU 107 del 6 maggio 1944 XXII EF)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian fascism]] derived its name from the fasces, which symbolises authority and/or "strength through unity". The fasces has been used to show the ''imperium'' ([[Power (philosophy)|power]]) of the [[Roman Empire]], and was thus considered an appropriate heraldic symbol. Additionally, Roman legions had carried the [[Aquila (Roman)|''aquila'']], or eagle, as ''signa militaria''.

This shield had previously been displayed alongside the Royal arms from 1927 to 1929, when the latter was modified to incorporate elements of both.&lt;ref&gt;Regio Decreto n. 2061 del 12 dicembre 1926 ''sull'emblema del Fascio Littorio'', Regio Decreto Legislativo n. 2273 del 30 dicembre 1926 ''norme per la fabbricazione, distribuzione e vendita di insegne e distintivi portanti l'emblema del Fascio Littorio'', Regio Decreto n. 1048 del 27 marzo 1927 ''disposizioni circa l'uso del Fascio Littorio da parte delle Amministrazioni dello Stato'', Legge n. 928 del 9 giugno 1927 ''conversione in legge del R. D.-L. 12 dicembre 1926, che dichiara il Fascio Littorio emblema dello Stato'' (GU 160 del 13 luglio 1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 1945, commemorated as [[Liberation Day|Festa della Liberazione]], the government of [[Benito Mussolini]] fell. The separate Italian Social Republic had existed for slightly more than one and a half years.

==Italian Republic==
The decision to provide the new Italian Republic with an emblem was taken by the government of [[Alcide De Gasperi]] in October 1946. The design was chosen by public competition, with the requirement that party political emblems were forbidden and the inclusion of the [[Stella d'Italia|Stellone d'Italia]], "inspired by a sense of the earth and municipalities." The five winners were assigned further requirements for the design of the emblem, "a ring that has towered shaped crown," surrounded by a garland of Italian foliage and flora. Below a representation of the sea, and above, the gold star, with the legend ''Unità e Libertà'' or Unity and Liberty in the [[Italian language]]. The winner was [[Paolo Paschetto]], Professor of the Institute of Fine Arts in Rome from 1914 to 1948, and the design was presented in February 1947, together with the other finalists, in an exhibition in Via Margutta. This version, however, did not meet with public approval, so a new competition was held, again won by Paolo Paschetto. The new emblem was approved by the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] in February 1948, and officially adopted by the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Enrico De Nicola]] in May 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Foggia ed uso dell'emblema dello Stato'' [http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/do/gazzetta/downloadPdf?dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=19480528&amp;numeroGazzetta=122&amp;tipoSerie=FO&amp;tipoSupplemento=SO&amp;numeroSupplemento=0&amp;estensione=pdf&amp;edizione=0 Decreto Legislativo n. 535 del 5 maggio 1948], pubblicato nella [[Gazzetta Ufficiale]] n. 122 del 28 maggio 1948 suppl. ord.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoleges.it/service1/scheda.aspx?id=99049&amp;service=1 Decreto Legislativo n. 535 del 5 maggio 1948] infoleges.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The emblem comprises a white [[five-pointed star]], with a fine red border, superimposed upon a five-spoked [[cogwheel]], between an [[olive]] branch on the left, and an [[oak]] branch on the right side; the green branches are in turn bound together by a red ribbon bearing the inscription &lt;small&gt;REPVBBLICA ITALIANA&lt;/small&gt; in white capital letters. As it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules, it does not have a formal [[blazon]].&lt;ref&gt;Disposition XIV of the Italian Constitution provides that "The law shall regulate the suppression of the [[Consulta Araldica|Heraldic Council]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant element, however, is the five-pointed [[Stella d'Italia|Stellone d'Italia]], an ancient secular symbol of Italy. Iconographic of the Risorgimento, it is usually seen shining radiant over [[Italia Turrita]], the personification of Italy. The star marked the first award of Republican reconstruction, the [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]], and still indicates membership of the [[Military of Italy|Armed Forces]] today. The steel cogwheel which surrounds it refers to the [[Constitution of the Italian Republic]]:&amp;mdash;
{{"|Italy is a democratic republic, built on labour. [...]|[[wikisource:Constitution of Italy#Fundamental principles|Article 1]]}} 
At the top, its shape also recalls a [[mural crown]], as worn by Italia Turrita (meaning ''with towers''), typical of Italian civic heraldry of communal origin. Both oak and olive trees are characteristic of the Italian landscape. While the oak branch is symbolic of the strength and dignity of the Italian people, the olive branch represents the Republic’s desire for peace, both harmony at home and brotherhood abroad, as expressed in the Constitution:&amp;mdash; 
[[File:Coat of arms of Marina Militare.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of the Italian Navy, used on ensign.]]
{{"|Italy repudiates war as an instrument of aggression [...]|[[wikisource:Constitution of Italy#Fundamental principles|Article 11]]}}
Elements of the emblem, such as its industrial symbolism and star, are influenced by [[socialist heraldry]].&lt;ref name=Volborthp11&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl-Alexander|last=von Volborth|authorlink=Carl-Alexander von Volborth|title=Heraldry: Customs, Rules and Styles|location=Ware, Hertfordshire|date=1983|publisher=Omega Books Ltd.|isbn=0-907853-47-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armed forces===
The Italian naval [[ensign]], since 1947, comprises the national flag defaced with the arms of the [[Marina Militare]]; the ''Marina Mercantile'' (and private citizens at sea) use the civil ensign, differenced by the absence of the [[mural crown]] and the lion holding open the gospel, bearing the inscription &lt;small&gt;PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS&lt;/small&gt;, instead of a sword.&lt;ref&gt;Decreto Legislativo del capo provvisorio dello stato n. 1305 del 9 novembre 1947 (GU 275 del 29 novembre 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The shield is quartered, symbolic of the four ''[[repubbliche marinare]]'', or great [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]], of Italy: [[Venice]] (represented by the lion ''passant'', top left), [[Genoa]] (top right), [[Amalfi]] (bottom left), and [[Pisa]] (represented by their respective crosses). To acknowledge the Navy's origins in ancient Rome, the ''rostrata'' crown, "... emblem of honor and of value that the [[Roman Senate]] conferred on ''duci'' of shipping companies, conquerors of lands and cities overseas," was proposed by [[Domenico Cavagnari|Admiral Cavagnari]] in 1939. An [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]], bearing the Savoy shield flanked by fasces, was removed before the arms were first employed.&lt;ref&gt;"Emblema di onore e di valore che il Senato romano conferiva ai 
duci di imprese navali, conquistatori di terre e città oltremare;" [http://www.marina.difesa.it/storia/Tradizioni/bandiera.asp La Bandiera della Marina Militare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915020611/http://www.marina.difesa.it/storia/tradizioni/bandiera.asp |date=2008-09-15 }} Ministero della Difesa (retrieved 5 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Esercito Italiano]], [[Aeronautica Militare]] and [[Arma dei Carabinieri]] also have their own distinctive coats of arms as do each of the [[comuni|municipalities]], [[provinces of Italy|provinces]] and [[regions of Italy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3100">The '''Eurasian cuisine''' is a 'fusion' [[cuisine]], mainly existing still in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].

==Origins==
In general, Eurasians are people of any mixed European and Asian ancestry. However, if referring to Eurasian cuisine, usually the amalgation of Portuguese, Dutch, British, Chinese, Malay, and also Indian and [[Peranakan]] influences is meant. Within this cuisine, ingredients in European dishes are replaced or complemented by Asian ingredients. Conversely, European ingredients are used in Asian dishes.

For example, cream in European recipes is replaced by coconut cream and dried Chinese sausage ([[lap cheong]]) is used instead of chorizo. Also, the use of [[soy sauce]], chilli and ginger is used interchangeably with vinegar, mustard and [[Worchestershire sauce]].

==Definition==
There is no clear definition of what can be specified as Eurasian. Some dishes are also found in Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese cuisines. By local adaptation(s), or by its ubiquitous presence within the Eurasian community, a dish is sometimes considered "Eurasian".

==Dishes==
* Shepherd's pie (British): a traditional dish with meat and mashed potatoes with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, Chinese mushrooms and garlic.
* Oxtail stew (British): a stew with cinnamon, soy sauce and star anise.
*Chicken chop: a grill-fried boneless chicken thigh marinated in a mix of soy sauce and [[Worcestershire sauce]], usually served in a black pepper or mushroom sauce with a side of [[French fries|fries]] and vegetables.
* Devil's curry (a.k.a. curry debal) (Portuguese): chicken in a sauce of chilli, [[galangal]], vinegar and [[kemiri]] nuts (candle nuts).
* Kueh kochi pulot hitam: a cake of black and white glutinous rice flour with a filling of [[mung beans]] or coconut.
* Banana salad with egg, lettuce, [[cilantro]] and ''[[chili chukka]]'' (a dip of chilli, sugar, vinegar, garlic, light soy sauce and ginger).
* Curry Feng: a spicy Eurasian curry dish containing minced beef or pork; minced pig’s kidney, liver, stomach, tripe and tongue; and various spices
* [[Semur (Indonesian stew)]]: a type of meat stew (mainly beef), that is braised in thick brown gravy.🦀

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">The interplay of '''exercise and music''' have been long-discussed, crossing the disciplines of [[biomechanics]], [[neurology]], [[physiology]], and [[sport psychology]]. People "automatically feel the beat" of the music they listen to and instinctively adjust their walking pace and heart rate to the tempo of the music&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franěk|first=Marek|last2=van Noorden|first2=Leon|last3=Režný|first3=Lukáš|date=2014-12-02|title=Tempo and walking speed with music in the urban context|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251309/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01361|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4251309|pmid=25520682}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Listening to music while exercising has been found in multiple studies to create an increased sense of motivation, distracting the mind while increasing heart rate. Faster tempo music has been found by researchers to motivate exercisers to work harder when performing at a moderate pace, but peak performance has been found to be unaffected by listening to music.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;Reynolds, Gretchen. [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/phys-ed-does-music-make-you-exercise-harder "Phys Ed: Does Music Make You Exercise Harder?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 25, 2010. Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study published in 2009, researchers at the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences at [[Liverpool John Moores University]] had 12 subjects ride a stationary bicycle at a pace that they could sustain for 30 minutes while listening to a song of the subject's choice. In successive trials, they rode the bikes again, with the tempo of the music variously increased or decreased by 10%, without the subject's knowledge. The researchers results showed that the riders heart rate and mileage decreased when the tempo was slowed, while they rode a greater distance, increased their heart rate and enjoyed the music more at the faster tempo. Though the participants thought their workout was harder at the more upbeat tempo, the researchers found that when the faster-paced music was heard while exercising "the participants chose to accept, and even prefer, a greater degree of effort".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse J, Hudson P, Edwards B. "Effects of music tempo upon submaximal cycling performance.", Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Aug;20(4):662-9.{{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.00948.x}} {{PMID|19793214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] found in a 2003 study that participants who chose to listen to faster-paced music generated a higher heart rate, pedaled harder and generated more power, increasing their level of work by as much as 15% by diverting their focus to the music. The study tested 20 volunteers who listened to an MP3 player loaded with a mix of 13 songs that they selected and then rode an exercise bike for an hour at a pace and gear of their choice. The study found that heart rates rose from 133 to 146 beats per minute and power output increased accordingly, when listening to the tempo-less sound of crashing waves versus music with a medium to fast tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Fauber, John via ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9AQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fggGAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=exercise%20music%20tempo%20physiology&amp;pg=6984%2C2509395 "Workout with a tempo: Choice of music can affect exercise intensity"], ''[[The Free Lance–Star]]'', November 9, 2003.

Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study by a research team from Australia, Israel and the United States found that runners performing at a pace where they were at 90% of their peak oxygen uptake enjoyed listening to music. Crazy enough, the music had no effect on their heart rate or running pace, regardless of the music's tempo.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tenenbaum, G.; Lidor, R.; Lavyan, N.; Morrow, K.; Tonnel, S.; Gershgoren, A.; Meis, J.; and Johnson, M. "The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations", ''Psychology of Sport and Exercise'' Volume 5, Issue 2, April 2004, Pages 89-109. {{doi|10.1016/S1469-0292(02)00041-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, studies suggest that athletes use music in purposeful ways to facilitate training and performance. In one study, seventy elite Swedish athletes completed a questionnaire relating the empirical motives for listening to music. The results showed that most of they often listened to music during pre-event, pre-training sessions, and warm-ups. The athletes gave as reasons for listening to music that they felt that it increased activation, positive affect, motivation, performance levels, and flow.&lt;ref&gt;Laukka, Petric, and Lina Quick. "Emotional and Motivational Uses of Music in Sports and Exercise: A Questionnaire Study among Athletes." Psychology of Music 41 (2011): 198-215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also types workout music using [[brainwave entrainment]] that claims to boost performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitcatalyst.com Fit Catalyst - Workout Brainwave Entrainment]&lt;/ref&gt;

To further this idea, a study from the ''New York Times'' shows how music helps boost workouts. This experiment was done by testing a control group of people working out in a normal workout setting and the same group of people working out with machines that incorporated beats and rhythms into each rep. To do this, they installed the kits into three different workout machines, one a stair-stepper, the other two weight machines with bars that could be raised or pulled down to stimulate various muscles. Thomas Hans Fritz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute who led the study said, “Participants could express themselves on the machines by, for instance, modulating rhythms and creating melodies.” Throughout each workout, the researchers monitored the force their volunteers generated while using the machines, as well as whether the weight lifters’ movements tended to stutter or flow and how much oxygen the volunteers consumed, a reliable measure of physical effort. Afterward, the scientists asked the volunteers to rate the tolerability or unpleasantness of the session, on a scale from 1 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/how-music-can-boost-our-workouts/?_r=1 |title=How Music Can Boost Our Workouts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2175">[[File:Famadihana reburial razana ancestor Madagascar.jpg|thumb]]'''Famadihana''' is a funerary tradition of the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] [[people]] in [[Madagascar]].  During this ceremony, known as ''the turning of the bones'', people bring forth the bodies of their ancestors from the family crypts and rewrap them in fresh cloth, then dance with the corpses around the tomb to live music.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;"Madagascar's dance with the dead" [[BBC]], 16 August 2008.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7562898.stm] Accessed 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famadihana appears to be a custom of somewhat recent origin, perhaps only since the 17th century in its present form, although it may be an adaptation of premodern double funeral customs from [[Southeast Asia]].  The custom is based upon a belief that the spirits of the dead finally join the world of the ancestors after the body's complete decomposition and appropriate ceremonies, which may take many years.  In Madagascar this became a regular ritual usually once every seven years, and the custom brings together extended families in celebrations of kinship, sometimes even those with troubled relations.  

The practice of Famadihana is on the decline due to the expense of [[silk]] [[shroud]]s and belief by some Malagasy that the practice is outdated. Early missionaries discouraged the practice and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] Malagasy have abandoned the practice in increasing numbers. The [[Catholic Church]], however, no longer objects to the practice because it regards Famadihana as purely cultural rather than religious.  As one Malagasy man explained to the BBC, "It's important because it's our way of respecting the dead.  It is also a chance for the whole family, from across the country, to come together."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mywanderlist.com/2013/03/08/worlds-most-bizarre-ceremony-turning-bones-corpses-madagascar-famadihana/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; A film's genre will influence the use of [[filmmaking]] styles and techniques, such as the use of [[flashback (narrative)| flashback]]s and low-key lighting in film noir, tight framing in horror films, fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films, or the "scrawled" title-font and credits of ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' (1995), a film about a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.''

The basic [[genre]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler]] and genre theory&lt;/ref&gt; include [[fiction]] and [[documentary]], from which subgenres have emerged, such as [[docufiction]] and [[docudrama]]. Other examples of subgenres include the courtroom- and trial-focused [[Drama (modern genre)|drama]] known as the [[legal drama]], which is a subtype of drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the [[The Evil Dead (franchise) | ''Evil Dead'']] films. Other popular combinations include the [[romantic comedy]] and the [[action comedy]] film. [[Alan Williams (disambiguation) | Alan Williams]] distinguishes three main genre categories: [[Narrative film | narrative]], [[Avant-garde film | avant-garde]] and documentary.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Genre film | Genre movies]] are "commercial feature films which, through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations".&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Genre affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in [[video rental store]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Films can also be classified by the setting, theme, topic, mood, format, target audience or budget. The setting is the environment where the story and action take place (e.g., a [[war film]], a [[Western film]], or a [[space opera|space-opera film]]). The theme or topic refers to the issues or concepts that the film revolves around (e.g., [[science-fiction film]], [[sports film]], or [[crime film]]). The mood is the emotional tone of the film (e.g., [[comedy film]], [[horror film]], or tearjerker film). Format refers to the way the film was shot (e.g., [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]], [[16&amp;nbsp;mm]] or [[8&amp;nbsp;mm film|8&amp;nbsp;mm]]) or the manner of presentation (e.g.: [[anamorphic widescreen]]). Additional ways of categorizing film genres may involve the target audience (e.g., [[children's film]], [[teen film]] or [[women's film]]) or by type of [[film production | production]] (e.g., [[B movie]], [[Blockbuster (entertainment) |big-budget blockbuster]] or [[low-budget film]]). ''Genre'' does not just refer to the type of film or its category; spectator expectations about a film, and institutional discourses that create generic structures also play a key role.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"&gt;
Hayward, Susan. "Genre/Sub-genre" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 185-192
&lt;/ref&gt;
Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

==History==
The term "genre" was used to organize films according to type since the earliest days of cinema.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; By the 1950s, [[André Bazin]] was discussing the concept of "genre" by using the [[Western (genre)#Film|Western film]] as an example; during this era, there was a debate over [[auteur theory]] versus genre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; In the late 1960s, the concept of genre became a significant part of [[film theory]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

Film genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and [[musical theatre]] existed before film musicals were made.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) is seen in the 2010s as a key early Western film, but when it was released, it was seen as related to the "then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film".&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in "Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products" to market to audiences, they are easy to produce and it is easy for audiences to understand a genre film.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to create them in an industrial, assembly line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the [[James Bond]] spy films, which all use a formula of "lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters changed.  &lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pure and hybrid genres==
Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of "vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography" and novels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; American film historian [[Janet Staiger]] states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The "idealist method" judges films by predetermined standards. The "empirical method" identifies the genre of a film by comparing it to a list of films already deemed to fall within a certain genre. The [[A priori knowledge|apriori]] method uses common generic elements which are identified in advance. The "social conventions" method of identifying the genre of a film is based on the accepted cultural consensus within society.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Martin Loop contends that [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films are not pure genres because most Hollywood movies blend the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCQOwvI9vsAC|title=Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology|last=Grant|first=Barry Keith|date=2007|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=9781904764793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Colins claims that since the 1980s, Hollywood films have been influenced by the trend towards "ironic hybridization", in which directors combine elements from different genres, as with the Western/science fiction mix in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

Many films cross into multiple genres. Susan Hayward states that spy films often cross genre boundaries with thriller films. &lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; Some genre films take genre elements from one genre and place them into the conventions of a second genre, such as with ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953), which adds film noir and detective film elements into "The Girl Hunt" ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s [[New Hollywood]] era, there was so much parodying of genres that it can be hard to assign genres to some films from this era, such as [[Mel Brooks]]' comedy-Western ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) or the private eye parody ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). &lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; Other films from this era bend genres so much that it is challenging to put them in a genre category, such as [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; 

[[Film theory|Film theorist]] [[Robert Stam]] challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether "genres [are] really 'out there' in the world or are they really the construction of analysts?". As well, he has asked whether there is a "... finite taxonomy of genres or are they in principle infinite?" and whether genres are "...timeless essences ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?" Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive. While some genres are based on story content (the [[war film]]), other are borrowed from literature ([[Comedic genres|comedy]], [[melodrama]]) or from other media (the [[musical film|musical]]). Some are performer-based ([[Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers]] films) or budget-based ([[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], [[low budget film]]), while others are based on artistic status (the [[art film]]), racial identity ([[Race films]]), location (the [[Western (genre)|Western]]), or sexual orientation ([[Queer cinema]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRXmmpFgZEC|title=Film Theory: An Anthology|last=Stam|first=Robert|date=2000-02-21|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631206545|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience expectations ==
Many genres have built-in [[audience]]s and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. For example, horror films have a well-established fanbase that reads horror magazines such as ''[[Fangoria]]''. Films that are difficult to categorize into a genre are often less successful. As such, film genres are also useful in the areas of marketing, [[film criticism]] and the analysis of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Hollywood story consultant [[John Truby]] states that "...you have to know how to transcend the forms [genres] so you can give the audience a sense of originality and surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.writersstore.com/whats-my-genre/|title=What's My Genre?|last=Truby|first=John|authorlink=John Truby|date=|website=Writers Store|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[screenwriter]]s use genre as a means of determining what kind of plot or content to put into a screenplay. They may study films of specific genres to find examples. This is a way that some screenwriters are able to copy elements of successful movies and pass them off in a new [[screenplay]]. It is likely that such screenplays fall short in originality. As Truby says, "Writers know enough to write a genre script but they haven’t twisted the story beats of that genre in such a way that it gives an original face to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|title=Interview: John Truby on Screenwriting and Breaking In|last=Ward|first=Lewis|date=|work=Script Magazine|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2007-07-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702182835/http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|archivedate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema technologies are associated with genres. Huge widescreens helped Western films to create an expansive setting of the open plains and desert. Science fiction and fantasy films are associated with special effects, notably computer generated imagery (e.g., the Harry Potter films).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

== Grouping vs. genre ==
There are other methods of dividing films into groups besides genre. For example, [[auteur]] critics group films according to their auteur-directors. Production attributes, such as the [[low-budget film]], can also be considered a grouping. Some groupings may be casually described as genres although the definition is questionable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} For example, while [[independent film]]s are sometimes discussed as if they are a genre in-and-of themselves, independent productions can belong to any genre. Similarly, while [[art film]]s are referred to as a genre by film scholar [[David Bordwell]], who states that "art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions",&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt; an art film can be in a number of genres (e.g., [[drama]], [[experimental film]], [[black comedy]], etc.).

==Categorization==
[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film) poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[War film]] or [[Anti-war film|anti-war movie]]: [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', 1930]]
Because genres are easier to recognize than to define, academics agree they cannot be identified in a rigid way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUNBpwAACAAJ|title=Film Art: An Introduction|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|last2=Bordwell|first2=David|date=2012-07-06|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780073535104|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, different countries and cultures define genres in different ways. A typical example are war movies. In US, they are mostly related to the two World Wars whereas, in other countries, movies related to wars in other historical periods are considered ''war movies''.

Film genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both ''[[Midway (1976 film)|The Battle of Midway]]''  and ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]''  are set in a [[war]]time context and might be classified as belonging to the [[war film]] genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice, and valour, and the second is an [[anti-war film]] which emphasizes the pain and horror of war. While there is an argument that [[film noir]] movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC|title=Architecture and Film|last=Lamster|first=Mark|date=2000|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=9781568982076|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of filmsite.org argue that animation, [[pornographic film]], documentary film, [[silent film]] and so on are non-genre-based film categories.&lt;ref name="filmsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/genres2.html |title=Other Major Film Categories |publisher=filmsite.org|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of "body genres" since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas are designed to make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people's spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.

A genre movie is a film that follows some or all of the conventions of a particular genre, whether or not it was intentional when the movie was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbKuuBqBWg8C|title=Journalists in Film: Heroes and Villains|last=McNair|first=Brian|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748634477|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and history==
In order to understand the creation and context of each film genre, we must look at its popularity in the context of its place in history. For example, the 1970s [[Blaxploitation]] films have been called an attempt to "undermine the rise of Afro-American's Black consciousness movement" of that era.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;  In William Park's analysis of film noir, he states that we must view and interpret film for its message with the context of history within our minds; he states that this is how film can truly be understood by its audience.&lt;ref name="What is Film Noir?"&gt; Park W. What Is Film Noir? [e-book]. Lanham, Md: Bucknell University Press; 2011. Available from: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Film genres such as [[film noir]] and [[Western film]] reflect values of the time period. While film noir combines German expressionist filming strategies with post World War II ideals; Western films focused on the ideal of the early 20th century. Films such as the [[Musical film|musical]] were created as a form of entertainment during the [[Great Depression]] allowing its viewers an escape during tough times. So when watching and analyzing film genres we must remember to remember its true intentions aside from its entertainment value.

Over time, a genre can change through stages: the classic genre era; the parody of the classics; the period where filmmakers deny that their films are part of a certain genre; and finally a critique of the entire genre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; This pattern can be seen with the Western film. In the earliest, classic Westerns, there was a clear hero who protected society from lawless villains who lived in the wilderness and came into civilization to commit crimes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; However, in [[revisionist Western]]s of the 1970s, the protagonist becomes an [[anti-hero]] who lives in the wilderness to get away from a civilization that is depicted as corrupt, with the villains now integrated into society. Another example of a genre changing over time is the popularity of the [[neo-noir]] films in the early 2000s (''[[Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001) and ''[[Far From Heaven]]'' (2002); are these film noir parodies, a repetition of noir genre tropes, or a re-examination of the noir genre?&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; 

This is also important to remember when looking at films in the future. As viewers watch a film they are conscious of societal influence with the film itself. In order to understand it's true intentions, we must identify its intended audience and what narrative of our current society, as well as it comments to the past in relation with today's society. This enables viewers to understand the evolution of film genres as time and history morphs or views and ideals of the entertainment industry.

[[File:Flag of Cambodia vertical.svg|thumb|right|Vertical display of the Flag of Cambodia]]

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Cambodia''' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: {{big|ទង់ជាតិ
កម្ពុជា}} ''Tung-Cheat'', "National flag") in its present form was originally adopted in 1948 and readopted in 1993, after the [[Cambodian Constituent Assembly election, 1993| Constituent Assembly election in 1993]] and restoration of the [[List of kings of Cambodia|monarchy]].

Since around 1850, the Cambodian flag has featured a depiction of [[Angkor Wat]] in the centre. The current flag, with a [[blue]] border and [[red]] central (the stripes are in the ratio 1:2:1) was adopted following Cambodia's independence in 1948. It was used until 9 October 1970, when a new flag was introduced for [[Lon Nol]]'s [[Khmer Republic]] that lasted until the takeover of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in 1975. The subsequent state of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], which existed from 1975 to 1979, used a red flag with a three-towered Angkor Wat design retained in [[yellow]] beginning in 1976. The [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] was established in 1979, after the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]].

The [[Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation]] (FUNSK) revived the flag adopted by the [[Khmer Issarak]] in the days of anti-French resistance for the new state. This flag had the same colour pattern as the DK flag, but with a yellow five-towered Angkor Wat silhouette. When the PRK renamed itself as "State of Cambodia" (SOC) in 1989, the flag's lower half became blue. The [[UNTAC]] flag was used during the 1992–1993 transitional period along with the flag of the SOC within Cambodia.

In 1993, the 1948 Cambodian flag was readopted. The current Cambodian flag, together with [[Flag of Afghanistan|the flag of Afghanistan]], [[Flag of Spain|the flag of Spain]], and [[Flag of Portugal|the flag of Portugal]], are the only four state flags to feature a building. Red and blue are traditional colours of Cambodia.

The flag used today is the same as that established in 1948, although the older flag is sometimes said to have used a red outline for Angkor Wat while the current flag uses black specifically. Since that time, five other intervening designs have been used. Almost all made use of the image of the temple of Angkor Wat in one form or another. This famous temple site, which dates from the 12th century, was built by the Mahidharapura monarchs. It has five towers, but these were not always all depicted in the stylised version used on flags. The monarchy was restored in September 1993, the 1948 flag having been readopted in June of that year.

The Royal Standard of the King of Cambodia ({{lang-km|ទង់ព្រះមហាក្សត្រ}}; literally, "King's Flag") is the personal flag of the [[ruler of Cambodia|Cambodian monarch]]. It was officially adopted in 1993, but its initial use dates back to 1941. It is also considered among the [[national symbols of Cambodia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14802">'''Futurism''' is a [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] [[Art movement|movement]] in [[literature]] and part of the [[Futurism_(art)|Futurism art movement]] that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909). Futurist [[poetry]] is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist [[theatre]] also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via [[parody]] and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the [[novel]], have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.

==Methodology==
=== Intuition ===
[[File:Filippo Tommaso Marinetti - Zang tumb tumb - Hoge Rijndijk 8, Leiden.JPG|thumb|200px|The Futurist poem "Zang tumb tumb" by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]], The Netherlands]]
In Marinetti's 1909 manifesto, Marinetti calls for the reawakening of "divine intuition" that "after hours of relentless toil" allows for the "creative spirit seems suddenly to shake off its shackles and become prey to an incomprehensible spontaneity of conception and execution".&lt;ref name="looking54"&gt;Clough, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

Soffici had a more earthly reasoning. Intuition was the means by which creation took place. He believed that there could be no abstraction of the values of futurist literature in logical terms. Rather, art was a language in and of itself that could only be expressed in that language. Any attempt to extrapolate from the literature resulted "in the evaluation not of artistic qualities but of extraneous matters".&lt;ref name="looking54" /&gt; As such, the spontaneous creation brought by intuition freed one from abstracting (and therefore adding erroneous material into the literature) and allowed on to speak in the language of art.

In this way, Futurists rallied against "intellectualistic literature…[and] intelligible poetry".&lt;ref name="looking53"&gt;Clough, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this idea is different from anti-intellectualism. They were not hostile to intellectual approaches, but just the specific intellectual approach that poetry had taken for so many years. Therefore, they often rejected any form of tradition as it had been tainted with the previous intellectual approaches of the past.

=== Analogy ===

Analogy's purpose in Futurist writing was to show that everything related to one another. They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence. That is to say, despite what the experience might show one, everything is in fact interconnected. The more startling the comparison, the more successful it is.

The means for creating these analogies is intuition. This intuition is "the poet's peculiar quality in that it enables him to discover analogies which, hidden to reason, are yet the essentials of art".&lt;ref name="looking55"&gt;Clough, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The discovering of analogies is made possible by intuition.

Now, Marinetti believed that analogies have always existed, but earlier poets had not reached out enough to bring appropriately disparate entities together. By creating a communion of two (or more) seemingly unrelated objects, the poet pierces to the "essence of reality".&lt;ref name="looking55" /&gt; The farther the poet has to reach in terms of logical remoteness is in direct proportion to its efficacy.

As analogy thus plays such an important role, it "offers a touchstone to gauge poetical values…: the power to startle. The artistic criterion derived from analogy is stupefaction".&lt;ref name="looking55" /&gt; While an ordinary person's vision is colored by convention and tradition, the poet can brush away this top layer to reveal the reality below. The process of communicating the surprise is art while the "stupefaction" is the reaction to this discovery. Thus, analogies are the essence of poetry for the Futurists.

=== Irony ===

As the Futurists advocated the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition, one might assume that they would suppress the use of irony. On the contrary, irony proved to be "so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it. What was new and untried, at least more so than their principles and theories, were the futurists' stylistic devices".&lt;ref name="looking59"&gt;Clough, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abolition of syntax ===

Futurists believed that the constraints of syntax were inappropriate to modern life and that it did not truly represent the mind of the poet. Syntax would act as a filter in which analogies had to be processed and so analogies would lose their characteristic "stupefaction." By abolishing syntax, the analogies would become more effective. 
The practical realization of this ideal meant that many parts of speech were discarded: Adjectives were thought to bring nuance in "a universe which is…black and white";&lt;ref name="looking60"&gt;Clough, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; the infinitive provided all the idea of an action one needed without the hindrances of conjugation; substantives followed their linked substantives without other words (by the notion of analogy). Punctuation, moods, and tenses, also disappeared in order to be consistent with analogy and "stupefaction."

However, the Futurists were not truly abolishing syntax. White points out that since "The OED defines 'syntax' as 'the arrangement of words in their proper forms) by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown".&lt;ref name="white166"&gt;White, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurists were not destroying syntax in that sense. Marinetti in truth advocated a number of "substantial, but nevertheless selective modifications to existing syntax" and that the "Russian Futurists' idea that they were 'shaking syntax loose'"&lt;ref name="white166" /&gt; is more accurate.

=== Metrical reform ===

Early Futurist poetry relied on free verse as their poetical vehicle. However, free verse "was too thoroughly bound up with tradition and too fond of producing…stale effects"&lt;ref name="looking61"&gt;Clough, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; to be effective. Furthermore, by using free verse, the Futurist realized they would be working under the rules of syntax and therefore interfering with intuition and inspiration.

In order to break free of the shackles of meter, they resorted to what they called "''parole in libertá'' (word autonomy)".&lt;ref name="looking61" /&gt; Essentially, all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern instead of the meter. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

For example, in the poem entitled "Studio" by Soffici, he "describes the artist's studio—and by extension, modern man himself—as becoming a 'radiotelefantastic cabin open to all messages', the sense of wonder her being transmitted by the portmanteau neologism: 'readotelefantastica'".&lt;ref name="white155"&gt;White, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Here all notions of familiar language have been abandoned and in their place a new language has emerged with its own vocabulary.

=== Onomatopoeia ===
There were four forms of [[onomatopoeia]] that the Futurists advocated: direct, indirect, integral, and abstract. The first of these four is the usually onomatopoeia seen in typical poetry, e.g. boom, splash, tweet. They convey the most realistic translation of sound into language. Indirect onomatopoeia "expressed the subjective responses to external conditions".&lt;ref name="looking62"&gt;Clough, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Integral onomatopoeia was "the introduction of any and every sound irrespective of its similarity to significant words".&lt;ref name="looking61" /&gt; This meant that any collection of letters could represent a sound. The final form of onomatopoeia did not reference external sounds or movements like the aforementioned versions of onomatopoeia. Rather, they tried to capture the internal motions of the soul.

=== Essential/synthetic lyricism ===

In order to better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, the Futurist literature promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere.&lt;ref name="looking-nopage"&gt;Clough.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).

== Futurism in the theatre ==

Traditional [[theatre]] often served as a target for Futurists because of its deep roots in classical societies. In its stead, the Futurists exalted the [[Variety show|variety theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] because, they argued, it "had no tradition; it was a recent discovery".&lt;ref name="looking64"&gt;Clough, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Vaudevillian acts aligned themselves well to the notions of "stupefaction" as there was the desire to surprise and excite the audience. Furthermore, the heavy use of machinery attracted the Futurists, as well as Vaudevillian acts' tendency to "destroy" the masterpieces of the past through [[parody]] and other forms of depreciation. 

By adding other Futurist ideals mentioned above, they firmly rooted their beliefs into theatre. They wanted to blur the line between art and life in order to reach below the surface to reality. In practice, this manifested itself in various ways:

:"Collaboration between the public and the actors was to be developed to the point of indistinction of roles—such cooperating confusion was to be partly impromptu…e.g. chairs were to be covered with glue so that ladies' gowns would stick to them; and tickets sold in such a way as to bring side by side men of the extreme right and those of the extreme left, prudes and prostitutes, teachers and pupils. Sneezing powders, sudden darkening of the hall, and alarm signals were all means to insure the proper functioning of this universal human farce".&lt;ref name="looking66"&gt;Clough, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most important aspect of the work was the discrediting of the great works of theatre. These new theatrical ideal of the Futurists helped to establish a new genre of theatre: the synthetic play.

=== Synthetic play ===

This type of play took the idea of compression to an extreme, where "a brief performance in which entire acts were reduced to a few sentences, and scenes to a handful of words. No sentiments, no psychological development, no atmosphere, no suggestiveness. Common sense was banished, or rather, replaced by nonsense".&lt;ref name="looking66" /&gt; There did exist some plays similar to this before the Futurists, but they did not conform to the Futurist agenda. The creator of the first modern synthetic play is thought to be Verlaine, with his aptly titled work ''Excessive Haste''.

== Examples ==
===Excerpt from Marinetti's free verse poem ''To a Racing Car''&lt;ref name="Folejewski155"&gt;Folejewski, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;===

Veemente dio d’una razza d’acciaio,&lt;br /&gt;

nutrito di fiamma&lt;br /&gt;
e d’olî minerali,&lt;br /&gt;
avido d’orizzonti, di prede siderali&lt;br /&gt;
Io scateno il tuo cuore che tonfa diabolicamente,&lt;br /&gt;
scateno i tuoi giganteschi pneumatici,&lt;br /&gt;
per la danza che tu sai danzare&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Vehement god from a race of steel,&lt;br /&gt;
Automobile drunk with space,&lt;br /&gt;
Trampling with anguish, bit between your strident teeth!&lt;br /&gt;
O formidable Japanese monster with forge,&lt;br /&gt;
Nourished with flame and mineral oils,&lt;br /&gt;
Hungry for horizons and sidereal prey,&lt;br /&gt;
I unleash your heart to the diabolical vroom-vroom&lt;br /&gt;
And your giant radials, for the dance&lt;br /&gt;
You lead on the white roads of the world.&lt;br /&gt;

===Farfa's parole in Libertá poem ''Triangle''&lt;ref name="Folejewski177"&gt;Folejewski, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;===

[[Gender inequality]] both leads to and is a result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little progress has been made in ensuring the equal [[right to food]] for women enshrined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]].&lt;ref name="one.wfp.org"&gt;[http://one.wfp.org/eb/docs/2009/wfp194044~1.pdf], World Food Programme Gender Policy Report. Rome, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="food conference"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spieldoch|first=Alexandra|title=The Right to Food, Gender Equality and Economic Policy|journal=Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL)|year=2011|url=http://cwgl.rutgers.edu/resources/publications/economic-a-social-rights/379-the-right-to-food-gender-equality-and-economic-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women face [[discrimination]] both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending [[malnutrition]] and [[hunger]].&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to be spent their income on food and their children's needs.&lt;ref name="Agriculture Sourcebook 2009"&gt;Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook, World Food Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Fund for Agricultural Development (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FAO|title=Food Security|journal=Policy Brief|year=2006|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/ESA/policybriefs/pb_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

According to the [[World Food Summit]] of 1996, food availability is defined as sufficient quantities of foods available on a consistent basis.&lt;ref name="Rome Declaration 1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Declaration (1996)|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} While those are rough estimates, the significant positive impact of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=FAO|title=The state of food and agriculture women in agriculture : closing the gender gap for development|year=2011|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-106768-0|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e.pdf|edition=2010-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to land===

{{See also|Land law}}
Women's ability to own or inherit land is restricted in much of the developing world. Even in countries where women are legally permitted to own land, such as Uganda, research from Women's Land Link Africa shows that cultural norms and customs have excluded them from obtaining land ownership in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Women’s Land Link Africa. (2010). "The Impact of National Land Policy and Land Reform On Women in Uganda". WLLA. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, women own less than 20% of agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;"Women Farmers: Change and Development Agents". 2011. Prepared by World Rural Forum with Alexandra Spieldoch for World Conference on Family Farming.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, in most of the developing countries, a woman's use of land is restricted to temporary cultivation rights, allocated to her by her husband, and in exchange, she provides food and other goods for the household. She is not able to pass the land on to her heirs nor she will be entrusted with the land if her husband dies; the land is automatically granted to her husband's family or any male children the couple may have produced. [[Bina Agarwal]], a development economist known for her work on women's property rights, states "the single most important factor affecting women’s situation is the gender gap in command over property."&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Bina (1994). A field of one's own: gender and land rights in South Asia. Cambridge University Press. p. 576. {{ISBN|0-521-41868-2}}, 0-521-42926-9. Retrieved 2012-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Agarwal claims that in many cases, rural women demand land rights, but she also confirms that some cases exist in which women do not identify land rights as a major problem.&lt;ref name=agarwal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agarwal|first=B.|title=‘Gender and Land Rights Revisited: Exploring New Prospects via the State, Family and Market|journal=Agrarian Change|year=2003|volume=3|pages=184–224|doi=10.1111/1471-0366.00054|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cecile Jackson objects the claim of Agarwal on the ground that it is important to focus on gendering land questions instead of treating land issues only in terms of land rights of women as Agarwal does.&lt;ref name="cecile agarwal critique" /&gt; Gendering land questions requires more ethnographic research of social relations around land.&lt;ref name="cecile agarwal critique"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=C. |year=2003 |title=Gender Analysis of Land: Beyond Land Rights for Women? |journal=Journal of Agrarian Change |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=453–480 |doi=10.1111/1471-0366.00062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, as land privatization leads to the end of communal lands, women find themselves unable to use any land not bestowed upon them by their families, rendering unmarried women and widows vulnerable. Many women still face legal hurdles when attempting to acquire land through inheritance or the marketplace. In order to reorganize post-colonial societies, SADC states have engaged in land redistribution and resettlement programs, ranging from temporary lease-holding to permanent property rights. Even in cases where no gender bias is officially present in land redistribution policy, social custom permits officials to favor male-headed households and individual men over female-headed households and individual women.

===Division of unpaid labor and time constraints===

{{See also|Unpaid work}}
Particularly in rural areas, the use of women's time in agriculture is often constrained by obligations such as fetching water and wood, preparing meals for their families, cleaning,  and tending to children and livestock. For example, in Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia women expend most of their energy on load-carrying activities involving transport of fuel-wood, water, and grain for grinding.&lt;ref name="Agriculture Sourcebook 2009"/&gt;

The gendered division of labor in agriculture has been known to create unequal household power dynamics, responsibilities, and benefits from agriculture.

===Access to markets===

Constraints to mobility and time, gendered divisions of labor as well as cultural and social norms hamper the access of women to markets.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Women tend to be engaged in the production of traditional and subsistence crops offering less opportunities to benefit from market income,&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; however, self-consumption might also be a conscious choice.&lt;ref name="De Schutter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Women's rights and the right to food|journal=Women's rights and the right to food|year=2010|volume=A/HRC/22/50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the household women often have little decision-making power related to marketing and selling activities as well as over the spending of the money earned, although they often contribute considerably amounts of time to the production.&lt;ref name="Women and Land in Africa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wanyeki|first=Muthoni|title=Women and Land in Africa: Culture, Religion, and Realizing Women's Rights|year=2003|publisher=David Phillip Publishers|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAID India"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurung|first=Chanda|title=The Role of Women in the Fruit and Vegetable Supply Chain in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, India|journal=USAID|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in parts of India women have to ask permission of their husbands to follow market activities.&lt;ref name="USAID India"/&gt; Engaging in markets offers opportunities like organic agriculture and collectives of landless women in Kenya used revenues from selling bananas and vegetables on local markets to compensate for shortfalls in their wages at coffee plantations. But reliance on markets also increases exposure to international market fluctuations, while women farmers are mainly smallholders and often unable to profit from export opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=García|first=Zoraida|title=Agriculture, trade negotiations and gender|year=2006|publisher=FAO|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0493e/a0493e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ifad|title=Rural Poverty Report 2001 - The Challenge of Ending Rural Poverty|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 5 - Markets for the Rural Poor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, potato farmers, felt the negative impacts of global market integration when imported potatoes cut market prices by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliveros |first=Teresita |title=Impact of new world trade regime on peasant women in the Philippines |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/regime-cn.htm |publisher=Third World Network |accessdate=13 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218134843/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/regime-cn.htm |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to technology, training, and infrastructure===
A gendered role of women hinders access to technology, agricultural training, and rural infrastructure.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Women's success in food security in most countries revolves around their reach to equal resources as men in aforementioned sectors.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Women's limited access to technology resulted in the failure to address women's time constraints to agricultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Shubh|title=Potential and Practice in Food Production Technology Development|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/mellor87ch10.pdf|chapter=Women's Role and Agricultural Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, agricultural training marginalizes women as they are normally conceived as farmwives rather than farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leckie|first=G.J.|title='They never trusted me to drive': Farm girls and the gender relations of agricultural information transfer|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|date=September 1996|volume=3|issue=3|pages=309–325|doi=10.1080/09663699625586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural infrastructure includes transport, energy, information and communication technologies.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Women's access to infrastructure eases their burden of agricultural and domestic activities as well as encourages their participation in farming. However, privatization of infrastructure services hindered rural women and children from escaping poverty traps which constrain their ability to sustainably produce food for themselves and for market. The Center for Women's Global Leadership writes that "trade liberalization policies have increased their work burden and undermined their right to food."&lt;ref name="Food page 7-8"/&gt;

=== Access to finance ===

Most financial services in rural areas are directed towards households, and the male members usually receive credit and insurance via development agencies. Another issue is that women are employed as mere helpers without any substantive decision making power within rural farming families, rather than entrepreneurs who should have access to credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletschner|first=Diana|author2=Lisa Kenney|title=Rural Women’s Access to Financial Services: Credit, Savings and Insurance|journal=ESA Working Paper No. 11-07|year=2011|url=http://www.ifad.org/drd/agriculture/133.htm|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation and local customs hinder women's access to and control of assets that can be deemed as collateral such as land or livestock, by lending institutions. It is less likely for a women to own land, even if their families own it, and they are also less likely to control land, even if they formally own it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|title=Gender and Land Rights Revisited: Exploring New Prospects via the State, Family and Market|journal=Journal of Agrarian Change|date=1 January 2003|volume=3|pages=184–224|url=http://www.escr-net.org/usr_doc/Agarwal-_Gender_and_Land_Rights_Revisited.pdf|doi=10.1111/1471-0366.00054|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, since there is bias in control over assets, livestock which is of a high-value is usually owned by men, whereas women mostly own low-value animals such as poultry. Such a system works against women as it offers lower security through their low-value livestock, and proves to be a serious hindrance for women to access credit due to lack of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Women's Access to financial services Credit, savings and insurance|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/am312e/am312e00.pdf|publisher=Economic and Social Department of the Food and Agricultural Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another constraint is that lower literacy levels among women hinder their ability to communicate and understand the information that is communicated to them in writing, which in turn limits their understanding of complex financial products that are being offered to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNDP Human Development Report 2007 |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429033726/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |archivedate=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==

The [[World Food Summit]] of 1996 defined access to food as to have "sufficient resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet."&lt;ref name="Rome Declaration 1996"/&gt;  It can be analyzed at national level – concerning the country's food access from the global market, at households level – concerning household member's ability to produce their own food or to purchase food from the market, and at individual level – concerning individual's ability to meet their nutritional needs.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook|year=2008|publisher=The World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Fund for Agricultural Development|isbn=978-0-8213-7587-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most research of the nexus between gender and food access has been conducted at households level and under the perception of gender as women.

===Women and household's food access===

Women's access to food is closely connected to households' food access because they are typically responsible for food supply in households.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Women can gain the access to food through producing it for their own consumption or purchasing it with income. Income is either generated from market activity or granted by redistributive mechanisms in the form of government's social protection measure or community's solidarity.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; Many studies conducted during the 1980s suggest that women typically spend a higher portion of their income on food and health care for children than men do.&lt;ref name="KEY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women: The Key to Food Security|url=http://www.ifpri.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/publications/fpr21.pdf|publisher=The International Food Policy Research Institute|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|For relevant studies, G.

One of them is that societal and cultural norms may impose on women the role of ensuring adequate share of food among household members. When a study interviewed people living near Lake Victoria, women typically considered their children as the first or second greatest expenditure, while men did not view them as a cost.&lt;ref name="VIC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Geheb|author2=Sarah Kalloh, Modesta Medard, Anne-Therese Nyapendi, Carrolyne Lweya, Mercy Kyangwa|title=Nile perch and the hungry of Lake Victoria: Gender, status and food in an East African fishery|journal=Food Policy|year=2008|volume=33|issue=1|pages=85–98|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that women may prefer to spend more on children's daily needs as they share more time with them. The other hypothesis is that different income flow of women from men causes different transaction costs.&lt;ref name="KEY" /&gt; According to a study, men typically contribute to large and one-off payments while women spend for daily household expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=S|title=Women and Nutrition in Third World Countries|year=1984|publisher=Begin and Garvey|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constraints to food access===

Food access by women can be constrained physically, or more frequently economically due to a gendered role of women.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Moreover, the gendered role of women can create sociocultural constraints to food access.&lt;ref name="Hadley 2008 427–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hadley|first=C|author2=Lindstrom D. |author3=Tessema F. |author4=Belachew T. |title=Gender bias in the food insecurity experience of Ethiopian adolescents|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=2|pages=427–38 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.025|pmid=17931763 |pmc=2791354}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints are interrelated with each other. For example, sociocultural norms toward women can limit women's mobility, imposing physical constraints, whereas physical constraints can hinder women to be engaged into the market, deteriorating their economic access to food.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

====Physical access to food====

Women are less mobile and more time-constrained due to both gender-based division of labor in household and sociocultural norms.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; While men are generally responsible only for income-generating activities, women are in charge of not only childcare but also time-consuming domestic activities.&lt;ref name="IFRIS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lisa C.|first=Smith|title=The Importance of Women’s Status for Child Nutrition in Developing Countries|year=2003|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/rr131.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa, women spend large amount of time to transport supplies of domestic use – such as fuelwood and water – and to travel between home and field for domestic task.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

====Economic access to food====

Women have less decision-making power in household.&lt;ref name="IFRIS" /&gt; Moreover, they have less chances for income-generating activities in the market.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt;  An analysis of poverty measures in rural Ghana and Bangladesh showed that more persons in female-headed households are below poverty line.&lt;ref name="KEY" /&gt; The inferior position of women in and outside household is interconnected because if women do not have economically constructed better alternative to staying with their husbands, they will be unlikely to make a voice against husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elizabeth|title=The Intra-Household Economics of Voice and Exit|journal=Feminist Economics|date=January 1997|volume=3|issue=3|pages=25–46|doi=10.1080/135457097338645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Limited Control over Resources in Household''' - Women have weak economic autonomy in household as they are attributed smaller amount of household income compared to men.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; In a study of fishery villages of lake Victoria, men did not reveal their income to women, while they expected women to do so.

* '''Limited Education Opportunities''' - Women have limited access to educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; Women tend to have lower educational status than men, and therefore more difficulties in finding formal wage employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovorka|first=Alice|title=Gender and urban agriculture: emerging trends and areas for future research|journal=In Annotated bibliography on urban and peri-urban agriculture.|year=2001|series=Compiled for the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)|pages=165–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that in Kampala, most women involved in urban farming have only primary education, or none at all.

* '''Limited Employment Opportunities''' - Women have limited access to employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; When women are self-employed in subsistence farming and meeting household needs, it is not counted as an economic activity in the market.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; Moreover, when women are employed on or off farm, they are likely to be located in periphery segment of operation and work in inadequate conditions because they have few options in the employment market.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; As a consequence, women may have not enough income to purchase food.&lt;ref name="KEY" /&gt;
* '''Less Investment in Girls''' - Limitations which women face in the market leads to underinvestment by parents in girls, making a vicious cycle.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt; Until they benefit from improved employment opportunities of girls, parents would have little incentive to educate girls because of their dim prospect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quisumbing|first=Agnes|author2=Maluccio J.|title=Resources at Marriage and Intrahousehold Allocation: Evidence from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and South Africa|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2003|volume=65|issue=3|pages=283–327|doi=10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socio-cultural access to food====
Customs and culture often dictate differential roles, privileges, and life options for women and men, especially in favor of the latter.&lt;ref name="IFRIS" /&gt; A study found that in Ethiopia where girls have faced historical discrimination girls were more likely to be food insecure than boys. This is because when food stress happens to a household, adult members buffer younger members in a preferential way for boys over girls.&lt;ref name="Hadley 2008 427–38"/&gt;

==Utilization ==

Household decision-making models assume family as a homogenous unit operating with a common [[utility function]]
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Becker |first=Gary S. |title=Irrational Behaviour and Economic Theory |journal=The Journal of Political Economy |year=1962 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |url=http://harbaugh.uoregon.edu/Readings/Rational%20choice/Becker%20irrational.pdf |doi=10.1086/258584 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011616/http://harbaugh.uoregon.edu/Readings/Rational%20choice/Becker%20irrational.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose members share the same amount of access to and utilization of household's resources including food. However, these models are not capable to explain dynamics impacting intra-household resource allocation and its effects to distribution within the family.

There is a huge number of empirical and theoretical studies declining altruistic family joint utility function theory of Becker . Sen's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sen |first=Amartya |title=Gender and Cooperative Conflicts |url=http://www.ser-mulher.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Amartya-Sen-Gender-and-cooperative-conflicts.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000244/http://www.ser-mulher.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Amartya-Sen-Gender-and-cooperative-conflicts.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   theory of [[intra-household bargaining]] shows the inequality in decision-making process among different members of households and how this inequality affects distribution of resources.

=== Case studies ===

Recent empirical case studies show that food allocation is sometimes preferentially distributed to certain members of households according to age, gender, health, or labor productivity and not all members benefit equally from it.

====Differences of food utilization of women in polygamous households in Burkina Faso====

The magnitude of inequality is more prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa where males are the primary decision makers within extended families and [[polygamy]] is quite common. Mostly, women work in small lands to provide food for themselves and their children. According to a research&lt;ref name="burkina faso polygamy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frongillo|first=Edward A.|author2=Siméon Nanama|title=Women's rank modifies the relationship between household and women's food insecurity in complex households in northern [[Burkina Faso]] |journal=Food Policy|year=2012|volume=37|issue=3|pages=217–225|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Burkina Faso, women in polygamous households were considerably more food insecure in comparison with their equals in [[monogamous]] households in case of food scarcity.

The same research&lt;ref name="burkina faso polygamy" /&gt; also shows how ranking among women within polygamous households matter in terms of food security and suggest that last-order women in polygamous households is more food secure in good times due to her relatively close tie with the household head. Yet, this advantage turns into a disadvantage due to her less access to arable land and her relative incompetence to establish a supportive network, unlike elder women in the same polygamous households, which can prevent her from food shortage when the households face with food insecurity.

====Buffering bias against girls in Ethiopia====

Many studies focus on resource allocation within households suggest that younger households are buffered from food insecurity by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leonard|first=W.R.|title=Household-level strategies for protecting children from seasonal food scarcity|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=1991|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1127–1133|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(91)90228-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these studies do not address whether the buffering experiences of young households are gendered.

Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hadley|first=Craig|author2=Lindstrom, David |author3=Tessema, Fasil |author4= Belachew, Tefara |title=Gender bias in the food insecurity experience of Ethiopian adolescents|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=January 2008|volume=66|issue=2|pages=427–438|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.025 |pmid=17931763 |pmc=2791354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  et al. observed “buffering hypothesis” in the city of Jimma, Ethiopia, where adult members of households waive some part of their food to buffer younger households in case of food insecurity. The research showed that girls are discriminated against boys since buffering aims at boys, 41% of girls in severely food insecure households also experienced food insecurity compared to 20% of boys in severely food insecure households.

====No difference in food security among female and male-headed households in indigenous ethnic groups in Bangladesh====

A research&lt;ref name="Food secure Bangaldesh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallick|first=Debdulal|author2=Rafi, Mohammad|title=Are Female-Headed Households More Food Insecure? Evidence from Bangladesh|journal=World Development|date=April 2010|volume=38|issue=4|pages=593–605|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; on four indigenous ethnic groups in [[Bengal]] found that there was no significant difference in food security between the male and female headed households in these communities. This finding was in contrast to general wisdom that the “female headed households are more vulnerable to food insecurity”.&lt;ref name="Food secure Bangaldesh" /&gt;

Lack of cultural and social restrictions on women such as participation in the labor force enables these women to perceive themselves food secure unlike societies where patriarchal norms are strong and there exist a number of restrictions on women.

On the other hand, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Lincoln|author2=Emdadul Huq |author3=Stan D'Souza |title=Sex Bias in the Family Allocation of Food and Health Care in Rural Bangladesh|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 1981|volume=7|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi=10.2307/1972764}}&lt;/ref&gt; in rural Bangladesh shows that malnutrition is prevalent in girls than boys. The research used Harvard weight-for-age standard, which found that 14.4% of girls were classified as severely malnourished in comparison with only 5.1% of boys, showing sex-biased nutrition-related practices favoring boys.

====Single obese mothers in USA====

Low food security does not only display itself in hunger and decrease in body size, but also in weight-gaining. According to a number of studies showing the linkage between low food security and sex differences, low food security is linked to being over-weight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=E.J.|author2=L. Grummer-Strawn, G.Chavez|title=Food insecurity is associated with increased risk of obesity in California women|journal=Journal of Nutrition|year=2003|volume=133|issue=4|pages=1070–1074|pmid=12672921|last3=Chavez|first3=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and “gaining 5 pounds or more in one year, but only among women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilde|first=P.E.|author2=J.N. Peterman|title=Individual weight change is associated with household food security status|journal=Journal of Nutrition|year=2006|volume=136|issue=5|pages=1395–1400|pmid=16614436}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Very low food security is associated with being underweight, but again only for women”.&lt;ref name="Obese bcz of her children"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Molly A.|author2=Adam M.

An empirical research&lt;ref name="Obese bcz of her children" /&gt;  is conducted between mothers and non-mothers in the US to understand the relation between “motherness” in gaining weight for women. The research found statistically significant association between “motherness” and “food insecurity”. Relatively income-restrained single mothers, in parallel to the requirements of traditional expectations and socially constructed roles for them, risk their individual health by skipping meals, eat less or consume high-calorie but nutritionally-poor food, in order to provide food security of their children.

==Stability==
Stability refers to adequate access to food for populations, households, or individuals that is stable over time. Both shocks and cyclical events can influence stability negatively.&lt;ref name="one.wfp.org"/&gt; Limited access to resources, increasing care and time burdens and less decision-making power for women resulting from gendered roles in society lead to differential experiences of and coping mechanisms for instability.&lt;ref name="Quisi Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Food-Price Shocks and Poor People|year=2012|pages=34–38|author=Quisumbing, Agnes, Ruth Meinzen-Dick, Julia Behrman, Lucy Bassett|edition=1|chapter=Gender and the global food-price crisis|editor1=Marc J.

=== Climate change ===
[[File:Ethiopian women and boys playing with water.jpg|thumb|Women and boys at a well in Ethiopia]]

Research findings suggest that gender roles in society and gendered access to resources will result in differential affects, coping and adaptation strategies for women and men in response to [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD"&gt;{{cite book|last=WB, FAO, IFAD|title=Gender in Agriculture|year=2009|publisher=IBRD, WB|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-8213-7587-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Additionally, women's access to resources and information is often more limited.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD"/&gt; For example, in South Africa male fishers were warned about [[El Niño]], while women were not.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; In drought-prone regions in India women have less access to agricultural information and services to adapt to climate change, and coping strategies vary by gender: women tend to seek local wage labor, while men migrate.&lt;ref name="FAO CC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambrou|first=Yianna|author2=Sibyl Nelson|title=Farmers in a changing climate - Does gender matter?|journal=FAO|year=2010|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1721e/i1721e00.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women [[geographic mobility]] is often limited, and they are left with the additional burden of the work priorly done by the men after those migrate.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite book |last=FAO, ADB |year=2013 |title=Gender Equality and Food Security - Women's Empowerment as a Tool against Hunger |url=http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ar259e/ar259e.pdf |publisher=Asian Development Bank |location=Mandaluyong City, Philippines |isbn=978-92-9254-172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; As consumers women are likely to feel increased prices stronger because of lower purchasing power and unequal bargaining power within households.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Another reason for differential impacts is the distribution of labor within households: with climate change water and fuelwood scarcity as well as negative health effects on children and other dependents can put additional time constraints on females.&lt;ref name=IPCC /&gt; Women often lack a voice in decision making at local and international levels, but climate change could also be an opportunity for renegotiation of [[gender roles]] and female empowerment.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO CC" /&gt;

=== Food-price shocks ===
Poor households are more at risk from food price spikes and increased food price volatility, because food expenditures account for a large proportion of their income, up to 67% for the extreme poor in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; High dependency ratios and discrimination, among others regarding employment, access to land, and social transfers make female-headed households especially vulnerable to rising food prices. In Bangladesh 38% of female-headed compared to 23% of male-headed households were found to be food-insecure in 2009 and in Ethiopia female-headed households were more vulnerable to the [[2007–08 world food price crisis]].&lt;ref name="Quisi Book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Food Security |author2=Nutritional Analysis Unit Somalia |title=Gender in Emergency Food Security, Livelihoods and Nutrition in Somalia|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh female workers in the textile industry were hit hard by the food price crisis of 2008, because their wages did not adjust to rising food prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macan-Markar |first=M. |title=ASIA: food crisis adds to women's burden |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42162 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |newspaper=Inter Press Service (IPS) |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709202545/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42162 |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IFPRI found that only few countries introduce safety nets in response to food crisis, and these are seldom targeted towards women.&lt;ref name="Quisi Book" /&gt; Within households women often act as shock-absorbers increasing their work load and decreasing their consumption. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, with negative repercussions on their and their children's future prospects, and girls are often the first ones to be taken out of school.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt;

=== Financial and economic crisis ===
The impacts of past crises, including the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]] and [[structural adjustment]] in Africa, have differed by gender.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quisi Book" /&gt; This pattern has also been confirmed in the most recent [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; For example, in the US subprime mortgages were targeted towards female-headed households&lt;ref name="Subprime"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dymski|first=Gary|author2=Jesus Fernandez |author3=Lisa Mohanty |title=Race, Gender, Power, and the US Subprime Mortgage and Foreclosure Crisis: A Meso Analysis|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=124–151|year=2013|doi=10.1080/13545701.2013.791401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and females are often the first ones to be dismissed.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; In a global survey 40% of respondents agreed that men have more right to employment in case of scarce employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sequino|first=Stephanie|title=Emerging issue The gender perspectives of the financial crisis|journal=Written submission to the Commission on the Status of Women, 53rd session, UN Women|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Asia women were overrepresented in export, low-skilled, low-wage and informal sectors and consequently felt the crisis more severely. In addition, working hours are likely to increase and wages to decrease for those remaining in employment.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; Disaggregated data by gender is rare, but research suggests that as a result of the Asian crisis of 1997-99 childhood [[anemia]] rose by 50%-65%, and maternal anemia by 15%-19% in Indonesia, while maternal anemia increased by 22% in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Asia crisis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhutta|first=Z.

In addition men are more likely to die in conflict or migrate, leaving women in charge of the household and increasing the burden on women.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; Country experiences from Somalia show that women's contribution to household income has increased during the conflict as well as their influence on decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Food Security |author2=Nutrition Analysis Unit Somalia |title=Gender in Emergency Food Security, Livelihoods and Nutrition in Somalia|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems, are that in conflict situations women are not always able to claim the land priorly owned by their husbands, and in Cambodia women received marginal lands in redistribution following conflict, partly because they were more likely to be illiterate.&lt;ref name="WB, FAO, IFAD" /&gt; Similarly, natural disasters, triggered by climate change or other factors, have been found to put additional care burdens on women post-disaster, while limited mobility and work opportunities outside of the home reduce their range of coping strategies.&lt;ref name=IPCC /&gt; Especially in unequal societies limited access to resources compounds women's vulnerability to natural disasters.&lt;ref name="one.wfp.org"/&gt;

==Gender and global food security policy==

Many small-scale, women-centered, agricultural cooperatives have emerged in developing countries to fulfill these needs by pooling resources, establishing economies of scale, and creating greater collective bargaining power for resources, land rights, and market access. One such [[urban agriculture]] project is Abalimi Bezekhaya, in Cape Town, South Africa, which provides training, manure, set-up and maintenance of an irrigation system, and R150 ($15 USD) to each participant. Most of the participants are women. According to Liziwe Stofile, who trains new farmers, "The reason that women take over most of the [[community gardens]] is because they want to take vegetables home to feed their children. The men only want to make money."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.good.is/post/cape-town-s-women-take-the-lead-in-farm-focused-social-enterprise/], Cape Town's Women Take the Lead in Farm-Focused Social Enterprise.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroeconomic factors should also be taken into account, such as the emergence of neo-liberal capitalist policies imposed through the [[Washington Consensus]] which include [[Structural Adjustment Programs]], austerity measures, and an emphasis on expanding export-oriented trade at the expense of small-scale producers and rural development. The Center for Women's Global Leadership reported in 2011 that the expectation that this economic shift would increase the global food supply resulted in the strengthening of powerful transnational companies through heavy subsidization, while overall food security faltered as "developing countries withdrew investment in agriculture and rural development, leading to a decline in their long-term productive capacity and transforming them into net food importers."&lt;ref name="Food page 7-8"&gt;The Right to Food, Gender Equality and Economic Policy. Center for Women's Global Leadership, page 7-8. September 16–17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy issues ===

Previously ignored, the accommodation of gender in agriculture is crucial for development policies in developing countries. Researchers, aid donors and policymakers are witnessing how important the role of gender is in agricultural programs, and how it can be utilized to improve productivity. Hence, there is a strong need to tackle issues that affect women, and to employ the expertise of women's groups as competent collaborators in improving agricultural productivity. According to the World Bank's Gender in Agricultural Sourcebook, women make up more than 50 percent of the labour force, and are in involved in three-quarters of food production in sub-Saharan Africa, but most development policies are gender-blind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Agricultural Livelihoods: Strengthening Governance|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENAGRLIVSOUBOOK/Resources/Module2.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failure to include the role of women as producers further exacerbates the situation.

The Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) report titled State of Food and Agriculture 2010-2011, and the World Bank's World Development Report 2012 illustrate women's input in the area of agriculture in developing countries. FAO's report focuses on the urgency with which the gender gap needs to be closed when it comes to agricultural resources, education, extension, financial services, and labour markets that women are denied access to. Moreover, it highlights the need for increased investment in labour-saving and productivity enhancing mechanisms, along with better infrastructure to enable women to engage in more productive activities that encourage women's involvement in fair, flexible, and efficient rural labour markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of Food and Agriculture 2010–2011: Women in Agriculture: Closing the Gender Gap for Development|year=2011|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Development Report 2012 strongly emphasizes that closing the gender gap will lead to improvements in productivity, and identifies areas where policies can address the issues related to gender gap such girl's education, excessive female deaths, decreasing poverty gaps between men and women, improving women's access to economic opportunities, pushing women's agendas into the public sphere, and discouraging the spread of gender inequality onto the future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Development Report 2012|year=2011|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington D.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key developmental organizations and aid donors are now including the gender dimension to their programmes, and to their programme monitoring structures. For example, FAO's gender strategy, found in the FAO Policy for Gender Equality 2013, includes assigning 30 percent of FAO's operational work and budget at the country and regional levels to targeted, women-specific interventions by 2017, and to disaggregate all data in every FAO statistical databases by sex.&lt;ref name="Food 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Food|title=FAO policy on gender equality : attaining food security goals in agriculture and rural development|year=2013|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-107490-9|author2=Nations, Agriculture Organization of the United}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, developed by the US government's Feed the Future programme which aims to decrease poverty and food insecurity. The index assesses different indicators of women's empowerment, and compares scores produced by these indicators over a period of time to evaluate if empowerment is produced as a result of Feed the Future, which runs in 19 focus countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01240.pdf|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy proposals ===

To decrease the gender gap in agriculture, policies and programs should not only be focused on improving productivity and livelihood of women, but should also play a role in empowering women in their households and communities. Women are often denied access to tangible assets such as land, irrigation, tools, technology, as well as non-tangible assets such financial, human and social capital.&lt;ref name="Institute 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Institute|first=International Food Policy Research|title=2012 global food policy report|year=2013|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89629-553-7|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/gfpr2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Land ====

The legislation surrounding land inheritance would benefit from reforms that are aimed at supporting women's property rights. For example, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005 is amended to remove provisions that are deemed to be discriminatory towards women.&lt;ref name=About.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Doy|first=Subhamoy|title=Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/history/a/successionact.htm|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such reforms must be addressed with caution since customary land rights and succession practices are strongly implemented in rural societies, where the practice may not be gender neutral.&lt;ref name="Gender section of Inheritance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and Sustainable Development since Rio - Legal Trends in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y3872E/y3872e0a.htm|publisher=FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, policymakers should incorporate this factor and ensure that efficient mechanisms are in place to ensure that the law is implemented equally across all areas.

==== Tools and technology ====

Access to technology and tools is essential in improving the role of women producers, because in some cases women do not possess the financial means to purchase tools while in other cases, they may not be socially permitted to own or use tools. Gender transformative policies regarding this issue should incorporate women's needs when designing policies.&lt;ref name="Food 2013"/&gt;

==== Microfinance ====

Rural women often rely on microfinance for credit, but this mechanism can be modified to meet other needs such a way of making and receiving payments, such as through mobile phones, or allow women to be involved in markets for purchasing inputs, and selling their produce. Such a system is crucial for women who live in societies where their mobility is restricted.&lt;ref name="Food 2013"/&gt;

==== Agricultural expertise ====

Gender blind policies should also address an important barrier, which is access to agricultural advisory services for women.&lt;ref name="World Bank Gender and Governance"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender and governance in rural services |year=2009 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/gender_and_gov_in_rural_services.pdf |publisher=World Bank |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-8213-7658-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformative policies would include female experts or a group based delivery mechanism that incorporates the social stigma of private interaction with the opposite sex. Such a policy would reinforce the notion of women as farmers, as well as meet their needs for information.&lt;ref name="Institute 2013"/&gt;

The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is the first measure to directly capture women's empowerment and inclusion levels in the agricultural sector. The index considers five factors to be indicative of women's overall empowerment in the agricultural sector:
* Decisions over agricultural production
* Power over productive resources such as land and livestock
* Decisions over income
* Leadership in the community
* Time use

Women are considered empowered if they score adequately in at least four of the components. The index functions at the country or regional level, working with individually based data of men and women in the same households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feedthefuture.gov/sites/default/files/resource/files/weai_brochure_2012.pdf], Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender-sensitive indexes such as WEAI are intended to aid governments, scholars, and organizations to make informed and educated decisions regarding food and gender policy in regionally specific agendas. Gender consciousness in policy-making may lead to decisions to support women's individual or cooperative agricultural endeavors, reform land laws, reduce market restrictions, allow for greater access to the international market, or provide targeted training and inputs.

==Plot==
"Nobby" Butcher has been separated from his little brother Sebastian for 28 years. During the years of separation, Nobby has become an alcoholic and has started his own life with his girlfriend Dawn and 11 children in the English seaport town of [[Grimsby]].

Sebastian (now Sebastian Graves) has become one of [[MI6]]'s top agents. After completing an interrogation, Sebastian comes into information regarding [[philanthropist]] Rhonda George, who is hosting a benefit called WorldCure and is a potential target for assassination, and is assigned to go. Nobby's pub friends also find out that his brother will be at WorldCure and convince Nobby to go and reconnect with him. At the event, Sebastian sees a hitman, Pavel Lukashenko, who plans to assassinate Rhonda with a gun disguised as a video camera. As Sebastian prepares to shoot the camera, Nobby sees him and gives him a hug, accidentally causing him to shoot a Jewish-Palestinian boy with [[AIDS]] named Schlomo. The spray of blood lands in [[Daniel Radcliffe]]'s mouth, infecting him.

The brothers go on the run from the authorities and other assassins. Despite Sebastian's protests, Nobby convinces him it would be best to hide at his home in Grimsby. Meanwhile, MI6 believes that Sebastian has gone rogue. The MI6 send orders to an assassin named Chilcott to track Sebastian down. However, Sebastian calls his handler Jodie and proclaims his innocence.

Chilcott and his men find the two brothers at a pub, but the both manage to escape, though Sebastian is hit with two ''[[Lonomia]]'' poison darts in the process. To save him, Nobby is forced to suck the poison out of his body.

Sebastian learns from Jodie that Lukashenko was going to make a deal with Joris Smit in a [[South Africa]]n lodge and the brothers travel there. Sebastian accidentally injects himself with [[heroin]], mistaking it for the bone strengthening treatment for his broken ankle. Nobby must assume his identity and go undercover.

Nobby mistakenly seduces the woman named Banu the Cleaner as Joris's wife Lina and is then interrupted by Joris and his two men. Sebastian arrives and saves Nobby. Lina tells them that Lukashenko bought some sort of virus, but she is fatally shot by Chilcott's men from a distance before she gives any further information. To outrun Chilcott's men, the brothers are forced to hide inside an elephant's vagina, but in the process are covered in semen due to several males having sexual intercourse with the female. Later, Sebastian asks why Nobby abandoned him as a child. Nobby explains that Sebastian's adoptive parents only wanted to adopt one of the brothers but were unable to decide, and he ran away so Sebastian could have a better life. Sebastian apologizes to Nobby.

The two brothers travel to [[Santiago, Chile]], the venue of football game final between [[England]] and [[Germany]]. They realise that the syndicate plans to unleash their weapon upon a football match in the area, but the syndicate captures Sebastian. Rhonda visits the captured Sebastian and tells him her plans to launch the virus — called WorldCure — into the arena via fireworks. Nobby kills Lukashenko and other henchmen on his way before rescuing Sebastian.

The brothers race back to the arena and spot Rhonda. Chilcott attempts to kill Sebastian, but Nobby's kids throw Schlomo's wheelchair at him, knocking him over and impaling him on a helmet while Nobby goes after Rhonda. Nobby then tries to shoot Rhonda but his gun jams and he realises he must stop the fireworks himself. He sits on one of the fireworks containing the virus; Sebastian sits on the other at the last minute, reaffirming his brotherhood with Nobby. The fireworks go off with the two atop them and the brothers are knocked unconscious upon landing. Nobby's gun goes off and hits Daniel Radcliffe, whose infectious blood spills into [[Donald Trump]]'s mouth.

The news reports state that Rhonda has been arrested, the Grimsby brothers have "died" after saving the world, and Trump has AIDS. Schlomo is in custody after "killing" Chilcott. The brothers are actually recovering in the hospital. Jodie visits and gives them new identities, informing them that the virus did not affect them because its antidote is elephant semen. Nobby's family visits them.

In the final scene, eight weeks later, Nobby and Sebastian are on a mission in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. On a boat, Nobby is approached by a team of gunmen, whom he quickly kills. He reaches Sebastian, who asks him if he has met the team; Nobby realises too late that the gunmen were his team.

In a post credit scene the brothers are in a car and stop to ask a man for directions to the stadium, after receiving directions Nobby shoots the man saying 'leave no witnesses', disturbing Sebastian.

A number of residents of Grimsby were upset with Baron Cohen for negative stereotypes portraying their town as a rubbish-strewn, violent ghetto in which drunks urinate from windows and mothers hand children cans of beer in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galvin|first1=Nick|title=Sacha Baron Cohen film outrages residents of UK town of Grimsby|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/sacha-baron-cohen-film-outrages-residents-of-uk-town-of-grimsby-20140715-zt7nc.html|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=smh.com.au|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally projected to gross $7–8 million in its opening weekend, however, after grossing just $1.2 million on its opening day, estimates were lowered to $3–4 million.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/10-cloverfield-lane-brothers-grimsby-zootopia-box-office-preview-1201716865|title='Zootopia' Turnstiles Still Spinning, But '10 Cloverfield Lane' Also A Hot Destination – Box Office Preview|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/03/12/friday-box-office-10-cloverfield-lane-adds-9m-to-its-mystery-box-brothers-grimsby-bombs/#601c13221ad0|title=Friday Box Office: '10 Cloverfield Lane' Adds $9M To Its Mystery Box, 'Brothers Grimsby' Bombs|author=Scott Mendelson|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wound up grossing $3.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing 8th at the box office.

'''Grok''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɑː|k}} is a word coined by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] for his 1961 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''.  While the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' summarizes the meaning of ''grok'' as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment",&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; Heinlein's concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that "the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term".&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;  The concept of ''grok'' garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication.  The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities as diverse as [[polyamory]] (in particular the [[Church of All Worlds]]) and [[computer science]].

==Descriptions of ''grok'' in ''Stranger in a Strange Land''==
Critic David E. Wright Sr. points out that in the 1991 "uncut" edition of ''Stranger'', the word ''grok'' "was used first ''without any explicit definition'' on page 22" and continued to be used without being explicitly defined until page 253 (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;  He notes that this first [[intensional definition]] is simply "to drink", but that this is only a metaphor "much as English 'I see' often means the same as 'I understand'".&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;  Critics have bridged this absence of explicit definition by citing passages from ''Stranger'' that illustrate the term.  A selection of these passages follows:

{{quote|''Grok'' means "to understand," of course, but Dr. Mahmoud, who might be termed the leading Terran expert on Martians, explains that it also means, "to drink" and "a hundred other English words, words which we think of as antithetical concepts.  'Grok' means ''all'' of these.  It means 'fear,' it means 'love,' it means 'hate'—proper hate, for by the Martian 'map' you cannot hate anything unless you grok it, understand it so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with you—then you can hate it.  By hating yourself.  But this implies that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise.  Then you can ''hate''—and (I think) Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human equivalent could only be called mild distaste.&lt;ref name=McGiveron/&gt;}}

{{quote|'Grok' means 'identically equal.'  The human cliché 'This hurts me worse than it does you' has a distinctly Martian flavor.  The Martian seems to know instinctively what we learned painfully from modern physics, that observer acts with observed through the process of observation.  'Grok' means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.  It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science and it means as little to us as color does to a blind man."&lt;ref name=McGiveron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;}}

{{quote|The Martian Race had encountered the people of the fifth planet, grokked them completely, and had taken action; asteroid ruins were all that remained, save that the Martians continued to praise and cherish the people they had destroyed."&lt;ref name=McGiveron/&gt;}}

{{quote|All that groks is God."&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;}}

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Robert A. Heinlein originally [[neologism|coined]] the term ''grok'' in his 1961 novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as a [[Martian]] word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as "water", "to drink", "life", or "to live", and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality.

According to the book, drinking water is a central focus on Mars, where it is scarce. Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both ''grok'' each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of [[Divinity|divine]] [[immanence]] verbalized between the main characters, "[[Thou Art God]]", is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term ''grok''.

Heinlein describes Martian words as "guttural" and "jarring". Martian speech is described as sounding "like a bullfrog fighting a cat". Accordingly, ''grok'' is generally pronounced as a guttural ''gr'' terminated by a sharp ''k'' with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow [[help:IPA|IPA]] transcription might be {{IPA|[ɡɹ̩kʰ]}}).{{Original research inline|date=January 2018}}
[[William Tenn]] suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenn's very similar concept of ''griggo'', earlier introduced in Tenn's story "[[Venus and the Seven Sexes]]" (published in 1949). In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence "very possible".

==Adoption and modern usage==

===In computer programmer culture===
Uses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in [[Cyberculture|computer culture]], such as a 1984 appearance in ''[[InfoWorld]]'': "There isn't any software! Only different internal states of hardware. It's all hardware! It's a shame programmers don't grok that better."

The [[Jargon File]], which describes itself as a "Hacker's Dictionary" and has been published under that name three times, puts ''grok'' in a programming context:

{{quote|When you claim to "grok" some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to say that you "know" [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] is simply to assert that you can code in it if necessary&amp;nbsp;— but to say you "grok" LISP is to claim that you have deeply entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast [[zen]], which is a similar supernatural understanding experienced as a single brief flash.}}

The entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File, dating from the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the ''Linux Bible, 2005'' characterizes the [[Unix]] [[software development]] philosophy as "one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea".

The book ''[[Perl Best Practices]]'' defines ''grok'' as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to ''re-grok'' code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into one's memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, ''to grok'' means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor [[CPU cache|caches]] memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something that a human (or maybe a Martian) would do.

The main web page for [[cURL]], an open source tool and programming library, describes the function of cURL as "cURL groks URLs".&lt;ref name=curl/&gt;

The book ''[[Cyberia (book)|Cyberia]]'' covers its use in this subculture extensively:

{{quote|This is all latter day usage, the original derivation was from an early text processing utility from so long ago that no one remembers but, grok was the output when it understood the file. [[Brian Kernighan|K]]&amp;[[Dennis Ritchie|R]] would remember.}}

The [[keystroke logging]] software used by the NSA for its remote intelligence gathering operations is named GROK.&lt;ref name=intercept/&gt;

One of the most powerful parsing filters used in [[ElasticSearch]] software's logstash component is named ''grok''.

===In counterculture===
{{see also|Counterculture of the 1960s}}
[[Tom Wolfe]], in his book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (1968), describes a character's thoughts during an [[Psychedelic experience|acid trip]]: "He looks down, two bare legs, a torso rising up at him and like he is just noticing them for the first time ... he has never seen any of this flesh before, this stranger. He groks over that&amp;nbsp; ..."&lt;ref name="wolfe1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Wolfe|title=The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9io09MPj55EC&amp;q=%22He+groks+over+that%22|year=1968|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his counterculture Volkswagen repair manual, ''How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot'' (1969), dropout aerospace engineer [[John Muir (engineer)|John Muir]] instructs prospective used VW buyers to "grok the car" before buying.&lt;ref name="MuirGregg1971"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Muir|author2=Tosh Gregg|title=How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive!: A Manual of Step by Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot : &amp;#91;for Beetle, Bus, Karmann Ghia, Square/Fastback, Safari, and 411-412&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/?id=guPXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=grok|year=1971|publisher=John Muir Publications|isbn=978-0-912528-33-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was used numerous times by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in his works ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy]]''.

The term inspired actress Mayim Bialik's women's lifestyle site, [[Grok Nation]].

:''For the [[Carnegie Endowment]] publication edited by [[Uri Dadush]], see [[International Economics Bulletin]].''

The '''Independent Examinations Board''', or '''IEB''', is a [[South Africa]]n independent assessment agency which offers examinations for various client schools, mostly [[Private school#South Africa|private schools]]. It is most prominent in setting examinations for the school-leaving [[National Senior Certificate]], or NSC (which replaced the Senior Certificate and Further Education and Training Certificate) for its client schools. See [[High school#South Africa|High school: South Africa]]; [[Matriculation in South Africa]].

The IEB exams are considered by many teachers, parents, students and universities, both within [[South Africa]] and abroad, as a more challenging and comprehensive assessment than the State NSC. Students with excellent IEB results have been accepted to [[Ivy League]] and [[Oxbridge]] institutions without taking further requirements such as [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]. ([[SAT]]s (or ACTs) are required for all major U.S. universities - the IEB NSC does not exempt students from this requirement.)

It is also important to note that IEB students who matriculate receive the same certificate as a NSC student would and universities may not bias between a state NSC and IEB matriculant.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Ixtlán del Rio''' is an archaeological site located in the [[Ixtlán del Rio]] municipality, on the south west region of the [[Nayarit]] State, Mexico. It is also known as "Los Toriles" and contains the only vestiges of the western cultures in Nayarit.&lt;ref name="INAH"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Arana Alvarez|first = Raúl M.|date =|title = Zona arqueologica Ixtlán del Río|url = http://www.inah.gob.mx/es/red-de-museos/266-zona-arqueologica-ixtlan-del-rio-o-los-toriles|format = Text based on work by Raúl Martín Arana Álvarez, Eduardo S. Contreras, José Corona Núñez &amp; Rodolfo Castro Hernández.|journal = INAH|language = Spanish|location = Mexico|trans-title=Ixtlán del Río Archaeological site|accessdate = March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Of the traditional Shaft Tombs, five large concentration areas are identified, containing human bone remains; domestic pottery [[ollas]], [[Comal (cookware)|comal]]es and cantaros (pitchers)]; as well as sculpture type remains (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Background==
In remote times in which early American settlers crossed the Behring Strait, several sedentary groups migrated south. The territory of present-day Nayarit State has manifestations of those settlers, chronologically and consecutively located in three cultural periods: Los Concheros, the shaft tomb tradition and the Aztatlán tradition.&lt;ref name=Encinay&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Historia Nayarit |trans-title=Nayarit History |journal=Enciclopedia de los municipios |location=Mexico |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Concheros===
Los concheros ("concha" = shell), is a name given to groups dedicated to the sea exploitation of the ocean shores, and in the process developed the first settlements, with sea shells. According to archaeologist Gabriela Zepeda, the Matanchén and San Blas coves, it was in the Nayarit shores where history commenced in these lands. From about 2000 BCE up to 1500 CE, an amazing occupation persisted by a culture that perceived the sea as merciful and stormy God. It was also the origin of artistic ceramic modeling and cooking.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Shaft Tomb Tradition===
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]] [[File:ShafttombMNAH.jpg|350px|thumb|Reconstruction of an excavated Shaft tomb exhibited at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia]], México.]]

On the traditional shaft tomb tradition, five major areas of concentration were identified, containing bones; ceramics for domestic use (pots, comales and pitchers); and remains of sculptural type (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Shaft Tomb Tradition (500 BCE - 500 CE) constitutes a peculiar feature of mesoamerican prehispanic development in México, although there are analog burials forms elsewhere in the continent. Shaft Tombs thus far discovered in the Nayarit territory, were found and excavated outside of the settlement sites of that epoch, in vertical shafts (Wells), with one or two chambers where their dead were placed together with human and animal sculptures, also with large vessels that contained funerary offerings, these reflect the development achieved by this tradition, with the particular regional characteristics found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The '''[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]]''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to the south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there are disagreements on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM].&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered but until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years, for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but it is linked to central, rather than western Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and [[Teuchitlan tradition|Teuchitlan]], constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although, as noted above, there is disagreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aztatlán Tradition===
The archaeological ruins of "Los Toriles" are related to the Aztatlán tradition. Its buildings contain temples with stairs and worship places made of round stones jointed with clay, stone slabs and in some cases, with motif carved stones including spirals and a snake.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Aztatlán tradition is chronologically located on a period from 700 BCE throughout 1520 CE, it is considered a western mesoamerican cultural event that shares cultural traits with the [[Toltec]] and received cultural influences from central highlands.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This rich tradition is manifested in their varied and beautiful complex ceramic and polished stone, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], and jade, such as: arrowheads; human instruments, gods and animals. Metal work impacted the agricultural activity and environmental exploitation, manufactured utilitarian artifacts as well as ornamental and sumptuary objects.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

Architecture reached its peak when ballgame courts appeared, their construction prompted the organizing of large well designed platforms, patios and squares with pyramids of certain elevations, walkways and paved roads, stairways, worship stone carvings, columns as roof support, roofs, posts, palm and grass, utilization of adobe walls and floors. The burial was common in large pots where skeletons lie in sitting or extended position, accompanied by offerings primarily made of pottery.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The " Aztatlán Tradition " flourished in the south of the State with the cultural development of Ixtlán de Río, on a period from around 750 BCE to 1110 CE, recognized as the Mid-Ixtlán period. Its early phase corresponds to the period that goes from 300 BCE to 600 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

From the "Aztatlán Tradition" the Shaft Tombs are highlighted, and it is noted that the discovery of [[Smoking pipe]]s vestiges in Amapa imply that tobacco was farmed, there are also samples that demonstrate the use of metals, form manufacturing needles and fish hooks, also bricks for construction evidence was found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

In more recent times, within the "Aztatlán tradition", the now called Sentispac town, formerly known as Tzenticpac or Centicpac, was the seat of the lordship of the same name, which extended to Omitlán, Itzcuintla, Cillan and Atecomatlán and was occupied by Totorames native groups, who dominated and receiving tributes from Coras and Zayahuecos settled in the same coastal region.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Toponymy===
The word "'''Ixtlán'''" is of [[Nahuatl]] origin, composed by the words "Itz-ittztell" that means obsidian, and "Tlán", that means place with abundance, that is, "Place where obsidian is abundant".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enciixt   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Ixtlán del Río, Nayarit
|trans-title=|journal=  Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|location=Mexico|url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nayarit/mpios/18006a.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia, Ixtlán, means place dedicated to Ehécatl, Wind God .&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===History===
This important site was very possibly occupied from 300 BCE through 600 CE. During the first stage a cultural complex was developed known as the Shaft Tomb tradition in which offerings were placed inside of funeral chambers. Between 500 and 600 CE the Shaft Tomb tradition is abandoned and its development is registered within an ample cultural region known as Aztatlán, with an apogee towards 750 and 1,100 CE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

With the "Tradición Aztatlán" develops a new way of life and it begins towards 750 – 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as mid-Ixtlán period (750 - 1110) that represents the apogee of the city, dedicated to Ehécatl (Wind God); and late Ixtlán (1110–1525CE) identified by red smooth ceramic for domestic use as well as cajetes and tripod [[molcajetes]]s decorated with white designs over red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The city was founded in the 12th century, by [[Nahuatlaca]] tribes en route towards the Valley of Mexico, forming the Ahuacatlán Lordship, known by its building construction and trading of obsidian goods.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

It is then that the urban settlement grows considerable with the construction of large terraces, palaces, temples and altars, acquiring a certain regional importance as manufacturing and commercial trade center. Although more than 85 mounds and structures have been located in the site, that remain still unexplored, at the moment it is only possible to visit fifteen structures, among them the building called Quetzalcoatl Temple that displays a circular shape with a parapet surrounding it and with peculiar perforations in cross shape.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The temple has two altars on top of the Mexico Central Plateau style. Other important buildings are structures called "Reliefs Palace", "Columns Palace", the "Four Column Palace" complex and the "Square Palace".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Ixtlán is the most studied archaeological zone in Nayarit. Its influence zone extended to the present day municipalities of Ixtlán del Rio, Ahuacatlán, Jala and Santa Maria del Oro. Their main towns were Cacalután, Tepuzhuacán, Mexpan, Zoatlán, Xala, Jomulco, Tequepexpan, Camotlán, Tetitlán, Acuitapilco and Zapotán.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Petroglyphs===
In Santiago Ixcuintla, [[INAH]] has registered the existence of petroglyphs from the "Los Concheros" epoch, in the Las Parejas, Emérita, Yago, El Caballo and Acatán de las Piñas sites, with a total of 13 engravings, including the "Piedra Galana".&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[Petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

===Ceramic===
This stage of prehispanic development distinguishes and identifies western Mexico from other mesoamerican cultural expressions, during the late formative period and early classical. The Nayarit shaft tomb complexes are identified within the early Ixtlán period (300 BCE to 300 CE), and three distinctive clay modeling styles have been defined: Chimisco, Ixtlán and San Sebastian.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The pottery of this tradition shows abundance of colors, predominating red, orange, yellow beige and the "negative" form. Common themes are human beings as warriors, musicians, women, sick people and couples.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

==The Site==
The '''Ixtlán del Río''' site is known as "Los Toriles", it was a constantly growing city and its inhabitants place huge importance to its buildings. They had urbanism knowledge, applied to an organized arrangement, with stairs, restricted accesses, open spaces, altars, sidewalks, drains, causeways, neighborhoods and palaces throughout the extensive city that flourished from 700 to 1200 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It had its heyday as a city during the "Aztatlán Tradition" period, in an area extended over eighty hectares. In the late phase, that corresponds to the period from 1110 to 1525 CE, had artistic red smooth ceramic expressions for home use, vessels and [[molcajete]]s tripods with white decor on red. This same period developed the metallurgy used to produce ornamental, ritual objects and obsidian bifacial instruments. On slopes they built extensive terraces, palaces, worship spaces, people’s homes, farmland areas and obsidian carving workshops.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It is clear that it is still unknown what was their original culture, it is only known that they were predecessors of the [[Cora people|Coras]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]] or Wixáritari peoples, they believed in life after death.&lt;ref name=Pedro   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   Pedro |date=Oct 24, 2006  |title= Los Toriles, Noticias de Historia Antigua y Arqueología|trans-title=Los Toriles, ancient history and archaeology news |journal= El Informador |location=  |url= http://historiayarqueologia.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/abriran-exposicion-sobre-culturas-prehispanicas-en-nayarit/ |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Accordingly, what their name was is not known, these were communities a little older than 2,200 years, and are known as belonging to the Shaft Tomb Tradition, constructed in vertical wells, round or square, representing the maternal uterus.&lt;ref name=Pedro   /&gt;

Anthropologist Marina Anguiano concludes that at the Spaniards arrival to these lands, ethnic-linguistic groups existed of the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahuatl family, which had a socio-political structure divided into lordships, ruled by groups, possibly of noble rank, and a number of local lords.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This archaeological site is considered related to the Aztatlán tradition, of which Corinca&lt;ref&gt;Corinca (1502-1530) was the last Lord of Aztatlán. He took office in 1513. During his Government, the tahue and achier peoples became tributaries of Aztatlán. In 1517, Aztatlán became part of the Chimalhuacana Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; was the last governor. Its constructions contain temples with stairways and altars made from round stones jointed with clay, slab stones and, in some cases, with carved stones with spirals and a serpent.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site was founded, in the 12th century, by Nahuatlacas tribes while on their way to the Valley of Mexico, and formed part of the Ahuacatlán kingdom, known by its constructions and obsidian objects which they traded.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site has an unusual pyramid for Mesoamerica; it is a round construction 24 meters diameter by four meters high. It has five stairways harmonically distributed around its perimeter. A wall that ends on top has small cruciform windows. Probably this was a ceremonial center dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], central image of the [[Toltec]] culture. The shaft tombs are the most representative funeral constructions of the area, although there are other modalities such as "shaft tombs" or earth graves where dead people were barely buried near the surface. Ceramics are constituted by spherical glasses with vertical walls tall neck and triple bell support. The most frequent ornamental motifs are flowers and streamlined butterflies, deer and tiger heads. There are many ceramic vessels decorated with white over red color rhombuses and segments.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Due to its special characteristics, ceramics and sculptures from this region are known as "Ixtlán style".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The small 30 to 40 centimeters high sculptures distinguish themselves by ornaments consisting of earrings and nose perforations, where they placed one or more hoops.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

From the rich Ixtlán ceramics, scale models with excellent finishing are featured, from them we can intuit their forms of life, the social organization and the economic life characteristic of these towns. There are scale models that represent houses, groups in some activity and ballgame courts. These are always constructions with life and movement. Also, worth mentioning, are sculptures representing soldiers, identifiable from a spiked helmet; the chest is armor protected and in their hands a cane resembling a mallet. The lower part generally is naked.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

[[File:Ixtlán.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ixtlán del Río another view of the Round Structure]]

==Structures==
Ixtlán del Río archaeological site has a plaza, with an altar with four small stairways and to the sides buildings that appear to be small rectangular rooms.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Busca &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=Zona Arqueologica los Toriles |url=  http://www.buscanay.com/Ixtlan%20del%20Rio/Atractivos%20Turisticos/Los%20toriles.html |publisher=Buscanay |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title=Los Toriles Archaeological Site  |year= |accessdate= September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These temples/rooms are built on platforms with adobe pilasters, as well as sidewalks and stairways.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of these temples has a road paved with stone slabs, which leads to the round monument, discovered in 1948 by Prof. José Corona Núñez and eloquently describes his discovery, stating: "the round monument has 30 meters in diameter by 4 meters high;" sloped walls crowned by a perforated parapet with crosses, as if skylights, four access stairs, limited by alfardas die finished, some of them still have cross shaped handrails.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Above, within the round patio, limiting the parapets are pyramid bases, one to the north and another at the south, with stairs geared toward the center. The North has a smooth vertical panel and the south has a beveled cornice. According to the remains found, these bases maintained small altars with column portals, ceilings and stone altered battlements: one shaped as arrowheads, others composed of a disk with two circles engraved, this monument is called "Quetzalcoatl Temple" and is believed to belong to the Toltec horizon by the Toltec cultural traits observed in its architecture.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

In earlier times, between 300 BCE and 600 CE., flourished a cultural complex known as shaft tombs tradition characterized by underground architecture and offerings deposited inside the funeral chambers. Its origins are ancient and have been found in the neighboring States of Colima, Zacatecas, Jalisco and Michoacán.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Around 500 to 600 CE.,the shaft  tomb traditoion disappears and a new way of perceiving life starts from 750 to 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as the Aztatlán tradition and is known in the mid-Ixtlán period (750 to 1110) which represents the apogee of this city dedicated to the God of the wind; and late Ixtlán (1110 to 1525) identified by red smooth ceramics household items and cajetes and tripod molcajetes with white decor on Red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of the temples has a stone slab paved road, which leads to the round building of section A.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section A===
Corresponds to the initial explorations of the site, composed of four structures; two of which are restored with rectangular shape with columns to the front, that limit spaces between the rooms, these two structures are part of the plaza with pyramidal foundation with central altar and other unexplored structures (mounds to the north and east of the plaza). The highlight of this complex is the circular pyramid, discovered in 1948 by [[Jose Corona Nuñez|Prof. Jose Corona Nuñez]], it is the most important structure of the archaeological site that, from its design and finishing, constitutes one of the most beautiful works of the prehispanic architecture in western Mexico. "The monument is of round base 24 meters in diameter and 4 meters high, originally was a cylinder with vertical walls (compact drum) crowned with a perforated parapet with small cruciform windows that give the construction the aspect of a large brazier, with five stairs harmonically distributed in its contour"; in the superior part there are two rectangular altars, and it is known as a Quetzalcoatl or Ehécatl temple,&lt;ref&gt;Quetzalcoatl temples probably dedicated to Ehécatl, are mesoamerican round buildings, generally related to Ehécatl. The circle is a perfect geometric figure, has no beginning or end, therefore infinite, as the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; due to its architectonic characteristics and elements.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section B===
It is composed by two plazas bordered by structures that correspond to buildings foundations and small pyramidal shape altars. Both plazas have nine monuments each, rectangular form, explored and restored; in center is a small foundation, similar to the ceremonial altar; dimensions and height varies and is in relation to the site topography and the plaza needs. The buildings stairways face the plaza, which has three closed spaces with one in front open and roof supporting pillars. Also there are remains of dirt floors, evidence of prehispanic occupation; constructive systems base in retaining walls with relief carved stone walls, with symbols religious and animal motifs.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section C===
It is the entrance to the archaeological zone; the south part has three explored and recovered structures that form part of a larger complex of plaza and buildings with a central altar. From the explored constructions one is outstanding, with two rectangular bodies and a single story whose stairways face towards the plaza. Also there are large columns that were used for support the roof of two large halls; the one to the east has a room and stairway integrated to the wall behind the structure.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Central Altar and Plaza C===
Is a two bodied pyramidal shape structure with stairways in all four sides; an "alfarda", ended on a dice shaped element in the top. Two bodied Pyramidal foundation. Is located in the center of Plaza C; its stairway faces west and is limited by two unexplored mounds, that are part of the plaza. The structure, just as other monuments, has stone retaining walls that were stucco covered.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Shaft Tombs==
During prehispanic times, western cultures buried to their dead in shaft tombs, these are vertical wells 1.5 to 16 meters deep, where diverse sculptures were placed as offering for the deceased; these were of various types of polychrome ceramic figures; animal forms, anthropomorphous and small and medium size scale models, which measured from five to 80 centimeters.&lt;ref name=Elda   &gt;{{cite web |first=Elda   |last= Lastra |title=Esculturas de las tumbas de tiro en Ixtlán del Río |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:esculturas-de-las-tumbas-de-tiro-en-ixtlan-del-rio-&amp;catid=45:especiales&amp;Itemid=118 |publisher=INAH |location=Mexico |language= Spanish|trans-title=Shaft Tombs Sculptures of Ixtlán del Río |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic figures date back to the late Preclassical period (400 BCE to 200 CE) and to the Classical period (200 to 650 CE), these were discovered by archaeologists since 1945 until recent years in areas included in the Nayarit, Colima and Jalisco States, where this funeral activity was practiced.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

In the case of the Ixtlán del Rio Archaeological Zone, the figures represent funeral processions, villages, people lying down or in beds, the flier and ballgame rituals, were modeled in reddish clay and decoration painted with black, red, orange, yellow and beige colors.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

According to art historian Lizeth Barreto Saucedo, these sculptures were modeled with reddish clay, dried and cooked in open fire.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The funeral processions scale models are square or round, the carved figures depict many people; musicians, moving towards a house, while carrying the dead person for burial; they carry food plates and practice the cheek perforation ritual practice.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The pieces representing the flier ritual, represents an individual dressed as a bird, on top of a pole on a flying simulation pose, can be leaning face down on the post or standing up looking upwards, houses are seen below and many people watching the ritual, some dance or play.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Similarly, there are ball game sculptures, similar to the Mesoamerican "I" shaped structure, the difference here is that there are houses in the ends of the representation, and some spectators.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The dancers and musicians figures not only appear in the processions scale models, there are also exclusive pieces of people groups in circular dances or playing instruments, such as drums, snails and flutes.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The largest sculptures (20 to 80 centimeters) are anthropomorphous figures decorated with facial painting and different types from clothes, some are standing up and other are seated. Women carry vessels or children, and men carry balls or instruments, some are soldiers with shields. Figures of both genders carry jewels, earflaps and cut shell collars. The facial painting is naturalist and streamlined.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Also sculptures with human figures representations are known with cheek perforations, in which three to four people are displayed (men and women) interconnected by an instrument that crosses their cheeks.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The individuals lying down or in beds are similar to those from Veracruz, emphasizing that are figures tied to a bed, which would seem to indicate that are women dead from childbirth or convalescent.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Five types of scale models have been classified, representing houses, measuring approximately 18 centimeters high by 20 wide and are distinguished by its shed roof with the corners raised in triangles form.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The type 1 house lacks walls, only shows the roof and people inside. House type 2 has an ample room with walls. Type 3, the building half walls are leaned. Type 4, has two levels, with a room on each level and stairs. And type 5 is similar to Type 4, except that the house is full of people.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;
 
Among the scale models, there are also villages with a circular construction in the center, very similar to the pyramid of the [[Guachimontones]] Archaeological site in Jalisco, surrounded by houses as previously mentioned.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Shaft tombs are vertical wells, whose surface can be circular or square, and have a depth of between 1.5 and 16 meters, and a width of between 0.80 and one meter; there are two types: familiar burials underneath the rooms, or cemeteries.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The '''John Rylands Library''' is a [[Victorian era|late-Victorian]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] building on [[Deansgate]] in [[Manchester]], England. The library, which opened to the public in 1900, was founded by [[Enriqueta Augustina Rylands]] in memory of her husband, [[John Rylands]].&lt;ref name="special_collection_information"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/spcoll/visitor/ | title=JRUL Special Collections: Visitor Information | accessdate=29 April 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718094851/http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/spcoll/visitor/ | archivedate=18 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The John Rylands Library and the library of the University of Manchester merged in July 1972 into the [[University of Manchester Library|John Rylands University Library of Manchester]]; today it is part of The [[University of Manchester Library]].

Special collections built up by both libraries were progressively concentrated in the Deansgate building. The special collections, believed to be among the largest in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What are Special Collections? |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/academicsupport/usingspecialcollections/whatare-specialcollections/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; include [[medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s and examples of early European printing, including a [[Gutenberg Bible]], the second largest collection of printing by [[William Caxton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/incunabulacollection/ |title=Incunabula Collection | accessdate=25 February 2012|publisher=The University of Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most extensive collection of the editions of the [[Aldus Manutius|Aldine Press]] of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/aldinecollection/ |title=Aldine Press| accessdate=25 February 2012|publisher=The University of Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]] has a claim to be the earliest extant [[New Testament]] text. The library holds personal papers and letters of notable figures, among them [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] and [[John Dalton]].

The architectural style is primarily neo-Gothic with elements of [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the ornate and imposing gatehouse facing Deansgate which dominates the surrounding streetscape. The library, granted [[Grade I listed buildings in Greater Manchester#Manchester|Grade I listed status]] in 1994, is maintained by the [[University of Manchester]] and open for library readers and visitors.

==History==
Enriqueta Rylands purchased a site on Deansgate for her memorial library in 1889 and commissioned a design from architect [[Basil Champneys]].&lt;ref name="special_collection_information" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnie, D. A. (1989) "Enriqueta Augustina Rylands" in: ''[[Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester]]'', LXXI, 2 (summer 1989); pp.&amp;nbsp;3–38&lt;/ref&gt; Rylands commissioned the Manchester academic [[Alice Margaret Cooke|Alice Cooke]] to index the vast library of the [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|2nd Earl Spencer]] which she had purchased and another collection of autographs.&lt;ref name=perrone&gt;Fernanda Helen Perrone, ‘Cooke, Alice Margaret (1867–1940)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/62414, accessed 26 Dec 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs Rylands intended the library to be principally [[theology|theological]], and the building, which is a fine example of Victorian Gothic, has the appearance of a [[church (building)|church]], although the concept was of an Oxford college library on a larger scale.&lt;ref name="Farnie 1989"&gt;Farnie (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Champneys presented plans to Mrs Rylands within a week of gaining the commission. Thereafter frequent disagreements arose and Mrs Rylands selected decorative elements, window glass and statues against his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Basil Champneys (1842–1935) |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/thepeople/basilchampneys/ |publisher=University of Manchester (The) |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Champneys was given the honour of speaking about the library at a general meeting of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and was awarded a [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 187"/&gt; The library was granted [[listed building]] status on 25 January 1952, which was upgraded to Grade I on 6 June 1994.&lt;ref name = "NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1217800|desc= John Rylands Library and Attached Railings, Gates and Lamp Standards|access-date= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the library's collection was formed around 40,000 books, including many rarities, assembled by [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer]], which Mrs Rylands purchased from Lord Spencer in 1892.&lt;ref name="special_collection"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data2/spcoll/ | title = JRUL: Special Collections Guide | accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had begun acquiring  books in 1889 and continued to do so throughout her lifetime.&lt;ref name="Farnie 1989"&gt;Farnie (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; After its inauguration on 6 October 1899 (the wedding anniversary of John Rylands and Enriqueta Tennant)&lt;ref name="Farnie 1989"&gt;Farnie (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; the library opened to readers and visitors on 1 January 1900.&lt;ref name="special_collection_information" /&gt;

The John Rylands Library and the library of the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] merged in July 1972 and was named the John Rylands University Library of Manchester. Special collections built up by both libraries were progressively concentrated in the Deansgate building.

The building has been extended four times, the first time to designs by Champneys in 1920 after the project was delayed by [[World War I]]. The [[Isaac Wolfson|Lady Wolfson Building]] opened in 1962 on the west side and a third extension, south of the first was built in 1969.
In January 2003, an appeal to renovate the building was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Appeal to restore historic library |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2678977.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 January 2003 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were generated from grants from the University of Manchester and [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and donations from members of the public and companies in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Library closes for refit |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3106460.stm |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2003 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, Unlocking the Rylands, demolished the third extension, refurbished parts of the old building and erected a pitched roof over its reinforced concrete roof. Champneys designed a pitched roof but Mrs Rylands was advised that an internal stone vault would reduce the fire risk and it was not built.&lt;ref name="special_collection" /&gt; The £17 million project was completed by summer 2007 and the library reopened on 20 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City's historic library reopens |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7004206.stm |work=BBC News |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the nineteenth century Manchester was a prosperous industrial town and the demands of [[Cotton mill|cotton manufacturing]] stimulated the growth of engineering and chemical industries.  The town became 'abominably filthy' and was 'often covered, especially during the winter, with dense fogs&amp;nbsp;... there is at all times a copious descent of soots and other impurities'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, and the overcrowded site, created many design problems for the architect.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 177"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the century most textile manufacture moved to newer mills in the surrounding towns while Manchester remained the centre of trading in cotton goods both for the home and foreign markets but pollution from burning coal and gas remained a considerable nuisance.

The site chosen by Mrs Rylands was in a central and fashionable part of the city, but was awkward in shape and orientation and surrounded by tall warehouses, derelict cottages and narrow streets.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 177"/&gt; The position was criticised for its lack of surrounding space and the fact that the valuable manuscript collections were to be housed in "that dirty, uncomfortable city&amp;nbsp;... [with] not enough light to read by, and the books they already have are wretchedly kept" (written in 1901 about the [[Crawford MSS]].)&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 177"/&gt;  Mrs Rylands negotiated Deeds of Agreement with her neighbours to fix the heights of future adjacent buildings. The permissible height of the building was fixed at just over 34 feet, but it was suggested that it could be taller at the centre if there was an open area around the edges, at the height of buildings that had been demolished to make way for the construction.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 177"/&gt; Champneys incorporated this suggestion into his design, setting the two towers of the facade twelve feet back from the boundary and keeping the entrance block low, to allow light into the library.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 177"/&gt; He designed the building in a series of tiered steps with an almost flat roof to give a 'liberal concession' to the neighbours' 'right to light'.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The library was built on a rectangular plan and subsequent extensions are to the rear. It was designed to resemble a church in a decorated neo-Gothic style with Arts and Crafts details.&lt;ref name = "NHLE"/&gt; It is constructed of Cumbrian [[sandstone]], the interior a delicately shaded 'Shawk' stone (from [[Dalston, Cumbria|Dalston]], varying in colour between sand and a range of pinks) and the exterior, dark red Barbary stone from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk:8180/luna/servlet/detail/Manchester~91~1~95745~105447:Historic-Reading-Room|title=Historic Reading Room|work=John Rylands University Library Image Collections|publisher=John Rylands University Library|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/CUL/Dalston/Gaz1868.html|title=Dalston, Cumberland|work=The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland, 1868|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; built around an internal steel framed structure and brick arched flooring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red 'Barbary plain' sandstone, which Champneys believed 'had every chance of proving durable' for the exterior, was an unusual choice in late Victorian Manchester. It proved relatively successful, as an inspection by Champneys in 1900 revealed little softening by the 'effects of an atmosphere somewhat charged with chemicals' although, by 1909 some repairs were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library has a [[crypt]] above which the building has two unequal storeys giving the impression of three. The ornate Deansgate facade has an [[embattled]] [[parapet]] with open-work arcading under which is a central three-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] entrance resembling a monastery gatehouse. Its two-centred arched portal has doorways separated by a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]] and tall windows on either side. Above the doors are a pair of small [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[oriel window]]s. Surfaces are decorated with lacy blind tracery and finely-detailed carving.&lt;ref name = "NHLE"/&gt; The carving includes the "J. R." monogram, the arms of Rylands, the arms of Rylands' native town, St Helens, and those of five English, two Scottish and two Irish universities and those of [[Owens College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guppy|first=Henry|title=The John Rylands Library, Manchester: 1899–1924: a record of its history |publisher=University Press|location=Manchester|year=1924|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On either side of the entrance portal are square two-storey two-bay wings with plain walls with a [[string course]] containing [[Grotesque#In architecture|grotesques]] and large octagonal [[Cupola|lanterns]]. Behind the entrance portal flanked by square towers is the three-light east window of the reading hall. It has reticulated tracery and shafts in a similar style to the parapet. In front of the library are Art Nouveau [[bronze]] railings with central double gates and lamp standards.&lt;ref name = "NHLE"/&gt;

===Interior===
The main reading room on the first floor, 30 feet above the ground and 12 feet from all four boundaries, was noted for the pleasant contrast between the 'sullen roar' of Manchester and the 'internal cloister quietude of Rylands'.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 178"/&gt; It was lit by oriel windows in the reading alcoves supplemented by high [[clerestory]] windows along both sides.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 178"/&gt; Embellishments in the reading room include two large stained glass windows with portraits of religious and secular figures, designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe|C. E. Kempe]]; a series of statues in the reading room by [[Robert Bridgeman and Sons|Bridgeman's]] of Lichfield;&lt;ref&gt;"A series of portrait statues, designed by Mr. Robert Bridgeman, of Lichfield"--Guppy, H. (1924) ''The John Rylands Library, Manchester: 1899-1924''. Manchester: University Press; p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; and bronzework in the art nouveau style by Singer of Frome. The portraits in sculpture (20) and stained glass (40) represent a selection of personages from the intellectual and artistic history of mankind. The western window contains "Theology" from Moses to Schleiermacher; the eastern "Literature and Art" (including philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guppy|first=Henry|title=The John Rylands Library, Manchester: 1899–1924: a record of its history |publisher=University Press|location=Manchester|year=1924|pages=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait statues of John and Enriqueta Rylands in [[white marble]], in the reading room, were sculpted by [[John Cassidy (artist)|John Cassidy]] who also executed the allegorical group of 'Theology, Science and Art' in the vestibule.&lt;ref name="special_collection_information"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Rylands and the allegorical group were completed for the inauguration, 6 October 1899; Enriqueta's statue was completed in December 1907 and portrays her at the age of her marriage in 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the main library and reading room with gallery above, the design incorporated Bible and map rooms on the first floor, and conference (lecture) and committee rooms on the ground floor, part of which was intended to be a lending library but never operated as such. A caretaker's house was incorporated in the building until it was demolished for the extension of 1969.&lt;ref name="jrl_plan"/&gt;

Electric lighting was chosen as the cleanest and safest alternative to gas but, as the use of electricity was in its early stages, the supply (110 volts DC) was generated on-site. This took some years to achieve due to the inexperience of contractors,&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 187"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the library became one of the first public buildings in Manchester to be lit by electricity&lt;ref name="special_collection_information" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An electrical power supply was available in Manchester city centre from 1893, from the Dickinson Street generating station.--McKechnie, H. M., ed. (1915) ''Manchester in Nineteen Hundred and Fifteen''. Manchester: University Press; p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  and continued to generate its own supply until 1950.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 185"/&gt;

Champneys suggested that, in order to protect the books and manuscripts, 'it will be very desirable to keep the air in the interior of the building as clear and free from smoke and chemical matter (both of which are held in the air of Manchester) as may be possible'.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 185"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground floor was built with numerous air inlets and, although his client felt it would prove impossible to exclude foul air, Champneys installed jute or hessian screens to trap the soot, with water sprays to catch the sulphur and other chemicals,&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 185"/&gt; which was a very advanced system for the period.&lt;ref name="special_collection_information" /&gt; Internal screen doors were employed in the entrance hall to prevent the air being 'fouled by the opening of the outer doors' with internal swing doors between the circulation areas and the main library to 'preserve the valuable books from injury'.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 185"/&gt; By 1900 the ventilation system had evolved to include electric fans to draw in air at pavement level through [[Petroleum coke|coke]] screens sprayed with water.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2000 185"/&gt;

On opening in 1900, the library had 70,000 books and fewer than 100 manuscripts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Our history - The Library opens |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2012, more than 250,000 printed volumes and over one million manuscripts and archival items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=John Rylands Library - Our history |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main foundation of the library's collections acquired in 1892 was the ''Althorp Library'' of [[John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] regarded as one of the finest library collections in private ownership with 43,000 items - 3,000 of which originate from before 1501 (i.e. incunabula).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Spencer collection |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/spencercollection/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=How did these books come to Manchester? |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/firstimpressions/The-Collection/How-did-these-books-come-to-Manchester/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs Rylands paid £210,000 for Spencer's collection which included the [[Aldine Press#Collections|Aldine Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Aldine Collection |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/aldinecollection/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Incunable|incunabula]] collection of 3,000 items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Incunabula collection |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/incunabulacollection/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens College Library received [[Richard Copley Christie]]'s library of over 8,000 volumes including many rare books from the [[Renaissance]] period in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Christie collection |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/christiecollection/ |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Victoria University of Manchester library from 1904 and was transferred to the John Rylands Library building after the merger in 1972. In 1901, Mrs Rylands paid £155,000 for more than 6,000 manuscripts owned by [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford]] of [[Haigh Hall]]. The [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford#The Bibliotheca Lindesiana|''Bibliotheca Lindesiana'']] was one of the most impressive private collections in Britain at the time, both for its size and rarity of some of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;Guppy, Henry (1946) "The ''Bibliotheca Lindesiana''", in: ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library''; vol. 30, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Nicolas (1978) ''Bibliotheca Lindesiana: the lives and collections of Alexander William, 25th Earl of Crawford and 8th Earl of Balcarres and James Ludovic, 26th Earl of Crawford and 9th Earl of Balcarres''. London: Quaritch for the Roxburghe Club; pp.&amp;nbsp;350–54, 361-62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Llewellyn Bullock]] bequeathed 5,000 items (notably early Italian imprints) during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bullock collection |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/bullockcollection/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504171342/http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/bullockcollection/ |archivedate=4 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library's collections include exquisite medieval illuminated manuscripts, examples of early European printing including a fine paper copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] and books printed by [[William Caxton]], and personal papers of distinguished historical figures including Elizabeth Gaskell, John Dalton and [[John Wesley]].&lt;ref name="special_collection" /&gt; Nothing is known of the early history of this copy of the Gutenberg Bible before it was acquired by the 2nd Earl Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;There are 48 complete or nearly complete extant copies of the Gutenberg Bible of which a few are on vellum. [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/copieselse.html Gutenberg in the British Library at bl.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The copy has some illuminated initial letters and the leaves are uncut (without trimming of the margins); MS. notes to guide the illuminator are near the top edges of the pages. The two folio volumes were rebound in blue morocco for Lord Spencer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The library houses [[papyrus]] fragments known as the [[Rylands Papyri]] and documents from [[North Africa]]. The most notable are the ''St John Fragment'', believed to be the oldest extant [[New Testament]] text, [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], the earliest fragment of the text of the canonical Gospel of John;&lt;ref name="papyrus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/text/fragment.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070421182600/http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/text/fragment.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 April 2007 |title=An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel |publisher=JRUL |accessdate=29 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest fragment of the [[Septuagint]], [[Papyrus Rylands 458]]; and [[Papyrus Rylands 463]], a manuscript fragment of the apocryphal Gospel of Mary. [[Minuscule 702]], ε2010 ([[Biblical manuscript#Von Soden|von Soden]]),&lt;ref name = Soden&gt;[[Hermann von Soden]], ''Die Schriften des neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt / hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' (Berlin, 1902), vol. 1, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[List of New Testament minuscules|minuscule]] [[manuscript]] of the [[New Testament]], on parchment. Among the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|papyri from Oxyrhynchus]] are a homily about women (Inv R. 55247), part of the [[Book of Tobit]] (Apocrypha) (448), and [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 73]], relating to the transfer of a slave. The Arabic papyri were catalogued by [[David Samuel Margoliouth]]; his catalogue was published in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth, D. S. (1933) ''Catalogue of Arabic Papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester''. Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the collections of Spencer, Crawford, Christie and [[Walter Bullock|Bullock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bullock Collection, The University of Manchester, The John Rylands University Library|url= http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/bullockcollection/|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120504171342/http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/bullockcollection/|archivedate= 4 May 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bullock Collection, The John Rylands Library|url= http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/thecollections/|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720193342/http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/thecollections/|archivedate= 20 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; holdings have been enriched by gifts, permanent loans or purchases of several libraries belonging to institutions and individuals. These include the French Revolution Broadsides donated by the 27th Earl of Crawford in 1924&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Bibliotheca Lindesiana'", in: ''The Bulletin of the John Rylands Library''; vol. 30, no. 1, 1946p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/atoz/frenchrevolutioncollection/ |title=French Revolution Collection|publisher=University of Manchester (The)|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the archives of the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/searchresources/guidetospecialcollections/methodist/ |title=Methodist Collections |publisher=University of Manchester (The)|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1946 and 1988 a number of sections of the Earl of Crawford's library were deposited here,&lt;ref&gt;Guppy, Henry (1946) "The 'Bibliotheca Lindesiana'", in: ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library''; vol. 30, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–94&lt;/ref&gt; however all but one of these were withdrawn in 1988.

Mrs Rylands died in 1908 having bequeathed her private collections and an endowment of £200,000 to enable the library to expand. The funds were used to acquire 180,000 books, 3,000 manuscripts and extend the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Our History - Enriqueta Rylands |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Librarian, [[Henry Guppy (librarian)|Henry Guppy]], invited individuals to deposit their archives for safe keeping in 1921 when there were no [[county record office]]s in Lancashire or Cheshire and the library became one of the first to collect historical family records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Our History - Family archives deposited |url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/ourhistory/ |work=University of Manchester |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
Librarians at John Rylands before its merger include [[Edward Gordon Duff]] in 1899 and 1900 and Henry Guppy between 1899 and 1948 (joint Librarian with Duff until 1900). Duff was responsible for the original library catalogue, compiled between 1893 and 1899: ''Catalogue of the Printed Books and Manuscripts in the John Rylands Library, Manchester''; ed. E. G. Duff. Manchester: J. E. Cornish, 1899. 3 vols.&lt;ref name="Farnie 1989"/&gt; The cataloguing of the books was done by [[Alice Margaret Cooke]], a graduate of the Victoria University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/firstimpressions/Pioneers-of-Print/Enriqueta-Rylands/ Enriqueta Rylands], First Impressions, University of Manchester, Retrieved 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Guppy began publication of the ''[[Bulletin of the John Rylands Library]]'' in 1903; it later became a journal publishing academic articles and from autumn 1972 the title was changed to the ''[[Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester]]'' (further slight changes have occurred since).&lt;ref&gt;Publication was suspended for a few years (1909–13) but it has been published continuously since 1914, either two or three issues a year&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War 11 members of staff joined the armed forces; of these only Capt. O. J. Sutton, MC, lost his life while serving.&lt;ref&gt;Guppy, Henry (1924) ''The John Rylands University Library, Manchester: 1899-1824''. Manchester: University Press; p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy members of staff were [[James Rendel Harris]], [[Alphonse Mingana]], the Semitic scholar Professor [[Edward Robertson (Semitic scholar)|Edward Robertson]] (d. 1964) who was the third librarian,&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', Vol. 45 (1962/63), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2, 273-75; 47 (1964/65), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who was Who; 1961–1970'', p. 966&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moses Tyson]], keeper of western manuscripts, afterwards librarian of Manchester University Library.  Stella Butler, a medical historian, was Head of Special Collections from 2000 until 2009, and she moved to the [[University of Leeds]] in 2011 as University Librarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/200192/library_staff/1038/dr_stella_butler |title=Dr Stella Butler |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/1383/university_librarian_appointment-dr_stella_butler |publisher=University of Leeds |title=University Librarian appointment - Dr Stella Butler |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Rachel Beckett has been Head of Special Collections and she was appointed as the Associate Director of The John Rylands Library in 2013. Jan Wilkinson has been the Director of The John Rylands Library, as well as University Librarian, since 2008.

==John Rylands Research Institute==
Acting Librarian David Miller founded the John Rylands Research Institute in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the University of Manchester, 1973-90|last = Pullan|first = Brian|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 9780719062421|pages = 261|last2 = Abendstern|first2 = Michele}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mrdwmiller.wordpress.com/|title=The John Rylands Research Institute : The True Tale Told|website=The John Rylands Research Institute : The True Tale Told|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote, fund and stimulate research on the primary material held at Deansgate.

The John Rylands Research Institute was relaunched in 2014 as a collaboration between the University of Manchester's Faculty of Humanities and the John Rylands Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/university-launches-the-john-rylands-research-institute/] "University launches the John Rylands Research Institute" Retrieved 13 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute is to open up the Library's Special Collections to innovative and multidisciplinary research, in partnership with researchers in Manchester and across the globe. In September 2016, Hannah Barker, Professor of British History, took up the role as Director of the John Rylands Research Institute &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrri.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/institute-staff/]"The John Rylands Research Institute"&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded Prof. Peter Pormann who had been appointed Director of the John Rylands Research Institute in 2013.

==Governors and Trustees==
Mrs Rylands established a board of trustees to hold the library's assets and a council of governors to maintain the building and control expenditure. The council consisted of some representative and some co-optative governors while honorary governors were not members of the council.&lt;ref&gt;John Rylands Library (1969) ''Catalogue of an Exhibition of Manuscripts and Early Printing Originating in Germany&amp;nbsp;... November 1969''. Manchester: John Rylands Library; list inside cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnie, D. A. (1989). "Enriqueta Augustina Rylands, 1843–1908, Founder of the John Rylands Library". ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester''; 71 (2): 3–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Both these bodies were dissolved at the merger in 1972. Members of the council of governors included Professor [[Arthur Peake]] and Professor [[F. F. Bruce]] both biblical critics and [[Rylands Professor of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis|Rylands Professors of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis]].

==Visitors==
Many notable people including heads of state have visited the library. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and the Duchess of Cornwall have also visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/royaltyattherylands/ |title=Royalty at the Rylands |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordanian art''' has a very ancient history. Some of the earliest figurines, found at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, have been dated to the Neolithic period. A distinct Jordanian aesthetic in art and architecture emerged as part of a broader [[Islamic art]] tradition which flourished from the 7th-century. Traditional art and craft is vested in material culture including mosaics, ceramics, weaving, silver work, music, glass-blowing and calligraphy. The rise of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East, led to a dilution of traditional aesthetics. In the early 20th-century, following the creation of the independent nation of Jordan, a contemporary Jordanian art movement emerged and began to search for a distinctly Jordanian art aesthetic that combined both tradition and contemporary art forms. 

==Traditional art==
{{main article|Islamic art}}
Jordan, as an independent nation was founded in 1924. Prior to that, the area that is now Jordan had been subject to a number of different rules. It was part of the [[Nabatean Kingdom]], under Hellenistic rule following Alexander the Great's conquest of the area; under Roman rule in the 1st century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Beienkowski, P., ''The Art of Jordan,'' Stroud, Allan Sutton, 1991, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; and was once part of the [[Umayyad]] Kingdom in the 7th century (CE) and part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 15th-century until the end of World War I&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp 362-363; Taylor, J. ''Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans,'' I.B. Tauris, 2001, p. 11 and p. 47 &lt;/ref&gt; when it became a British protectorate until the time of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East, ''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Its art is part a broader Islamic artistic tradition, with evidence of classical influences.&lt;ref&gt;''Mideast File,'' Vol. 4, Learned Information, 1985, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional art was often based on material culture including hand-crafts such as rug-making, basket weaving, silver smithing, mosaics, ceramics, and glass-blowing. The Bedouins were largely self-sufficient in the production of goods, and made their own rugs, wove baskets and prepared ceramics. Such works exhibited wide variation in styles, as tribes often used their own tribal motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Bienkowski, P. and van der Steen, E., "Tribes, Trade, and Towns: A New Framework for the Late Iron Age in Southern Jordan and the Negev," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,'' No. 323 (Aug., 2001), pp. 21-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian art historian, [[Wijdan Ali]] has argued that the traditional Islamic aesthetic evident in craft-based work was displaced by the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Contemporary Art from the Islamic World,'' London, Scorpion Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the decolonised period of the 20th-century, a contemporary art form combining tradition and modern influences can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G.

===Pre-Islamic art===

As early as the Neolithic period in Jordan, figurines and sculptures were being made. In some of the earliest examples, human skulls were built up with plaster, and inlays were used for the eye sockets.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, L.S., ''The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction,'' Routledge, 2018, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Two caches of figurines discovered at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, include animal models and some three dozen monumental figurines (pictured below), which scholars believe were important to the ritual and social structure of the peoples living there,&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S., ''After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000 - 5000 BC,'' UK, Hachette UK, 2011, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have formed part of a burial ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The [['Ain Ghazal Statues|'Ain Ghazal statues]] are very large, with some around three feet in height. Aïn Ghazal was occupied between 7,000 BCE and 5,000 BCE and the statues have been dated to around 6,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Showing extensive use of plaster,&lt;ref&gt;Bourke, S., ''The Middle East: The Cradle of Civilization Revealed,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; the Aïn Ghazal statues represent a clear departure from the tiny, faceless figures of the Paleolithic period and mark the dawn of a distinct Neolithic art.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nabateans]] incorporated numerous sculpted panels, figurines and decorative friezes into their buildings at [[Petra]] and made pottery. Examples include the architectural detail used on the temple of Qsr al-Bint at Petra&lt;ref&gt;Basile, J.J., "Recently Discovered Relief Sculptures from the Great Temple at Amman," ''Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, vol. 46, The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Amman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalent stele representing the gods, as carved reliefs and either cut directly into the rock-face or carved as stand-alone units and placed inside carved niches.&lt;ref&gt;Patrich, J., ''The Formation of Nabataean Art: Prohibition of a Graven Image Among the Nabateans,'' Brill Archive, 1990, pp. 59-76&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans conquered Palestine and Syria in 64-63 BCE, and annexed Nabatea in 106 CE by which time the whole of Jordan fell under Roman rule. The Roman occupation corresponded with a flowering of the visual arts - painting, architecture. By the time of the Emperor Justinian (527-565 CE), churches dotted Jordan's landscape and these featured intricate mosaic floors, frescoes and porticos.&lt;ref&gt;"The Art of Ancient Jordan," in ''Minerva,'' Aurora Publications, 1991, pp. 20-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic art ===
{{main|Islamic art}}
The [[Umayyad]] period marks the starting point of Islamic art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad Castles: The Shift From Late Antique  Military  Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25; Yalman, S., "The Art of the Umayyad Period (661–750)," ''The Met Museum,'' [https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/umay/hd_umay.htm Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth and patronage of the [[Umayyad]] period stimulated the construction of religious, administrative and royal residences as well as prompting a distinctive style of ''bayt'' (domestic home). Jordan has some of the finest examples of early Islamic architecture including: [[caravanserai]]s, [[desert castles]] (in Arabic known as ''qusayr''), bath-houses, hunting lodges and palaces located in the fringe of the eastern desert.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad  Castles; The Shift From Late Antique Military Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of great mosques constructed during the rule of the Umayyad caliph [[Al-Walid I]] (705-714) include: the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]] (706 CE), the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] of Jerusalem (715 CE), and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina (709-715). Since the mid 19th-century, a number of the Umayyad sites have been excavated, revealing stunning frescoes, wall and ceiling paintings and statuary.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; One of these paintings, the ''[[Painting of the Six Kings]]'' has been the subject of considerable scholarship with respect to its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O., "The  Painting of the Six Kings at Quṣayr 'Amrah," ''Ars Orientalis,'' Vol. 1, 1954, pp. 185-187&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable frescoes and relief carvings can be found the [[desert castles]] of Quasyr Al Hallabat; [[Qasr Al-Kharanah|Quasyr al-Kharanah]], [[Qasr Azraq|Quasyr el-Azraq]], [[Qasr Mshatta]] and the [[Qasr Amra|Quasyr 'Amra]] which features frescoes of hunting scenes, musicians, acrobats, entertainers, nude women, wrestlers and scenes of the Royal court.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, especially see pp 55-68 for descriptions of the frescoes at Qusayr 'Amra&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser desert castles include [[Qasr Tuba|Quasyr al-Tuba]]; [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi|Quasyr al-Hayr al-Gharbi]]; [[Qasr Burqu'|Quasyr Burqu']], Qasr el `Uweinid and Qasr el Feifeh. &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. and Riley, D., ''Rome's Desert Frontiers,'' Routledge, 2012, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry and calligraphy were elevated to high art. Under the [[Umayyad]], writing assumed a special place, often based on scripture and the life of the prophet, Mahommed, but often seen as the carrier of independent meaning and a subject worthy of ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, R., Grabar, O. and Jenkins, K. (eds.), ''Islamic Art and Architecture, 650-1250 ''Yale University Press, 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Master calligraphers were venerated. The art of calligraphy was passed from master to student in a formal, rigorous system of training that took place over many years, required for students to learn the strict rules and protocols that governed the art form. Both religious and secular writing flourished under the Umayyad dynasty. 

Poets, (known as ''sha'ir'' meaning wizard) were thought to be inspired by a spirit (''jinn''), and were expected to defend the honour of their tribe, and to perpetuate its deeds and accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Art, Literature, and Culture,'' Britannica Educational Publishing, 2009, pp. 58-60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mu'allaqat]], a collection of seven poems by different poets, although pre-Islamic in origin, is thought to be the precursor to Arabic poetry.

==Early modern art==
The origins of modern art in Jordan have their roots in the 1920s and 1930s when a small number of artists settled in Amman. [[Omar Onsi]] (1901-1969) was a Lebanese artist who settled in Amman in around 1922,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363; Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;  and gave painting lessons to the children of Abdullah I.&lt;ref name="Naef1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naef|first=Silvia |title=À la recherche d'une modernité arabe: l'évolution des arts plastiques en Égypte, au Liban et en Irak|page=160|year=1996|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101376-5|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the Turkish artist, Ziauddin Suleiman (1880-1945) also settled in Amman  and held the first solo exhibition at the Philadelphia Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, [[George Aleef]] arrived in Jordan with a group of Palestinian refugees and set up an art studio where he taught local students.&lt;ref&gt; Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; These three artists introduced local students to easel painting and contributed to a broader appreciation of art. &lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' p. 362 &lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1940s, Jordan had no art galleries and art exhibitions were virtually unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, T., ''Jordan: A Meed Practical Guide,'' Middle East Economic Digest Limited, Jordan, 1983, p. 72; the author claims that the first art exhibition was held in 1938 but adds no detail. However, different sources claim that the first art exhibition was held in  1951, See: ''Jordan,'' Jordan Information Bureau, 1981, p. 53 and Jonathan Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; The few art exhibitions that were mounted, were held in public spaces such as schools and the halls of parliament.

==Jordanian modern art movement==
In the late 1950s, a group of young artists who had trained in Europe, returned to Jordan to lay the foundations of the ''Jordanian modern art movement.''&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these students, including [[Muhanna Al-Dura]], Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi, received their earliest art education in Jordan from the Russian émigré, [[George Aleef]], who was the first Western painter to establish a studio in Amman and teach local students. According to Muhanna Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S., "Mohanna Durra," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohanna-Durra.aspx; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Dura along with these young artists helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement. &lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhanna Dura ultimately taught painting and art history at the Teachers' Training College in Ammman and in 1964, established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and also established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. Thus, he inspired a generation of young artists. Among his notable students were the Princess [[Wijdan Ali]] who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene and whose art often includes calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., "A Hit List of Jordanian Artists" in ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

A second group of artists, who trained in Europe and America in the 1960s, returned to Jordan and began to search for a distinctive Jordanian artistic expression and to assert their Arab identity. Notable artists in the Jordanian art movement include: Khalid Khreis (b. 1955); Nabil Shehadeh (b. 1949); Yasser Duwaik (b. 1940); [[Mahmoud Taha]] (b. 1942) and Aziz Amoura (b. 1944).&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, pp. 377-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurufiyah art movement==
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|Roof of [[Frere Hall]], Karachi, Pakistan, c. 1986. Pakmural by artist, [[Sadequain|Sadequain Naqqash]], integrates calligraphy into a contemporary artwork]]

{{main|Hurufiyya movement}}
The Hurufiyah Art Movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'' or the ''North African Letterist movement'') refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic form within an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1955, artists working in North Africa and parts of Asia transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; The use of calligraphy in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall (3).JPG|thumb|Detail of Roof of Frere Hall]]
Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrate Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyah artists were concerned with their individual dialogue with nationalism and attempted to engage with the modern art movement, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan's most notable exponents of hurufiyyah art are the ceramicist, [[Mahmoud Taha]] and the artist and art historian, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]] who through her writing has been able to bring the art movement to the attention of a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lākhey''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: लाखे, lā-khé) (alternative spellings '''Lākhe''', '''Lākhay''', लाखय्) is a demon in Nepalese folklore. He is depicted with a ferocious face, protruding fangs and mane of red or black hair. Lakhes figure prominently in traditional [[Newar]] culture of [[Nepal Mandala]]. The Lakhe tradition is found in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other Newar settlements throughout [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gurung| first = Anuj | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/nepal/demon-among-deities| title = A Demon Among Deities| work = Cultural Survival| publisher = | date=Spring 2009| accessdate = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakhes are said to be demons who used to live in the forests and later became protectors to the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, Simon and Barker, Clive (1 September 2003). ''New Theatre Quarterly 74, Volume 19.'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521535891}}, 9780521535892. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; A female Lakhe is known as Lasin (लसिं).

The other common legendary being in Nepalese folklore is the [[Khyah (legendary creature)|Khyāh]], who is depicted as a fat, hairy ape-like creature.

==Dancing Lakhes==

Lakhey Dance is one of the most popular dances of Nepal. Performers wearing a Lakhe costume and mask perform dances on the streets and city squares during festivals. The mask is made of [[papier-mâché]] and [[yak]] tails are used for the hair. The Lakhe dance is characterised by wild movements and thumping music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sikkim-culture.gov.in/Dances/Trance%20Dances.aspx| title = Lakhey Mask Dance| work = | publisher = Cultural Affairs and Heritage Department, Government of Sikkim| date=| accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Lakhe is [[Majipa Lakhey]] of [[Kathmandu]] who appears during the [[Yenya]] (Indra Jatra) festival in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| date=January 1992| accessdate = 24 July 2012}} Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koizumi, Fumio (1983). ''Dance and music in South Asian drama: Chhau, Mahākālī pyākhan and Yakshagāna.'' Academia Music. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped as a deity. City dwellers offer food and ritual items to him as he moves through the city accompanied by his musical band giving dance performances.

The Lakhe stops at major crossroads and market squares to give a performance. During the dance, a small boy is known as Jhyalincha (झ्यालिंचा) taunts the Lakhe making him chase him in anger. Jhyalincha always manages to slip into the crowd and escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |editor-first=Subash Ram |editor-last=Prajapati |title=The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal|publisher=Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council|date=2006|chapter=Majipa Lakhe|isbn=99946-707-0-0}} Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunla Lakhe comes out during [[Gunla]], the 10th month in the [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar which corresponds to August.

==Other Lakhes==

There are other Lakhes with particular characteristics. These mythical beings are said to reside in various parts of the city.

* Michyāh Lākhe (मिच्या: लाखे) (meaning "fire burning demon" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]) is a spirit who is said to cause a fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] wherever it resides. People possessed by Michyāh Lakhe are also believed to cause a fire. 
* Minpu Lākhe (मिंपू लाखे) also causes a fire.

The '''legal working age''' is the minimum age required by [[law]] for a person to work, in each [[country]] or [[jurisdiction]].

Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the [[age of majority]]. Activities that are dangerous, [[harmful]] to the [[health]] or that may affect the [[morals]] of [[Minor (law)|minors]] fall into this category.

{{Redirects|Stopping knot||Stopper knot}}
&lt;!--ABOK #3439--&gt;

A '''binding knot''' is a [[knot]] that may be used to keep an object or multiple loose objects together, using a string or a rope that passes at least once around them.  There are various binding knots, divided into two types.  '''Friction knots''' are held in place by the [[friction]] between the windings of line.  '''Knotted-ends knots''' are held in place by the two ends of the line being knotted together.

{{Quote|''Stopping'' may be either a temporary whipping or seizing, the commonest variety consisting of a few round turns finished off with a [[reef knot]]. The purpose of a ''whipping'' is to prevent the end of a rope from fraying. A ''seizing'' holds several objects together.|''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Clifford W. (1944). ''The Ashley Book of Knots'', p.546. Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-04025-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Whipping knot|Whipping]] and [[seizing]] are binding knots, but are more complex since they contain many turns, like a [[lashing (ropework)|lashing]].

This is a list of binding knots.

Many [[fandom]]s have their own nicknames that distinguish them from other fan communities. The nicknames are popular with singers, music bands, films, television shows, books, games, sports teams, and celebrities. Some of the terms are coined by fans while others are created by celebrities themselves.

The trend of giving a name to a fandom became more popular in the beginning of the 21st century with the invention of [[social media]], although such nicknames were used much earlier. Some people consider the [[Sherlock Holmes fandom|Sherlockians]] (fans of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) and [[Beatlemania]]cs (fans of [[The Beatles]]) to be some of the oldest known examples.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/beliebers-directioners-barbz-whats-with-pops-fanbase-nickname-craze/260798|title= Beliebers, Directioners, Barbz: What's With Pop's Fanbase-Nickname Craze?|website= The Atlantic|author= Jason Richards|date= 7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherlockians"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-05/pl_brown|title= Scott Brown on Sherlock Holmes, Obsessed Nerds, and Fan Fiction|author= Scott Brown|date= 20 April 2009|website= Wired|access-date=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is celebrated annually on 5 March, to mark the arrival of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) missionaries in 1797 when their ship ''[[Duff (1794 ship)|Duff]]'' landed at [[Matavai Bay]].&lt;ref name="AGW" /&gt; It is a non-working holiday.&lt;ref name="KennedyStudies2001" /&gt;

== History ==
On 5 March 1797, British Protestant missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] landed at [[Matavai Bay]], in [[Mahina, French Polynesia|Mahina]], Tahiti, on board ''[[Duff (1794 ship)|Duff]]''. Despite early setbacks in the mission, the LMS missionaries were able to convert the reigning king [[Pōmare II]], who sought to use the new religion to consolidate his own power over the other chiefs of the island. The king was formally baptized on 16 May 1819, and the rest of the [[kingdom of Tahiti]] followed. Protestantism gained a strong following with the [[Tahitian people]] through the patronage of the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] and other chiefly families of the neighboring [[Society Islands]]. Even when Tahiti became a French protectorate in 1843 and was annexed in 1880, Protestantism remained the dominant religion among the natives.&lt;ref name="Garrett1982"&gt;{{cite  book|last=Garrett|first=John|chapter=|title=To Live Among the Stars: Christian Origins in Oceania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7HYexAnWCoC|year=1982|publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]]|location=Suva, Fiji|isbn=978-2-8254-0692-2|oclc=17485209|pages=14-31, 253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday was established on 1 February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronologie|work=Histoire de l'Assemblée de la Polynésie française|url=http://histoire.assemblee.pf/articles.php?id=568|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebrations ==
The parishes of the [[Maohi Protestant Church]] hold organized celebrations and worship services. The holiday is also marked by cultural shows, public concerts and other events of cultural significance. Traditionally, the arrival of the first missionaries in 1797 is re-enacted at the Willy Bambridge Stadium complex in [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]], as well as on [[Afareaitu]], [[Moorea]].&lt;ref name="AGW"&gt;{{cite web|title=French Polynesia Observes Missionary Day|website=AGlobalWorld.com|url=http://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/french-polynesia-missionary-day/|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saura|first=Bruno|title=Histoire et mémoire des temps coloniaux en Polynésie française|location=Papeete|publisher=Au vent des îles|year=2015|isbn=978-2-36734-081-4|url=http://www.auventdesiles.pf/catalogue/collections/culture-oceanienne/histoire-et-memoire-des-temps-coloniaux-en-polynesie-francaise/|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commune of [[Arue, French Polynesia|Arue]] commemorates the festival by laying wreaths at the graves of the first Christian king Pōmare II and [[Henry Nott]], a member of the first company of missionaries who translated the Bible into the [[Tahitian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'arrivée de l'Évangile célébrée|work=Tahiti Infos|date=5 March 2016|url=http://www.tahiti-infos.com/L-arrivee-de-l-Evangile-celebree_a145512.html|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Music For Montserrat''''' was a [[benefit concert]] held on 15 September 1997 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Musicians came together to raise funds for the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Montserrat]] after a major volcanic eruption by the [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano earlier that year left the island, including its [[capital city|capital]] of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]], devastated. The concert starred musicians such as [[Phil Collins]], [[Ray Cooper]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Elton John]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Midge Ure]], [[Arrow (singer)|Arrow]] and many more, all of whom had once recorded at the island's famous [[AIR Studios]]. A DVD was released with the most famous songs from the concert, such as ''Your Song'', ''Layla'', ''Brothers In Arms'', ''Blue Suede Shoes'', ''Money For Nothing'', ''Yesterday'', ''Hey Jude'', and ''Message In A Bottle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfr.com/dvd/f1025-music-for-montserrat.html|title=Music for Montserrat|language=French|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert was arranged and produced by [[George Martin]]; proceeds from the show and DVD were used for immediate relief and also helped fund the building of a new cultural centre in Montserrat. On its completion in 2006, George Martin gifted the centre to the islanders.

'''New Australians''' are non-British migrants to Australia who arrived in the wave of [[Post-war immigration to Australia|immigration following World War II]]. The term initially referred to newly arrived immigrants, generally refugees, who were expected to eventually become mainstream Australians. It was coined by [[Arthur Calwell]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Colm Kiernan]] (1978). ''Calwell. A Personal and Political Biography'', West Melbourne, Thomas Nelson, pp. 129-130.  {{ISBN|0-17-005185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's first Minister for Immigration, to promote the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of migrants to Australia from continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Egon F. Kunz (1988). ''Displaced persons. Calwell's New Australians'', Sydney, Australian National University Press.  {{ISBN|0-08-034406-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was intended to be positive, and to discourage use of pejorative terms such as "reffo" or "Balt" that were then in frequent use.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Jupp]] (ed.)(1988) ''The Australian People. An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins'', North Ryde, NSW, Angus and Robertson, p.103. {{ISBN|0-207-15427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has fallen into disuse since the 1970s.

The [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], under state leader [[Jack Little (politician)|Jack Little]], is credited with being the first Australian political party to promote New Australian candidates in parliamentary elections in the period after the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsley Symons (2013), "Jack Little: leader of the DLP," in ''Recorder'' (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch), No. 278, December, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent candidates were [[Hungarians in Australia|Hungarian-Australian]] Vilmos Kormos for the [[Australian Senate]] in 1958, and [[Italian-Australian]] [[Nino Randazzo]] for the [[Electoral district of Fitzroy (Victoria)|electoral district of Fitzroy]] in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] in 1964.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">An '''omnibus edition''' or '''omnibus''' is a work containing one or more works by the same or, more rarely, different authors. Commonly two or more components have been previously published as books but a collection of shorter works, or shorter works collected with one previous book, may be an omnibus.

Omnibus editions help consolidate longer series into fewer books. The prices are usually equal to or less than the price of buying each individual edition separately. 

==Examples==
*''The Omnibus Jules Verne (4-Books-In-1: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Around the World in Eighty Days, The Blockade Runners, From the Earth to the Moon and a Trip Around It)''. Philadelphia: [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 2011-11-02.
&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Agatha Christie 1920s Omnibus'', ''Agatha Christie 1930s Omnibus'', and so on to the ''1960s Omnibus'', are five omnibus editions of those novels by [[Agatha Christie]] that were originally published in one decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agathachristie.com/shop/books/omnibus/ Agatha Christie: Omnibus Edition]. ''agathachristie.com''. Retrieved 2011-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Provection''' (from Latin: ''provectio'' "advancement") is a linguistic term referring to the carrying over of the final [[consonant]] of a word to the following word. Examples in English include ''newt'' from earlier ''an ewte'' and ''nickname'' from earlier ''an eke name''. It is also observed in [[Celtic languages]], both [[Scottish Gaelic]], noted in ''The Gaelic of Arran'' by [[Nils Holmer|Nils Magnus Holmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmZiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Provection%22&amp;dq=%22Provection%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9CrbTs6VNcWMmQWi_7TrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ |title=The Gaelic of Arran - Nils Magnus Holmer - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively in [[Breton language|Breton]] grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzKa-iSAWggC&amp;pg=PA575&amp;dq=%22Provection%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9CrbTs6VNcWMmQWi_7TrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Provection%22&amp;f=false |title=Breton Orthographies and Dialects: The Twentieth-Century Orthography War in ... - Iwan Wmffre - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0453 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà romana - Sarcofago Mattei Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Symbolic representation of the Rhea Silvia myth on a sarcophagus in the [[Palazzo Mattei]]. Most of the elements of the story can be found in the scene. The central figure, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], strides over Rhea Silvia being put to sleep by [[Hypnos|Somnus]] pouring the juice of sleep on her from a horn. The wolf, the personification of the river, the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], are all present.]]
'''Rhea Silvia''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|ə|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|v|i|ə}} (also written as '''Rea Silvia'''), and also known as '''Ilia''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|l|i|ə}}, was the mythical mother of the twins [[Romulus and Remus]], who founded the city of [[Rome]]. Her story is told in the [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#3|first book]] of ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' of [[Livy]] and in fragments from [[Ennius]], ''Annales''&lt;ref&gt;Ennius, ''Annales'', I, fr. 19, as well as [[Cicero]], ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'' 1.30,&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'' 809 f4a.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The legend ==
[[Image:Rea teatro romano cartagena.jpg|thumb|Rhea Silvia, torso from the [[Roman theatre, Cartagena]], Spain that was rediscovered in 1988.]]
[[File:Fonte Gaia - she wolf detail.jpg|thumb|[[gray wolf|She-wolf]] (''lupa'') in [[Fonte Gaia]]]]
According to Livy's account of the legend she was the daughter of [[Numitor]], king of [[Alba Longa]], and descended from [[Aeneas]]. Numitor's younger brother [[Amulius]] seized the throne and killed Numitor's son, then forced Rhea Silvia to become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a priestess of the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. As Vestal Virgins were sworn to celibacy for a period of thirty years, this would ensure the line of Numitor had no heirs.

However, Rhea Silvia conceived and gave birth to the twins [[Romulus and Remus]]. She claimed that the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] was the father of the children. Livy says that she was raped by an unknown man, but "declared Mars to be the father of her illegitimate offspring, either because she really imagined it to be the case, or because it was less discreditable to have committed such an offence with a god."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1|Book 1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Amulius learned of the birth he imprisoned Rhea Silvia and ordered a servant to kill the twins. But the servant showed mercy and set them adrift on the river [[Tiber]], which, overflowing, left the infants in a pool by the bank. There, a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] (''lupa''), who had just lost her own cubs, suckled them.&lt;ref&gt;The she-wolf is memorialised in the Medieval bronze ''[[Capitoline Wolf]]'' and is a symbol of Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently [[Faustulus]] rescued the boys, to be raised by his wife [[Acca Larentia|Larentia]].&lt;ref&gt;Some are of the opinion that Larentia was called Lupa among the shepherds from her being a common prostitute, and hence an opening was afforded for the marvellous story (Livy).&lt;/ref&gt; The god of the Tiber, [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], rescued Rhea Silvia and took her to be his bride.

[[Romulus]] would go on to found [[Rome]], overthrow Amulius, and reinstate Numitor as King of Alba Longa.

==In Roman art and literature==
Despite Livy's [[euhemerism|euhemerist]] and realist deflation of this myth, it is clear that the story of her seduction by Mars continued to be widely accepted. This is demonstrated by the recurring theme of Mars discovering Rhea Silvia in Roman arts: in bas-relief on the Casali Altar ([[Vatican Museums]]), in engraved couched glass on the [[Portland Vase]] ([[British Museum]]), or on a sarcophagus in the [[Palazzo Mattei]]. Mars' discovery of Rhea Silvia is a prototype of the "invention scene", or "discovery scene" familiar in Roman art; Greek examples are furnished by Dionysus and [[Ariadne]] or Selene and [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]. The [[Portland Vase]] features a scene that has been interpreted as a depiction of the "invention", or coming-upon, of Rhea Sylvia by Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by D. E. L. Haynes, "The Portland Vase again" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''88''' (1968:58-72)  p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In a version presented by [[Ovid]],&lt;ref&gt;Ovid: ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'',  [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/AmoresBkIII.htm#anchor_Toc520536662 book III, elegy VI: 'The Flooded River'].&lt;/ref&gt; it is the river Anio who takes pity on her and invites her to rule in his realm.

==Etymology==

The name Rhea Silvia suggests a minor [[deity]], a demi-goddess of [[forest]]s. ''Silva'' means woods or forest, and ''Rea'' may be related to ''res'' and ''regnum''; ''Rea'' may also be related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''rheô'', "flow," and thus relate to her association with the spirit of the river [[Tiber]] or Greek goddess [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. [[Carsten Niebuhr]] proposed that the name Rhea Silvia came from ''Rea'', meaning ''guilty'', and ''Silvia'' meaning ''of the forest'' and so assumed that Rhea Silvia was a generic name for ''the guilty woman of the forest'', i.e. the woman who had been seduced there.

== In literature ==
* Rhea Silvia appears as a minor [[goddess]] in [[Rick Riordan]]'s [[fantasy novel]] ''[[The Mark of Athena]]''. She and her husband [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]] assist [[demigod]] [[Annabeth Chase]] on her quest in [[Rome]]. She affects the appearance of [[Audrey Hepburn]] from the film ''[[Roman Holiday]]''.
* In [[David Drake]]'s Science Fiction story ''"To Bring the Light"''&lt;ref&gt;In included in the 2011 collection [[Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories]].&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[time travel]]ling protagonist meets a completely human Rhea Silvia - a sympathetic peasant living in a small shepherd community on [[Palatine Hill]] in what would become the city of Rome.

== In popular culture ==
* "Rhea Silva" is used as a password numerous times in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' spin-off series ''[[Torchwood]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|thumb|[[Neolithic]] art in Djelfa.]]
The rock art of the [[Djelfa]] region in the [[Ouled Naïl Range]] ([[Algeria]]) consists of prehistoric cave paintings and petroglyphs dating from the [[Neolithic]] age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the [[Saharan rock art|Saharan]] [[Atlas Mountains]] they follow on from those, to the west, of [[Rock art of south Oran (Algeria)|south Oran]] (the regions of [[Rock art of Figuig|Figuig]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[El Bayadh]], [[Mechta-Afalou|Afalou]] and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable [[rock art|engravings]] have also been described further to the east, in the [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine (Algeria)]] region.

== Localities and descriptions ==
Some of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of [[Zaccar]] were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Daïet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesbaïa and [[Aïn Naga]]. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region.

[[Henri Lhote]] referred to these engravings in his major work, ''Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'', which he published in 1970 in the series of the ''Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques'' (CRAPE).&lt;ref&gt;Edited at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri (Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages and photographic reproductions).&lt;/ref&gt; For him they could not "be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna"(p.&amp;nbsp;194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like "foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south [[Oran]]", (p.&amp;nbsp;193), a region which for the author was "the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions." Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like "The Apollo of Ouled Naïl", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.

Regretting "the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in ''Lybica'' (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on ''Les figurations rupestres de la région de Djelfa, Sud Algérois.'' The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of [[Sidi Makhlouf]] and on the south-east by the town of [[Messaad]].
* [http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=34.350239&amp;lon=3.261566&amp;z=10&amp;l=2&amp;m=a&amp;v=2] The region of Djelfa on Wikimapia.

[[Image:Gravures préhistoriques, Djelfa, carte.jpg|550px|thumb|left]]

Around the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Daïet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons "Pigeon Rock"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesbaïa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n° 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia).

Around the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (Aïn Mouilha), 5 (Daïet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan), 9 (Station de l'Autruche "Ostrich"), 8 (Daïet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (Aïn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura).

The engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, "stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the [[patina]] of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds." They are "by-and-large arranged in little separate groups", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesbaïa or [[Aïn Naga]] being "exceptions".

Recognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are "similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif"(p.&amp;nbsp;67). According to these authors "The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with [[spheroid]]s can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

What is more "The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south [[Algeria]]n." Deducing that these evidences "show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient", Huard and Allard prefer to speak "of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep"(p.&amp;nbsp;71).

== The "Hunters" Stage ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Oued el Hesbaïa.]]

In the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures.

Of the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesbaïa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), Aïn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a "lengthened semi-circular attribute"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane.

Large, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at Aïn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, Aïn Mouilha, Oued el Hesbaïa (where the "[[elephant]] panel", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, [[Zaccar]], Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin.

Seven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, Aïn Naga, and Oued el Hesbaïa.

Nine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Daïet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called ''the Tazina School'', found in south-[[Oran]].

Eighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: "naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes" (Oued el Hesbaïa, Zaccar, Daïet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), "fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile", "weaker in style and carving method", "late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the "smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late", "of mediocre style and carving method"(pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85).

The ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesbaïa) "generally of a poor quality." [[boars]], in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir.

The human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesbaïa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and [[Ben Hadid]]. Authors attribute to them the model of the "twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture" which they have identified "in the [[Nile]] area and in various [[Sahara]]n regions" (p.&amp;nbsp;85).

Thus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, "all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the ''spirale'' (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at [[Tassili]] in the Oued Djerat sector."(p.&amp;nbsp;93).

== Early stages of domestication ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga.]]

Several antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching "through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures ([[Aïn Naga]], Daïet es Stel, Oued el Hesbaïa, Saouiet).

It is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of Aïn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a [[loin-cloth]] with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the [[nape]] of his neck in three swathes.

Of the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a [[Sheep|ram]], a ewe and a large bull denotes "a well established domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesbaïa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and [[Aïn Naga]].

The rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle ([[Zaccar]]) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others dating from the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb).

The "pastoral scenes" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, Aïn Mouilha (men with "bandes molletières"), Morhoma, Daïet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, [[ithyphallic]] images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou, Mediouna II, and Daïet el Hamra. [[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga, engraving called "The timid lovers".]]At Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at Aïn Naga that of the "timid lovers" in which the man carries an object like a [[haricot]], [[shield]] or [[quiver]] surmounted by [[arrow]]s, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at Aïn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip.

One also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various epochs.

In addition, three sites with [[cave painting]]s are located at Djebel Doum, at the Zaccar south site (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma south.

In 1968, elements of a [[lithic industry]] belonging to the [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] were discovered ''in situ'' by D. Grébénart at Aïn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220.

==The probable ancient regional ecology==
North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a [[savanna]] type of ecosystem, with [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the [[Sahel]] region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist [[Roland Oliver]] has described the scene as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] the highlands of the central [[Sahara]] beyond the [[Libyan desert]],... in the great [[massif]]s of the [[Tibesti]] and the [[Hoggar]], the mountaintops, today bare rock, were covered at this period with forests of [[oak]] and [[walnut]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[alder]] and [[elm]]. The lower slopes, together with those of the supporting bastions — the [[Tassili]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus|Acacus]] to the north, [[Ennedi]] and [[Aïr Mountains|Air]] to the south — carried [[olive]], [[juniper]] and [[Aleppo pine]]. In the valleys, perennially flowing rivers teemed with fish and were bordered by seed-bearing grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Oliver|Oliver, Roland]] (1999), ''The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge to the 21st Century'' (Series: History of Civilization), London: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|Phoenix Press]], revised edition, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sandawe''' is a "[[click language]]" spoken by about 60,000 [[Sandawe people]] in the [[Dodoma]] region of [[Tanzania]]. Language use is vigorous among both adults and children, with people in some areas monolingual. Sandawe had generally been classified as a member of the defunct [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan family]] since Albert Drexel in the 1920s, due to the presence of [[click consonant|clicks]] in the language.  Recent investigations however (Güldemann 2010) suggest that Sandawe may be related to the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]] regardless of the validity of Khoisan as a whole. A discussion of Sandawe's linguistic classification can be found in Sands (1998).

Sandawe has two dialects, northwest and southeast. Differences include speaking speed, vowel dropping, some [[word taboo]], and minor lexical and grammatical differences. Some [[Alagwa people|Alagwa]] have shifted to Sandawe, and are considered a Sandawe clan.

[[SIL International]] began work on Sandawe in 1996 and to date (2004), Daniel and Elisabeth Hunziker and Helen Eaton continue to work on the analysis of the language. They have so far produced a phonological description, a dialect survey report and several papers on aspects of grammar. Sandawe is also currently (since 2002) studied by Sander Steeman of [[Leiden University]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
[[File:Sandawe vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|Sandawe vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Eaton|2006|p=237}}]]

Sandawe has five vowel qualities:

{|
|-
| i || || || || u 
|-
| || e || || o || 
|-
| || || a || ||
|}

All five vowel qualities may be found as short oral {{IPA|/a/}}, long oral {{IPA|/aː/}}, and long nasal {{IPA|/ãː/}} vowels {{Clarify|reason=current text gives impression that all five vowels can shift tot /a/; meant is probably to give examples only for /a/; please indicate with "e.g."|date=August 2014}}. There are therefore fifteen basic vowel phonemes. Short nasal vowels also occur, apparently from the historical elision of a nasal consonant that is still attested in related forms. Long vowels are written double, ''aa,'' and long nasal vowels with a tilde, ''ã.''

Long vowels are about 50% longer than short vowels. In morpheme-final position, low-tone /u/ and /i/ are frequently devoiced, though this may not occur after /j/, /w/, or /h/.

===Consonants===

====Non-click consonants====
The glyphs in ''italics'' are the practical orthography developed by Hunziker and Hunziker, followed by approximate equivalents in the IPA.

''Tc'' and ''dz'' are {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in the northwestern dialect, but often {{IPA|[ts]}} and {{IPA|[dz]}} or even {{IPA|[z]}} in the southeast. {{IPA|[tsʰ]}} for ''tch'' occurs but is less common.

Consonants in parentheses are rare.

====Clicks====

|}

The clicks in Sandawe are not particularly loud, when compared to better known click languages in southern Africa. The lateral click {{IPAblink|kǁ}} can be confused with the [[alveolar lateral ejective affricate]] {{IPAblink|tɬʼ}} even by native speakers. With the [[alveolar click|postalveolar clicks]], the tongue often slaps the bottom of the mouth, and this slap may be louder than the actual release of the click. Wright et al. transcribe this [[slapped click]] with the [[extended-IPA]] symbol {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ǃ¡}}}}. The voiced clicks are uncommon, being found in a few words such as ''gqokomi'' "greater kudu" and ''gcingco'' (sp. bird). Labialized clicks are found in word-initial position.

The glottalized click phonation is something like [[creaky voice]], not an [[ejective]]. In initial position, the [[glottis]] is closed during the entire occlusion of the click, and not opened until after the release burst. In medial position, the glottis is closed after the velar closure {{IPA|[ŋ]}} and before the forward closure, but opened ''before'' the click release. Such clicks are not nasalized all the way through; in some tokens they are simply prenasalized glottalized clicks, {{IPA|[ŋkǃˀ]}}, bearing in mind that the superscript {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ˀ}}}} implies [[co-articulated consonant|coarticulation]] (that is, that it is pronounced together with the {{IPA|[k]}}, not after).

The practical orthography is based on [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

===Tone===
Hunziker et al. (2008) transcribe seven surface tones: high {{IPA|[á]}}, mid {{IPA|[ā]}}, low {{IPA|[à]}}, high falling {{IPA|[â]}}, mid falling {{IPA|[ā̀]}}, low falling {{IPA|[ȁ]}}, and rising {{IPA|[ǎː]}} (on long vowels only)

High and low tones are fundamental. High falling tones are required in the underlying representation, for example in {{IPA|[tsʼâ]}} "water", but are also often due to a sequence of tones. As in [[Twi language|Twi]], mid tone does not occur initially. Hunziker et al. analyze it as a [[downstep]]ped high tone: //H-L-H// is realized as [H-H-M]. This rightward shift on the tones is a general process in Sandawe.{{Clarify|reason=last H of H-L-H seems to have shifted leftward in H-H-M rather than rightward; M may be a transformed L and have shifted rightward, but this is by no means clear from the text|date=August 2014}} This analysis requires the assumption of [[floating tone|floating low tones]] carried by [[consonant cluster]]s, and thought to reflect a historical vowel which has been deleted. The low and mid falling{{Clarify|reason=low falling and mid falling or plain low and mid falling?|date=August 2014}} tones are a prosodic effect, found on final syllables, or on penultimate syllables followed by a voiceless vowel; this leftward shift of tone before voiceless vowels (which by their nature cannot carry tone) is another general process of Sandawe. Rising tone is only found on long vowels and can be seen as a low-high sequence.

Thus at a phonemic level, {{smallcaps|high}}, {{smallcaps|low}}, {{smallcaps|falling}}, and {{smallcaps|downstep}} are required. Tone is not written, except indirectly in genitive phrases, which are hyphenated.

===Phonotactics===
The majority of Sandawe syllables are [[consonant|C]][[vowel|V]]. Morpheme-initially, consonant clusters are of the form Cw; these are not found in the middle of morphemes. Most consonants are attested in this Cw sequence apart from the labials, the glottals ''(’, h),'' sonorants ''(r, l, y, w),'' and the rather infrequent consonants ''n, d, dl,'' &amp; the voiced clicks, which may simply be gaps in attestation. The rounded vowels ''o, u'' are not found after Cw sequences. Vowel initial syllables, as in ''cèú'' "buffalo", are not found initially, though initial glottal stop is not written ''(íóó'' {{IPA|/ʔíóː/}} "mother").

Glottal stops {{IPA|/ʔ/}} are found as syllable codas, though these may be released in an [[echo vowel]] in some circumstances. Hunziker et al. prefer to analyze these are final consonants, because the quality of the echo vowel is predictable, and otherwise this is the only place where the vowels /e a o/ would have voiceless allophones.

Hunziker et al. find complementary distribution between homorganic [[Nasal stop|N]]C clusters, which occur only medially (there are no word-final nasal consonants), and nasal vowels, which they only transcribe word finally. It would therefore seem that NC clusters are the realization of a preceding nasal vowel.

Other final consonants are found as consonant clusters in the middle of a word. Historically, these are presumably due to vowel elision, as evidenced by records from the early 20th century and also by tone patterns. In the northwestern dialect, words are found with final consonants where tonal patterns suggest there was once a voiceless final vowel, and where the southeastern dialect retains a voiceless ''i'' or ''u.''

===Syllable structure===
Sandawe syllables are usually of the form CV; in monosyllabic words, word-final nasals are not uncommon, CV(N). Sometimes other consonants are found in word-final position, but this is most probably the result of deletion of word-final voiceless vowels.

A syllabic nasal ''m'' is found in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] loanwords. The most common word structure is disyllabic with or without long vowels (CV(ː)CV(ː)), according to De Voogt (1992).

===Nouns===
Although nouns can be masculine or feminine, there is usually no particular marker that indicates the gender. Many singular feminine human nouns are marked by the ending -sù, whereas some singular masculine human nouns end in -é. Additionally, definite human feminine nouns must be marked with the suffix -sù, often repeating marking:
:{{interlinear|lang=sad
|ncûmsù-n-sù
|wife-DEF-F
|'the wife'}}

Gender assignment for most non-human animates as well as inanimates is largely unpredictable. However, according to Steeman (2011), all body parts are masculine, bigger plants are masculine while smaller plants are feminine, machinery nouns new to the Sandawe (whose names are typically borrowed from Swahili) are usually feminine, and deverbal nouns representing acts (nominalizations) are masculine. According to Eaton (2010), a masculine noun can be made a diminutive by treating it as a feminine noun.

According to Eaton (2010), definite plural nouns are marked with the suffix -khéé, while definite associative plurals are marked with the suffix -khì. According to Steeman (2011), definite human plurals are marked with -sò.

===Adjectives===
The same roots may be used as adjectives or verbs according to Kagaya (1993:ix).

===Syntax===
Basic word order in Sandawe is SOV according to De Voogt (1992). However, word order in the Sandawe sentence is very flexible due to the presence of several 'subject identification strategies'.

Sample sentence (mid tones are not marked):
:{{interlinear|lang = sad
|úte-s kxʼaré-és hàʔǃà
|yesterday-I boy-I called
|'Yesterday I called a boy.'&lt;ref&gt;Source: De Voogt 1992:19, adapted from Tucker 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An article in Studies in African Linguistics, Volume 10, Number 3, 1979, by Gerard Dalgish, describes these 'subject identification strategies' in detail. Numerous permutations of sentence constituents are allowed in certain tenses, the pattern being: (a) the first constituent is the subject or (b) any non-subject that is first in the sentence must be marked for the subject. Non-subject constituents include verbs, a progressive marker, objects, indirect objects, adverbs, prepositional phrases, complementizers. Similar results are obtained in WH-Questions.
&lt;ref&gt;elanguage.net/journals/index.php/sal/article/viewPDFInterstitial/1062/823&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Elderkin (1989) analyzes Sandawe as having two level tones (High, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising). His thesis considers the behavior of tone at word-, sentence- and discourse-level. De Voogt (1992) and Kagaya (1993) list three level tones (High, Mid, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising).

==Classification==
The most promising candidate as a relative of Sandawe are the [[Khoe languages]] of [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]. Most of the putative cognates Greenberg (1976) gives as evidence for Sandawe being a Khoisan language in fact tie Sandawe to Khoe. Gueldemann and Elderkin have strengthened that connection, with several dozen likely cognates, while casting doubts on other Khoisan connections. Although there are not enough similarities to reconstruct a Proto-Khoe–Sandawe language, there are enough to suggest that the connection is real. However, other linguists have criticized the proposal as cherry-picking among a large number of non-matching pronominal forms.

The pronominal system is quite similar: 
{| class=wikitable
! 
! Sandawe
! Proto-Khoe–Kwadi
|-
! 1sg PN
| tsi
| *ti (Kwadi tʃi)
|-
! 2sg PN
| ha-
| *sa
|-
! 3 PN base
| he-
| xa (Kwadi ha-)
|-
! 3ms suffix
| -w(e), -m
| (Khoe *-bV, *-mV)
|-
! 3fs suffix 
| su
| (Khoe *-sV)
|}

These may cast some light on the development of clicks. For example, the Sandawe word for 'horn', ''tlana,'' may be a cognate with the root ''nǁâ'' found throughout the Khoe family. This and other words suggests that clicks may form from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word is lost: ''*tlana &gt; *tlna &gt; ǁna (nǁa).''

Since the Khoe family appears to have migrated to southern Africa from the northeast, it may be that Sandawe is closer to their common homeland than the modern Khoe languages are.

'''''Scooby Apocalypse''''' is a monthly [[comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]], which began in May 2016. It re-imagines the characters from the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise, particularly the 1969 TV series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', setting them in a [[Global catastrophic risk|post-apocalyptic world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/2016/01/28/dc-entertainment-hanna-barbera-titles|title=DC Entertainment announces new slate of Hanna-Barbera titles - EW.com|first=|last=Andrea Towers • @_atowers|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldnews.com/zz/entertainment/20160502/scooby-doo-grows-up----and-fights-future----in-scooby-apocalypse|title=Scooby-Doo Grows Up – And Fights The Future – In Scooby Apocalypse|first=TV|last=Guide|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/gritty-reboot-scooby-doo-shaggy-is-a-hipster-now|title=Today in Gritty Reboots: Shaggy from 'Scooby-Doo' Is a Hipster Now and Fred Has Tribal Tattoos|first=Joshua|last=Rivera|date=28 January 2016|publisher=[[GQ]]|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous titles, which are all-ages, this title has a teen plus rating.

The comic was conceived by DC Comics co-publisher and artist, [[Jim Lee]], as part of a major reboot using Hanna-Barbera characters, in order to create a new Hanna-Barbera comic book universe.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/galleries/scooby-apocalypse-exclusive-first-look-inside-the-comic/|title=Scooby Apocalypse: Exclusive First Look Inside The Comic: Scooby Apocalypse cover, art by Jim Lee|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Lee worked on the first issue's cover and several more after that (before interior artist, Howard Porter, took over).

== Premise ==
"Those meddling kids" and their Mystery Machine are at the center of a well-meaning experiment gone wrong and they’ll need to bring all of their mystery solving skills to bear (along with plenty of Scooby Snacks), to find a cure for a world full of mutated creatures infected by a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]] virus that enhances their fears, terrors, and baser instincts. This time, the horrors are real in this apocalyptic near-future badland!&lt;ref&gt;Beedle, Tim (January 28, 2016).

== Story ==

{{Empty section|date=December 2016}}

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===

* '''[[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scoobert "Scooby" Doo]]''' – Scooby-Doo is a "Smart Dog" prototype, who is able to talk like a human being, thanks to a chip that was implanted in his cerebral cortex. This enables him to communicate with others, either by words or through the use of a pair of emoji-goggles. He was treated poorly by the rest of the smart dogs in the Nevada Complex as the runt of the litter, being constantly attacked by them. Eventually, he ended up standing up against the other dogs after Shaggy taught him how to defend himself. Unlike his cartoon counterpart, Scooby is quite brave and is not afraid of anything that stands in his way. His original name was 24062, having been named Scooby by Shaggy himself.  
* '''[[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]]''' – Fred Jones was the doting cameraman of "Daphne Blake's Mysterious Mysteries", hosted by his long-time friend, Daphne Blake. Having attended the same college as Daphne, Fred has always been there for her. Over the years he developed a crush on Daphne and has since tried to prove himself as a man worthy of her affections (he states that he proposed to her numerous times), even though Daphne states that she sees him only as a friend (which he does not believe for a minute). He acts as Daphne's moral compass sometimes, and is usually the voice of reason, whenever there are fights among the gang. However, it is revealed in issue 25 that Fred has died, suggesting the Fred seen in the issue is a hallucination of Daphne's.
* '''[[Daphne Blake]]''' – Daphne Blake was a budding journalist, who came from a wealthy family. Her career plummeted after she failed to expose a story she had been working on for almost a year. After that, she was lucky to get a slot on the Knitting Channel, hosting "Daphne Blake's Mysterious Mysteries", which further contributed to her being seen by her peers as a laughing-stock. As a journalist, she feels compelled to finding the truth, no matter what the cost. Known for being extremely distrustful, she has a sharp tongue and a sarcastic vein. Still, under a tough shell, Daphne is shown to be very caring and very fearful for the well-being of everyone in the gang, especially Fred, for whom she has a soft spot. 
* '''[[Shaggy Rogers|Norville "Shaggy" Rogers]]''' – Norville Rogers, nicknamed Shaggy by his friends, was a dog handler in the Nevada Complex, where he was responsible for the treatment and training of the "smart dog" prototypes. On his first day on the job, he saved Scooby-Doo from being ripped to pieces by the other prototypes, making it his mission to show the Great Dane how to defend himself against the others. Later, this earned the canine's loyalty and friendship. He also became an acquaintance of Dr. Krebs, the creator of the Mystery Machine, who taught him how to drive it. Normally, Shaggy is laid-back and is always hungry. He defends a philosophy of life, in which a person must be open-minded to the universe and to what the universe throws at people. He also believes in numerous gods and deities, and is very superstitious. Still, in moments of tension, he is the one that tries to keep the peace between the gang, reminding them that in order to survive, they have to stick together.    
* '''[[Velma Dinkley]]''' – Velma Dinkley was a leading scientist in the Nevada Complex. Throughout her life, Velma never had any friends and considered herself as incapable of making them due to her extraordinary intelligence and low social skills. She would later collaborate in a top secret research project called Project Elysium, which through the use of nanites was supposed to alter mankind's DNA, eliminating mankind's bad and vile instincts. She was also the coordinator of the "Smart Dog" program, which created Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo. Being quite shy and socially awkward, Velma does not speak very much. Still, with a brilliant and objective mind, and armed with doctorates in the fields of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Astrophysics, Astronomy, Math and Engineering, she is usually the one that comes up with theories and plans on how to deal with the numerous monsters that attack her and the rest of the gang.

=== Recurring characters ===

* '''The Four''' – The Four are Velma's former employers, who operate several underground facilities and perform weird scientific experiments. They are revealed to be Velma's older brothers, who positioned themselves in strategic places of a specific field (Hugo Dinkley in the Military, Cheeves Dinkley in Politics, Quenton Dinkley in the Secret Services and Rufus Dinkley in a Research Medical Company) Velma describes them as a unique mind that shared four bodies, when they were younger. Along with Velma, they created Project Elysium and unknown to her at the time, used Velma's research for their own benefit, plunging Earth into an apocalyptic nightmare.
* '''[[Scrappy-Doo]]''' – Scrappy-Doo is one of the test subjects of the "smart dog" program at the underground Nevada Complex. Scrappy has two objectives on his mind: upgrading his implants that give him human-like attributes and to kill Scooby-Doo, the prototype of the smart dog program, who he hates because he sees him as a soft-hearted weakling. He also hates humans, given the experiments they performed on him. He leads the Scrappy Gang, which is composed of some of the other test subjects of the program.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/can-dcs-scooby-apocalypse-redeem-scrappy-doo/|title=Can DC's Scooby Apocalypse Redeem Scrappy-Doo?|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a runaway orphan named Cliffy, who he adopted and has grown fond of ever since.
* '''Daisy Dinkley''' – Daisy is Rufus Dinkley's wife and Velma's sister-in-law. Being Rufus' trophy wife, she was always treated like that, with Rufus always demeaning her. The truth is that Daisy is a lot smarter than she shows, and when the gang shows up, she ditches Rufus and goes with them, hoping to find a cure to the nanite apocalypse for which her husband was partly responsible. Its hinted that she has developed feelings for Shaggy.
* '''Cliffy''' – Cliffy is a runaway orphan that Scrappy-Doo adopts, while searching for Velma and the rest of the Scooby gang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">Founded in 2001, the '''Stock Artists Alliance''' was an international trade association of [[photographers]] who produce images for [[stock photography]]. The mission of SAA was to support and protect the business interests of professional stock photographers with regard to the worldwide distribution of their [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="SAA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716115607/http://www.stockartistsalliance.org/info/about/mission Stock Artists Alliance website: Mission Page at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an advocate for its members, SAA encouraged the use of fair contracts and ethical behavior at all levels of the industry. SAA monitored the [[stock photography]] industry and served as an ombudsman for its members' interests in dealing with picture agencies and other distribution channels.&lt;ref name="SAA"/&gt;

SAA's first major negotiation was with [[Getty Images]] to improve the photographers' contract.

In 2008, SAA joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the [[Artists Rights Society]], the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]], [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]], Illustrator's Partnership of America and the Advertising Photographers of America, among others) in opposing both [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236 The Orphan Works Act of 2008] and [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11322171 The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008].&lt;ref name="ipa2"&gt;[http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 Orphan Works Legislative Action Center: Groups Opposed to the Orphan Works Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 |date=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known collectively as "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 Artists United Against the U.S. Orphan Works Acts]," the diverse organizations joined forces to oppose the bills, which the groups believe "permits, and even encourages, wide-scale infringements while depriving creators of protections currently available under the Copyright Act."&lt;ref name="ipa2"/&gt;

In October 2009 SAA formally became a member of the [[Alliance of Visual Artists]] an umbrella organization representing six photographic associations and some 45,000 professional photographers (direct and affiliated members) worldwide, led by [[Professional Photographers of America]]

The organization ceased operations in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2011/03/stock-photographers-advocacy-group-saa-shutting-down.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2015}}

'''Syncretism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k|r|ə|t|ɪ|z|əm}}) is the combining of different beliefs, while blending practices of various [[school of thought|schools of thought]]. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation  of several originally discrete [[tradition]]s, especially in the [[theology]] and [[mythology]] of [[religion]], thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an [[Inclusivism|inclusive]] approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as [[eclecticism]]) as well as politics ([[syncretic politics]]).

== Nomenclature==
The English word is first attested in the early 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' first attests the word ''syncretism'' in English in 1618.&lt;/ref&gt; from   [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] ''syncretismus'', drawing on [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[:wikt:συγκρητισμός|συγκρητισμός]] (''synkretismos''), supposedly meaning "Cretan federation", but this is a spurious etymology from the naive idea in [[Plutarch]]'s 1st-century AD essay on "Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)" in his collection ''[[Moralia]]'' (2.490b). He cites the example of the [[History of Crete|Cretans]], who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. "And that is their so-called ''Syncretism'' [Union of Cretans]". More likely as an etymology is sun- ("with") plus kerannumi ("mix") and its related noun, "krasis," "mixture."

[[Erasmus]] probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word in his ''[[Adagia]]'' ("Adages"), published in the winter of 1517–1518, to designate the coherence of [[dissenter]]s in spite of their differences in theological opinions. In a letter to [[Melanchthon]] of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage "Concord is a mighty rampart".

== Social and political roles ==
[[File:Lahore Fort Elephant Pillars.jpg|thumb|The use of elephant-shaped column brackets at the [[Lahore Fort]] in [[Pakistan]] reflects Hindu influences on the syncretic architectural style of the Muslim [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]].]]
Overt syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the "other" cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized ''syncresis'' nevertheless. For example, some [[Converso]]s developed a sort of [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] for martyr-victims of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], thus incorporating elements of [[Catholicism]] while resisting it.

Some religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|melding Shintō beliefs into Buddhism]] or the amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic [[Christianity and Paganism#Pagan influences on Christianity|pagan views]] into [[Early Christianity#Spread of Christianity|Christianity]] during its spread into Gaul, the British Isles, Germany, and Scandinavia. Indian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in [[Trinidad]]. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples of this include post-[[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Exile]] [[Second Temple Judaism]], [[Islam]], and most of Protestant Christianity.{{explain|date=June 2017}}{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Syncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise different cultures and world-views ([[intercultural competence]]), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic [[empire|realm]]s. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of "[[piety]]" and "[[orthodoxy]]", may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of un-compromised [[Cultural identity|cultural unity]] in a well-defined minority or majority.

Religious syncretism exhibits blending of two or more religious [[Belief#Systems|belief systems]] into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in a culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or (especially) practices.

Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to "revealed" religious systems, such as the [[Abrahamic religions]], or any system that exhibits an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic trend may sometimes use the word "syncretism" as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Keith Ferdinando notes that the term "syncretism" is an elusive one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl= http://www.missiology.org.uk/pdf/cotterell-fs/15_ferdinando.pdf|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BlqxOQAACAAJ|chapter= Sickness and Syncretism in the African Context|author= Ferdinando, K.|title= Mission and Meaning: Essays Presented to Peter Cotterell|editor1= Antony Billington|editor2= Tony Lane|editor3= Max Turner|publisher= Paternoster Press|year= 1995|isbn= 9780853646761}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can apply to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a religion by beliefs or practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence under such a definition, according to Ferdinando, can lead to a fatal "compromise" of the original religion's "integrity".&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = The Christian faith is inevitably assimilated in terms of the existing structures of thought of its adherents, whatever their culture. Nevertheless, there are points at which the worldview of any people will be found to be incompatible with central elements of the gospel; if conversion to Christianity is to be more than purely nominal, it will necessarily entail the substantial modification of the traditional worldview at such points. Where this does not occur it is the Christian faith which is modified and thus relativised by the worldview, and the consequence is syncretism. [...] The term 'syncretism' [...] is employed here of the substitution or modification of central elements of Christianity by beliefs of practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence of such a process is fatally to compromise its integrity.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[secularization|secular]] society, religious innovators sometimes construct new religions syncretically as a mechanism to reduce inter-religious tension and enmity, often with the effect of offending the original religions in question. Such religions, however, do maintain some appeal to a less exclusivist audience. Note the [[Living Church]] in Soviet Russia and the [[German Evangelical Church]] in Nazi Germany.

== Cultures and societies ==
{{Main article|Moral syncretism}}

According to some authors, "Syncretism is often used to describe the product of the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of practices over another that is already present."&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Claus and Margaret A. Mills, ''South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia'': (Garland Publishing, Inc., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Jerry H. Bentley]], however, have argued that syncretism has also helped to create cultural compromise. It provides an opportunity to bring beliefs, values, and customs from one cultural tradition into contact with, and to engage different cultural traditions. Such a migration of ideas is generally successful only when there is a resonance between both traditions. While, as Bentley has argued, there are numerous cases where expansive traditions have won popular support in foreign lands, this is not always so.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Enlightenment ===
The modern, rational non-pejorative connotations of syncretism date from [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' articles: ''Eclecticisme'' and ''Syncrétistes, Hénotiques, ou Conciliateurs.''  Diderot portrayed syncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources.

'''Transgressive fiction''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] which focuses on characters who feel confined by the norms and expectations of society and who break free of those confines in unusual or illicit ways.&lt;ref name="atlmonth"/&gt;

==Literary context==
Because they are rebelling against the basic norms of society, [[protagonist]]s of transgressive fiction may seem [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[psychopathy|anti-social]], or [[nihilism|nihilist]]ic. The genre deals extensively with [[taboo]] subject matters such as [[drug]]s, [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[violence]], [[incest]], [[pedophilia]], and [[crime]]. The genre of "transgressive fiction" was defined by ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' literary critic [[Michael Silverblatt]].&lt;ref name="atlmonth"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96dec/wrdwatch/wrdwatch.htm Word Watch &amp;mdash; December 1996] from ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]]'s essay "A Preface to Transgression" (1963) provides an important methodological origin for the concept of transgression in literature. The essay uses ''[[Story of the Eye]]'' by [[Georges Bataille]] as an example of transgressive fiction.&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;[[Michel Foucault|Foucault, Michel]] (1963). "A Preface to Transgression." {{cite web |url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/cte/events/foucault-a-preface-to-transgression_11-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819050732/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/cte/events/foucault-a-preface-to-transgression_11-2.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rene Chun, a journalist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', described transgressive fiction:&lt;!-- the excerpt from Word Watch is a quote from the NY Times, not the words of the Atlantic Monthly journalist --&gt;
{{Cquote|A literary genre that graphically explores such topics as incest and other aberrant sexual practices, mutilation, the sprouting of sexual organs in various places on the human body, urban violence and violence against women, drug use, and highly dysfunctional family relationships, and that is based on the premise that knowledge is to be found at the edge of experience and that the body is the site for gaining knowledge.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;The New York Times &amp;mdash; April 23, 1995, pp. 49, 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The genre has been the subject of controversy, and many forerunners of transgressive fiction, including [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], have been the subjects of [[obscenity]] trials.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Transgressive fiction shares similarities with [[splatterpunk]], [[hard-boiled|noir]], and [[erotica|erotic fiction]] in its willingness to portray forbidden behaviors and shock readers. But it differs in that protagonists often pursue means to better themselves and their surroundings&amp;mdash;albeit unusual and extreme ones. Much transgressive fiction deals with searches for [[self-identity]], [[inner peace]], or [[personal freedom]]. Unbound by usual restrictions of taste and literary convention, its proponents claim that transgressive fiction is capable of incisive social commentary.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The genre overlaps somewhat with [[minimalist#Literary minimalism|literary minimalism]], in that many transgressive writers use short sentences and simplistic style.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==History==
The basic ideas of transgressive fiction are by no means new. Many works that are now considered [[western canon|classic]]s dealt with controversial themes and harshly criticized societal norms. Early examples include the scandalous writing of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]]'s ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' (1869). [[French literature|French]] author [[Émile Zola]]'s works about social conditions and "bad behavior" are examples, as are [[Russia]]n [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' (1864) and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Knut Hamsun]]'s psychologically-driven ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890). Sexual extravagance can be seen in two of the earliest European novels, the ''[[Satyricon]]'' and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', and also (with disclaimers) ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' and some of the excesses of early [[Gothic fiction]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The early development of the genre was anticipated in the work of early [[20th century]] writers such as [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Georges Bataille]], and [[Arthur Schnitzler]], who explored [[psychosexual development]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 6 December 1933, US federal judge John M. Woolsey overturned the federal ban on [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. The book was banned in the US due to what the government claimed was obscenity, specifically parts of Molly Bloom's "soliloquy" at the end of the book. [[Random House Inc.]] challenged the claim of obscenity in federal court and was granted permission to print the book in the US. Judge Woolsey's explanation for his removal of the ban is often quoted: "It is only with the normal person that the law is concerned."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the late 1950s, [[United States of America|American]] publisher [[Grove Press]], under publisher [[Barney Rosset]], began releasing decades-old novels that had been unpublished in most of the [[English language|English]]-speaking world for many years due to controversial subject matter. Two of these works, ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' ([[D. H. Lawrence]]'s tale of an [[upper class]] woman's affair with a [[working class]] man) and ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' ([[Henry Miller]]'s sexual odyssey), were the subject of landmark obscenity trials (''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was also tried in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Austria]]). Both books were ruled not obscene and forced the US courts to weigh the [[literary merit|merit of literature]] that would have once been instantly deemed [[pornographic]] (see [[Miller test]]). Similarly, the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]] published ''[[Lolita]]'' in 1955 to a great deal of controversy due to the [[hebephilia]] that occurs between the book's main characters, Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The transgressive nature of this subject has made Lolita a book often found on the [[list of books banned by governments]] and the [[list of most commonly challenged books in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Grove Press also published the explicit works of [[Beat generation|Beat]] writers, which led to two more obscenity trials. The first concerned ''[[Howl]]'', [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s 1955 poem which celebrated American [[counterculture]] and decried hypocrisy and emptiness in mainstream society. The second concerned [[William S. Burroughs]]' hallucinatory, [[satire|satirical]] novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959). Both works contained what were considered lewd descriptions of body parts and sexual &lt;!--what's "idesexual"? (often [[wikt:idesexual|]])--&gt; acts. Grove also published [[Hubert Selby Jr.]]'s anecdotal novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' (1964), known for its gritty portrayals of criminals, [[prostitute]]s, and [[transvestism|transvestites]] and its crude, slang-inspired prose. ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' was tried as obscene in the UK. Grove Press won all these trials, and the victories paved the way both for transgressive fiction to be published legally, as well as bringing attention to these works.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the 1970s and '80s, an entire underground of transgressive fiction flourished. Its biggest stars included [[J.G. Ballard]], a British writer known for his strange and frightening [[dystopia]]n novels; [[Kathy Acker]], an American known for her [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminist]] fiction; and [[Charles Bukowski]], an American known for his tales of womanizing, drinking, and gambling. The notorious [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|1971 film version]] of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', contained scenes of rape and "ultraviolence" by a futuristic youth gang complete with its own [[Nadsat|argot]], and was [[List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange|a major influence on popular culture]]; it was subsequently withdrawn in the UK, and heavily censored in the US.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the 1990s, the rise of [[alternative rock]] and its distinctly downbeat subculture opened the door for transgressive writers to become more influential and commercially successful than ever before.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This is exemplified by the influence of [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Douglas Coupland]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'', which explored the economically-bleak and [[apocalypse]]-fixated worldview of Coupland's age group. The novel popularized the term [[generation X]] to describe this age demographic. Other influential authors of this decade include [[Bret Easton Ellis]], known for novels about depraved [[yuppie]]s; [[Irvine Welsh]], known for his portrayals of [[Scotland]]'s drug-addicted working class youth; and [[Chuck Palahniuk]], known for his characters' bizarre attempts to escape bland [[consumerism|consumer culture]]. Both of [[Elizabeth Young (journalist)|Elizabeth Young]]'s volumes of literary criticism from this period deal extensively and exclusively with this range of authors and the contexts in which their works can be viewed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The early 21st century saw the rise of writers like [[Rupert Thomson]], [[R D Ronald]] and Kelly Braffet with their protagonists further pushing the criminal, sexual, violent, narcotic, self-harm, anti-social and mental illness related subject matter taboos from the shadows of the transgressive umbrella into the forefront of mainstream fiction. Ronald's novels ''The Elephant Tree'' and ''The Zombie Room'' are based in the fictional city of Garden Heights, providing a fresh, contemporary melting pot to showcase the amalgamation of UK and US cultural and societal dissatisfaction and frustration, that had previously been portrayed very differently.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the UK, the genre owes a considerable influence to "[[working class]] literature",{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} which often portrays characters trying to escape poverty by inventive means, while in the US, the genre focuses more on [[middle class]] characters trying to escape the emotional and spiritual limitations of their lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Due to a surge in popularity in the 21st century [https://transgressivefiction.info Transgressive Fiction] now has a central hub celebrating authors and books from past classics to contemporary masterpieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">In [[Etruscan mythology]], '''Tyrrhenus''' (in {{lang-el|Τυρρηνός}}) was one of the founders of the [[Etruscan civilization#Etruscan League|Etruscan League]] of twelve cities, along with his brother [[Tarchon]]. [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']] I.94&lt;/ref&gt; describes him as the saviour of the Etruscans, because he led them from [[Lydia]] to [[Etruria]]; however this Lydian origin is to be debated as it contradicts cultural and linguistic evidence, as well as the view held by both the Etruscans themselves and by other Etrusco-Roman and Greek ancient sources &lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Hamilton Grey, Chapter I, "The Rasena"; pp.5-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiquities Romanae, Book 1; Section 30. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend, "Foundation Myths and Legends"; pp. 201-208.
&lt;/ref&gt;. His name was given to the Etruscan people by the Greeks. The Romans extended this use to the sea west of Etruria: the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

The '''Ultraverse''' was a [[comic book]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] published by the [[American comic book|American]] company [[Malibu Comics]] which is owned by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Ultraverse was a [[shared universe]] in which a variety of characters—known within the comics as "[[Ultras (comics)|Ultras]]"—acquired super-human abilities.

==History==
The Ultraverse line was launched by [[Malibu Comics]] during the "comics boom" of the early 1990s. Ultraverse emphasized tight [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] between the various series in their line; Malibu made extensive use of [[fictional crossover|crossover]]s, in which a story that began in one series would be continued in the next-shipping issue of another series. Various promotions for special editions or limited-print stories also encouraged readers to sample issues of the entire line. The Ultraverse line came to dominate Malibu's catalog. Several characters from the series [[Ultraforce]] were featured in a short-lived animated series by the same name.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

As American comics sales declined  in the mid-1990s, Malibu canceled lower-selling series. The company was purchased by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1994. Reportedly Marvel made the purchase to acquire Malibu's then-groundbreaking in-house coloring studio. In reality, Marvel purchased the line to prevent DC Comics from buying Malibu, in order to increase DC's market share.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Brian (December 16, 2016). [http://www.cbr.com/comic-legends-why-did-marvel-really-buy-the-ultraverse/ "Comic Legends: Why Did Marvel REALLY Buy the Ultraverse?"]. [[CBR.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Marvel canceled the entire Ultraverse line, but (during the controversial ''Black September'' event) re-launched a handful of the more popular titles as well as a number of [[Intercompany crossover|crossovers]] with Marvel characters. The initial move was foreseen with popular franchises and characters from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] guest-starring in their books. The "volume 2" series each started with "#[[infinity|∞]]" (infinity) issues and were canceled a short time later. Within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics multiverse]], the Malibu Universe is designated as '''Earth-93060'''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Black September==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
When Malibu was bought out by [[Marvel Comics]], the entire Ultraverse line was cancelled and restarted.  Only a few of the more popular series were [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] and relaunched, with some being radically altered. The history and continuity of the Ultraverse was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] in numerous ways, and a number of characters simply ceased to exist (or in the new continuity, to have ever existed). This now-modified Ultraverse lasted less than a year and a half before being cancelled once again.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The event connects issues that were part of the countdown to Black September — ''[[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]]'' #8-10, ''Ultraforce/Avengers Prelude'', ''[[Avengers/Ultraforce]]'', ''Ultraforce/Avengers'' — after which all the surviving Ultraverse titles restarted with a special "∞"-numbered issue.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Revival==
In June 2005, when asked by [[Newsarama]] whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] replied:

{{quote|Let's just say that I wanted to bring these characters back in a very big way, but the way that the deal was initially structured, it's next to impossible to go back and publish these books.

There are rumors out there that it has to do with a certain percentage of sales that has to be doled out to the creative teams. While this is a logistical nightmare because of the way the initial deal was structured, it's not the reason why we have chosen not to go near these characters, there is a bigger one, but I really don't feel like it's my place to make that dirty laundry public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays9.html |title=Joe Fridays - Week 9|date=May 2005 |work=[[Newsarama]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323215618/http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays9.html |archivedate=March 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Senior Vice President of Publishing [[Tom Brevoort]] has stated in the past that the reason Marvel cannot discuss the Ultraverse properties is because of [[non disclosure agreements]] in place with certain parties, which has been speculated to pertain to [[Scott Mitchell Rosenberg]]'s contractual position as "ongoing producer deal for all Malibu Comics properties".&lt;ref&gt;De Blieck, Augie Jr. (December 17, 2013).
