      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5775">'''Acidogenesis''' is the second stage in the four stages of [[anaerobic digestion]]:
* [[Hydrolysis]]: A chemical reaction where [[particulate]]s are solubilized and large [[polymer]]s converted into simpler [[monomer]]s;
* Acidogenesis: A biological reaction where simple monomers are converted into volatile [[fatty acid]]s;
* [[Acetogenesis]]: A biological reaction where volatile fatty acids are converted into [[acetic acid]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[hydrogen]]
* [[Methanogenesis]]: A biological reaction where [[acetate]]s are converted into [[methane]] and carbon dioxide, while hydrogen is consumed.
Anaerobic digestion is a complex [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] process of [[Biology|biologically]] mediated reactions by a consortium of [[microorganism]]s to convert [[organic compound]]s into methane and carbon dioxide. It is a stabilization process, reducing odor, [[pathogen]]s, and mass [[Redox|reduction]].

[[Hydrolysis|Hydrolytic]] [[bacteria]] form a variety of [[Redox|reduced]] end-products from the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of a given [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. One fundamental question that arises concerns the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] features that control [[carbon]] and [[electron]] flow to a given reduced end-product during [[pure culture]] and mixed [[Methanogenesis|methanogenic]] [[Microbiological culture|cultures]] of hydrolytic bacteria. ''[[Thermoanaerobium brockii]]'' is a representative [[Thermophile|thermophilic]], hydrolytic bacterium, which ferments [[glucose]], via the [[Embden–Meyerhof pathway|Embden–Meyerhof Parnas Pathway]]. ''T. brockii'' is an atypical hetero-[[lactic acid]] bacterium because it forms molecular hydrogen ([[Dihydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), in addition to lactic acid and [[ethanol]]. The reduced end-products of glucose fermentation are [[Enzyme|enzymatically]] formed from [[pyruvate]], via the following mechanisms: lactate by [[Fructose
bisphosphatase|fructose 1-6]] all-[[phosphate]] ([[Fructose 6-phosphate|F6P]]) activated [[lactate dehydrogenase]]; H2 by pyruvate [[ferredoxin]] [[oxidoreductase]] and [[hydrogenase]]; and ethanol via [[NADH]]- and [[NADPH]]-linked [[alcohol dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchaim, U. (1992). FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin – 95: [[Biogas]] process for sustainable development, FAO – [http://www.fao.org Food and Agriculture Organization] of the United Nations, ISSN 1010-1365 (1/9/2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

By its side, the acidogenic activity was found in the early 20th century, but it was not until the mid-1960s that the engineering of phases separation was assumed in order to improve the stability and [[Waste treatment|waste digesters treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, I.E. and Panter, K. (2004). A review of two phase applications to define best practice for the treatment of various waste streams. Anaerobic Digestion 10th World Congress, September  2004. Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In this phase, complex [[molecule]]s ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s) are [[depolymerization|depolymerized]] into soluble compounds by hydrolytic enzymes ([[cellulase]]s, [[hemicellulase]]s, [[amylase]]s, [[lipase]]s and [[protease]]s). The hydrolyzed compounds are fermented into volatile fatty acids (acetate, [[propionate]], [[butyrate]], and [[lactic acid|lactate]]), neutral compounds (ethanol, [[methanol]]), [[ammonia]], hydrogen and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|es}} Cairó, J.J. and París, J.M.

[[Acetogenesis]] is one of the main reactions of this stage, in this, the intermediary [[metabolite]]s produced are metabolized to acetate, hydrogen and carbonic gas by the three main groups of bacteria: 
* [[homoacetogen]]s;
* [[syntrophe]]s; and
* [[sulphoreductor]]s.

For the [[acetic acid]] production are considered three kind of bacteria:
* ''[[Clostridium aceticum]]'';
* ''[[Acetobacter woodii]]''; and
* ''[[Clostridium termoautotrophicum]]''.
Winter y Wolfe, in 1979, demonstrated that ''A. wodii'' in syntrophic association with ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' produce methane and carbon dioxide from [[fructose]], instead of three molecules of acetate.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, J.U. and Wolfe, R.S. (1979). Complete degradation of carbohydrates to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methane by syntrophic cultures of Acetobacterium woodii y Methanosarcina barkeri. Arch. Microbiol. 121: 97 – 102.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Moorella thermoacetica]]'' and ''[[Clostridium formiaceticum]]'' are able to reduce the carbonic gas to acetate, but they do not have [[hydrogenase]]s which inhabilite the hydrogen use, so they can produce three molecules of acetate from fructose. Acetic acid is equally a co-[[metabolite]] of the organic substrates fermentation ([[sugars]], [[glycerol]], [[lactic acid]], etc.) by diverse groups of microorganisms which produce different acids: *[[Propionate|propionic]] bacteria ([[propionate]] + acetate);
* ''[[Clostridium]]'' (butyrate + acetate);
* [[Enterobacteria]] (acetate + lactate); and
* Hetero-fermentative bacteria (acetate, propionate, butyrate, [[valerate]], etc.).

"A blackboard architecture for control" --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where a common knowledge base, the "blackboard", is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge sources, starting with a problem specification and ending with a solution.  Each knowledge source updates the blackboard with a partial solution when its internal constraints match the blackboard state.  In this way, the specialists work together to solve the problem.  The blackboard model was originally designed as a way to handle complex, ill-defined problems, where the solution is the sum of its parts.

==Metaphor==
The following scenario provides a simple metaphor that gives some insight into how a blackboard functions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A group of specialists are seated in a room with a large [[blackboard]]. They work as a team to brainstorm a solution to a problem, using the blackboard as the workplace for cooperatively developing the solution.

The session begins when the problem specifications are written onto the blackboard. The specialists all watch the blackboard, looking for an opportunity to apply their expertise to the developing solution. When someone writes something on the blackboard that allows another specialist to apply their expertise, the second specialist records their contribution on the blackboard, hopefully enabling other specialists to then apply their expertise. This process of adding contributions to the blackboard continues until the problem has been solved.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Components==

A blackboard-system application consists of three major components

# The software specialist modules, which are called '''knowledge sources (KSs)'''. Like the human experts at a blackboard, each knowledge source provides specific expertise needed by the application.  
# The '''blackboard''', a shared repository of problems, partial solutions, suggestions, and contributed information. The blackboard can be thought of as a dynamic "library" of contributions to the current problem that have been recently "published" by other knowledge sources.
# The '''control shell''', which controls the flow of problem-solving activity in the system. Just as the eager human specialists need a moderator to prevent them from trampling each other in a mad dash to grab the chalk, KSs need a mechanism to organize their use in the most effective and coherent fashion. In a blackboard system, this is provided by the control shell.

==Implementations==

Famous examples of early academic blackboard systems are the [[Hearsay (computer program)|Hearsay II]] speech recognition system and [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and Numbo projects.

More recent examples include deployed real-world applications, such as the PLAN component of the Mission Control System for RADARSAT-1,&lt;ref&gt;Corkill, Daniel D. "Countdown to success: Dynamic objects, GBB, and RADARSAT-1." Communications of the ACM 40.5 (1997): 48-58.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Earth]] observation satellite developed by [[Canada]] to monitor environmental changes and Earth's natural resources.

GTXImage CAD software by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110830054943/http://www.gtx.com/ GTX Corporation] was developed in the early 1990s using a set of rulebases and neural networks as specialists operating on a blackboard system.

Adobe Acrobat Capture (now discontinued) used a Blackboard system to decompose and recognize image pages to understand the objects, text, and fonts on the page. This function is currently built into the retail version of Adobe Acrobat as "OCR Text Recognition".  Details of a similar OCR blackboard for [[Farsi]] text are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, H., &amp; Kabir, E. (2009). A blackboard approach towards integrated Farsi OCR system. International Journal of Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), 12(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackboard systems are used routinely in many military [[C4ISTAR]] systems for detecting and tracking objects.

== Criticism ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
Blackboard systems were popular before the [[AI Winter]] and, along with most symbolic AI models, fell out of fashion during that period. Along with other models it was realised that initial successes on [[toy problems]] did not scale well to real problems on the available computers of the time.  Most problems using blackboards are inherently [[NP-hard]], so resist tractable solution by any algorithm in the large size limit. During the same period, [[statistical pattern recognition]] became dominant, most notably via simple [[Hidden Markov Models]] outperforming symbolic approaches such as [[Hearsay-II]] in the domain of speech recognition.

==Recent developments==

Blackboard-like systems have been constructed within modern [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[machine learning]] settings, using agents to add and remove [[Bayesian network]] nodes.  In these 'Bayesian Blackboard' systems, the heuristics can acquire more rigorous probabilistic meanings as proposal and acceptances in [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm|Metropolis Hastings sampling]] though the space of possible structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fox C, Evans M, Pearson M, Prescott T |title=Towards hierarchical blackboard mapping on a whiskered robot |journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1356–66 |year=2011 |url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/18368/1/fox_ras_RAS_corrected.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.robot.2012.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton C.

   |date=May 1997
   |url = http://www.cs.siu.edu/~carver/ps-files/maics97.ps.gz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, using these mappings, existing Metropolis-Hastings samplers over structural spaces may now thus be viewed as forms of blackboard systems even when not named as such by the authors.   Such samplers are commonly found in [[musical transcription]] algorithms for example.&lt;ref&gt;Godsill, Simon, and Manuel Davy. "Bayesian harmonic models for musical pitch estimation and analysis." Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2002 IEEE International Conference on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackboard systems have also been used to build large-scale intelligent systems for the annotation of media content, automating parts of traditional social science research. In this domain, the problem of integrating various AI algorithms into a single intelligent system arises spontaneously, with blackboards providing a way for a collection of distributed, modular [[natural language processing]] algorithms to each annotate the data in a central space, without needing to coordinate their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Flaounas|first=Ilias|last2=Lansdall-Welfare|first2=Thomas|last3=Antonakaki|first3=Panagiota|last4=Cristianini|first4=Nello|date=2014-02-25|title=The Anatomy of a Modular System for Media Content Analysis|eprint=1402.6208|class=cs.MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Bushpig}}
A '''brush hog''' or "bush hog" is a type of [[rotary mower]]. Typically these mowers attach to the back of a [[farm tractor]] using the [[three-point hitch]] and are driven via the [[Power take-off]] (PTO). It has blades that are not rigidly attached to the drive like a [[lawnmower]] blade, but are on hinges so if the blade hits a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[Stack (geology)|stump]], it bounces backward and inward, and then centrifugal force makes it go outwards again.

The rotary blades are not sharpened in the same way as a conventional mower blade. They are usually quite dull so they whack through dense plant growth, whereas a sharp blade often gets stuck or slowed down. The blades are very heavy, up to an inch thick, so the centrifugal force pulling out is stronger than the forces of the [[vegetation]] bouncing in. They are made of heat treated [[high carbon steel]] that can withstand strikes with hard objects such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and stones.

==Types of brush hog==
Two archetypes of this type of mower are the '''Bush Hog''' which is made by Bush Hog, Inc. [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], [[Alabama]] and the Flex-Wing by '''RhinoAg''' [[Gibson City, Illinois|Gibson City]], [[Illinois]]. The formal name for this type of implement is a rotary cutter or [[rotary mower]], although it differs from mowers in that it does not cut with a sharp blade, but rather severs with an intentionally very dull wedge-like blade.

Several other manufacturers make these types of mowers including: 
*Bush-Whacker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bush-whacker.com|title=The Bush-Whacker web site}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*DR Power Equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drpower.com/power-equipment/field-brush-mowers/|title=DR Power Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*King Kutter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingkutter.com|title=King Kutter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Land Pride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landpride.com|title=Land Pride}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*RhinoAg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhinoag.com|title=inventor of the Flex-Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Woods Equipment, inventor of the Batwing


There are two types of attachment for a rotary mower, either using the [[three-point hitch]] or via a [[draw bar]]. The height of the cut on models attached on the [[three-point hitch]] is adjusted using the hitch control lever. This adjusts the height of the front of mower. For more radical height adjustment the rear wheel can also be adjusted. Typically the mowers in this category range from {{convert|3.3|to|22|ft|m|0}} mowing widths.

A rotary mower that applies chemical while cutting was patented by Tom Burch of Boone, N.C and was later sold to Diamond Mowers Inc. of Sioux Falls, SD under the name [[Wet Blade]][https://web.archive.org/web/20080715053746/http://www.diamondmowers.com/Products/WetBlade.cfm].

On draw bar models the height of the cut is determined using [[hydraulic rams]] on the mower itself; this requires remote hydraulics on the tractor. These mowers in this category range from {{convert|3.3|to|22|ft|m|0}} mowing width. Draw bar mowers which are able to mow larger widths up to {{convert|20|ft|0}} are available. These are multi-spindle and hinged so that the side wings can move over varied terrain. Also these wings can be folded up into a vertical position to reduce width for transport on roadways.

==Safety==
The blades on a rotary cutter can have top speeds of over {{convert|150|mph}}. Therefore the [[kinetic energy]] enables the blades to cut through saplings and small trees up to several inches/centimetres in diameter. Consequently, these mowers can be very dangerous and contact with the blades would cause severe bodily injury or death.

These cutters also pose a thrown object hazard. Objects such as rocks, stones and roadside debris can be thrown in excess of {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}}.

==Sizing==
Larger rotary cutters require more powerful tractors to effectively operate. Tractor dealers can recommend the right size brush hog for any of their tractors, or tractor and brush hog sizing charts are available&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tractordata.com/articles/technical/tractor-mower.html Tractor and brush hog sizing chart], tractordata.com&lt;/ref&gt; on the Internet. Calculators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tractordata.com/articles/technical/tractor-mower.html Brush hog mowing calculator], tractordata.com&lt;/ref&gt; used to estimate the time required to mow different size areas with different size cutters are also available and can be used to help decide which brush hog is the best investment for different situations.

'''Business performance management''' is a set of [[performance management]] and analytic processes that enables the [[management]] of an [[organization's performance]] to achieve one or more pre-selected goals. Synonyms for "business performance management" include '''"corporate performance management (CPM)"'''&lt;ref&gt;"Introducing the CPM Suites Magic Quadrant", Lee Geishecker and [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2 October 2002, www.gartner.com, M-17-4718&lt;/ref&gt; and '''"enterprise performance management"'''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Business performance management is contained within approaches to [[business process management]].&lt;ref&gt;vom Brocke, J. &amp; Rosemann, M. (2010), [http://www.bpm-handbook.com Handbook on Business Process Management: Strategic Alignment, Governance, People and Culture] (International Handbooks on Information Systems). Berlin: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Business performance management has three main activities:
# selection of goals
# [[data consolidation|consolidation]] of measurement information relevant to an organization’s progress against these goals
# interventions made by managers in light of this information with a view to improving future performance against these goals

Although presented here sequentially, typically all three activities will run concurrently, with interventions by managers affecting the choice of goals, the measurement information monitored, and the activities being undertaken by the organization.

Because business performance management activities in large organizations often involve the collection and reporting of large volumes of data, many software vendors, particularly those offering [[business intelligence]] tools, market products intended to assist in this process. As a result of this marketing effort, business performance management is often incorrectly understood as an activity that necessarily relies on software systems to work, and many definitions of business performance management explicitly suggest software as being a definitive component of the approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 BPM Mag, What is BPM?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212062646/http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 |date=December 12, 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, business performance management has been strongly influenced by the rise of the [[Balanced Scorecard|balanced scorecard]] framework. It is common for managers to use the balanced scorecard framework to clarify the goals of an organization, to identify how to track them, and to structure the mechanisms by which interventions will be triggered. These steps are the same as those that are found in BPM, and as a result, balanced scorecard is often used as the basis for business performance management activity with organizations.{{Citation needed|date = September 2010}}

{{as of | 2009 | alt = In the past}}, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations, transform these strategies into actionable metrics, and use analytics to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give insight into decision-making.

== History ==
Reference to non-[[business]] performance management occurs{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]''. Sun Tzu claims that to succeed in war, one should have full knowledge of one's own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of one's enemies. Lack of either set of knowledge might result in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/art-of-war/attack-by-stratagem/zh?en=on#n20929  paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels between the challenges in business and those of war include{{Citation needed | date=January 2009}}:

* collecting data - both internal and external
* discerning patterns and meaning in the data (analyzing)
* responding to the resultant information

Prior to the start of the [[Information Age]] in the late 20th century, businesses sometimes took the trouble to laboriously collect data from non-automated sources. As they lacked computing resources to properly analyze the data, they often made commercial decisions primarily on the basis of [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

As businesses started automating more and more systems, more and more data became available. However, collection often remained a challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for data exchange or due to incompatibilities between systems. Reports on the data gathered sometimes took months to generate. Such reports allowed informed long-term strategic decision-making. However, short-term tactical decision-making often continued to rely on intuition.

In 1989 [[Howard Dresner]], a research analyst at [[Gartner]], popularized "[[business intelligence]]" (BI) as an umbrella term to describe a set of concepts and methods to improve business decision-making by using fact-based support systems. Performance management builds on a foundation of BI, but marries it to the planning-and-control cycle of the enterprise with enterprise planning, consolidation, and modeling capabilities.

Increasing standards, automation, and technologies have led to vast amounts of data becoming available. [[Data warehouse]] technologies have allowed the building of repositories to store this data. Improved [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] and [[enterprise application integration]] tools have increased the timely collecting of data. [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] reporting technologies have allowed faster generation of new reports which analyze the data. {{As of | 2010}}, business intelligence has become the art of sieving through large amounts of data, extracting useful information and turning that information into actionable knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Definition and scope ==
Business performance management consists of a set of management and analytic processes, supported by technology, that enable businesses to define strategic goals and then measure and manage performance against those goals. Core business performance management processes include [[Financial planning (business)|financial planning]], operational planning, business modeling, consolidation and reporting, analysis, and monitoring of [[key performance indicator]]s linked to strategy.

Business performance management involves [[data consolidation|consolidation of data]] from various sources, querying, and analysis of the data, and putting the results into practice.

== Frameworks ==
Various frameworks for implementing business performance management exist. The discipline gives companies a top-down framework by which to align planning and execution, strategy and tactics, and [[business-unit]] and enterprise objectives. Reactions may include the [[Six Sigma]] strategy, [[balanced scorecard]], [[activity-based costing]] (ABC), [[OKR | Objectives and Key Results]] (OKR), [[Total Quality Management]], [[Economic value added|economic value-add]], [[integrated strategic measurement]] and [[Theory of Constraints]].

== Metrics and key performance indicators ==
Some of the areas from which bank management may gain knowledge by using business performance management include:

* customer-related numbers:
** new customers acquired
** status of existing customers
** attrition of customers (including breakup by reason for attrition)
* turnover generated by segments of the customers - possibly using demographic filters
* outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment - possibly using demographic filters
* collection of bad debts within customer relationships
* [[demographic analysis]] of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections and pending numbers
* delinquency analysis of customers behind on payments
* [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability
* [[marketing campaign|campaign]] management
* [[Real time (media)|real-time]] [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]] on key operational metrics
** [[overall equipment effectiveness]]
* [[clickstream]] analysis on a website
* key product portfolio trackers
* [[marketing channel|marketing-channel]] analysis
* [[sales]]-data analysis by product segments
* [[callcenter]] metrics

Though the above list describes what a bank might monitor, it could refer to a telephone company or to a similar service-sector company.

Items of generic importance include:

# consistent and correct KPI-related data providing insights into operational aspects of a company
# timely availability of KPI-related data
# KPIs designed to directly reflect the efficiency and effectiveness of a business
# information presented in a format which aids decision-making for management and decision-makers
# ability to discern patterns or trends from organized information

Business performance management integrates the company's processes with [[customer relationship management|CRM]] or {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]. Companies should become better able to gauge [[customer satisfaction]], control customer trends and influence shareholder value.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Application software types==
People working in business intelligence have developed tools that ease the work of business performance management, especially when the business-intelligence task involves gathering and analyzing large amounts of unstructured [[data]].

Tool categories commonly used for business performance management include:

* [[MOLAP]] &amp;mdash; Multidimensional online analytical processing, sometimes simply called "analytics" (based on [[dimensional analysis]] and the so-called "hypercube" or "cube")
* [[Balanced scorecard|scorecarding]], [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboarding]] and [[data visualization]]
* [[data warehouse]]s
* [[document warehouse]]s
* [[text mining]]
* DM &amp;mdash; [[data mining]]
&lt;!--  * BPM — Business performance management --&gt;
* BPO &amp;mdash; business performance optimization
* EPM &amp;mdash; [[enterprise performance management]]
* EIS &amp;mdash; [[executive information system]]s
* DSS &amp;mdash; [[decision support system]]s
* MIS &amp;mdash; [[management information system]]s
* SEMS &amp;mdash; [[strategic enterprise management]] software
* EOI &amp;mdash; [[Operational intelligence]] Enterprise Operational Intelligence Software

== Design and implementation ==
Questions asked when implementing a business performance management program include:

* '''Goal-alignment queries'''
:Determine the short- and medium-term purpose of the program. What strategic goal(s) of the organization will the program address? What organizational mission/vision does it relate to? A hypothesis needs to be crafted that details how this initiative will eventually improve results / performance (i.e. a [[strategy map]]).
* '''Baseline queries'''
:Assess current information-gathering competency. Does the organization have the capability to monitor important sources of information? What data is being collected and how is it being stored? What are the statistical parameters of this data, e.g., how much random variation does it contain? Is this being measured?
* '''Cost and risk queries'''
:Estimate the financial consequences of a new BI initiative. Assess the cost of the present operations and the increase in costs associated with the BPM initiative. What is the risk that the initiative will fail? This risk assessment should be converted into a financial metric and included in the planning.
* '''Customer and stakeholder queries'''
:Determine who will benefit from the initiative and who will pay. Who has a stake in the current procedure? What kinds of customers / stakeholders will benefit directly from this initiative? Who will benefit indirectly? What quantitative / qualitative benefits follow? Is the specified initiative the best or only way to increase satisfaction for all kinds of customers? How will customer benefits be monitored? What about employees, shareholders, and distribution channel members?
* '''Metrics-related queries'''
:Information requirements need [[operationalization]] into clearly defined metrics. Decide which metrics to use for each piece of information being gathered. Are these the best metrics and why? How many metrics need to be tracked? If this is a large number (it usually is), what kind of system can track them? Are the metrics standardized, so they can be [[benchmarking|benchmarked]] against performance in other organizations? What are the industry standard metrics available?
* '''Measurement methodology-related queries'''
:Establish a methodology or a procedure to determine the best (or acceptable) way of measuring the required metrics. How frequently will data be collected? Are there any industry standards for this? Is this the best way to do the measurements? How do we know that?
* '''Results-related queries'''
:Monitor the BPM program to ensure that it meets objectives. The program itself may require adjusting. The program should be tested for accuracy, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]]. How can it be demonstrated that the BI initiative, and not something else, contributed to a change in results? How much of the change was probably random?

[[File:Cascade Impactor.png|thumb|Diagram of the apparatus]]
A '''cascade impactor''' measures the reach range of a particulate substance as it moves through an opening with the use of [[aerosol]].  Cascade impactors are strictly measurement-related devices. In addition to measuring the range of substances moved through an opening by aerosol, the impactor can also be used to determine the particle size of the distributed substance. A cascade impactor collects its samples in a graduated manner. This allows the user to identify the sizes of the substance particles as the particles are distributed from the propellant aerosol source.When the aerosol substance is distributed into the cascade impactor, the substance enters a series of discs designed to collect solids and different particulate matter. The substance is thus collected as it passes through the disc series. Each disc is set in sequence with both the prior and the previous disc. The size of the discs is graduated as well, to properly determine the size of the particulate matter at each stage of the impactor.

An impactor is a device that classifies particles present in a sample of air or gas into known size ranges. It does this by drawing the air sample through a cascade of progressively finer nozzles. The air jets from these nozzles impact on plane sampling surfaces and each stage collects finer particles than its predecessor. The samples may be analysed under the microscope or by any method of chemical analysis that may be suitable for obtaining the mass of material of interest on each stage, e.g. [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|atomic absorption]] or [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS).

All cascade impactors have certain design features in common. By using suitable pumps, jet dimensions can be decreased to the point where the velocity is close to that of sound, enabling particles down to about 0.25&amp;nbsp;µm to be impacted.

[[File:DuctileIronConcreteLined.jpg|thumb|right|Section of DICL pipe (ductile iron concrete lined), commonly used for utility water mains, showing iron casing, concrete lining, and textured polymer protective coatings on the inner and outer surfaces.]]

'''Cement-mortar lined ductile iron pipe''' is a [[ductile iron pipe]] with [[cement]] lining on the inside surface, and is commonly used for [[water]] distribution.

Cement-mortar lined ductile iron pipe is governed by standards set forth by DIPRA (Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association), and was first used in 1922 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

Ductile Iron is commonly used in place of [[cast iron]] pipe for fluid distribution systems, the idea of lining the formerly cast iron and currently ductile iron was put into practice for the first time in Charleston, South Carolina in 1922. The purpose of installing a cement/mortar lining to the interior wall of the pipe is to reduce the process of tuberculation inside the pipe network. The cement/mortar lining provides an area of high [[pH]] near the pipe wall and provides a barrier between the water and the pipe, reducing its susceptibility to [[corrosion]].

[[File:Composite monitor.JPG|right|thumb|300px|This is an early example of a composite monitor with color graphics marketed for home use.]]
A '''composite monitor''' is any [[analog signal|analog]] video display that receives input in the form of an analog [[composite video]] signal to a defined specification. A composite video signal encodes all information on a single conductor; a composite [[Electrical cable|cable]] has a single live conductor plus earth. Other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced [[Interface (computing)#Hardware interfaces|interfaces]] and connectors giving a better picture, including analog [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], and digital [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]], and [[DisplayPort]]; and [[television]] (TV) receivers which are self-contained, receiving and displaying video [[radio frequency|RF]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]] received with an internal  [[tuner (radio)|tuner]]. Video monitors are used for displaying [[Computer monitor|computer output]], [[closed-circuit television]] (e.g. security cameras) and other applications requiring a two-dimensional monochrome or colour image.

==Inputs==
Composite monitors usually use [[RCA connector|RCA jack]]s or [[BNC connector]]s for video input.  Earlier equipment (1970s) often used [[UHF connector]]s. Typically simple composite monitors give a picture inferior to other interfaces.

In principle a monitor can have one or several of multiple types of input, including composite—in addition to composite monitors as such, many monitors accept composite input among other standards. In practice computer monitors ceased to support composite input as other interfaces became predominant.

A composite monitor must have a two-dimensional approximately flat display device with circuitry to accept a composite signal with picture and synchronisation information, process it into monochrome [[chrominance]] and [[luminance]], or the red, green, and blue of [[RGB]], plus synchronisation pulses, and display it on a screen, which was predominantly a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] until the 21st century, and then a thin panel using [[LCD]] or other technology.

A critical factor in the quality of this display is the type of encoding used in the TV camera to combine the signal together and the decoding used in the monitor to separate the signals back to RGB for display. Composite monitors can be very high quality, with professional broadcast reference displays costing [[US$]]10k-$15k as of 2000. [[Comb filter]]s are frequently used to improve the quality of a composite monitor, and devices using [http://www.google.com/search?q=Faroudja Faroudja] decoders are frequently considered the pinnacle of composite displays.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Early innovations of this technology==
Originally, these monitors were used for commercial studios. Composite video first saw home use for dubbing tapes on [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. Early computers, both commercial and amateur, mostly used [[teleprinter]]s for output; simple home models might simply display an array of lights to be interpreted as binary information. Later the concept of the [[TV Typewriter]] was born, effectively the video monitor used for digital information; this was implemented as dedicated monitors and as interfaces to the television receivers present in many homes. Many computers incorporated a display. From the late 1970s stand-alone composite monitors came into use, including by the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC 20]]/[[Commodore 64|64]]/[[Commodore 128|128]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari]],  the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] card, some [[IBM PC compatible|computers compatible with it]], and other home and business computers of the 1980s. These computers had composite video outputs, and sometimes composite monitors bundled with the systems. Some computer companies separately sold their own composite monitors for use with their computers.

===Composite video and game consoles===
During the same time period, home game consoles chose to stick with [[RF modulator|RF modulation]] since many people had color televisions without composite video inputs. However, in 1985, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] was released and was the first game console to feature direct composite outputs. Although the redesigned NES ([[Nintendo Entertainment System (Model NES-101)|NES 2]]) lacked these outputs, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and nearly all consoles made since have included the direct composite outputs. From the fifth generation systems (such as the [[Sony PlayStation]] and the [[Nintendo 64]]) onward, many consoles used these outputs as the primary means of connecting to the television, requiring a separate adapter for use on televisions lacking composite inputs. As of today, some people still use stand-alone composite monitors with modern game consoles even with the advent of televisions with a tuner and composite inputs combined.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Composite input to non-composite device==
When a composite monitor is not available, a device requiring one can use an [[RF modulator]] to encode a composite output onto a RF signal which can be received by an analog television, available in many homes until the [[digital switchover]].

Devices are available to convert from composite to other standards such as analog VGA or digital HDMI; such devices may be called [[upscaler]]s or [[scan converter]]s, although not all devices with these names will handle composite input. Price and quality vary. A converter with electronics is necessary; a simple cable will not do the job.

With a whole market full of all sorts of solutions to convert composite (or its related standard [[S-video]]) to all sorts of other video transmission standards, it has even offered opportunities to [[repurposing|repurpose]] non-composite monitors for composite video input, in which composite monitors themselves have also been repurposed for other applications of their own.

==Commercial use of composite monitors==
* [[Television studio]]s use stand-alone composite [[video monitor]]s to check and judge their output picture quality. These are usually high-end professional broadcast monitors that are used to view the output of [[professional video camera]]s, [[video tape recorder|VTR]]s, [[character generator]]s, [[telecine]]s and [[Direct to disk recording#Video recording|DDRs]]. They can also be used when new video devices are being tested. Most commercial composite monitors have no audio support or speakers, as the audio system is processed through high-quality audio equipment.
* Stand-alone composite monitors are commonly used for [[closed-circuit television]] and video surveillance.

Some monitors used in video surveillance give a monochrome picture.

==Common features==
* [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo sound]]
* TV tuner
* Front AV inputs
* [[S-Video]] input
* [[Closed captioning]]

==Other video standards==
Other video standards include

* [[RGB color model|RGB]] video, 3 signals, red, green and blue, with synchronisation information, on three wires from a computer or other source
* [[Component Video]], 3 signals such as [[YUV]] or Y, B-Y, R-Y
* [[S-Video]], 2 signals, which have the brightness (luminance) information on one cable and the color information (chrominance) on another. Most monitors with S-Video inputs also support composite inputs
* Several [[digital video]] standards, including DVI and HDMI
* VGA, an analog standard used to display digital signals
Monitors sometimes support several standards. Absence of certain video inputs may require purchase of signal adapters to reuse  electronics that are otherwise incompatible.

An '''ESR meter''' is a two-terminal [[electronics|electronic]] [[measuring instrument]] designed and used primarily to measure the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) of real [[capacitor]]s; usually without the need to disconnect the capacitor from the circuit it is connected to. Other types of meters used for routine servicing, including normal [[capacitance meter]]s, cannot be used to measure a capacitor's ESR, although combined meters are available which measure both ESR and out-of-circuit capacitance. A standard ([[Direct current|DC]]) milliohmmeter or multimeter cannot be used to measure ESR, because a steady [[direct current]] cannot be passed through the capacitor.
Most ESR meters can also be used to measure non-inductive low-value resistances, whether or not associated with a capacitor; this leads to a number of additional applications described below.

==Need for ESR measurement==
Aluminium [[electrolytic capacitor]]s have a relatively high ESR that increases with age, heat, and [[ripple current]]; this can cause the equipment using them to malfunction. In older equipment, this tended to cause hum and degraded operation; modern equipment, in particular [[switch-mode power supplies]], is very sensitive to ESR, and a capacitor with high ESR can cause equipment to malfunction or cause permanent damage requiring repair, typically by causing power supply voltages to become excessively high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=86990 Example of high-ESR capacitors causing voltages to rise in a circuit and destroy components.] High ESR capacitors cause "5V dropping quite low and causing every other voltage to go sky high (and doing things like frying the HDD with upwards of 15V rather than 12V, and frying the tuning agc transistor with upwards of 36V instead of 30V)."&lt;/ref&gt; Electrolytic capacitors are, nevertheless, very often used because they are inexpensive and have a very high capacitance per unit volume or weight; typically, these capacitors have capacitance from about one [[microfarad]] to tens of thousands of microfarads.

Capacitors with faults leading to high ESR often overheat and thereafter bulge and leak as the electrolyte chemicals decompose into gases, making them somewhat easy to identify visually; however, capacitors that appear visually perfect may still have high ESR, detectable only by measurement.

Precise measurement of ESR is rarely necessary, and any usable meter is adequate for troubleshooting. When precision is required, measurements must be taken under appropriately specified conditions, because ESR varies with frequency, applied voltage, and temperature. A general-purpose ESR meter operating with a fixed frequency and waveform will usually be unsuitable for precise laboratory measurements.

==Methods of ESR measurement==
Measuring ESR can be done by applying an [[alternating current|alternating voltage]] at a frequency at which the capacitor's [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] is negligible, in a [[voltage divider]] configuration.
It is easy to check ESR well enough for troubleshooting by using an improvised ESR meter comprising a simple [[waveform generator|square-wave generator]] and [[oscilloscope]], or a sinewave generator of a few tens of kilohertz and a [[voltmeter|AC voltmeter]], using a known good capacitor for comparison, or by using a little mathematics.&lt;ref name=c99&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~bobpar/99_Cent_ESR.pdf |title=99 cent ESR test adapter |author=Stephen M. Powell |year=2000 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional ESR meter is more convenient for checking multiple capacitors in rapid succession.  
A standard [[Bridge circuit|measurement bridge]], and many [[LCR meter|LCR]] and [[Q meter]]s, can also measure ESR accurately, in addition to many other circuit parameters. The dedicated ESR meter is a relatively inexpensive special-purpose instrument of modest accuracy, used mainly to identify capacitors with unacceptably large ESR and sometimes to measure other low resistances; measurements of other parameters cannot be made.

==Principles of ESR meter operation==

Most ESR meters work by discharging a real electrolytic capacitor (more or less equivalent to an ideal capacitor in series with an unwanted resistance, the ESR) and passing an [[electric current]] through it for a short time, too short for it to charge appreciably. This will produce a [[volt]]age across the device equal to the product of the current and the ESR plus a negligible contribution from a small charge in the capacitor; this voltage is measured and its value divided by the current (i.e., the ESR) shown in ohms or milliohms on a [[digital display]] or by the position of a pointer on a scale. The process is repeated tens or hundreds of [[kilohertz|thousands of times a second]].

Alternatively an [[alternating current]] at a frequency high enough that the capacitor's [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] is much less than the ESR can be used. Circuit parameters are usually chosen to give meaningful results for capacitance from about one microfarad up, a range that covers typical aluminium capacitors whose ESR tends to become unacceptably high.

==Interpretation of readings==
An acceptable ESR value depends upon capacitance (larger capacitors usually have lower ESR), and may be read from a table of "typical" values, or compared with a new component. In principle, the capacitor manufacturer's upper limit specification for ESR can be looked up in a datasheet, but this is usually unnecessary. When a capacitor whose ESR is critical degrades, power dissipation as the ESR increases usually causes a rapid and large runaway increase, so [[go/no-go]] measurement is usually good enough as the ESR often rapidly moves from a clearly acceptable to a clearly unacceptable level; an ESR of over a few ohms (less for a large capacitor) is unacceptable.

In a practical circuit, the ESR will be much lower than any other resistance in parallel with the capacitor, so it is not necessary to disconnect the component, and an in-circuit measurement can be made. Practical ESR meters use a voltage too low to switch on any [[semiconductor junction]]s that may be present in the circuit;  this might present a low "on" impedance that would interfere with measurements.

==Limitations==
* An ESR meter does not measure the [[capacitance]] of a capacitor; the capacitor must be disconnected from the circuit and measured with a [[capacitance meter]] (or a multimeter with this capability). Excessive ESR is far more likely to be an identifiable problem with aluminium electrolytics rather than out-of-tolerance capacitance, which is rare in capacitors with acceptable ESR.
* A faulty short-circuited capacitor will incorrectly be identified by an ESR meter as having ideally low ESR, but an ohmmeter or multimeter can easily detect this case, which is much rarer in practice than high ESR. It is possible to connect the [[test probe]]s to an ESR meter and ohmmeter in [[parallel circuit|parallel]] to check for both shorts and ESR in one operation; some meters both measure ESR and detect short-circuits.
* ESR may depend upon operating conditions (mainly applied voltage, temperature); a capacitor which has excessive ESR at [[operating temperature]] and voltage may test as good if measured cold and unpowered. Some circuit faults due to such intermittent capacitors can be identified by using [[freeze spray]]; if cooling the capacitor restores correct operation, it is faulty.
* An ESR meter can be damaged by connection to a capacitor with significant voltage across it, either because of [[dielectric relaxation|residual stored charge]] or in a live circuit. Protective diodes across the input will minimise this risk, but then the meter can no longer be used to measure battery internal resistance.
* When an ESR meter is used as a milliohmmeter, any significant [[inductance]] present between the test probes will make measurements meaningless. For example, an ESR meter is unsuitable for measuring resistance in [[transformer]] windings because of their inductive characteristics. This effect is significant enough that test probes with coiled cords should not be used due to their inductance.

==Other uses of ESR meters==

An ESR meter is more accurately described as a pulsed or high-frequency AC milliohmmeter (depending upon type), and it can be used to measure any low resistance. Depending upon the exact circuit used, it may also be used to measure the [[internal resistance]] of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] (many batteries end their useful life largely due to increased internal resistance, rather than low [[Electromotive force|EMF]]. However, an ESR meter with back-to-back protective diodes across its input cannot be used to measure batteries), [[Electrical contact|contact]] resistance of [[switch]]es, the resistance of sections of [[printed circuit board|printed circuit]] (PCB) track, etc.

While there are specialised instruments to detect short-circuits between adjacent PCB tracks, an ESR meter is useful because it can measure low resistances while injecting a voltage too low to confuse readings by switching on semiconductor junctions in the circuit. An ESR meter can be used to find short-circuits, even finding which of a group of capacitors or transistors connected in [[parallel circuit|parallel]] by printed circuit tracks or wires is short-circuited. Many conventional [[ohmmeter]]s and [[multimeter]]s are not usable for very low resistances, and those that are often use too high a voltage, risking damage to the circuit being tested.

[[Test probe#Tweezer probes|Tweezer probes]] are useful when test points are closely spaced, such as in equipment made with [[surface mount technology]]. The tweezer probes can be held in one hand, leaving the other hand free to steady or manipulate the equipment being tested.

==History==

The first major device to measure in-circuit ESR was based on Carl W. Vette's {{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4216424 |title=US Patent #4216424: Method and apparatus for testing electrolytic capacitors}}&lt;ref name="cwvPatent"&gt;Carl W. Vette (1978). [http://www.google.com/patents/US4216424 "US Patent #4216424: Method and apparatus for testing electrolytic capacitors "]&lt;/ref&gt; under the Creative Electronics brand. The Creative Electronics ESR meter was the primary device many used for the duration of the patent. The patent expired in 1998, when many other companies entered the market.

Additional patents extended the original work, including John G. Bachman's 2001 {{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US6677764 |title=US Patent #6677764: System for protecting electronic test equipment from charged capacitors}} &lt;ref name="jgbPatent"&gt;John G. Bachman (2001). [https://www.google.com/patents/US6677764 "US Patent #6677764: System for protecting electronic test equipment from charged capacitors"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of ecological goods include [[Air pollution|clean air]], and abundant [[fresh water]]. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of [[public goods]].

The concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore [[land use]] managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.

==Markets==
A market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners.  Some believe that [[public land]]s alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the "polluter pays" to the "beneficiary pays". 

Financial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&amp;S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, [[market-based instruments]], and tax rebates.

==Biodiversity and EGS==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423003943/http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx Millennium Ecosystem Assessment] project, [[biodiversity]] is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services.  Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as [[biological control]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza|Costanza, R.]], d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Naeem, S., O'Neill, R., Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P. &amp; van den Belt, M. (1997). The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''387''':253-260&lt;/ref&gt;  However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing.  

==Policy tools==
The following policy tools can be used to ensure production of ecological goods and services:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)|Agriculture, Pêcheries et Alimentation]], Quebec. (2005). Remuneration for ecological goods and services produced by agriculture: Elements for a Quebec analysis.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in French)

*Regulations
*Cross compliance programs
*Environmental marketing schemes (e.g. [[ecolabel|eco-labeling]])
*Voluntary participation programs
*Market based approaches (e.g. offset credits{{Clarify|date=January 2012}})
*One time direct payments
*Ongoing direct payments

[[File:Electric Fireplace.jpg|thumb|right|An electric fireplace.]]
An '''electric fireplace''' is an [[electric heater]] that mimics a [[fireplace]] burning [[coal]], [[wood fuel|wood]], or [[natural gas]]. Electric fireplaces are often placed in conventional fireplaces, which can then no longer be used for conventional fires. They plug into the wall, and can run on a "flame only" setting, or can be used as a heater, typically consuming 1.4-1.6&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;!-- This was given in BTU, but that is a unit of energy not power.  The "convert" template incorrectly translated it into kJ.--&gt;, that can heat a {{convert|400|sqft|abbr=on}} room.

==History==
The electric fire was invented in 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF ELECTRIC APPLIANCES|url=http://www.localhistories.org/electric.html|publisher=Localhistories.org|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became popular in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heating the house with electric fires in the 1940s and 1950s|url=http://www.1900s.org.uk/1940s50s-heating-elec.htm|publisher=1900s.org.uk|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for electrical "flame effects" have been around since at least 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4253045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial electric fireplace techniques include the Optiflame, introduced in 1988 by [[Dimplex]].

Dimplex claims to have produced the first electric fireplace with a "realistic" wood-burning flame effect in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dimplex |url=http://www1.dimplex.com/aboutdimplex.aspx |publisher=[[Dimplex]] |accessdate=29 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120185409/http://www1.dimplex.com/aboutdimplex.aspx |archivedate=January 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear what specific technique is being referred to, although it may be {{US Patent|5642580}}.

In 2008 [[Dimplex]] launched the Opti-myst effect which simulates both flames and smoke.

In 2013 [[Dimplex]] launched the Opti-V effect which combines realistic flickering flames with three dimensional LED logs that sporadically sparks and  an audio element of crackling logs.

==Advantages compared to traditional fireplaces==
Advantages of electric fireplaces are that they:
* do not require [[chimney]]s;
* are often portable;
* do not require remodeling to install.
* are not just more economical, they are also more convenient and safer to use.
* do not require the maintenance needed for wood burning or gas fireplaces.

==Disadvantages compared to traditional fireplaces==
Disadvantages of electric fireplaces are that they:
* are often less efficient{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}, because of the inefficiency in generating heat{{Dubious|date=November 2013}};
* cost more to buy than typical electric heaters;
* are not as realistic as real flames, even in gas fireplaces;
* cannot be exposed to weather.

[[File:Arduino Duemilanove 2009b.jpg|thumb|A microcontroller development board ([[Arduino]] Duemilanove), which could be used for [[Embedded system|embedded systems development]].]]

'''Electrical/Electronics engineering technology''' ('''EET''') is an [[engineering technology]] field that implements and applies the principles of [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical Engineering Technology|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/engtech/disciplines/elecet.htm|work=Engineering Technology Overview|publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like electrical engineering, EET deals with the "design, application, installation, manufacturing, operation or maintenance of electrical/electronic(s) systems."&lt;ref name=Program_Criteria&gt;{{cite web | title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf | work=Program Criteria | pages=13–14 | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, EET is a specialized discipline that has more focus on application, theory, and applied design, and implementation, while electrical engineering may focus more of a generalized emphasis on theory and conceptual design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Engineering vs. Engineering Technology  | url =http://www.abet.org/engineering-vs-engineering-technology/ | work=Curricular Focus | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical/Electronic engineering technology is the largest branch of engineering technology and includes a diverse range of sub-disciplines, such as applied design, [[electronics]], [[embedded system]]s, [[control system]]s, [[instrumentation]], [[telecommunication]]s, and [[Power engineering|power systems]].

==Education==

===Accreditation===
The [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) is the recognized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programmatic Accrediting Organizations|url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/2010_2011_Directory_of_CHEA_Recognized_Organizations.pdf|work=Directory of CHEA-Recognized Organizations|publisher=[[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization for accrediting both undergraduate engineering and engineering technology programs in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is ABET? |work=General Information (ABET) |url=http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/curr_abet.asp#generalinfo |publisher=VaNTH ERC |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005031742/http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/curr_abet.asp |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coursework===
EET curricula can vary widely by institution type, degree type, program objective, and expected student outcome. Each year, however, ABET publishes a set of minimum criteria that a given EET program (either associate degree or bachelor's degree) must meet in order to maintain its ABET accreditation. These criteria may be classified as either general criteria, which apply to all ABET accredited programs, or as program criteria, which apply to discipline-specific criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf | work=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs | page=1 | publisher=[[ABET]] | accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Associate degree====

Associate degree programs emphasize the practical field knowledge that is needed to maintain or troubleshoot existing electrical/electronic systems or to build and test new design prototypes.

Discipline-specific program outcomes include the application of circuit analysis and design, analog and digital electronics, computer programming, associated software, and relevant engineering standards

Coursework must be at a minimum [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]] based.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

====Bachelor's degree====

Bachelor’s degree programs emphasize the analysis, design, and implementation of electrical/electronic systems. Some programs may focus on a specific sub-discipline, such as [[control system]]s or [[communications system]]s, while others may take a broader approach, introducing the student to several different sub-disciplines.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

Math to [[differential equation]]s is a minimum requirement for ABET accredited bachelor’s level EET degrees. In addition, graduates must demonstrate an understanding of basic project management skills.&lt;ref name="Program_Criteria" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Commerce]] classifies the bachelor of science in electrical engineering technology (BSEET) as a [[STEM fields|STEM]] undergraduate engineering degree field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs, 2012 - 2013  | url =http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/documents/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf | work=STEM: Good Jobs Now and for the Future | page=2,9 | author=Langdon | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]] | accessdate=20 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate BSEET degree are qualified to sit-in for the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FE Requirements | url=http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/| work= | page= | publisher=NCEES | accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those BSEETs who have already gained at least four years’ post-college experience are qualified to sit-in for the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|Professional Engineer exam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PE Requirements | url=http://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/| work= | page= | publisher=NCEES | accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their [[licensure]] in the United States. The importance of the licensing board requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exam Requirements |url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensing_boards.php?boardID=1004&amp;show=examRequirements |work= |page= |publisher=NCEES |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523093147/http://www.ncees.org/Licensing_boards.php?boardID=1004&amp;show=examRequirements |archivedate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depend upon location, level of education, required years of experience, and the BSEETs sub-discipline are the passageways for becoming a licensed engineer. The knowledge obtained by a TAC/ABET accredited program is one pathway that may help students prepare for and pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|FE]]/[[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|PE]] exam. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = June 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

'''EMML''', or '''Enterprise Mashup Markup Language''', is an [[XML]] [[markup language]] for creating enterprise [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]], which are software applications that consume and mash data from variety of sources, often performing logical or mathematical operations as well as presenting data. Mashed data produced by enterprise mashups are presented in graphical user interfaces as mashlets, widgets, or gadgets. EMML can also be{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} considered a declarative mashup [[domain-specific language]] (DSL). A mashup DSL eliminates the need for complex, time-consuming, and repeatable procedural programming logic to create enterprise mashups. EMML also provides a declarative language for creating visual tools for enterprise mashups.  

The primary benefits of EMML are mashup design portability and interoperability of mashup solutions. These benefits are expected to accelerate the adoption of enterprise mashups by creating transferable skills for software developers and reducing [[vendor lock-in]]. The introduction of EMML is expected to help accelerate the trend toward the integration of Web-based applications and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Where Is The Future of SOA Headed? Where The Web Goes | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/enterprise/2009/09/where_is_soa_heading_where_the.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bank of America]] was a high-profile early supporter of EMML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Bank of America Joined the Open Mashup Alliance | url = http://adtmag.com/articles/2009/09/25/why-bank-of-america-joined-open-mashup-alliance.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent early supporters included [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Capgemini]], [[Adobe Systems]], and [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="blogs.zdnet.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Enterprise mashup proponents start organizing | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=2972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EMML history==
Raj Krishnamurthy (chief architect at JackBe Corporation) and Deepak Alur (VP engineering at JackBe Corporation) started working on EMML in 2006. Their objective was to enable user-oriented and user-enabled mashups by creating what was then a new type of middleware called an Enterprise Mashup Platform. Raj Krishnamurthy became the chief language designer and implementer of EMML and also led the team to create an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]-based EMML [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] called Mashup Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = JackBe announces free enterprise mashup software | url = http://www.ebizq.net/news/10503.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work evolved into the EMML reference implementation that was donated to the Open Mashup Alliance. Raj Krishnamurthy continues to be one of the key contributors to EMML through the Open Mashup Alliance.

==EMML features==
EMML language provides a rich set of high-level mashup-domain vocabulary to consume and mash a variety of Web data-sources in flexible ways.  EMML provides a uniform syntax to invoke heterogeneous service styles: [[REST]], [[WSDL]], [[RSS]]/[[ATOM]], [[RDBMS]], and [[POJO]]. The EMML language also provides ability to mix diverse data formats: [[XML]], [[JSON]], [[JDBC]], JavaObjects, and primitive types. 

High-level EMML language features include:
* Filter and sort data coming from heterogeneous services
* Join data across heterogeneous services and data formats   
* Group and aggregate data using assorted functions
* Annotate original service data to enrich its semantic meaning 
* Merge multiple data streams into consolidated datasets
* Split datasets to select individual data fields
* Embedded scripting support for [[JavaScript]], [[JRuby]], [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[XQuery]]
* Web clipping to scrape data from [[HTML]] pages
* Conditional statements - &lt;code&gt;If&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Then&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;While&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ForEach&lt;/code&gt;
* Parallel syntax for concurrent processing 

EMML is primarily a XML-based declarative language, but also provides ability to encode complex logic using embedded scripting engines. [[XPath]] is the expression language used in EMML.

=== Directinvoke statement===

&lt;code&gt;directinvoke&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Directinvoke chapter | url = http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/directinvokeRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides ability to invoke and consume a variety of data services.  These data services may be [[REST]], [[RSS]]/[[ATOM]], or [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]] services. &lt;code&gt;directinvoke&lt;/code&gt; also supports Web clipping by allowing [[HTML]] pages to be specified as service endpoints. &lt;code&gt;HTTP GET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; protocols are supported in &lt;code&gt;directinvoke&lt;/code&gt;. HTTP Header and cookie support is also available thus providing capability to consume a wide variety of [[REST]]/[[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]] [[Web service]]s. It is possible to use &lt;code&gt;directinvoke&lt;/code&gt; with a proxy server.

Code sample of passing attributes as parameters to a service:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;directinvoke endpoint="http://www.myCompany.com/rest-services/getItems" 
    method="GET" outputvariable="$result" query="items=all" 
    appID="67GYH30N25" /&gt; 

&lt;directinvoke endpoint="http://www.svcsltd.com/getReservation" 
    method="GET" outputvariable="$news" xmlns:sc="http://www.svcltd.com/" 
    sc:date="20070515" sc:nights="3"/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Filter statement ===

The &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Filter chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/filterRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; statement filters the content of a variable using an [[XPath]] expression and places the result in a new variable.

Code sample for filtering west-coast customers using region data-item:

&lt;source lang="XML" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;filter inputvariable="$queryResult" filterexpr="/customers[region='West']" outputvariable="$westCoastOnly"/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sort statement ===

The &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Sort chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/sortRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; statement sorts the content of a document-type variable or variable fragment based on key expressions and places the result in another variable.

Code sample that sorts tickets based on created date and customer:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;sort inputvariable="$troubleTickets" 
  sortexpr="ticket" 
  sortkeys="xs:date(created) descending, customer ascending" 
  outputvariable="$troubleTickets"/&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Groupby statement ===

&lt;code&gt;groupby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Groupby chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/groupRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the ability to group and aggregate data sets. Standard [[XPath]] aggregation operations can be used and there is an extension mechanism for adding user-defined functions. Nested Grouping of hierarchical data sets are also supported. There is a &lt;code&gt;Having&lt;/code&gt; clause to filter Group attributes.

Code sample that groups books by genre and computes total copies for each genre:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;group by="$catalog//book/genre" outputvariable="$groupResult"&gt; 
    &lt;res:genre name="{$group_key}" copiessold="{sum(copiessold)}"/&gt; 
&lt;/group&gt;

=== Merge statement ===

&lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Merge chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/mergeRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides ability to combine various data sources including [[RSS]]/[[ATOM]] feeds, [[XML]],  [[JSON]] payload formats. The merge feature is similar to &lt;code&gt;SQL UNION&lt;/code&gt; functionality but merges hierarchical document structures.

Code sample that merges Yahoo! News, Financial News, and Reuters feeds:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;merge inputvariables="$YahooRSS, $FinancialNewsRss, $ReutersRSS" 
  outputvariable="$NewsAggregate"/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Annotate statement ===

&lt;code&gt;annotate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Annotate chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/annotateRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides ability to enrich the semantic meaning of source service data with microformat-like elements/attributes. These data annotations can be used by mashlets or gadgets to provide richer visual user interfaces.

Code sample for annotating vendor payload with geo-coordinates:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;annotate variable="$vendors" expr="/vendor/site" &gt; 
element geo:lat { $georesult//y:Latitude/string() }, 
element geo:long { $georesult//y:Longitude/string() } 
&lt;/annotate&gt;

=== Join statement ===

The &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Join chapter | url =http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/joinRefCmd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; statement defines how disparate, hierarchical data formats are joined and is comparable to inner joins for relational databases.

Code sample where output variable contains a &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:recommendations&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element with a repeating set of &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:movie&gt;&lt;/code&gt; children, which are the repeating items. Each &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:movie&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains a &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:movietitle&gt;&lt;/code&gt; child with data from the variable named movies and &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:rating&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;res:comment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; children with data from the variable named reviews:

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;join outputvariable="$joinResult" 
  joincondition="$movies/movie/@id = $reviews/review/movie/title"&gt; 
  &lt;select name="res:recommendations"&gt; 
      &lt;res:movie&gt; 
        &lt;res:movietitle&gt;{$movies/title}&lt;/res:movietitle&gt; 
        &lt;res:rating&gt;{$reviews/rating}&lt;/res:rating&gt; 
        &lt;res:comment&gt;{$reviews/comment}&lt;/res:comment&gt; 
      &lt;/res:movie&gt; 
  &lt;/select&gt; 
&lt;/join&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scripting in EMML ===

EMML is a declarative language, but provides programmatic scripting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Documentation Scripting chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; extensions for performing complex mashup logic. [[JavaScript]], [[JRuby]], [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[POJO]], [[XQuery]] scripting environments are supported. Data flows seamlessly between EMML and scripting environments. 

Code sample where [[JavaScript]] snippet is used to extract authentication token that is required for subsequent calls  "result" variable that gets propagated to [[JavaScript]] environment:

&lt;source lang=html&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[
            var r = new String(result)
            var ar = r.split("=");
            auth = ar[ar.length-1];
            auth = auth.slice(0, -1)
            ]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A '''fault model''' is an engineering model of something that could go wrong in the construction or operation of a piece of equipment.  From the model, the designer or user can then predict the consequences of this particular fault.  Fault models can be used in almost all branches of engineering.

==Basic fault models==
Basic '''fault models''' in [[digital circuit]]s include:
* the [[stuck-at fault]] model.  A signal, or gate output, is stuck at a 0 or 1 value, independent of the inputs to the circuit.
* the [[bridging fault]] model.  Two signals are connected together when they should not be.  Depending on the logic circuitry employed, this may result in a ''wired-OR'' or ''wired-AND'' logic function.  Since there are ''O(n^2)'' potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design.
* the [[transistor fault]]s. This model is used to describe faults for CMOS logic gates. At transistor level, a transistor maybe stuck-short or stuck-open. In stuck-short, a transistor behaves as it is always conducts (or stuck-on), and stuck-open is when a transistor never conducts current (or stuck-off). Stuck-short will produce a short between VDD and VSS.
* The [[open fault]] model.  Here a wire is assumed broken, and one or more inputs are disconnected from the output that should drive them.  As with bridging faults, the resulting behavior depends on the circuit implementation.
* The [[delay fault]] model, where the signal eventually assumes the correct value, but more slowly (or rarely, more quickly) than normal.

==Fault assumption==
A fault model, falls under one of the following assumptions:
* single fault assumption: only one fault occur in a circuit. if we define k possible fault types in our fault model the circuit has n signal lines, by single fault assumption, the total number of single faults is k×n.
* multiple fault assumption: multiple faults may occur in a circuit.

==Fault collapsing==
There are two main ways for collapsing fault sets into smaller sets.

===Equivalence collapsing===
[[File:Fault equivalence example.png|400px|thumbnail|right|an example of fault equivalence in digital circuits]]
It is possible that two or more faults produce same faulty behavior for all input patterns. These faults are called equivalent faults. Any single fault from the set of equivalent faults can represent the whole set. In this case, much less than k×n fault tests are required for a circuit with n signal line. removing equivalent faults from entire set of faults is called fault collapsing. fault collapsing significantly decreases the number of faults to check.


In the example diagram, red faults are equivalent to the faults that being pointed to with the arrows, so those red faults can be removed from the circuit. In this case, the fault collapse ratio is 12/20.

===Dominance collapsing===
[[File:Fault dominance example.png|thumbnail|right|Fault dominance example for a NAND gate]]
Fault F is called dominant to F' if all tests of F' detects F. In this case, F can be removed from the fault list. If F dominates F' and F' dominates F, then these two faults are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mazum/F02/lectures/lecmazum3.pdf "Fault Modeling"],''[University of Michigan]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example, a NAND gate has been shown, the set of all input values that can test output's SA0 is {00,01,10}. the set of all input values that can check first input's SA1 is {01}. In this case, output SA0 fault is dominant and can be removed from fault list.

===Functional collapsing===
Two faults are functionally equivalent if they produce identical faulty functions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~vagrawal/TALKS/VDAT07_Rev7.ppt "Using Hierarchy in Design Automation:The Fault Collapsing Problem "],[''11th VLSI Design and Test Symposium Kolkata, August 8–11, 2007'']&lt;/ref&gt; or we can say, two faults are functionally equivalent if we can not distinguish them at primary outputs (PO) with any input test vector.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Veneris, Robert Chang, Magdy S. Abadir, Sep Seyedi, [http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~veneris/jetta4.pdf "Functional Fault Equivalence and Diagnostic Test Generation in Combinational Logic Circuits Using Conventional ATPG"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In aerospace contexts ==
A fault model in an aerospace context is a set of structured information which helps users or systems to identify and isolate a problem that occurs on an engine, [[line-replaceable unit]] (LRU), or [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU) during a flight. Associated with this fault model may be a suggested repair procedure along with references to aircraft maintenance manuals (~ Light maintenance manual).

[[File:Carolina-rig.jpg|thumb|right|A completed assembly of tackle ready for fishing is sometimes called a [[Rig (fishing)|rig]],  such as this [[Carolina rig]].]]

'''Fishing tackle''' is the equipment used by [[fishermen|anglers]] when [[fishing]]. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are  [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], [[Fishing rod|rods]], [[Fishing reel|reels]], [[Fishing bait|baits]], [[Fishing lure|lures]], [[Spearfishing|spears]], [[Fishing net|nets]], [[Fishing gaff|gaffs]], [[Fishing trap|traps]], [[Waders (footwear)|waders]] and tackle boxes.

Gear that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called ''terminal tackle''. This includes [[Fishing hook|hooks]], leaders, [[Fishing swivel|swivels]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. Sometimes the term [[Rig (fishing)|fishing rig]] is used for a completed assembly of tackle ready for fishing.

Fishing tackle can be contrasted with [[fishing techniques]]. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing.

The term ''tackle'', with the meaning "apparatus for fishing", has been in use from 1398 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tackle|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing tackle is also called ''fishing gear''. However the term fishing gear is more usually used in the context of [[commercial fishing]], whereas fishing tackle is more often used in the context of [[recreational fishing]]. This article covers equipment used by recreational anglers.

==Hook, line and sinker==
Hook, line and sinker is a classic combination of tackle empowering an angler to catch fish.

===Hooks===
{{main|Fish hook}}
[[File:Fishhook.jpg|thumb|left|A [[fish hook]]]]
The use of the hook in angling is descended, historically, from what would today be called a "gorge". The word "gorge", in this context, comes from an archaic word meaning "throat". Gorges were used by ancient peoples to capture fish. A gorge was a long, thin piece of bone or stone attached by its midpoint to a thin line. The gorge would be fixed with a bait so that it would rest parallel to the lay of the line. When a fish swallowed the bait, a tug on the line caused the gorge to orient itself at right angles to the line, thereby sticking in the fish's [[Esophagus|gullet]].

A fish hook is a device for catching fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish hooks have been employed for millennia by anglers to catch fresh and saltwater fish. Early hooks were made from the upper bills of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and thorns of plants (Parker 2002). In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by ''Forbes'' as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/personaltech/2005/08/05/technology-food-fishhook_cx_de_0805fishhook.html|title=No. 19: The Fish Hook|first=David M.|last=Ewalt|date=5 August 2005|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of [[Fishing line|line]] or [[Fishing lure|lure]] device which connects the caught fish to the angler. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks.  Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the hook. They are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications.  Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live [[Fishing bait|bait]]s ([[Bait (luring substance)|bait fishing]]); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey ([[fly fishing]]); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey ([[Fishing lure|lure fishing]]).

===Lines===
{{main|Fishing line}}
[[File:Angeln zubehoer hacken.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing line with hooks attached]]
A [[fishing line]] is a cord used or made for fishing. The earliest fishing lines were made from leaves or plant stalk (Parker 2002). Later lines were constructed from horse hair or silk thread, with [[catgut]] leaders.  From the 1850s, modern industrial machinery was employed to fashion fishing lines in quantity.  Most of these lines were made from [[linen]] or [[silk]], and more rarely [[cotton]].&lt;!--what's the difference between "flax" and the "linen" already listed?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, James (Dr.), ''Book of the Black Bass'' (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern lines are made from artificial substances, including [[nylon]], [[polyethylene]], [[dacron]] and [[dyneema]]. The most common type is [[monofilament line|monofilament]] made of a single strand.  Anglers often use monofilament because of its buoyant characteristics and its ability to stretch under load. Recently alternatives such as [[fluorocarbon]], which is the least visible type, and [[braided fishing line]], also known as 'superlines' because of their small diameter, minimal amount of stretch, and great strength relative to standard nylon monofilament lines.

Important parameters of a fishing line are its breaking strength and its diameter (thicker, sturdier lines are more visible to fish).  Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include [[breaking strength]], diameter,castability, buoyancy, stretch, color, knot strength, UV resistance, limpness, abrasion resistance, and visibility.

Fishing with a hook and line is called [[angling]]. In addition to the use of the hook and line used to catch a fish, a heavy fish may be landed by using a landing net or a hooked pole called a [[Gaff (fishing)|gaff]]. [[troll (angling)|Trolling]] is a technique in which a [[fishing lure]] on a line is drawn through the water. Snagging is a technique where the object is to hook the fish in the body.

===Sinkers===
{{main|Fishing sinker}}
[[File:Angeln zubehoer grundblei 01.jpg|thumb|left|Three types of small lead sinkers]]
A sinker or plummet is a [[weight]] used when angling to force the [[fishing lure|lure]] or [[Fishing bait|bait]] to sink more rapidly or to increase the distance that it may be cast. The ordinary plain sinker is traditionally made of [[lead]]. It can be practically any shape, and is often shaped round like a pipe-stem, with a swelling in the middle. However, the use of smaller lead based fishing sinkers has now been banned in the UK, Canada and some states in the USA,&lt;ref name="MPCA"&gt;[http://www.pca.state.mn.us/oea/reduce/sinkers.cfm MPCA Home  &gt;  Sustainability  &gt;  Reduce Reuse Recycle  &gt;  Nontoxic Tackle: Let's get the lead out!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420070851/http://www.pca.state.mn.us/oea/reduce/sinkers.cfm |date=April 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since lead can cause toxic [[lead poisoning]] if ingested. There are loops of [[brass]] wire on either end of the sinker to attach the line. Weights can range from a quarter of an ounce for trout fishing up to a couple of pounds or more for sea bass and menhaden.

The [[swivel]] sinker is similar to the plain one, except that instead of loops, there are swivels on each end to attach the line. This is a decided improvement, as it prevents the line from twisting and tangling. In trolling, swivel sinkers are indispensable. The slide sinker, for bottom fishing, is a leaden tube which allows the line to slip through it, when the fish bites. This is an excellent arrangement, as the angler can feel the smallest bite, whereas in the other case the fish must first move the sinker before the angler feels him.

==Fishing rods==
{{main|Fishing rod}}
[[File:Deepsea.JPG|thumb|right|Fishing with a fishing rod]]
A fishing rod is an additional tool used with the hook, line and sinker. A length of fishing line is attached to a long, flexible rod or pole: one end terminates with the hook for catching the fish. Early fishing rods are depicted on inscriptions in ancient [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. In [[Medieval England]] they were called ''angles'' (hence the term ''angling''). As they evolved they were made from materials such as split Tonkin bamboo, Calcutta reed, or ash wood, which were light, tough, and pliable. The butts were frequently made of maple. Handles and grips were made of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Guides were simple wire loops.

Modern rods are sophisticated casting tools fitted with line guides and a [[fishing reel|reel]] for line stowage. They are most commonly made of [[fibreglass]], [[carbon fibre]] or, classically, [[bamboo]].  Fishing rods vary in action as well as length, and can be found in sizes between 24&amp;nbsp;inches and 20 feet. The longer the rod, the greater the mechanical advantage in casting. There are many different types of rods, such as [[Fishing rod#Fly rods|fly rods]], [[Fishing rod#Tenkara rods|tenkara rods]], [[Fishing rod#Spin and bait casting rods|spin and bait casting rods]], [[Fishing rod#Spinning rods|spinning rods]], [[Fishing rod#Ice rods|ice rods]], [[Fishing rod#Surf rods|surf rods]], [[Fishing rod#Sea rods|sea rods]] and [[Fishing rod#Trolling rods|trolling rods]].

Fishing rods can be contrasted with fishing poles. A fishing pole is a simple pole or stick with a line which is fastened to the tip and suspended with a hooked [[fishing lure|lure]] or [[Fishing bait|bait]] at the other end.

==Fishing reels==
{{main|Fishing reel}}
[[File:Fishing reel.jpg|thumb|left|A spinning reel]]
A fishing reel is a device used for the deployment and retrieval of a fishing line using a spool mounted on an [[axle]]. Fishing reels are traditionally used in angling.  They are most often used in conjunction with a fishing rod, though some specialized reels are mounted on [[crossbow]]s or to boat [[gunwale]]s or [[Transom (nautical)|transoms]]. The earliest known illustration of a fishing reel is from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 A.D. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 A.D., and by the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising multiplying or gear-retrieved reels. [[Paris, Kentucky]] native George Snyder is generally given credit for inventing the first fishing reel in America around 1820, a bait casting design that quickly became popular with American anglers.{{clear}}

==Fishing bait==
{{main|Fishing bait}}
;Natural baits
[[File:Green Highlander salmon fly.jpg|thumb|right|''Green Highlander'', an artificial fly used for [[salmon]] fishing.]]

The natural bait angler usually uses a common prey species of the fish as an attractant. The natural bait used may be alive or dead. Common natural baits include [[bait fish]], [[Earthworm|worms]], [[leech]]es, [[Cyprinid|minnow]]s, [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[Lumbricus terrestris|nightcrawlers]] and other [[insect]]s. Natural baits are effective due to the lifelike texture, odour and colour of the bait presented.

The common [[earthworm]] is a universal bait for fresh water angling. In the quest for quality worms, some fishers culture their own [[worm compost]] or practice [[worm charming]]. [[Larva|Grub]]s and [[maggots]] are also considered excellent bait when trout fishing. [[Grasshopper]]s, [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s and even [[ant]]s are also used as bait for trout in their season, although many anglers believe that trout or salmon [[roe]] is superior to any other bait. Studies show that natural baits like [[Sciaenidae|croaker]] and [[shrimp]] are more recognized by the fish and are more readily accepted. A good bait for [[red drum]] is [[menhaden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Live Bait Fishing: Including Doughbait &amp; Scent|author1=Gunnar Miesen |author2=Steve Hague |author3=Steve Hauge |year= 2004|publisher=Creative Publishing|isbn=1-58923-146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the risk of transmitting [[Myxobolus cerebralis|whirling disease]], [[trout]] and [[salmon]] should not be used as bait.

Processed baits, such as [[groundbait]] and [[boilie]]s, can work well with [[coarse fish]], such as [[carp]]. For example, in lakes in southern climates such as [[Florida]], fish such as [[Lepomis|bream]] will take bread bait. Bread bait is a small amount of bread, often moistened by saliva, balled up to a small size that is bite size to small fish.

;Artificial baits
Many people prefer to fish solely with [[Fishing lure|lures]], which are artificial baits designed to entice fish to strike. The artificial bait angler uses a man-made lure that may or may not represent prey. The lure may require a specialised presentation to impart an enticing action as, for example, in [[fly fishing]]. Recently, electronic lures have been developed to attract fish. Anglers have also begun using [[plastic bait]]. A common way to fish a soft [[plastic worm]] is the [[Texas rig]].  
{{clear}}

==Bite indicators==
{{main|Bite indicator}}
[[File:Floats.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of fishing floats.]]
A [[bite indicator]] or commonly referred to as "strike indicator" is a mechanical or electronic device which indicates to an angler that something is happening at the hook end of the fishing line. There are many types of bite indicators—which ones work best depends on the type of fishing.

Strike indicators are also commonly used in fly fishing for trout. Nymphs or wet flies will be suspended below the indicator to alert the angler of a fish. This has been used successfully for all trout and salmon species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyfishingtrout.org/double-fly-fishing-rig-for-nymphs-streamers-and-dry-flies/|title=Double Fly Fishing Rig for Nymphs, Streamers and Dry flies - Rigging|author=|date=22 May 2013|website=flyfishingtrout.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common form of using an indicator in fly fishing is the "hopper dropper rig" With this technique a nymph or wet fly will be hung from the bottom of a floating dry fly. This will effectively double the opportunity of a strike from an actively feeding fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyfishingtrout.org/fly-fishing-with-hoppers-hopper-dropper-rig/|title=Fly fishing The Hopper Dropper Rig and Chernobyl Ants with Nymphs|date=17 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other devices which are widely used as bite indicators are [[Fishing float|floats]] which float in the water, and dart about if a fish bites, and [[quiver tip]]s which are mounted onto the tip of the fishing rod. Bite alarms are electronic devices which bleep when a fish tugs a fishing line. Whereas floats and quiver tips are used as visual bite detectors, bite alarms are audible bite detectors.

==Spears==
{{main|Spearfishing}}
[[File:Negrito outrigger.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Negrito]]s traditionally used bows and arrows to shoot fish in clear water.&lt;ref&gt;March, Alden (1899) [https://archive.org/details/conquestphilippine00marcrich ''The history and conquest of the Philippines and our other island possessions; embracing our war with the Filipinos in 1899''] Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Spearfishing is an ancient method of fishing conducted with an ordinary [[spear]] or a specialised variant such as a [[harpoon]], [[trident]], [[arrow]] or eel spear.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/claremuseum/riches_of_clare/water/eel_spear2.htm Image of an eel spear].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofantiques.com/June03/hearthJun03.htm Spear fishing for eels].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harpoon]]s are spears which have a barb at the end. Their use was widespread in [[palaeolithic]] times.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=Cosquer+spear+fish&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JMnNQj1gPu&amp;sig=2SgDhCZyGrWWNpMXz9y0DLSWmuE&amp;hl=en#PPA298,M1 ''The Nature of Paleolithic Art.''] Page 298. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-31126-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosquer cave]] in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned.  [[Trident]]s are spears which have three prongs at the business end. They are also called leisters or gigs. They feature widely in early mythology and history.

Modern spears can be used with a [[speargun]]. Some spearguns use [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] (or rubber loops) to propel the spear. [[Polespear]]s have a sling attached to the spear, [[Hawaiian sling]]s have a sling separate from the spear, in the manner of an underwater bow and arrow.

A [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or [[crossbow]] can be used with arrows in [[bowfishing]]. 
{{clear}}

==Nets==
{{main|Fishing nets}}
[[File:FraserRiverSalmonFishing.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing for [[salmon]] with a hand net on the [[Fraser River]], [[Canada]]]]
Fishing nets are [[mesh]]es usually formed by [[knot]]ting a relatively thin thread. 
Between 177 and 180 the Greek author [[Oppian]] wrote the ''Halieutica'', a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps  "which work while their masters sleep". Ancient fishing nets used threads made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. They could be rough in design and material but some designs were amazingly close to designs we use today (Parker 2002). Modern nets are usually made of artificial [[polyamide]]s like [[nylon]], although nets of organic polyamides such as [[wool]] or [[silk]] thread were common until recently and are still used.

[[Hand net]]s are held open by a hoop, and maybe on the end of a long stiff handle. They have been known since antiquity and may be used for sweeping up fish near the water surface like [[muskellunge]] and [[northern pike]]. When such a net is used by an angler to help land a fish it is known as a ''landing net''.&lt;ref name="Fishing Tools - Landing Nets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp|title=Fishing Tools - Landing Nets|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915101844/http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp|archivedate=15 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, hand-netting is the only legal way of catching [[glass eels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eelregulations.co.uk/cont-008.html|title=Eel Regulations: Eel fishing|website=eelregulations.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been practised for thousands of years on the [[River Parrett]] and [[River Severn]].

[[Cast net]]s are small round nets with weights on the edges which is thrown by the fisher. Sizes vary up to about four metres in diameter. The net is thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught as the net is hauled back in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccoastalfishing.com/index.htm?casting.htm~main Casting net].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traps==
{{main|Fishing trap}}
[[File:Đặt đó.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vietnam]]ese traditional [[fish trap]].]]
Fishing traps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and pot-traps that are baited to attract prey and periodically lifted. They might have the form of a [[fishing weir]] or a [[lobster trap]]. A typical trap can have a frame of thick steel wire in the shape of a [[heart]], with [[chicken wire]] stretched around it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of the trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as the chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. In earlier times, traps were constructed of wood and fibre.

==Fish stringer==
[[File:Простейший кукан для подводной охоты.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Simple fish stringer for spearfishing}}]]

A [[fish stringer]] is a line of rope or chain along which an angler can string fish that have been caught so they can be immersed and kept alive in water.&lt;ref name=Toth&gt;Toth, Mike (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_AFSanZPpEC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Fish+stringer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qQHiU-SOBo_k8AWh5oH4CA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fish%20stringer%22&amp;f=false ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fishing Basics''] Second edition, pp. 158–159, Penguin. {{ISBN|9781101222126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fly fishing tackle]] is equipment used by, and often specialised for use by [[fly fishing|fly anglers]]. Fly fishing tackle includes [[Fly fishing tackle#Fly lines|fly lines]] designed for easy casting, specialised [[Fly fishing tackle#Fly reels|fly reels]] designed to hold a fly line and supply [[Drag (physics)|drag]] if required for landing heavy or fast fish, specialised [[Fly fishing tackle#Fly rods|fly rods]] designed to cast fly lines and artificial flies, [[Fly fishing tackle#Terminal tackle|terminal tackle]] including [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]], and other [[Fly fishing tackle#Accessories|accessories]] including fly boxes used to store and carry artificial flies.

==Tackle boxes==
[[File:TackleBoxFortDeSoto.JPG|alt=Typical tackle box with rod and bait bucket.|thumb|300px|right| Typical tackle box with rod and bait bucket]]
Fishing tackle boxes have for many years been an essential part of the anglers equipment. Fishing tackle boxes were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing tackle boxes were manufactured. The first plastic fishing tackle boxes were manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic fishing tackle boxes were similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof [[cantilever]] tackle boxes with numerous small trays for small tackle. These types of tackle boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small tackle gets mixed up. Fishing tackle boxes have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small tackle from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small tackle to a rod some distance from the main tackle box.

[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]], created by the perfumer [[Paul Parquet]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;]]
[[File:sa-fern.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fougère means "[[fern]]" in [[French language|French]] ]]

'''''Fougère''''', {{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|pron}}, is one of the main [[Perfume#Olfactive families|olfactive families]] of [[perfume]]s. The name comes from the [[French language]] word for "[[fern]]". ''Fougère'' perfumes are made with a blend of fragrances: [[Note (perfumery)|top-notes]] are sweet, with the scent of [[lavender]] flowers; as the more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components evaporate, the scents of [[oakmoss]], derived from a species of [[lichen]] and described as woody, sharp and slightly sweet, and [[coumarin]], similar to the scent of new-mown [[hay]], become noticeable. Aromatic ''fougère'', a derivative of this class, contains additional notes of herbs, spice and/or wood.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica&gt;{{cite web|title=Aromatic Fougere|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/groups/aromatic+fougere.html|website=Fragrantica.com perfumes magazine|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name originated with [[Houbigant Parfum]]'s ''Fougère Royale''. This perfume, created by Houbigant owner [[Paul Parquet]], was later added to the scent archives known as the [[Osmothèque]], in [[Versailles, France]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant&gt;{{cite web|title=Fougère Royale|url=https://www.houbigant-parfum.com/us_en/fougere-royale.html|website=Parfums Houbigant Paris|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houbigant re-introduced this fragrance in 2010.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

Perfumes of this type are especially popular as fragrances for men.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt; Many modern fougère perfumes have various citrus, herbaceous, green, floral and animalic notes included. The most common additions to the basic fragrance blend include [[vetiver]] and [[pelargonium|geranium]]. [[Bergamot orange|Bergamot]] is often present to add sharpness to the lavender top-note.

Examples of men's fragrances which fall into the ''fougère'' class include [[Brut (cologne)|Brut]] by [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]], [[Paco Rabanne]] Pour Homme, Azzaro Pour Homme, Boss by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]], [[Prada]] for Men, [[Eternity (fragrance)|Eternity for Men]] by [[Calvin Klein]], Canoe for Men by Dana, [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] Pour Homme, [[Drakkar Noir]] by [[Guy Laroche]], [[Tabac (perfume)|Tabac]] for Men, Michael for Men by [[Michael Kors]], Clubman Pinaud After Shave and Special Reserve, Polo Blue and Chaps by [[Ralph Lauren]], and [[Kouros (perfume)|Kouros]] by [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

A '''gate fee''' (or '''tipping fee''') is the charge levied upon a given quantity of [[waste]] received at a waste processing facility.

In the case of a [[landfill]] it is generally levied to offset the cost of opening, maintaining and eventually closing the site. It may also include any [[landfill tax]] which is applicable in the region. The gate fee differs from the '''waste removal fee''' which is the charge levied on people in areas, such as [[Ireland]], where waste collection is not covered as part of local taxes.

With waste treatment facilities such as incinerators, mechanical biological treatment facilities or composting plants the fee offsets the operation, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[Manual labour|labour]] costs, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] costs of the facility along with any [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]s and final disposal costs of any unusable residues.

The fee can be charged per load, per tonne, or per item depending on the source and type of the waste.

[[File:Glider2010-overgunma.ogv|thumb|(video) A glider sails over [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]], [[Japan]].]]
A '''glider''' or '''sailplane''' is a type of [[glider aircraft]] used in the leisure activity and sport of [[gliding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-13a.pdf FAA Glider handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080621012626/http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.1.0 Definition of gliders used for sporting purposes in FAI Sporting Code]&lt;/ref&gt;  This unpowered aircraft uses naturally occurring currents of rising air in the atmosphere to remain airborne. Gliders are aerodynamically streamlined and are capable of gaining altitude and remaining airborne, and maintaining forward motion.  
==Types of gliders==
[[Image:Ash-25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schleicher ASH 25|ASH25M]]—a self-launching two-seater glider]]
Gliders benefit from producing the least [[drag (physics)|drag]] for any given amount of lift, and this is best achieved with [[Aspect ratio (wing)|long, thin wings]], a fully [[aircraft fairing|faired]] narrow cockpit and a slender [[fuselage]]. Aircraft with these features are able to soar - climb efficiently in rising air produced by thermals or hills. In still air, gliders can glide long distances at high speed with a minimum loss of height in between.

Gliders have rigid wings and either skids or [[Landing gear|undercarriage]].&lt;ref name="definition"/&gt; In contrast [[hang gliding|hang gliders]] and [[paragliding|paragliders]] use the pilot's feet for the start of the launch and for the landing. These latter types are described in separate articles, though their differences from gliders are covered below. Gliders are usually launched by winch or aerotow, though other methods: auto tow and bungee, are occasionally used.

Some gliders do not [[Lift (soaring)|soar]] and are simply engineless aircraft towed by another aircraft to a desired destination and then cast off for landing. [[Military glider]]s (such as those used on [[D-Day]]) are single-use only, and are abandoned after landing, having served their purpose.

'''[[Motor glider]]s''' are gliders with engines which can be used for extending a flight and even, in some cases, for [[takeoff|take-off]]. Some high-performance motor gliders (known as "self-sustaining" gliders) may have an engine-driven retractable propeller which can be used to sustain flight. Other motor gliders have enough thrust to launch themselves before the engine is retracted and are known as "self-launching" gliders. Another type is the self-launching "touring motor glider", where the pilot can switch the engine on and off in flight without retracting their propellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Civil Aviation Authority: Personnel Licensing Department |title=LASORS 2006: The Guide for Pilots |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_z6d-q_X4MAC |date=2005-12-02 |publisher=The Stationery Office |isbn=978-0-11-790501-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Aircraft Glider Vampyr.jpg|thumb|left|HAWA Vampyr 1921]]
{{For|early attempts to fly|Early flying machines}}

[[Sir George Cayley]]'s gliders achieved brief wing-borne hops from around 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%202909.html ''Flight'' magazine 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, [[Otto Lilienthal]] built gliders using weight shift for control. In the early 1900s, the [[Wright Brothers]] built gliders using movable surfaces for control. In 1903, they successfully added an engine.

After [[World War I]] gliders were first built for sporting purposes in Germany. Germany's strong links to gliding were to a large degree due to post-WWI regulations forbidding the construction and flight of motorised planes in Germany, so the country's aircraft enthusiasts often turned to gliders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.org/test/UsTeam/adobe%20pdf/pr%20pdf/BR%20Soaring%20History%20V5%2004.pdf|title=History of Gliding &amp; Soaring|date=7 August 2004|work=United States Soaring Team|accessdate=23 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606062253/http://www.ssa.org/test/UsTeam/adobe%20pdf/pr%20pdf/BR%20Soaring%20History%20V5%2004.pdf#|archive-date=6 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were actively encouraged by the German government, particularly at flying sites suited to gliding flight like the [[Wasserkuppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.glidingmagazine.org/FeatureArticle.asp?id=506# |title= Gliding Magazine {{!}} Features |access-date=23 February 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726111201/http://www.glidingmagazine.org/FeatureArticle.asp?id=506# |archive-date=26 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sporting use of gliders rapidly evolved in the 1930s and is now their main application. As their performance improved, gliders began to be used for [[Gliding#Cross-country|cross-country flying]] and now regularly fly hundreds or even thousands of kilometres in a day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/record-gliding# |title=List of FAI claimed and ratified records |access-date=11 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232118/http://www.fai.org/record-gliding# |archive-date=16 March 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinecontest.org/olc-2.0/gliding/daily.html?st=olc&amp;rt=olc&amp;df=&amp;sp=2010&amp;c=C0&amp;sc= On-line contest web page]&lt;/ref&gt; if the weather is suitable.

==Glider design==
Early gliders had no [[cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] and the pilot sat on a small seat located just ahead of the wing. These were known as "[[primary glider]]s" and they were usually launched from the tops of hills, though they are also capable of short hops across the ground while being towed behind a vehicle. To enable gliders to soar more effectively than primary gliders, the designs minimized drag. Gliders now have very smooth, narrow [[fuselage]]s and very long, narrow wings with a high [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] and [[winglet]]s.

[[File:Cockpit with Computer.JPG|thumb|Instrument panel of a typical modern glider ([[Glaser-Dirks DG-100|Glaser-Dirks DG-101G ELAN]]). &lt;br /&gt;Click on the image for an explanation of the instrumentation.]]

The early gliders were made mainly of wood with metal fastenings, stays and control cables. Later fuselages made of fabric-covered steel tube were married to wood and fabric wings for lightness and strength. New materials such as [[carbon-fiber]], [[fiber glass]] and [[Kevlar]] have since been used with computer-aided design to increase performance. The first glider to use glass-fiber extensively was the [[Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24|Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Phönix]] which first flew in 1957. This material is still used because of its high strength to weight ratio and its ability to give a smooth exterior finish to reduce drag. Drag has also been minimized by more aerodynamic shapes and retractable undercarriages. [[Flap (aircraft)|Flaps]] are fitted to the trailing edges of the wings on some gliders to minimize the drag from the tailplane at all speeds.

With each generation of materials and with the improvements in [[aerodynamics]], the performance of gliders has increased. One measure of performance is the [[glide ratio]]. A ratio of 30:1 means that in smooth air a glider can travel forward 30&amp;nbsp;meters while losing only 1&amp;nbsp;meter of altitude. Comparing some typical gliders that might be found in the fleet of a gliding club – the [[Grunau Baby]] from the 1930s had a glide ratio of just 17:1, the glass-fiber [[Glasflügel H-201|Libelle]] of the 1960s increased that to 39:1, and modern flapped 18&amp;nbsp;meter gliders such as the [[Schleicher ASG 29|ASG29]] have a glide ratio of over 50:1. The largest [[FAI Open Class|open-class]] glider, the [[Eta Aircraft eta|eta]], has a span of 30.9&amp;nbsp;meters and has a glide ratio over 70:1. Compare this to the [[Gimli Glider]], a [[Boeing 767]] which ran out of fuel mid-flight and was found to have a glide ratio of 12:1, or to the [[Space Shuttle]] with a glide ratio of 4.5:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klabs.org/DEI/Processor/shuttle/shuttle_tech_conf/1985008580.pdf Space Shuttle Technical Conference pg 258]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the critical role that aerodynamic efficiency plays in the performance of a glider, gliders often have aerodynamic features seldom found in other aircraft. The wings of a modern racing glider have a specially designed low-drag [[laminar flow]] [[airfoil]]. After the wings' surfaces have been shaped by a mold to great accuracy, they are then highly polished. Vertical [[wingtip device|winglets]] at the ends of the wings are computer-designed to decrease drag and improve handling performance. Special aerodynamic seals are used at the [[aileron]]s, [[rudder]] and [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] to prevent the flow of air through control surface gaps. [[Turbulator]] devices in the form of a zig-zag tape or multiple blow holes positioned in a span-wise line along the wing are used to trip laminar flow air into turbulent flow at a desired location on the wing. This flow control prevents the formation of laminar flow bubbles and ensures the absolute minimum drag. Bug-wipers may be installed to wipe the wings while in flight and remove insects that are disturbing the smooth flow of air over the wing.

Modern competition gliders carry jettisonable water ballast (in the wings and sometimes in the vertical stabilizer). The extra weight provided by the water ballast is advantageous if the lift is likely to be strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider's [[center of mass]]. Moving the [[center of mass]] toward the rear by carrying water in the vertical stabilizer reduces the required down-force from the horizontal stabilizer and the resultant drag from that down-force.  Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the gliders spend only a small amount of time climbing in thermals. The pilot can jettison the water ballast before it becomes a disadvantage in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of water ballast is to dampen air turbulence such as might be encountered during [[ridge soaring]]. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders must jettison any water ballast before landing.

Most gliders are built in Europe and are designed to [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] Certification Specification CS-22 (previously [[Joint Aviation Requirements]]-22). These define minimum standards for safety in a wide range of characteristics such as controllability and strength. For example, gliders must have design features to minimize the possibility of incorrect assembly (gliders are often stowed in disassembled configuration, with at least the wings being detached). Automatic connection of the controls during rigging is the common method of achieving this.

The two most common methods of launching gliders are by aerotow and by winch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Piggott| first = Derek| title = Gliding: A handbook on soaring flight| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RsJzPwAACAAJ| date = 2002-03-01| publisher = A &amp; C Black| isbn = 978-0-7136-6148-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When aerotowed, the glider is towed behind a powered aircraft using a rope about 60&amp;nbsp;meters (about 200&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The glider pilot releases the rope after reaching the desired altitude. However, the rope can be released by the towplane also in case of emergency.  Winch launching uses a powerful stationary engine located on the ground at the far end of the launch area.  The glider is attached to one end of 800–1200&amp;nbsp;metres (about 2,500–4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) of cable and the winch rapidly winds it in.  The glider can gain about 900–3000&amp;nbsp;feet (about 300–900&amp;nbsp;metres) of height with a winch launch, depending on the head wind. Less often, automobiles are used to pull gliders into the air, by pulling them directly or through the use of a reverse pulley in a similar manner to the winch launch. Elastic ropes (known as [[bungee cord|bungees]]) are occasionally used at some sites to launch gliders from slopes, if there is sufficient wind blowing up the hill.  Bungee launching was the predominant method of launching early gliders.  Some modern gliders can self-launch with the use of retractable engines and/or propellers, which can also be used to sustain flight once airborne (see [[motor glider]]).

Once launched, gliders try to gain height using [[thermal]]s, [[ridge lift]], [[lee waves]] or [[convergence zone]]s and can remain airborne for hours.  This is known as "soaring". By finding lift sufficiently often, experienced pilots fly [[Gliding#Cross-country|cross-country]], often on pre-declared tasks of hundreds of kilometers, usually back to the original launch site. Cross-country flying and aerobatics are the two forms of [[Gliding competitions|competitive gliding]]. For information about the forces in gliding flight, see [[lift-to-drag ratio]].

==Glide slope control==
Pilots need some form of control over the glide slope to land the glider. In powered aircraft, this is done by reducing engine thrust.  In gliders, other methods are used to either reduce the lift generated by the wing, increase the drag of the entire glider, or both.  [[Glide ratio|Glide slope]] is the distance traveled for each unit of height lost.  In a steady wings-level glide with no wind, glide slope is the same as the lift/drag ratio (L/D) of the glider, called "L-over-D".  Reducing lift from the wings and/or increasing drag will reduce the L/D allowing the glider to descend at a steeper angle with no increase in airspeed.  Simply pointing the nose downwards only converts altitude into a higher airspeed with a minimal initial reduction in total energy. Gliders, because of their long low wings, create a high [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] which can significantly increase the glide angle and make it difficult to bring the glider to Earth in a short distance.
;Sideslipping: A [[slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] is performed by crossing the controls (rudder to right with ailerons to left, for example) so that the glider is no longer flying aligned with the air flow.  This will present one side of the fuselage to the air-flow significantly increasing drag. Early gliders primarily used slipping for glide slope control.
;Spoilers: [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]] are movable control surfaces in the top of the wing, usually located mid-chord or near the spar which are raised into the air-flow to eliminate (spoil) the lift from the wing area behind the spoiler, disrupting the spanwise distribution of lift and increasing [[lift-induced drag]].  Spoilers significantly increase drag.
;Air brakes: [[Air brake (aircraft)|Air brakes]], also known as dive brakes, are devices whose primary purpose is to increase drag.  On gliders, the spoilers act as air brakes.  They are positioned on top of the wing and below the wing also. When slightly opened the upper brakes will spoil the lift, but when fully opened will present a large surface and so can provide significant drag.  Some gliders have ''terminal velocity dive brakes'', which provide enough drag to keep its speed below maximum permitted speed, even if the glider were pointing straight down. This capability is considered a safer way to descend without instruments through cloud than the only alternative which is an intentional [[spin (flight)|spin]].
;Flaps: [[Flap (aircraft)|Flaps]] are movable surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing.  The primary purpose of flaps is to change the [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] of the wing and so change the lift-to-drag ratio of the wing.  This reduces the [[stall (flight)|stall]] speed and so allows reduced landing speeds.  It was possible to lower the flaps on some older gliders by up to 90 degrees to increase drag significantly as well as increasing [[lift coefficient]] when landing. Another feature that flapped gliders possess are ''negative flaps'' that are also able to deflect the trailing edge upward. This feature is included on some competition gliders in order to reduce the [[pitching moment]] on the wing and allowing better glide ratios at higher speeds (a particularly desirable characteristic for racing gliders).
;Parachute: Some high performance gliders from the 1960s and 1970s were designed to carry a small [[drogue parachute]] because their air brakes were not particularly effective. This was stored in the tail-cone of the glider during flight. When deployed, a parachute causes a large increase in drag, but has a significant disadvantage over the other methods of controlling the glide slope. This is because a parachute does not allow the pilot to finely adjust the glide slope. Consequently, a pilot may have to jettison the parachute entirely, if the glider is not going to reach the desired landing area.

==Landing==

Early glider designs used skids for landing, but modern types generally land on wheels.  Some of the earliest gliders used a dolly with wheels for taking off and the dolly was jettisoned as the glider left the ground, leaving just the skid for landing. A glider may be designed so the [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|center of gravity (CG)]] is behind the main wheel so the glider sits nose high on the ground.  Other designs may have the CG forward of the main wheel so the nose rests on a nose-wheel or skid when stopped.  Skids are now mainly used only on training gliders such as the [[2-33|Schweizer SGS 2–33]]. Skids are around 100mm (3&amp;nbsp;inches) wide by 900mm (3&amp;nbsp;feet) long and run from the nose to the main wheel.  Skids help with braking after landing by allowing the pilot to put forward pressure on the control stick, thus creating friction between the skid and the ground. The wing tips also have small skids or wheels to protect the wing tips from ground contact.

In most high performance gliders the undercarriage can be raised to reduce drag in flight and lowered for landing.  Wheel brakes are provided to allow stopping once on the ground.  These may be engaged by fully extending the spoilers/air-brakes or by using a separate control.  Although there is only a single main wheel, the glider's wing can be kept level by using the flight controls until it is almost stationary.

Pilots usually land back at the airfield from which they took off, but a landing is possible in any flat field about 250&amp;nbsp;metres long.  Ideally, should circumstances permit, a glider would fly a standard [[Airfield traffic pattern|pattern]], or [[circuit (airfield)|circuit]], in preparation for landing, typically starting at a height of 300&amp;nbsp;metres (1,000&amp;nbsp;feet).  Glide slope control devices are then used to adjust the height to assure landing at the desired point.  The ideal landing pattern positions the glider on [[final approach (aviation)|final approach]] so that a deployment of 30–60% of the spoilers/dive brakes/flaps brings it to the desired touchdown point.  In this way the pilot has the option of opening or closing the spoilers/air-brakes to extend or steepen the descent to reach the touchdown point. This gives the pilot wide safety margins should unexpected events occur.

==Instrumentation and other technical aids==
[[File:Glider Instrument Panel.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Schempp-Hirth Janus]]-C in flight, showing instrument panel configured in the [[basic-T]], with [[airspeed indicator|airspeed]], [[turn and bank indicator|turn and bank]] and [[altimeter|altitude]] displays across the top row; below a [[GPS]]-driven computer, with wind and glide information, drives two electronic [[variometer]] displays to the right. The [[yaw string]] and [[magnetic compass|compass]] are above the glare shield]]

In addition to an [[altimeter]], [[compass]], and an [[airspeed indicator]], gliders are often equipped with a [[variometer]], [[turn and bank indicator]] and an [[airband]] radio ([[transceiver]]), each of which may be required in some countries. An [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] ([[Emergency Locator Transmitter|ELT]]) may also be fitted into the glider to reduce [[search and rescue]] time in case of an accident.

Much more than in other types of aviation, glider pilots depend on the [[variometer]], which is a very sensitive [[vertical speed indicator]], to measure the climb or sink rate of the plane. This enables the pilot to detect minute changes caused when the glider enters rising or sinking air masses. Both mechanical and electronic 'varios' are usually fitted to a glider. The electronic variometers produce a modulated sound of varying amplitude and frequency depending on the strength of the lift or sink, so that the pilot can concentrate on centering a thermal, watching for other traffic, on navigation, and weather conditions. Rising air is announced to the pilot as a rising tone, with increasing pitch as the lift increases. Conversely, descending air is announced with a lowering tone, which advises the pilot to escape the sink area as soon as possible. (Refer to the ''[[variometer]]'' article for more information).

Gliders' variometers are sometimes fitted with mechanical devices such as a "MacCready Ring" to indicate the optimal [[speed to fly]] for given conditions. These devices are based on the mathematical theory attributed to [[Paul MacCready]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Electronic variometers make the same calculations automatically, after allowing for factors such as the [[Polar curve (aerodynamics)|glider's theoretical performance]], water ballast, headwinds/tailwinds and insects on the leading edges of the wings.

Soaring flight computers, often used in combination with [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] running specialized soaring software, have been designed for use in gliders. Using [[GPS]] technology in conjunction with a barometric device these tools can:
* Provide the glider's position in 3 dimensions by a moving map display
* Alert the pilot to nearby [[airspace]] restrictions
* Indicate position along track and remaining distance and course direction
* Show airports within theoretical gliding distance
* Determine wind direction and speed at current altitude
* Show historical lift information
* Create a GPS log of the flight to provide proof for contests and gliding badges
* Provide "final" glide information (i.e., showing if the glider can reach the finish without additional lift).
* Indicate the best speed to fly under current conditions

After the flight the GPS data may be replayed on computer software for analysis and to follow the trace of one or more gliders against a backdrop of a map, an aerial photograph or the airspace.

Because collision with other gliders is a risk, the anti-collision device [[FLARM]] is becoming increasingly common in Europe and Australia. In the longer term, gliders may eventually be required in some European countries to fit [[transponder (aviation)|transponders]] once devices with low power requirements become available.

==Markings==
So that ground-based observers may identify gliders in flight or in [[gliding competition]], registration marks ("insignias" or "competition numbers" or "contest ID") are displayed in large characters on the underside of a single wing, and also on the [[vertical stabilizer|fin]] and [[rudder]]. Registration marks  are assigned by gliding associations such as the US [[Soaring Society of America]], and are unrelated to national registrations issued by entities such as the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/zander940.pdf Reference to competition numbers on FAI web site]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007025354/http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/zander940.pdf |date=7 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This need for visual ID has somewhat been supplanted by GPS position recording.  Insignias are useful in two ways:  First, they are used in radio communications between gliders, as pilots use their competition number as their [[call sign]]s. Secondly, to easily tell a glider's contest ID when flying in close proximity to one another to alert them of potential dangers.  For example, during gatherings of multiple gliders within thermals (known as "gaggles"), one pilot might report "Six-Seven-Romeo I am right below you".

[[Fibreglass]] gliders are invariably painted white to minimise their skin temperature in sunlight. Fibreglass resin loses strength as its temperature rises into the range achievable in direct sun on a hot day. Color is not used except for a few small bright patches on wing tips; these patches (typically orange or red) improving a glider's visibility to pilots while in flight.  Such patches are obligatory for mountain flying in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircross.co.uk/sisteron/FlyFrance.htm#Safety Gliding In France]&lt;/ref&gt; Non-fibreglass gliders made of aluminum and wood are not so subject to deterioration at higher temperatures and are often quite brightly painted.

== Comparison of gliders with hang gliders and paragliders ==
There is sometimes confusion about gliders, hang gliders and paragliders. In particular, paragliders and hang gliders are both foot-launched. The main differences between the types are:

==Competition classes of glider==
[[File:DG1000 glider crop.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[DG Flugzeugbau DG-1000]] of the Two Seater Class]]
Eight [[Glider Competition Classes|competition classes]] of glider have been defined by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602011814/http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.7.7 Competition classes as defined by FAI]&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
* Standard Class (No flaps, 15&amp;nbsp;m wing-span, water ballast allowed)
* 15&amp;nbsp;metre Class (Flaps allowed, 15&amp;nbsp;m wing-span, water ballast allowed)
* 18&amp;nbsp;metre Class (Flaps allowed, 18&amp;nbsp;m wing-span, water ballast allowed)
* Open Class (No restrictions except a limit of 850&amp;nbsp;kg for the maximum all-up weight)
* Two Seater Class (maximum wing-span of 20&amp;nbsp;m), also known by the German name "Doppelsitzer"
* Club Class (This class allows a wide range of older small gliders with different performance and so the scores have to be adjusted by [[handicapping]]. Water ballast is not allowed).
* World Class (The [[FAI Gliding Commission]] which is part of the FAI and an associated body called [[Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile]] (OSTIV) announced a competition in 1989 for a low-cost glider, which had moderate performance, was easy to assemble and to handle, and was safe for low hours pilots to fly. The winning design was announced in 1993 as the [[Politechniki Warszawskiej PW-5|Warsaw Polytechnic PW-5]]. This allows competitions to be run with only one type of glider.
* Ultralight Class, for gliders with a maximum mass less than 220&amp;nbsp;kg.

==A==
* '''[[Adaptive capacity]]''': An important part of the [[Resilience (network)|resilience]] of systems in the face of a [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]], helping to minimise loss of [[Structural functionalism|function]] in individual human, and collective social and biological systems.
* '''[[Allopoiesis]]''': The process whereby a system produces something other than the system itself.
* '''[[Allostasis]]''': The process of achieving stability, or [[homeostasis]], through physiological or behavioral change.
* '''[[Autopoiesis]]''': The process by which a system regenerates itself through the self-reproduction of its own elements and of the network of interactions that characterize them. An [[autopoietic]] system renews, repairs, and replicates or reproduces itself in a flow of matter and energy. Note: from a strictly [[Humberto Maturana|Maturanian]] point of view, autopoiesis is an essential property of biological/living systems.

==B==
* '''[[Black box]]''': A technical term for a device or system or object when it is viewed primarily in terms of its input and output characteristics.
* '''[[Boundary (thermodynamic)|Boundaries]]''': The parametric conditions, often vague, always subjectively stipulated, that delimit and define a system and set it apart from its environment.

==C==
* '''[[Cascading failure]]''': Failure in a system of interconnected parts, where the service provided depends on the operation of a preceding part, and the failure of a preceding part can trigger the failure of successive parts.
* '''[[Closed system]]''': A system which can exchange energy (as heat or work), but not matter, with its surroundings.
* '''[[Complexity]]''': A complex system is characterised by components that interact in multiple ways and follow local rules. A complicated system is characterised by its layers. 
* '''[[Culture]]''': The result of individual [[learning]] processes that distinguish one social group of higher animals from another. In humans culture is the set of interrelated concepts, products and activities through which humans express themselves, interact with each other, and become aware of themselves and the world around them.

==D==
* '''Development''': The process of liberating a system from its previous set of limiting conditions. It is an amelioration of conditions or quality.
* '''[[Dissipative structure]]:''' A term invented by [[Ilya Prigogine]] to describe complex chemical structures undergoing the process of chemical change through the dissipation of entropy into their environment, and the corresponding importation of "negentropy" from their environment. Also known as [[Syntropy|syntropic systems]].

==E==
* '''Embeddedness''': A state in which one system is nested in another system.
* '''[[Emergence]]''': The appearance of novel characteristics exhibited on the level of the whole ensemble, but not by the components in isolation.
* '''[[Enantiostasis]]''': The ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]], especially a living [[organism]], to stabilize and conserve function in spite of an unstable environment.
* '''[[Quantum entanglement|Entanglement]]''': A state in which the manner of being, or form of existence, of one system is inextricably tied to that of another system or set of systems.
* '''[[Entropy]]''': In physics, entropy is a measure of energy that is expended in a physical system but does no useful work, and tends to decrease the organizational order of the system.
* '''Environment''': The context within which a system exists. It is composed of all things that are external to the system, and it includes everything that may affect the system, and may be affected by it at any given time.
* [[Equifinality]]: In open systems, the principle that the same final state can be reached from different initial conditions, or in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4442775|title=General system theory : foundations, development, applications|last=[[Bertalanffy]]|first= Ludwig von,|date=1972-01-19|publisher=G. Braziller|isbn=0807604526|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=4442775}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''[[Evolution]]''': A tendency toward greater structural complexity, ecological and/or organizational simplicity, more efficient modes of operation, greater dynamic harmony, etc. As a cosmic process, it is not limited to the domain of biological phenomena, but extends to include all aspects of change in open dynamic systems with a throughput of information and energy.
* '''[[Evolutionary systems]]''': A type of system which reproduces with mutation.

== F ==
* '''[[Feedback]]''': A functional monitoring [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] obtained from a given dynamic and continuous system. A feedback function only makes sense if this monitoring signal is looped back into an eventual control structure within a system and compared with a known desirable state. The difference between the feedback monitoring signal and the desirable state of the system gives the notion of error. The amount of error can guide corrective actions in the system that can bring the system back to the desirable state.

==H==
* '''[[Heterarchy]]''': An ordering of things in which there is no single peak or leading element, and in which the element that is dominant at a given time depends on the total situation. The term is often used in contrast to hierarchy, i.e. a vertical arrangement of entities (systems and their subsystems), usually ordered from the top downwards rather than from the bottom upwards.
* '''[[Holarchy]]''': A concept invented by [[Arthur Koestler]] to describe behavior that is partly a function of individual nature and partly a function of the nature of the embedding system, generally operating in a bottom upwards fashion.
* '''[[Holism]]''': A non-reductionist descriptive and investigative strategy for generating explanatory principles of whole systems. Attention is focused on the emergent properties of the whole rather than on the [[reductionism|reductionist]] behavior of the isolated parts.
* '''[[Holon (philosophy)]]''': A whole in itself as well as a part of a larger system.
* '''[[Homeorhesis]]''': A concept encompassing dynamical systems which return to a trajectory, as opposed to systems which return to a particular state, which is termed homeostasis.

* '''[[Metastability]]''': The ability of a non-equilibrium state to persist for some period of time.
* '''Model building''': A disciplined inquiry by which a [[Conceptual model|conceptual (abstract) representation]] of a system is constructed or a representation of expected outcomes/output is portrayed.

==O==
[[File:Basic Open System Model.gif|200px|thumb|right|Open System Model (basics)]]
* '''[[Open system (systems theory)|Open system]]''': A state and characteristics of that state in which a system continuously interacts with its environment. Open systems are those that maintain their state and exhibit the characteristics of openness previously mentioned.
* Structure–'''organization'''–process: ''See [[Structure–organization–process]] for various definitions.''

==P==
* '''[[wikt:process|Process]]''': A naturally occurring or designed sequence of actions of an agent or changes of properties or attributes of an object or system.
* '''Process model''': An organized arrangement of systems concepts and principles that portray the behavior of a system through time. Its metaphor is the "motion-picture" of "movie" of the system.
* Structure–organization–'''process''': ''See [[Structure–organization–process]] for various definitions.''

==R==
* '''[[Reductionism]]''': One kind of scientific orientation that seeks to understand phenomena by a) breaking them down into their smallest possible parts (a process known as analytic reductionism), or conversely b) conflating them to a one-dimensional totality (a process known as holistic reductionism).

==S==
* '''[[Self-organization]]''': A process in which the internal organization of a [[system]], normally an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], increases in [[complexity]] without being guided or managed by an outside source.
* '''[[Self-organizing systems]]''': Systems that typically (though not always) display [[emergence|emergent properties]].
*'''[[Steady state]]''': A state in which the variables (called [[state variable]]s) which define the behavior of a system or a process are unchanging in time. In [[chemistry]], it is a more general situation than [[dynamic equilibrium]]. If a [[system]] is in steady state then the recently observed behaviour of the system will continue into the future. In stochastic systems, the probabilities that various states will be repeated will remain constant.
* '''[[Strong emergence]]''': A type of [[emergence]] in which the emergent property is irreducible to its individual constituents.
* '''Structure'''–organization–process: ''See [[Structure–organization–process]] for various definitions.''
* '''Subsystem''': A major component of a system. It is made up of two or more interacting and interdependent components. Subsystems of a system interact in order to attain their own purpose(s) and the purpose(s) of the system in which they are embedded.
* '''Suprasystem''': The entity that is composed of a number of component systems organized in interacting relationships in order to serve their embedding suprasystem.
* '''[[Sustainability]]''': The ability of a system to maintain itself with no loss of function for extended periods of time. In human terms it is an ideal of creative and responsible stewardship of resources—human, natural, and financial—to generate stakeholder value while contributing to the well-being of current and future generations of all beings.
* '''Synchrony''' or '''[[synchronicity]]''': In engineering; concurrence of periods and/or phases; simultaneity of events or motions: contemporaneous occurrences. In evolutionary systems thinking; a fortunate coincidence of phenomenon and/or of events.
* '''[[Synergy]]''': The process by which a system generates emergent properties resulting in the condition in which a system may be considered more than the sum of its parts, or equal to the sum of its parts plus their relationships.
* '''Syntony''': In evolutionary systems thinking, evolutionary consonance, the occurrence and persistence of an evolutionarily tuned dynamic regime, a purposeful creative aligning and tuning with the evolutionary flows of one's milieu. In traditional radio engineering, a condition in which two oscillators have the same resonant frequency.
* '''[[Syntropy]]''': The process of [[negentropy]]-importation. A syntropic system is a [[dissipative structure]].
* '''[[Systems design]]''': A decision-oriented disciplined inquiry that aims at the construction of a model that is an abstract representation of a future system.
* '''[[Soft systems methodology]]''': A systemic approach for tackling real-world problematic situations, an approach which provides a [[Problem structuring methods|problem-structuring framework]] for users to deal with the kind of messy problem situations that lack a formal problem definition.

Both styles date to Late Paleoindian times and share similar lanceolate shapes.]]
'''Golondrina points''' (formerly '''Plainview Golondrina''') are [[lanceolate]] [[spear]] or [[Dart (missile)|dart]] [[projectile point]]s, of medium size, dated to the transitional [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian Period]], between 9000–7000 [[Before Present|BP]]. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem [[hafting|hafts]] and may have served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of [[Texas]], and points have also been discovered in [[Arkansas]] and [[Mexico]]. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the [[South Texas|South Texas Plains]], where the point is the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region.&lt;ref name='texasbeyondhistory' /&gt; The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (''golondrina'' in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the [[Plainview point]], to which it was originally thought to be related.

==Classification==
Classification of the Golondrina point was made by [[Texas Historical Commission]] archeologist [[LeRoy Johnson Jr.]] in 1964, after the discovery of a collection of unrecognized projectile points at the [[Devil's Mouth]] site in the [[Amistad Reservoir]], Texas. Initially believed to be related to the Plainview point classification, the new type was termed "Plainview Golondrina" by Johnson, who used a genus-species approach for the naming. This classification method sought to describe the relationship between the two types, placing Plainview as the genus, and Golondrina as the species, to highlight key similarities and differences. But by 1977, the genus-species classification approach had been discarded, and the name Golondrina alone was being used to represent the Devil's Mouth specimens.{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=18}} Subsequent research and technological analysis determined this type to be separate and distinct from the Plainsview point, and the name was shortened to simply "Golondrina" by Thomas C. Kelly in 1982.{{Sfn|Holliday|1997|p=154}}&lt;ref name='lithicsnet' /&gt;{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=134}} The type takes its name from a pronounced flaring of the basal corners (stem), which recall the split tail of a [[swallow]] (''golondrina'' in Spanish).{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=18}} The Golondrina is considered to be a [[Plano point]].{{Sfn|Vere|2004|p=8}}

==Description==
The Golondrina point is medium-sized and lanceolate-shaped with a lenticular cross-section that exhibits convex sides.&lt;ref name='lithicsnet' /&gt; The type displays a distinctive auriculate ("eared") stem with basal corners that flare outward. The blade edges are slightly serrated with a recurved outline—wide at the bottom, then narrowing before becoming wide and then thin again at the distal end, a so-called "fish shaped profile".{{Sfn|Hranicky|2010|p=204}}&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt; The [[Lithic reduction|flaking]] style is generally random, with no attention given to alignment of [[flake scars]]. However, collateral flaking—where parallel flakes have been removed equally, resulting in a median ridge on the blade edges—has also been observed in some specimens.&lt;ref name='lithicsnet' /&gt; The basal edge of the Golondrina presents concave with a deep basal notch that varies from a flattened, inverted, v-shape to recurved.{{Sfn|Hranicky|2010|p=204}} The Golondrina point can range in length from 32–61 mm, with a width ranging from 23–32 mm and a thickness from 6–8 mm.&lt;ref name='lithicsnet' /&gt; The width of the base ranges from 22–29 mm with a typical basal concavity of 4 mm or more. The Golondrina is [[unfluted]], without a longitudinal channel flake.{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=18}}

The point has an expanding [[hafting]] area where the width, upward from the stem, increases in size.  Analysis suggests that Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts either with or without foreshafts. They may have served a dual function as projectile points as well as butchering knives.&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt;{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=20}} By nature of a split-stem haft style, Golondrina points would not need to be deeply set, resulting in a largely exposed cutting edge.{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=20}} The hafting area, as well as the side and basal edges are usually ground dull.&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt;

Edwards [[chert]], Alibates [[agate]], and Tecovas [[jasper]] were the major materials utilized by Paleo-Indians in the Southern Plains for the manufacture of flaked stone implements.{{Sfn|Boldurian|Cotter|1999|p=23}} Chert was the most important stone for tool making throughout pre-historic central Texas and there were many available sites where it was acquired and [[Knapping|knapped]].{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=104}}

==Age and cultural affiliations==
Most Golondrina points have been dated to the Transitional [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian Period]], between 9000–7000 [[BP]], with excavation of [[Stratification (archeology)|stratified]] sites along with [[radiocarbon dating]] providing a definitive age.&lt;ref name=texasbeyondhistory /&gt;&lt;ref name='lithicsnet'/&gt; The first dating of Golondrina points was made after excavations of area C in the Devil's Mouth site which revealed Paleo-Indian projectile points that were radiocarbon assayed to 8700 BP. Later excavations in 1976, at the nearby [[Baker Cave]] in Texas, revealed a large [[hearth]] in the Golondrina stratum containing a wide variety of small game and plant remains left by early hunter gathers. This archaeological assemblage was termed Golondrina Complex, and the materials were attributed to the post-[[Pleistocene]] period. At the same site, Golondrina materials stratified near the base of a rock-shelter deposit were radiocarbon dated at 9000 BP&lt;ref name='Hester' /&gt;

Projectile points featuring more [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] characteristics, including [[Barbed point|early barbed]] and [[stemmed projectile points|early stemmed]], share an overlapping chronology with Golondrina.{{Sfn|Holliday|1997|p=155}}

==Distribution==
Golondrina points are widespread across much of central, southern, and western [[Texas]], with distribution extending northward along the [[Balcones Escarpment]]. They are particularly prevalent across the South Texas Plains, so much so as to be said to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the [[South Texas|South Texas Plains]] are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods.&lt;ref name='texasbeyondhistory' /&gt; Several sites have also been found in Arkansas as well as in the [[Lower Pecos]] Canyonlands and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] states of [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt;

==Comparison with other projectile points==
[[File:Dalton points.jpg|thumb|upright|Dalton points display a similar auriculated stem as the Golondrina which can lead to confusion between the two types. Dalton blade edges, however, are characteristically more serrated.&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt;]]
The Golondrina can be difficult to type because of its similarity to other point classifications. In particular the distinction between Golondrina and Plainview is not yet completely resolved.{{Sfn|Holliday|1997|p=154}}

===Plainview===
Past hypotheses have suggested mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or variant of the [[Plainview point|Plainview]] type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made from a lack of an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed.{{Sfn|Perttula|2004|p=20}} [[Stratigraphic]] evidence from the [[St. Mary's Hall site]] in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.{{Sfn|Justice|2002|p=83}}

===Others===
The [[Simpson point|Simpson]] and [[Suwannee point]]s, found in Florida and the Southeastern United States, are similar to the Golondrina in shape and age. The [[Dalton Tradition|Dalton point]], found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that they are part of a series.&lt;ref name=lithicsnet /&gt; Identification is made by examination of the blade edges—Golondrina exhibits much less serration.{{Sfn|Justice|2002|p=86}} The [[Meserve point|Meserve]] type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.&lt;ref name='lithicsnet' /&gt;{{Sfn|Justice|2002|p=86}}

[[Image:Schrumpfschlauch animated modified.gif|thumb|Animation of heat-shrink tubing, before and after shrinking]]
'''Heat-shrink tubing''' (or, commonly, ''heat shrink'' or ''heatshrink'') is a shrinkable [[plastic]] tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance and environmental protection for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in [[electrical work]]. It can also be used to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor [[wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]], and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heat-shrink tubing is ordinarily made of [[nylon]] or [[polyolefin]], which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.

Heat-shrink tubing is manufactured in a multitude of varieties and chemical makeups with the exact composition of each type being dependent on the intended application. From near microscopically-thin-wall tubing to rigid, heavy-wall tubing, each type has precise design and chemical additives that make it suitable for meeting any of a wide variety of environmental demands. Heat-shrink tubing is rated by its expansion ratio, a comparison of the differences in expansion and recovery rate.

==Use==
The unshrunk tubing is fitted on the wire before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, silicone lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material.&lt;ref name=howto/&gt; The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an [[oven]] or with a [[hot air gun]] or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a [[soldering iron]] held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a [[lighter]]. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers.&lt;ref name=howto/&gt; If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted and to a lesser extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%.&lt;ref name=howto&gt;[http://www.cableorganizer.com/learning-center/how-to/how-to-use-heat-shrink-tubing.htm cableorganizer.com: How to Use Heat Shrink Tubing]&lt;/ref&gt; The tubing provides good electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation]], protection from dust, [[solvent]]s and other foreign materials, and [[Deformation (mechanics)|mechanical strain]] relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.
[[File:Video of Heat shrink tube before and after.ogv|thumb|Video of adhesive-lined heat-shrink tubing shrinking]]

Some types of heat-shrink contain a layer of [[thermoplastic]] [[adhesive]] on the inside to help provide a good seal and better adhesion, while others rely on friction between the closely conforming materials. Heating non-adhesive shrink tube to very near the melting point may allow it to fuse to the underlying material as well{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

Heatshrink tubing is sometimes sold in pre-cut lengths, with a solder blob at the center of the length, as this configuration is specified by [[Daimler-Benz]] for automotive electrical repairs.&lt;ref name="autorepair"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilles|first=Tim|title=Automotive Service|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2015|pages=546|isbn=9781305445932|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ji5-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA546&amp;dq=polyolefin+heat+shrink+temperature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=polyolefin%20heat%20shrink%20temperature&amp;f=false|accessdate=2016-11-20|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One application that has used heatshrink in large quantities since the early 1970s is the covering of fibreglass [[helical antennas]], used extensively for 27&amp;nbsp;MHz [[CB Radio]]. Many millions of these antennas have been coated this way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Manufacture==
Heat-shrink tubing was invented by [[Raychem]] Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quality Today|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9U1WAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=IPC Industrial Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Patent 3,396,460|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3396460.pdf|year=1968|publisher=U.S. Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manufactured from a [[thermoplastic]] material such as [[polyolefin]], [[fluoropolymer]] (such as FEP, [[Teflon|PTFE]] or [[Kynar]]), [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[neoprene]], silicone elastomer or [[Viton]].

The process for making heat-shrink tubing is as follows: First the material is chosen based on its properties. The material is often compounded with other additives (such as colorants, stabilizers, etc.) depending on the application. A starting tube is extruded from the raw material. Next, the tube is taken to a separate process where it is cross-linked, usually through radiation. The cross-linking creates a memory in the tube. Then the tube is heated to just above the polymer's crystalline melting point and expanded in diameter, often by placing it in a vacuum chamber. While in the expanded state it is rapidly cooled. Later, when heated (above the crystalline melting point of the material) by the end user, the tubing shrinks back to its original extruded size.

The material is often [[cross-link]]ed through the use of [[electron beam]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000806 Accelerator apps: heat-shrink tubing], Symmetry, Dimensions of Particle Physics. V. 7, Issue 2, Apr. 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[peroxide]]s, or moisture. This cross-linking creates the memory in the tubing so that it is able to shrink back to its original extruded dimensions upon heating, producing a material called heat-shrink tubing.
For external use, heat-shrink tubing often has a [[UV stabilizers in plastics|UV stabiliser]] added.

==Materials==
Different applications require different materials:
* [[Elastomeric]] tubes maintain high flexibility even at low temperatures and meet stringent international specifications. Their operating temperature range is -75 to 150&amp;nbsp;°C. The material is resistant to many chemicals (including diesel and petrol) and has good resistance to [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], even in severe environmental conditions. A common shrink ratio is 2:1.&lt;ref name="3m"/&gt;
* [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP) is a lower-cost alternative to PTFE.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} It is a versatile electrical insulator and is inert to most chemicals and solvents. Additionally, it is highly resistant to extreme heat, cold, and [[Ultraviolet]] radiation, making it an excellent material for heat-shrink tubing applications.
* [[Polyolefin]] tubes, the most common kind,&lt;ref name="medrd"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_zDx7xAM6ccC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=polyolefin+heat+shrink&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=polyolefin&amp;f=false|page=19|last=Kucklick|first=Theodore R.|title=The Medical Device R&amp;D Handbook, Second Edition|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; have maximum continuous-use temperatures from -55 to 135&amp;nbsp;°C, and are used by the military, aerospace and railway industries. They are flexible and fast-shrinking, and manufactured in a wide range of colors (including clear), which can be used for color-coding wires. With the exception of black, they tend to have lower resistance to ultraviolet light; accordingly, only black is recommended for outdoor applications. Polyolefin tubing shrinks at 143°C.&lt;ref name="microfluidics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Xuefeng|first2=Kashan A.|last2=Shaikh|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8wyBp-vKbdcC&amp;dq=polyolefin+heat+shrink+temperature&amp;q=polyolefin#v=snippet&amp;q=polyolefin&amp;f=false|title=Microfluidics for Biological Applications|editor=Wei-Cheng Tian, Erin Finehout|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2009|pages=102|chapter=Interfacing Microfluidic Devices with the Macro World|isbn=9780387094809|accessdate=2016-11-20|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyolefin heat-shrink tubing typically shrinks 2:1 diametrically,&lt;ref name="modrail"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=65eZCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=polyolefin+heat+shrink&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=polyolefin&amp;f=false|page=88|last=Puckett|first=Larry|title=Wiring Your Model Railrod|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing, Co.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microfluidics" /&gt; but high-grade polyolefin heat-shrink is also available with a 3:1 ratio.&lt;ref name="3m"/&gt; Polyolefin tubing may withstand being touched with a soldering iron.&lt;ref name="modrail" /&gt;
* [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]] tubes are available in several colors and can be used outdoors.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} PVC heat-shrink tends to burn if touched with a soldering iron.&lt;ref name="modrail" /&gt;
* [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) tubes are intended for high temperature applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Silicone rubber]] offers excellent resistance to scrape abrasion and high flexibility. Its operating temperature range is -50 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Teflon|PTFE]] (fluoropolymer) tubes have a wide [[operating temperature]] range (-55 to 175&amp;nbsp;°C), a low [[coefficient of friction]], and high resistance to chemicals and punctures.&lt;ref name="3m"&gt;{{cite web|title=3M Heat Shrink catalogue|url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/EMDCI/Home/Products/HeatShrinkProducts/|publisher=3M|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Viton]], another fluoropolymer with high chemical resistance, is widely used in hydraulic equipment. It is highly flexible, with a very wide operating temperature range of -55 to 220&amp;nbsp;°C, making it suitable for protecting sensitive devices against heat.&lt;ref name="3m"/&gt;

Other special materials exist, offering qualities such as resistance to diesel and aviation fuels, and there is also woven fabric, providing increased abrasion resistance in harsh environments.

==Types==
Heat-shrink tubing is available in a variety of colors for [[Electronic color code|color-coding]] of wires and connections. In the early twenty-first century heat-shrink tubing started to be used for [[case modding|PC modding]] to tidy up the interior of computers and provide an appearance considered pleasing{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In response to this opening market{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, manufacturers started producing heat-shrink tubing in [[luminosity|luminous]] and [[ultraviolet|UV]] reactive varieties.

Although usually used for insulation, heat-shrink tubing with a conductive lining is also available, for use on joints which are not [[Soldering|soldered]].

Specialty heat-shrink tubing, known as "solder sleeves", have a tube of solder inside of the heat-shrink tubing, allowing the heat source to electrically join the two wires by melting the solder and simultaneously insulate the junction with the tubing. Solder sleeves also commonly contain a ring of heat-activated sealant on the inside of each end of the tubing, allowing the connection to also be made waterproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inventables.com/technologies/solder-sleeves|title=Solder Sleeves: Solder, heat shrink and waterproof your splices in one operation|publisher=Inventables|accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat-shrink end caps, closed at one end, are used to insulate the exposed cut ends of insulated wires.

'''Janice Elaine Voss''' (October 8, 1956 – February 6, 2012) was an American [[engineer]] and a [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. She flew in space five times, jointly holding the record for American women.&lt;ref name="rr110711"/&gt; Voss died on February 6, 2012, from [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="cs120207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ms120207"/&gt;

==Education==
Voss graduated from [[Minnechaug Regional High School]] in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, in 1972.&lt;ref name="ames0301"/&gt; She earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from [[Purdue University]] while working on a co-op at the [[Johnson Space Center]]. She earned an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]] from [[MIT]] in 1977. After studying space physics at [[Rice University]] from 1977 to 1978, she went on to earn a doctorate in aeronautics/astronautics from MIT in 1987.

==Career==
Voss was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1990 and flew as a mission specialist on missions [[STS-57]] (1993), [[STS-63]] (1995), [[STS-83]] (1997), [[STS-94]] (1997) and [[STS-99]] (2000).&lt;ref name="jscbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spfde"/&gt; All of her flights included another female astronaut as well.&lt;ref name="women"/&gt;

During her career as an astronaut, she participated in the first Shuttle [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with the [[Mir space station]] on STS-63: it flew around the station, testing communications and inflight manoeuvres for later missions, but did not actually dock. As an STS-99 crew member on the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]], she and her fellow crew members worked continuously in shifts to produce what was at the time the most accurate digital topographical map of the Earth.&lt;ref name="cs120207"/&gt;

From October 2004 to November 2007, she was Science Director for NASA's [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Space Observatory]], an Earth-orbiting satellite designed to find Earth-like [[extrasolar planet]]s in nearby solar systems. It was launched in March 2009 and was still operational at the time of her death at age 55 from breast cancer.

At the Astronaut Office Station Branch, she served as the Payloads Lead. She also worked for [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] in flight operations support.&lt;ref name="jscbio"/&gt;

==Cygnus==
The [[Cygnus CRS Orb-2]] capsule was named ''SS Janice Voss'' in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.space-travel.com/reports/The_ISS_just_dumped_3300_lbs_of_space_trash_to_burn_up_in_Earths_atmosphere_999.html |title= The ISS just dumped 3,300 lbs of space trash to burn up in Earth's atmosphere |author= Matt Bradwell |work= UPI |publisher= SpaceDaily |date= 15 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VOSS Model==
The VOSS Model is a scaled model of the solar system, dedicated to Janice Voss, located at Purdue University’s Discovery Park in West Lafayette, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://engineering.purdue.edu/vossmod/ |title= The VOSS Model - Purdue University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VOSS Model.jpg|thumb|The cornerstone of the Visiting Our Solar System interactive exhibit in Discovery Park is the design of the sun, which is 45 feet in diameter. Surrounding the VOSS sun (pictured here) are the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune set into a series of curved, 6-foot-high walls.

Starting in 2007, Julep opened four nail parlors in the Seattle area that offer manicures, pedicures, facials, and waxing.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chapman|first1=Lizette|title=Julep Beauty Raises $30M to Give Big Beauty a Makeover with Crowdsourcing|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/04/14/julep-beauty-raises-30m-to-give-big-beauty-a-makeover-with-crowdsourcing/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SBM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilmes|first1=Kelsey|title=Jane Park’s winning strategy at Julep|url=http://seattlebusinessmag.com/article/jane-park’s-winning-strategy-julep|publisher=Seattle Business Magazine|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Jane Park saw a rise in popularity for nail care products, prompting her to focus on selling new products online and through television.&lt;ref name="SBM" /&gt; While expanding the parlors as a "third place" for women was the initial business model,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nailsmag.com/article/40332/a-taste-of-southern-hospitality-in-seattle&lt;/ref&gt; Park now says she uses the parlors as a testing ground for new products.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Amy|title=Julep raises $10 million for beauty-brand expansion|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020449265_julepfundingxml.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julep moved into  e-commerce in 2008. The company’s website is now its main sales channel, making available more than 300 new products on its website in 2013. Julep products are also available through their Seattle parlors, through retailers such as [[Sephora]], [[Nordstrom]] and on TV though [[QVC]].&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tice|first1=Carol|title=How Social Media Is Fueling The Next $1B Beauty Brand|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/caroltice/2014/01/22/girlfriend-power/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, it opened its first pop-up store in New York City.&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Rheana|title=Julep's first NYC pop-up launches today|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the-powder-room/julep-nyc-pop-up-launches-today-blog-entry-1.1622928|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Julep reportedly tripled its revenue in 2013.&lt;ref name=Geek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soper|first1=Taylor|title=Venture-backed beauty startup Julep is crowdfunding its new bendable nail-polishing tool|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/julep-crowdfunding-new-product-plie/|publisher=Geekwire|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julep is backed by venture capital firms [[Andreessen Horowitz]], Altimeter Capital, [[Azure Capital Partners]], [[Madrona Venture Group]], [[Maveron]], as well as celebrity backers such as [[Will Smith]] and [[Jay Z]].&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt;  Other investors include AFSquare, Alliance of Angels, Atom Factory, [[Creative Artists Agency]], [[Overbrook Entertainment]], Precedent Investments, [[Roc Nation]], [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]], Version One Ventures, and Western Technology Investment.&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Venture&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Rebecca|title=Cosmetics startup Julep whizzes by rivals with its crowdsourced approach to making makeup|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/01/28/cosmetics-startup-julep-whizzes-by-rivals-with-its-crowdsourced-approach-to-making-products/|publisher=Venture Beat|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julep has raised $56M in [[venture capital financing]] to date.&lt;ref name=TCrunch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Leena|title=Beauty And E-Commerce Brand Julep Raises $30M To Disrupt The $160B Cosmetics Industry|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/beauty-and-ecommerce-brand-julep-raises-30m-for-to-disrupt-the-cosmetics-industry/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julep currently employs around 200 people and plans on using funding to accelerate the introduction of new products and other operating activities.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While Jane Park and Julep generally enjoy a favorable reception in most media articles (see reference section below), employee reviews on Glassdoor suggest there are problems with retaining staff, and speak to issues with management and an inability to use vacation time—including accounts of former employees not being reimbursed for earned vacation time upon leaving the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employee Reviews|url=http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Julep-Reviews-E460580.htm|publisher=Glassdoor|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Julep's subscription service came under fire when the company received an "F" rating from the Better Business Bureau. The BBB's David Quinlan said about the 173 total complaints made during that period, "It's an alarming amount. I mean, think about it, 113 people have complained about this company to us and not one of them has received a response back." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Connie|title=Nail polish retailer Julep vows to polish up customer service|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/consumer/Nail-polish-retailer-Julep-vows-to-polish-up-customer-service-275851891.html|publisher=Komo News|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB notified Julep on Aug. 19, 2014 of the complaint pattern, but its website noted that the company has not responded to its request to “address the pattern.” Julep responded with a statement blaming the influx of complaints on a surge in business and shipping errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soper|first1=Taylor|title=Beauty startup Julep receives ‘F’ rating from Better Business Bureau over subscription program|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/julep-rating-bbb/|publisher=GeekWire|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2015, Julep still maintains an "F" rating from the Better Business Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBB Business Review|url=http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/magazines-subscription-agents/julep-in-seattle-wa-22692965|publisher=Better Business Bureau|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, Julep has a "B-" rating from the Better Business Bureau.

In March of 2015, Julep announced that they were laying off 8% of their staff. According to CEO Jane Park, seventeen employees were laid off as part of a decision that "align[s] with Julep’s greatest long-term opportunities and to best position the company for success and category leadership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=John|title=Seattle cosmetics startup Julep cuts 8% of staff|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-cosmetics-startup-julep-cuts-8-percent-of-staff/|website=Geekwire|publisher=Geekwire|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Julep designs, produces and sells its own products, working with scientists and manufacturers that also work for larger brands.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Claire Cain|title=A Start-Up Aims to Upend E-Commerce by Selling Nail Polish|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/a-start-up-aims-to-upend-e-commerce-by-selling-nail-polish/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=2|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells over 200 shades of nail polish,&lt;ref name=Julep&gt;{{cite web|title=Nail Polish|url=http://www.julep.com/shop/nail-polish.html#.|publisher=Julep|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which is given a woman’s name. It has also expanded its line into makeup and skin care products.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

In 2014, Julep launched its Plié Wand, an ergonomic nail polishing brush that bends, pivots, and attaches to the top of nail polish caps.&lt;ref name=BizWomen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=I-Chun|title=Jane Park's Julep just put a nice polish on crowdfunding|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/2014/03/jane-parks-julep-just-put-a-nice-polish-on.html|publisher=Biz Journals|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for the wand was first tested through a $75,000 crowdfunding campaign.&lt;ref name="Geek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Venture" /&gt;

The company promotes its products as free of fumes and toxins.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI&gt;{{cite web|title=Julep Nail Parlor: SassyBusiness of the Week!|url=Julep Nail Parlor: SassyBusiness of the Week!|publisher=Seattle PI|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julep Maven==
Julep introduced its monthly subscription service, Julep Maven, in 2011. Subscribers or “Mavens” pay a monthly fee to receive custom boxes of nail polish and makeup.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; To complement Julep’s [[crowdfunding]] campaigns, Mavens may also act as beta-testers in the company’s Idea Lab, answering surveys and posting on social media, allowing Julep to see how their products in development are being received.&lt;ref name=FC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brodesser-Akner|first1=Taffy|authorlink=Taffy Brodesser-Akner|title=Minting Julep: How Former Starbucks Exec Jane Park is Reimagining the Beauty Business|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3023331/jane-park-minting-julep|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Laura|title=Women in Business Q&amp;A: Jane Park, CEO of Julep Beauty|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-dunn/women-in-business-qa-jane_b_5608852.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''[[Souvlaki]]'''
|c. 17th century BC
| Excavations in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]], unearthed [[Fire dog|sets of stone cooking supports]] used before the 17th century BC. In the supports there are pairs of indentations that were likely used for holding skewers. The line of holes in the base allowed the [[coals]] to be supplied with [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=1&amp;artId=382454&amp;dt=04/02/2011#ixzz1D5R96Hvx To Vima (in Greek)], 6-2-2011 (picture 2 of 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''[[Theatre]]'''
|c. 6th century BC
| Theatre, in its modern sense, involving the performance of pre-written tragic, dramatic and comedic plays for an audience, first originated in [[Classical Athens]] in the 6th century BC &lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented theatre" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Winches may have been employed even earlier in [[Assyria]], though. By the 4th century BC, winch and pulley hoists were regarded by [[Aristotle]] as common for architectural use (''Mech''. 18; 853b10-13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Coulton, J.

==Discoveries==

===Mathematics===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
*[[Deductive reasoning|Mathematical deduction]] - [[Thales of Miletus]], considered by Aristotle to be the first Greek philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to be the first individual to apply [[deductive reasoning]] to produce mathematical proofs, particularly in the field of [[geometry]] &lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thales' theorem]] - One of the most basic theorems of geometry, stating that whenever an angle is drawn from two ends of the diameter of a circle to any third point on its circumference, the angle formed at the third point is always a perfect right angle. The phenomenon was known empirically to the [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] but was first [[Mathematical proof|proved]] in the 6th century BC by [[Thales of Miletus]], making him the first known individual to whom a [[Greek mathematics#Classical period|mathematical discovery]] has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Intercept theorem]] - Also attributed to [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] is the fundamental theorem of geometry that states that the ratios of corresponding sides of [[similar triangles]] (i.e. triangles formed from the intersection of two common lines with two different parallel lines) are equal. Thales is said to have used his theorem to determine the height of pyramids by measuring the lengths of their shadows. &lt;ref&gt; [[Hieronymus of Rhodes|Hieronymus]] (3rd century BC) about Thales: "''Hieronymus says that [Thales] measured the height of the pyramids by the shadow they cast, taking the observation at the hour when our shadow is of the same length as ourselves (i.e. as our own height).''". Pliny writes: "''Thales discovered how to obtain the height of pyramids and all other similar objects, namely, by measuring the shadow of the object at the time when a body and its shadow are equal in length.''". However [[Plutarch]] gives an account, that may suggest Thales knowing the intercept theorem or at least a special case of it:"''.. without trouble or the assistance of any instrument [he] merely set up a stick at the extremity of the shadow cast by the pyramid and, having thus made two triangles by the intercept of the sun's rays, ... showed that the pyramid has to the stick the same ratio which the shadow [of the pyramid] has to the shadow [of the stick]''". (Source: [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Thales.html ''Thales biography''] of the [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|MacTutor]], the (translated) original works of

'''Magnadata Group''', also known as '''Magnadata International''', is a specialised printing company in Boston in Lincolnshire. Since 2010 it has had the national contract for producing the UK's train tickets. It is one of the main companies in Europe that can produce magnetic ID cards for a company's workforce. It claims to be a global leader in RFID ([[radio-frequency identification]]) technology. The technology is referred to as [[smart ticketing]].

==History==
===Dapag===
Dapag had been formed in 1943. It made machines for printing tickets, labels and tags. It was based at Plumtree Court in EC4 in London, near where the A40 and [[A201 road|A201]] meet at [[Holborn Viaduct]]. It employed around 170 staff.

===Norprint===
Norcros was founded on 29 May 1956. Dapag was part of Norcros. The name Norcros comes from [[Normanby, North Lincolnshire]], home of [[Normanby Hall]]. A Director of the company was John Vincent Sheffield, former [[High Sheriff of Lincolnshire]] from 1944-5, and great-uncle of the wife of [[David Cameron]]. Other members of the Sheffield family - Edmund and George - were directors.

Norprint International was based on Norfolk Street in Boston. It had a division on ''Valley Road'' in [[Dovercourt]] on the Essex coast with 550 staff. Norprint also made ticket printing machines. Norprint claimed to be Europe's largest producer of industrial and retail labelling systems, and the largest in the world outside of America.

In early 1968 it helped to start the ''[[I'm Backing Britain]]'' campaign, by running off the promotional stickers for free. Before the days of barcodes in supermarkets, Norprint made hand-held price labellers, used by the main supermarkets; these were made in Harwich.

In April 1989 it received a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]] for its ''magnetic striped and encoded tickets and payment tokens''.

Norprint produced tickets for airlines and the [[London Underground]]. It was owned by [[Norcros]] plc.

On 25 June 1998 Norcros put Norprint up for sale. In July 1998 Norprint was bought by a [[management buyout]] (MBO) for £13.7 million. After the buyout it was known as Norprint Labelling Systems.

In 2005 it developed the ''Nortag'', a small inconspicuous RFID label on products to combat shoplifting, which won [[The Queen's Award for Enterprise: Innovation (Technology) (2005)|The Queen's Award for Enterprise: Innovation (Technology)]] in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norprint.co.uk/index.php/products/nortag1/ Nortag]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as [[electronic article surveillance]] (EAS). The Nortag took seven years to develop.

Customers include the [[New York City Subway|New York Metro]], Dublin Bus, Valencia Metro ([[Metrovalencia]]), Sydney Rail and [[London Underground]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Magnadata===
On 7 December 2000, Magnadata was visited by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], in [[Special Representative for International Trade and Investment|his capacity]] as Vice-Chairman of [[British Trade International]], being accompanied by [[Bridget Cracroft-Eley]].

In February 2006 Magnadata, also based in Boston, bought Norprint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printweek.com/news/541342/ Magnadata February 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913132342/http://www.printweek.com/news/541342/ |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norprint had around 220 staff and Magnadata had around 200.

===UK train tickets===
In 1987 Magnadata was the first company to produce [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic strip]] tickets for [[British Rail]]. For this it received the [[The Queen's Award for Enterprise: Innovation (Technology) (1987)|Queen’s Award for Technology in 1989]]; it was the first printing company to receive this award.

In August 2010 it was awarded the £24 million contract to produce the magnetic strip tickets for train tickets in the UK for the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] (ATOC). This is for around 750 million tickets a year at over 2500 railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-11014815 ATOC contract in August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is based in the north of Boston in [[Lincolnshire]] on the B1183, which follows alongside the [[Witham Navigable Drains|Maud Foster Drain]]. [[Haven High Academy]], a [[secondary school]], is next door.

===Magnadata USA===
Magnadata USA is based in [[Toms River, New Jersey]].

===Magnadata Pty===
In May 2002 it bought Spectron Transit Tickets Pty Ltd, of Australia, which is now Magnadata Pty, based in [[St Marys, New South Wales]].

===Norprint===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Norprint is a subsidiary of Magnadata. It has thirty printing presses running 24 hours a day at the site in Boston, and claims to be the largest printing facility in the UK. It produces over 10 billion labels per year. Norprint claims to be the UK's largest distributor and reseller of [[Thermal transfer printer|thermal transfer ribbons]] for printers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7994">[[File:CanadianChequeSamplePAR.png|thumb|[[Cheque]] sample for a fictional bank in Canada using [[Crossing of cheques|par-crossing]] MICR encoding for cashing in the United States]]

'''MICR code''' is a character-recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to ease the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents. The MICR encoding, called the ''MICR line'', is at the bottom of cheques and other vouchers and typically includes the document-type indicator, [[bank code]], [[bank account number]], cheque number, cheque amount, and a control indicator. The technology allows MICR readers to scan and read the information directly into a data-collection device. Unlike [[barcodes]] and similar technologies, MICR characters can be read easily by humans. The MICR E-13B font has been adopted as the international standard in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1004:1995, but the CMC-7 font is widely used in Europe, Brazil, Mexico and some other countries.

== Fonts ==
[[Image:MICR char.svg|thumb|500px|The 14 characters of the E-13B font. The control characters bracketing each numeral block are (from left to right) ''transit'', ''on-us'', ''amount'', and ''dash''.]]
[[Image:Cmc7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of the CMC-7 MICR font. Shown are the 15 characters of the CMC-7 font. The control characters after the numerals are (from left to right) ''internal'', ''terminator'', ''amount'', ''routing'', and an unused character.]]
There are two major MICR [[typeface|fonts]] in use: E-13B and CMC-7. E-13B has a 14 character set, while CMC-7 has 15—the 10 numeric characters along with control characters.

The MICR E-13B font is the standard in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. Besides decimal digits, it also contains the following symbols:

* ⑆ (transit: used to delimit a [[bank code]]), 
* ⑈ (on-us: used to delimit a customer account number),
* ⑇ (amount: used to delimit a transaction amount), 
* ⑉ (dash: used to delimit parts of numbers—e.g., routing numbers or account numbers).

Major European countries, including France and Italy, and others like Brazil and Mexico use the CMC-7 font, developed by [[Groupe Bull]] in 1957.

==MICR reader==
MICR characters are printed on documents in either of the MICR fonts. The ink used in the printing is a magnetic ink or toner, usually containing [[iron oxide]]. The MICR text is passed before a MICR reader. The ink in the plane of the paper is first magnetized. Then the characters are passed over a MICR reader head, a device similar to the playback head of a [[tape recorder]]. As each character passes over the head it produces a unique [[waveform]] that can be easily identified by the system.

The use of MICR allows the characters to be read reliably even if they have been overprinted or obscured by other marks, such as cancellation stamps and signature{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. The error rate for the magnetic scanning of a typical cheque is smaller than with [[optical character recognition]] systems{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. For well printed MICR documents, the "can't read" rate is usually less than 1%{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} while the substitution rate (misread rate) is in the order of 1 per 100,000 characters{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

Thus, when the cheque is inserted in the MICR reader (also called a cheque sorting machine), it can read the MICR code even if there are other marks or stamps on it. Thus, the machine easily finds out which bank branch and location the cheque belongs to. Eventually, the cheques are sorted bank, branch and location wise by MICR reader automatically based on the MICR code. Sorting of cheques is done as per the geographical coverage of banks in a nation.

== Unicode ==
{{Main|Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)}}

MICR characters were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 1993 with the release of version 1.1.

The Unicode block that includes MICR characters is called Optical Character Recognition and covers U+2440–U+245F:

==History==
Before the mid-1940s, [[cheque]]s were processed manually using the Sort-A-Matic or Top Tab Key method. The processing and [[clearance of cheques]] was very time consuming and was a significant cost in cheque clearance and bank operations. As the number of cheques increased, ways were sought for automating the process. Standards were developed to ensure uniformity in financial institutions. By the mid-1950s, the Stanford Research Institute and General Electric&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ARTICLES: Magnetic Ink Character Recognition|journal=Computers and Automation|date=Oct 1956|volume=5|issue=10|pages=10-16, 44 (12 - ''Other Sessions'')|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/computersAndAutomation/|others=195610.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer Laboratory had developed the first automated system to process cheques using MICR. The same team also developed the E13B MICR font.  "E" refers to the font being the fifth considered, and "B" to the fact that it was the second version.  The "13" refers to the 0.013 inch character grid.

In 1958, the [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) adopted E13B font as the MICR standard for [[negotiable document]]s in the United States. By the end of 1959, the first cheques had been printed using MICR. The ABA adopted MICR as its standard because machines could read MICR accurately, and MICR could be printed using existing technology. In addition, MICR remained machine readable, even through overstamping, marking, mutilation and more.

MICR technology has been adopted in many countries, with some variations. In 1963, [[ANSI]] adopted the ABA’s E13B font as the American standard for MICR printing.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI standard X9.27-1995 and ANSI standard ANS X9.7-1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Although compliance with MICR standards is voluntary in the United States, their use with [[cheque]]s is almost universal. E13B MICR has also been standardized as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1004:1995. The E13B font was adopted as the standard in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other countries.

The CMC-7 font was developed in [[France]] by [[Groupe Bull]] in 1957.  It was adopted as the MICR standard in Argentina, France, Italy, and some other European countries.

In the 1960s, the MICR fonts became a symbol of modernity or futurism, leading to the creation of lookalike "computer" [[typeface]]s that imitated the appearance of the MICR fonts, which unlike real MICR fonts, had a full character set.

MICR, or E-13B, is also used to encode information in other applications like: sales promotions, coupons, credit cards, airline tickets, insurance premium receipts, deposit tickets, and more.

E13b is the version specifically developed for Offset Litho  printing. There was a subtly different version for letterpress, called E13a. Also, there was a Rival system named 'Fred' (Figure Reading Electronic Device) which used figures that looked more conventional.

She was an electrical and electronics engineering educator. She was the author of several nonfiction books&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Circuit Analysis|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/electric-circuit-analysis-margaret-r-taber/1000980387|website=Barnes and Noble|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and articles on computer programming.

==Early life==
Taber was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], as the only child to Wynn Orr and Margaret Ruth (Feldman) Stevens. Her father was an [[electrical engineer]]. Her mother was a department store clerk. They [[divorce]]d and her mother raised her alone during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=transcript&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kata|first1=Lauren|title=INTERVIEW WITH MARGARET TABER, MAY 12, 2003|url=http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/images/PDFs/swe%20women_transcript%20taber.pdf|website=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] when Taber was in the sixth grade. Taber described her child-self as a [[tomboy]]. She had played with toy soldiers/sailors, pretended war, and owned a sailor suit. Before attending Wilbur Wright Junior High School, Tabor discovered the value of [[Work ethic|hard work]]. Tabor's favorite class at this point was [[physical education]]; she wanted to be a gym teacher.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

At South High School in [[Akron, Ohio]], Taber was inspired by many teachers. There was a math teacher who seated students according to their score on the math tests. Instead of intimidating Taber, it inspired her to compete for the first row. Taber was inspired by another unnamed teacher, who was so dedicated to their future in college that she taught [[physics]] at her own expense. The physics class was not provided by the school. Her [[mechanical drawing]] teacher allowed her to progress at her own rate. During Taber's time in high school, she decided on [[electrical engineering]], because she believed it "took math the furthest of all the engineering".&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

==Education==
In 1958, Margaret graduated from [[Cleveland State University]] in Cleveland, Ohio. She had two bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and engineering science, with an emphasis on mathematics. In 1967, Taber obtaining her Master of Science in Engineering from the [[University of Akron]]. In 1976, Margaret received an Ed.D. from [[Nova Southeastern University]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].

==Career==
Taber was a licensed professional engineer and a certified engineering technologist.&lt;ref name="sweprofile" /&gt;

Taber began her career at the Tocco Division of The Ohio Crankshaft Company as an engineering trainee and Development Engineer. Briefly, she was a digital systems consultant for Design and Development Inc. Then, Taber began working in academia as an instructor in Electrical-Electronic Engineering at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio. She went on to become an assistant, associate, and full professor as well as Chairperson of Engineering Technologies at the College. In 1979, she became an Associate Professor at Purdue University and an Educational Consultant and Writer for the Cleveland Institute of Electronics.&lt;ref name="sollerbaker" /&gt;

Taber was the only woman faculty member of Purdue University's Department of Electrical Engineering Technology. She received tenure as an associate professor, was made full professor (1983-2000), and became a Professor Emeritus in 2000.&lt;ref name="sweprofile" /&gt;

Taber has designed, developed, and taught many fundamental and advanced microprocessor courses. She has also written several books/manuals and articles on computer programming.&lt;ref name="sweprofile" /&gt;

===Professional Influence===
Taber was extremely supportive of women in engineering.

When Taber retired, Purdue University dedicated the Margaret R. Taber Microcomputer Lab in her honor.&lt;ref name=purduefacilities&gt;{{cite web|title=Facilities|url=https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/schools/engineering-technology/about/facilities|website=Purdue Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, she established the Dr. Margaret R. Taber Scholarship for Women in Engineering to provide for outstanding women engineering students at the University of Akron. In 2007, she established a second scholarship fund for women in Electronic Engineering Technology.&lt;ref name="sollerbaker" /&gt;

===Awards===
In 1987, Dr. Taber received the 1987 Distinguished Engineering Educator Award from the [[Society of Women Engineers]]. In 1991, she was honored with the Helen B. Schleman Gold Medallion Award at [[Purdue University]]. She also received the Survivorship Award from the Greater Lafayette community. In 1994, she received the Outstanding Alumni Award from the [[University of Akron]]. In 2002, Taber received the Lifetime Leadership award from [[Cleveland State University]].

In 2009, Taber received the President’s Award for Leadership, Volunteer Service &amp; Philanthropy from Rainbow Acres in [[Arizona]]. In 2012, Margaret was honored with the YWCA Woman of Distinction Award for her "willingness to go the extra mile, extreme tenacity, enthusiasm for life and reliability, a true inspiration for many."

==Personal life==
Margaret married William J. Taber on September 6, 1958. Her husband's death preceded hers by 2 days, on June 8, 2015.&lt;ref name="sollerbaker" /&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Dr. Taber spent her retirement volunteering for organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]], CanSurmount 1993-1998, and the computer lab of the Lafayette Adult Reading Academy. Taber was a dedicated member of the Federated Church for 35 years. She had a passion for mission work. She volunteered at Rainbow Acres in Arizona for 25 years to help adults with developmental disabilities, including the creation and ongoing support of a computer lab and the teaching of computer skills.&lt;ref name="sollerbaker" /&gt;

The '''nanocar''' is a molecule designed in 2005 at [[Rice University]] by a group headed by Professor [[James Tour]]. Despite the name, the original nanocar does not contain a [[Synthetic molecular motors|molecular motor]], hence, it is not really a car. Rather, it was designed to answer the question of how [[fullerene]]s move about on metal surfaces; specifically, whether they roll or slide (they roll).

The molecule consists of an H-shaped 'chassis' with [[fullerene]] groups attached at the four corners to act as wheels.

When dispersed on a [[gold]] surface, the molecules attach themselves to the surface via their fullerene groups and are detected via [[Scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]]. One can deduce their orientation as the frame length is a little shorter than its width.

Upon heating the surface to 200&amp;nbsp;°C the molecules move forward and back as they roll on their fullerene "wheels". The nanocar is able to roll about because the fullerene wheel is fitted to the [[alkyne]] "axle" through a carbon-carbon [[single bond]]. The hydrogen on the neighboring carbon is no great obstacle to free rotation. When the temperature is high enough, the four carbon-carbon bonds rotate and the car rolls about.  Occasionally the direction of movement changes as the molecule pivots. The rolling action was confirmed by Professor Kevin Kelly, also at Rice, by pulling the molecule with the tip of the [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]].

==Independent early conceptual contribution==
The concept of a nanocar built out of molecular "tinkertoys" was first hypothesized at the Fifth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology (November 1997).&lt;ref&gt;M T Michalewicz [http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Abstracts/Michabst.html Nano-cars: Feynman's dream fulfilled or the ultimate challenge to Automotive Industry]. Publication abstract. The Fifth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology, [[Palo Alto]] (1997 November 5–8)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, an expanded version was published in [[Annals of Improbable Research]].&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Michalewicz [http://www.quantum-pi.com/papers/air2fin.pdf Nano-cars: Enabling Technology for building Buckyball Pyramids], Annals of Improbable Research, Vol. IV, No. 3 March/April 1998&lt;/ref&gt; These papers supposed to be a not-so-serious contribution to a fundamental debate on the limits of bottom-up Drexlerian nanotechnology and conceptual limits of how far mechanistic analogies advanced by [[Eric Drexler]] could be carried out. The important feature of this nanocar concept was the fact that all molecular component tinkertoys were known and synthetized molecules (alas, some very exotic and only recently discovered, e.g. [[staffane]]s, and notably – ferric wheel, 1995), in contrast to some Drexlerian diamondoid structures that were only postulated and never synthesized; and the drive system that was embedded in a ferric wheel and driven by inhomogeneous or time-dependent magnetic field of a substrate – an "engine in a wheel" concept.

The '''Nanodragster''', dubbed the world's smallest [[hot rod]], is a molecular nanocar.&lt;ref name=ol/&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34938564/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=World's tiniest hot rod spurs nanotechnologies |last=Hadhazy|first=Adam|date=Jan 19, 2010|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design improves on previous nanocar designs and is a step towards creating [[molecular machines]]. The name comes from the nanocar's resemblance to a [[Drag racing|dragster]], as it has a shorter axle with smaller wheels in the front and a larger axle with larger wheels in the back.

The nanocar was developed at [[Rice University| Rice University’s]] Richard E. Smalley Institute Nanoscale Science and Technology by the team of [[James Tour]], Kevin Kelly and other colleagues involved in its research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Texas scientists develop 'nanodragster'  | url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=36312 | work= Nano Tech Now| accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nl&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directional Control in Thermally Driven Single-Molecule Nanocars|author=Shirai, Y.|journal=Nano Lett.|year=2005|volume=5|doi=10.1021/nl051915k|pmid=16277478|issue=11|pages=2330–34|bibcode = 2005NanoL...5.2330S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous nanocar developed was 3 to 4 nanometers which was a little&lt;!--wider?--&gt; over&lt;sup&gt;[the width of?]&lt;/sup&gt; a strand of [[DNA]] and was around 20,000 times thinner than a human hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Previous Nanocar Specifications | url= http://www.tfot.info/content/view/102/61/| work=The Future of Things | accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nanocars were built with carbon [[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyball]]s for their four wheels, which made it need {{convert|400|°F|°C|sigfig=2}} to get it moving. On the other hand, a nanocar which utilized p-[[carborane]] wheels moves as if on ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World's Smallest Hot Rod Made Using Nanotechnology| url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/nano-dragster-100119.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations led to the production of nanocars which had both wheel designs.

The Nanodragster is 50,000 times thinner than a human hair and has a top speed of 0.014 millimeters per hour (0.0006 in/h).&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 'Nanodragster' Races Toward the Future of Molecular Machines| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100106193320.htm | work= Science Daily | accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Nanodragster' races toward the future of molecular machines | url=http://www.nanotechwire.com/news.asp?nid=9244 | work= Nano Techwire | accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear wheels are spherical [[fullerene]] molecules, or buckyballs, composed of sixty carbon atoms each, which are attracted to a dragstrip that is made up of a very fine layer of [[gold]]. This design also enabled Tour’s team to operate the device at lower temperatures.

The nanodragster and other nano-machines are designed for use in transporting items. The technology can be used in manufacturing computer circuits and electronic components, or in conjunction with pharmaceuticals inside the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Model Nanocar on the Showroom Floor | url= http://www.tfot.info/content/view/102/61/| work=The Future of Things | accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tour also speculated that the knowledge gained from the nanocar research would help build efficient [[Catalytic convertor|catalytic systems]] in the future.

==Electrically driven directional motion of a four-wheel molecule on a metal surface==
Kudernac ''et al.'' described a specially designed molecule that has four motorized "wheels". By depositing the molecule on a copper surface and providing them with sufficient energy from electrons of a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]] they were able to drive some of the molecules in a specific direction, much like a car, being the first single molecule capable to continue moving in the same direction across a surface. Inelastic electron tunnelling induces conformational changes in the rotors and propels the molecule across a copper surface. By changing the direction of the rotary motion of individual motor units, the self-propelling molecular 'four-wheeler' structure can follow random or preferentially linear trajectories. This design provides a starting point for the exploration of more sophisticated molecular mechanical systems, perhaps with complete control over their direction of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electrically driven directional motion of a four-wheeled molecule on a metal surface|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature10587|year=2011|last1=Kudernac|first1=Tibor|last2=Ruangsupapichat|first2=Nopporn|last3=Parschau|first3=Manfred|last4=MacIá|first4=Beatriz|last5=Katsonis|first5=Nathalie|last6=Harutyunyan|first6=Syuzanna R.|last7=Ernst|first7=Karl-Heinz|last8=Feringa|first8=Ben L.|volume=479|issue=7372|pages=208–11|pmid=22071765|bibcode = 2011Natur.479..208K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This electrically driven nanocar was built under supervision of [[University of Groningen]] chemist [[Bernard L. Feringa]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 2016 for his pioneering work on [[nanomotors]], together with [[Jean-Pierre Sauvage]] and [[Fraser Stoddart|J. Fraser Stoddart]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016 was awarded jointly to Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa "for the design and synthesis of molecular machines".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor nanocar==
A future nanocar with a [[synthetic molecular motor]] has been developed by Jean-Francois Morin ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=En route to a motorised nanocar|author1=Morin, Jean-François |author2=Shirai, Yasuhiro |author3=Tour, James M. |journal=Org. Lett.|year=2006|volume=8|doi=10.1021/ol060445d|pmid=16597148|issue=8|pages=1713–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is fitted with [[carborane]] wheels and a light-powered [[helicene]] synthetic molecular motor. Although the motor [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] displayed unidirectional rotation in solution, light-driven motion on a surface has yet to be observed. Mobility in water and other liquids can be also realized by a [[molecular propeller]] in the future.

A '''needlecase''' or '''needle case''' is a small, often decorative, holder for [[sewing needle]]s. Early needlecases were usually small tubular containers of bone, wood, or bronze with tight-fitting stoppers, often designed to hang from a belt.  Needlecases are sometimes called by the French name ''[[étui]]'' and are typically one of the tools attached to a [[Chatelaine (chain)|chatelaine]].

== History ==
Early sewing needles were precious items and easily lost. Needlecases were a necessity for storing these fragile objects, and are found in cultures around the world. Tubular bronze needlecases are common finds from [[Viking]]-age sites in Europe. Cane needlecases were found in a grave from [[Cerro Azul, Peru]], dated to 1000–147.&lt;ref name="Cerro Azul"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1179/0077629715Z.00000000022| title = Studying the individual in Prehistory: a tale of three women from Cerro Azul, Peru | journal = ResearchGate| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277912074_Studying_the_individual_in_Prehistory_a_tale_of_three_women_from_Cerro_Azul_Peru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone, leather, and metal needlecases have been found from [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] London,&lt;ref name="Findings" /&gt; and bone or ivory needlecases were made by the [[Inuit]] people.&lt;ref name="Ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/art_inuit/inart13e.shtml|title=Inuit art: Needle cases|website=Canadian Museum of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone and ivory needlecases and pin poppets were also popular in 18th century America.&lt;ref name ="Findings" /&gt;

Elaborate needlework confections like the frog-shaped needlecase in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] appeared by the 16th century. Heavily decorated silver and brass needlecases are typical of the [[Victorian period]]. 

Between 1869 and 1887, [[W. Avery &amp; Son]], an English needle manufactory, produced a series of figural brass needlecases, which are now highly collectible.  Avery's dominance of this market was such that all similar brass Victorian needlecases are called "Averys".&lt;ref name="Avery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coulthart.com/avery/|title=Avery Needle Case Resource Center|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preceding case, it was held that the Commonwealth's extensive regulations regarding premises used for the slaughtering of livestock for export were valid under [[Section 51(i) of the Australian Constitution|s 51(i)]] of the Constitution. In June 1955 the Privy Council gave special leave to appeal except to the extent they required a certificate of appeal under section 74. O'Sullivan applied to the High Court for a certificate of appeal.

Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ wrote a joint judgment refusing a certificate of appeal stating that the policy of section 74 was to confine the decision of essentially federal questions to the High Court. McTiernan, Kitto and Taylor JJ each delivered concurring judgments.

The Privy Council took a narrower view of section 74 than the High Court, holding that the question of whether laws were inconsistent involved the application of section 109 of the Constitution and did not involve a question in relation to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, approving the earlier decision of the statutory majority of the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;As this was a stated case and not an appeal, the decision of the Chief Justice prevailed: ''Judiciary Act 1903'' s23 as amended by the  [https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1912A00031/38649a6b-fc03-48c0-949a-8bdeb05e650f ''Judiciary Act 1912''].&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the judgment of Fullager J.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan PC"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=O'Sullivan v Noarlunga Meat Ltd |year=1956 |court=UKPC |num=24 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1957] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|4|1956|parallelcite=(1956) 95 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 177 |courtname=auto |date=4 July 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ostomy pouching system'''
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2002|quote=colostomy bag n. A receptacle worn over the stoma to collect feces following a colostomy.|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/colostomy+bag}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[prosthetic]] [[medical device]] that provides a means for the collection of waste from a surgically diverted biological system ([[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[ileum]], [[urinary bladder|bladder]]) and the creation of a [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]]. Pouching systems are most commonly associated with [[Colostomy|colostomies]], [[Ileostomy|ileostomies]], and [[Urostomy|urostomies]].&lt;ref name="ostomy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostomy.org/ostomy_info/whatis.shtml|title=Ostomy Information|accessdate=September 3, 2010|publisher=United Ostomy Associations of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pouching systems usually consist of a collection pouch [[plastic bag]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Mayo Clinic]]|title=Ostomy|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ostomy/SA00072}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as a one-piece system or, in some instances involves a mounting plate, commonly called a flange, [[wafer]] or a baseplate, and a collection [[Bag|pouch]] that is attached mechanically or with an [[adhesive]] in
an [[airtight]] seal, known as a two-piece system.  The selection of systems varies greatly between individuals and is often based on personal preference and lifestyle. Ostomy pouching systems collect [[waste]] that is output from a stoma. The pouching system allows the stoma to drain into a sealed collection pouch, while protecting the surrounding [[skin]] from [[contamination]].&lt;ref name="Lueder"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.browardostomy.org/newsletter-articles/ostomate-choices.html|title= Ostomates' Choices|accessdate=September 3, 2010 |author=Lueder, Wendy |publisher=Broward Ostomy Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081858/http://www.browardostomy.org/newsletter-articles/ostomate-choices.html |archivedate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostomy pouching systems are air- and water-tight and allow the wearer to lead an active lifestyle that can include all forms of sports and recreation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Ostomy pouching systems are also sometimes referred to as an [[Prosthesis|appliance]], where the term appliance refers to a prosthesis, as a mechanical replacement for a biological function.

== Wafers/baseplates/flange ==
[[Image:OstomyWafer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical ostomy wafer/baseplate]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ostomybasebag.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A modern ostomy wafer/baseplate and bag with double layer adhesive.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 October 2009}}|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 October 2009}}]] --&gt;

Most wafers/baseplates, also called ostomy barriers, are manufactured using [[pectin]] or similar organic material and are available in a wide variety of sizes to accommodate a person's particular [[anatomy]].

The internal opening must be the correct size to accommodate the individual's [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] while protecting the skin from contact with waste. The methods for sizing this opening vary depending on the type of wafer/baseplate; some pre-cut sizes are available, some users customize the opening using [[scissors]]. Manufacturers have recently introduced moldable wafers than can be shaped by hand without the need for scissors.&lt;ref name="ostomy1"/&gt;

Skin adhesion for modern wafers/baseplates/flanges are optimized on all the five parameters required in an adhesive:

*[[absorption (skin)|absorption]]
*tack and adhesion
*flexibility
*[[erosion]] resistance
*ease of removal.

In addition, modern wafers/baseplates/flanges with adhesive border can provide additional security that the system stays in place. Using a barrier film spray before applying a new flange will improve adhesion, soothe irritated skin and protect the skin from irritation.

A wafer/baseplate/flange may last between one and many days before it needs to be replaced; this is highly dependent on the individual's lifestyle, ostomy type, and anatomy.

== Pouches ==
[[Image:OstomyPouch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical ostomy pouch, in this case a closed-end or
"disposable". Note the [[flange]] ring, which uses a "[[Tupperware]]" type of seal]]
[[File:Ileostomy bag.jpg|thumb|right|One-piece (open-end) bags]]

The method of attachment to the wafer varies between manufactures and includes permanent (one-piece), press-on/click ("[[Tupperware]]" type), turning locking rings and "sticky" adhesive mounts. The two-piece arrangement allows pouches to be exchanged without removing the wafer; for example, some people prefer to temporarily switch to a "mini-pouch" for swimming, intimate and other short-term activities. Mini-pouches are suitable for minimum usage only.

Pouches can be divided into two basic types: open-end (drainable) and closed-end (disposable).
* Open-end pouches have a resealable end that can be opened to drain the contents of the pouch into a [[toilet]]. The end is sealed with either a [[Velcro]]-type closure or a simple clip.
* Closed-end pouches can be removed and replaced with a new pouch once the bag is full or the pouch can be emptied and rinsed. The flange or wafer does not need to be replaced.

The use of open-end vs. closed-end pouches is dependent on the frequency in which an individual needs to empty the contents, as well as [[economics]].&lt;ref name="Lueder"/&gt;

[[Flatulence|Gas]] is created during [[digestion]], and an airtight pouch will collect this and inflate. To prevent this some pouches are available with special [[Activated carbon|charcoal filtered]] vents that will allow the gas to escape, and prevent ballooning at night. Some odor can be expelled through the charcoal filter especially if  sufficient deodorant is not used in the pouch.

Pouch covers are helpful to disguise the plastic pouch when it is exposed when reaching or other physical activity. These are usually made of cloth and can be decorative or plain to blend in with clothing. Various sources stock sizes for most manufacturers pouches. There are flexible elastic pouch belts available for extreme physical activity but some of these require the pouch to be worn sideways so it does not fill properly and the tight fit causes pancaking of the effluent.

It measures the change in anisotropic [[magnetoresistance]] caused by an external magnetic field in the Hall geometry. The sensor responds to magnetic field components in the sensor plane as opposed to the ordinary Hall sensor, which measures field components perpendicular to the sensor plane. Hence the name "planar Hall". Generally speaking, for ferromagnetic materials, the resistance is larger when the current flows along the direction of magnetization than when it flows perpendicular to the magnetization vector. This creates an asymmetric electric field perpendicular to the current, which depends on the magnetization state of the sensor. Exactly controlling the magnetization state is the key to the operation of the planar Hall sensor. From fabrication the magnetization is confined to one certain direction in zero applied field, and the application of a field perpendicular to this direction changes the magnetization state in such a way that the electronic readout is linear with respect to the magnitude of the applied field. This is true for applied fields smaller than a fourth of the intrinsic effective anisotropy field (see ref. 1 for details on the working principle).

The planar Hall sensor has been demonstrated as a magnetic bead detector &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJJ-4FTS076-5&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2005&amp;_alid=519906406&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=5312&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=63c9bc919bae712f6d57593e3f1bbbef Science Direct]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000084000023004729000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes Applied Physics Letters]&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure the Earth's field with [[nanotesla]] precision &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6THG-3YSXPYW-2T&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=04%2F01%2F2000&amp;_alid=519920214&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5282&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fa805313ed2e4a4520c47e0b2c36278e Science Direct]&lt;/ref&gt; As a magnetic bead sensor, the planar Hall sensor can be used as sensing principle in a magnetic bioassay. &lt;ref name="mic.dtu.dk"/&gt; In ref. 5 detection of influenza virusses was demonstrated using an immunoassay imitating a sandwich ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T58-3YK00TR-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31% Science Direct] 2F1995&amp;_alid=519937647&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=4996&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=c5fd21474ce60d55a16eb84cac97a155&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Production planning''' is the [[planning]] of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[manufacturing]] modules in a company or industry. It utilizes the [[resource allocation]] of activities of employees, [[raw material|materials]] and [[production capacity]], in order to serve different customers.&lt;ref name="FR 1996"&gt;Fargher, Hugh E., and Richard A. Smith. "Method and system for production planning." U.S. Patent No. 5,586,021. 17 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of production methods, such as single item manufacturing, [[batch production]], [[mass production]], [[continuous production]] etc. have their own type of production planning. Production planning can be combined with production control into production planning and control, or it can be combined .[[enterprise resource planning]].

Production planning is used in companies in several different industries, including agriculture, industry, amusement industry, etc.....

== Overview ==
Production planning is a future of production that can be manufacture or company can be set  in which the facilities needed are determined and arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Telsang, Martand. ''Industrial engineering and production management.'' S. Chand, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A production plan is made periodically for a specific time period, called the planning horizon. It can comprise the following activities:
* Determination of the required product mix and factory load to satisfy customers needs.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, Yi-Feng, and Robert C. Leachman. "A production planning methodology for semiconductor manufacturing based on iterative simulation and linear programming calculations." ''Semiconductor Manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on'' 9.2 (1996): 257-269.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matching the required level of production to the existing resources.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Thomas O. "The choice of cost parameters in machining cost models." The Engineering Economist 32.3 (1987): 217-230.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Scheduling]] and choosing the actual work to be started in the manufacturing facility"&lt;ref name="FR 1996"/&gt;
* Setting up and delivering production orders to production facilities.&lt;ref name="BR 1999"&gt;Bertrand, J. W. M., and W. G. M. M. Rutten. "Evaluation of three production planning procedures for the use of recipe flexibility." European journal of operational research 115.1 (1999): 179-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to develop production plans, the production planner or production planning department needs to work closely together with the marketing department and sales department. They can provide sales forecasts, or a listing of customer orders."&lt;ref&gt;[[August-Wilhelm Scheer]] (1984) Scheer, A-W. "Production control and information systems." ''Methods and Tools for Computer Integrated Manufacturing.'' Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1984. 138-178.&lt;/ref&gt; The "work is usually selected from a variety of product types which may require different resources and serve different customers. Therefore, the selection must optimize customer-independent performance measures such as cycle time and customer-dependent performance measures such as on-time delivery."&lt;ref name="FR 1996"/&gt;

A critical factor in production planning is "the accurate estimation of the productive capacity of available resources, yet this is one of the most difficult tasks to perform well".&lt;ref&gt;Solberg, James J. "Capacity planning with a stochastic workflow model." AIIE Transactions 13.2 (1981): 116-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Production planning should always take "into account material availability, resource availability and knowledge of future demand".&lt;ref name="BR 1999"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Planning department bulletin board, 1911.jpg|300px|thumb|Planning department bulletin board, 1911.]]
Modern production planning methods and tools have been developed since late 19th century. Under [[Scientific Management]], the work for each man or each machine is mapped out in advance (see image). The origin of production planning back goes another century. [[Robert S. Kaplan|Kaplan]] (1986) summarized that "the demand for information for internal planning and control apparently arose in the first half of the 20th century when firms, such as textile mills and railroads, had to devise internal administrative procedures to coordinate the multiple processes involved in the performance of the basic activity (the conversion of raw materials into finished goods by textile mills, the transportation of passengers and freight by the railroads."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaplan, Robert S.]] "[http://kczx.gzhu.edu.cn/course_center/files_upload/template/6C473DC0-9248-4A50-A2B2-04741AAD2F02/COLUMN_16/file3/09.pdf The evolution of management accounting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222130258/http://kczx.gzhu.edu.cn/course_center/files_upload/template/6C473DC0-9248-4A50-A2B2-04741AAD2F02/COLUMN_16/file3/09.pdf |date=2014-12-22 }}," ''The Accounting Review,'' Vol 14, No 3. July 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrmann (1996) further describes the circumstances in which new methods for internal planning and control evolved: "The first factories were quite simple and relatively small. They produced a small number of products in large batches. Productivity gains came from using [[interchangeable parts]] to eliminate time-consuming fitting operations. Through the late 1800s, manufacturing firms were concerned with maximizing the productivity of the expensive equipment in the factory. Keeping utilization high was an important objective. Foremen ruled their shops, coordinating all of the activities needed for the limited number of products for which they were responsible. They hired operators, purchased materials, managed production, and delivered the product. They were experts with superior technical skills, and they (not a separate staff of clerks) planned production. Even as factories grew, they were just bigger, not more complex.&lt;ref name="H 2006"&gt;Herrmann, Jeffrey W. "[http://content.schweitzer-online.de/static/content/catalog/newbooks/978/038/733/9780387331157/9780387331157_Excerpt_001.pdf A history of production scheduling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129092511/http://content.schweitzer-online.de/static/content/catalog/newbooks/978/038/733/9780387331157/9780387331157_Excerpt_001.pdf |date=2014-11-29 }}." Handbook of Production Scheduling. Springer US, 2006. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

About production planning Herrmann (1996) recounts that "production scheduling started simply also. Schedules, when used at all, listed only when work on an order should begin or when the order is due. They didn't provide any information about how long the total order should take or about the time required for individual operations ..."&lt;ref name ="H 2006"/&gt;

In 1923 ''Industrial Management'' cited a Mr. Owens who had observed: "Production planning is rapidly becoming one of the most vital necessities of management. It is true that every establishment, no matter how large or how small has production planning in some form; but a large percentage of these do not have planning that makes for an even flow of material, and a minimum amount of money tied up in inventories."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robertson Dunlap]], [[Arthur Van Vlissingen]], [[John Michael Carmody]]. eds. ''Industrial Management,'' Vol. 65-66, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">The '''Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership''' is a U.S. presidential honor to recognize companies "for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities".  It is presented to companies that "have demonstrated a deep commitment to innovative initiatives that not only empower employees and communities but also advance strategic business interests".

==Establishment==
President [[Bill Clinton]], along with prominent business leaders, established the award in 1997 following [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]]'s death in a [[1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash|plane crash in 1996]]. The award was originally referred to as [[Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award]]. [[The Conference Board]], a non-profit organization, was chosen to manage the award's administration. Ron Brown was the [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] from 1993–1996; he was the first African-American to hold that position.  This award and the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]] are the two presidential awards to corporations.

==Ceremony==
The award is presented in an annual White House ceremony, either by the President or by the Secretary of Commerce.

'''Schoology''' is a [[learning management system]] (LMS) for K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and corporations that allows users to create, manage, and share content and resources. Also known as a [[course management system]] (CMS) or [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE), the cloud-based platform provides tools to manage any classroom or blended learning environment.&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate =July 15, 2011 |author=Conte, Henry S.| url=http://www.fbfanpost.com/2011/05/02/facebook-like-website-helps-students-and-teachers-communicate/ |title=Facebook-like Web Site Helps Students and Teachers Communicate |work=Facebook Fanpost |date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Schoology platform was designed by Jeremy Friedman, Ryan Hwang and Tim Trinidad in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schoology.com/history.php|title=About Us - Schoology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 while still undergraduates at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University in St. Louis, MO]]. Originally designed for sharing notes, additional features and functionality continue to be added.&lt;ref name="Virtual Classroom" /&gt;

Schoology secured its first institutional round of venture capital funding amounting to $1.25M from Meakam Becker Venture Capital in June 2010, following an angel investment in 2009 from an unnamed investor.&lt;ref name=program /&gt; In 2012, Schoology raised &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/16/schoology-series-b/|title=1M Users Strong, Schoology Grabs $6M To Take On Blackboard, Moodle|first=Rip|last=Empson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;$6M in a round led by Firstmark Capital, and in 2014, a &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2014/06/24/disruptive-classroom-technology-lures-vcs-in-new-round/|title=Disruptive Classroom Technology Lures VCs In New Round|first=Elaine|last=Pofeldt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;$15M round of funding was led by [[Intel Capital]].

==History==
Seadrill was incorporated as a Bermuda company in May 2005 by the Norwegian-born shipping tycoon [[John Fredriksen]] and listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] in November 2005.

In July 2005, the company acquired the drilling company [[Odfjell]].&lt;ref name=viking/&gt;

In September 2006, the company acquired a controlling share of [[Smedvig]] by outbidding [[Noble Corporation]].&lt;ref name=viking&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/04/19/seadrill-drilling-billionaires-cz_ch_0419fredriksen.html | title=Viking Attacks | first=Christopher | last=Helman | publisher=[[Forbes]] | date=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company acquired [[Eastern Drilling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/45409/Seadrill_Now_Controls_Nearly_All_Eastern_Shares_Votes | title=Seadrill Now Controls Nearly All Eastern Shares, Votes | publisher=RigZone | date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the company outbid [[Ensco plc]] for [[Scorpion Offshore]], valuing the company at $567 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/seadrill-scorpion-idUSLDE64R0P520100528 | title=Seadrill beats Ensco in Scorpion battle | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Seadrill conducted an [[initial public offering]] of its North Atlantic Drilling subsidiary, which owns harsh environment rigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/01/29/605416/10065967/en/NADL-North-Atlantic-Drilling-Ltd-Announces-Pricing-of-its-Initial-Public-Offering-of-its-Common-Shares.html | title=North Atlantic Drilling Ltd.

In April 2013, the company sold the majority of its [[tender rig]] and semi-tender operation to SapuraKencana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/sdrl-seadrill-completes-integration-tender-rig-business-into-sapurakencana-oslo-sdrl-1784712.htm | title=Seadrill completes the integration of the tender rig business into SapuraKencana | publisher=[[Marketwired]] | date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the company sold [[Tender rig]]s ''T-15'', ''T16'' and the ''West Vencedor'' to Seadrill Partners LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idUSnHUGd4J0+72+ONE20130507 | title=Seadrill Limited sells the tender rig T15 to Seadrill Partners LLC | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the company acquired a majority interest in Sevan Drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://inpublic.globenewswire.com/releaseDetails.faces?rId=1712418 | title=SEVAN DRILLING ASA: ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS | publisher=[[GlobeNewswire]] | date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the company suspended dividend payments as a result of a downturn in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-26/seadrill-plunges-after-suspending-dividend-as-rig-market-sours | title=Seadrill Plunges on Dividend Suspension as Rig Market Sours | first=Mikael | last=Holter | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the company filed for [[bankruptcy]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/09/12/1118428/0/en/SDLP-Seadrill-Limited-Restructuring-Update.html | title=Seadrill Limited Restructuring Update | publisher=[[GlobeNewswire]] | date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-12/seadrill-files-bankruptcy-to-shrink-offshore-driller-s-debt-load | title=Seadrill Files for Bankruptcy in Bid to Shrink Debt Burden | first1=Steven | last1=Church | first2=Mikael | last2=Holter | first3=Angelina | last3=Rascouet | first4=Luca | last4=Casiraghi | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Bribery allegations===
In 2015, [[Petrobras]] alleged bribery in the negotiations of rig contracts signed by Sevan Drilling, a subsidiary of Seadrill, in 2005-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://inpublic.globenewswire.com/releaseDetails.faces?rId=1959476 | title=SEVAN DRILLING LTD: PRESS RELEASE | publisher=[[GlobeNewswire]] | date=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental damage due to rig fire===
{{main|Montara oil spill}}

In November 2009, Seadrill's West Atlas [[jackup rig]], which was located on Montara field, about 690 kilometers offshore of [[Darwin (Australia)|Darwin]], [[Australia]], caught fire after the field had been leaking oil for ten weeks. The rig was operated by the Thai firm PTTEP. For 74 days, gas and oil ran into the [[Timor Sea]], in what was one of the worst environmental disasters in Australian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/six-years-after-the-montara-oil-spill-those-who-suffered-most-still-seek-compensation/news-story/98b1c7ac1f6c03d57e6974359e756fa0 | title=Six years after the Montara oil spill, those who suffered most still seek compensation | first=ROHAN | last=SMITH | publisher=[[News.com.au]] | date=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-service software vendors ==
Self-service software vendors allows authors (typically subject matter experts or agents) to readily automate the deployment of, the timeliness of and compliance around a variety of processes of which they are involved in communicating without having to physically address the questions, needs and solicitations of end users who are inquiring about the particular process being automated. 

Most self-service software addresses "closed-loop" inquiries whereby the author emulates a variety of known (finite) questions and related (known) responses on hand or required steps that must be addressed to derive and deliver a final answer or directive.  Often the author using such software codifies such known processes and steps and then generates (publishes) end-user facing applications which can encompass a variety of code bases and platforms.

[[Image:Signal lamp training.jpg|thumb|250px|Signal lamp training during World War II.]]
A '''signal lamp''' (sometimes called an '''Aldis lamp''', after Arthur Cyril Webb Aldis who invented a widely used design, or a '''Morse lamp'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Walter Lord|Lord, Walter]]|title=[[The Night Lives On]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a visual signaling device for [[optical communication]], typically using [[Morse code]]. Modern signal lamps are focused lamps which can produce a pulse of light. In large versions, this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp, either via a manually operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically. With hand held lamps, a concave mirror is tilted by a trigger to focus the light into pulses. The lamps were usually equipped with some form of [[optical sight]], and were most commonly used on [[warship|naval vessels]] and in [[airport]] [[Air traffic control|control tower]]s (using color signals for stop or clearance). In manual signaling, a signalman would aim the light at the recipient ship and turn a lever, opening and closing the shutter over the lamp, to emit flashes of light to spell out text messages in [[Morse code]].  On the recipient ship, a signalman would observe the blinking light, often with [[binoculars]], translating the Morse code into text.

== Marine usage ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[Image:Seaman send Morse code signals.jpg|thumb|250px|US Navy sailor sending Morse code using a signal lamp.]]
Signal lamps were pioneered by the [[Royal Navy]] in the late 19th century and continue to be used through the present day, on naval vessels. They provide handy, secure communications, which is especially useful during periods of [[radio silence]] and were particularly useful for [[convoy]]s operating during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. 

There are several types.  Some signal lamps are mounted on the [[mast (sailing)|masthead]]s of ships, some small hand-held versions are also used (e.g., the 'Aldis lamp'); other more powerful versions are mounted on pedestals. These larger ones use a [[carbon arc lamp]] as their light source, with a diameter of 20&amp;nbsp;inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm). These can be used to signal to the horizon, even in conditions of bright sunlight.  Although it was originally thought that it was only possible to communicate by line-of-sight, in practice it is possible to illuminate cloud bases both during the night and day, which allow for communication beyond the horizon.  

The maximum transmission rate possible via flashing lights is no more than 14 [[wpm]]. They have a secondary function as simple [[searchlight|spotlights]].

==Early history==
[[File:Begbie signalling oil lamp (Signalling, 1918).jpg|thumb|Begbie signalling oil lamp, 1918]]
The idea of flashing dots and dashes from a lantern was first put into practice by Captain, later Vice Admiral, [[Philip Howard Colomb|Philip Colomb]], of the British Royal Navy, in 1867. His original code, which the Navy used for seven years, was not identical with Morse's, but [[Morse code]] was eventually adopted with the addition of several special signals. 

Another signalling lamp was the Begbie lamp, a [[kerosene]] lamp with a lens to focus the light over a long distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neal McEwen, K5RW |url=http://www.telegraph-office.com/pages/Black-Watch-Signal-Unit.html |title=Victorian Era Visual Signalling Instruments -Black Watch, 42nd Royal Highland Regiment Signalling Unit, c. 1898 |publisher=Telegraph-office.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashing lights were the second generation of signalling in the Royal Navy, after the [[flag signals]] most famously used to spread [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Nelson's rallying-cry]] before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

[[File:Germany blinker signal lamp - National World War I Museum - Kansas City, MO - DSC07704.JPG|thumb|WW I German Blinkgerät]]

During the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]] when wire communications were often cut, German signals used three types of optical Morse transmitters, called ''{{lang|de|Blinkgerät}}'', the intermediate type for distances of up to 4&amp;nbsp;km (2.5&amp;nbsp;miles) at daylight and of up to 8&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;miles) at night, using red filters for undetected communications.{{cn|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Turkish heliograph at Huj2.jpg|thumb|A Blinkgerät can be seen second from the left in this picture of an Ottoman heliograph crew. ]]

==Modern use==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The Commonwealth Navies and [[NATO]] forces use signal lamps when radio communications need to be silent or electronic "[[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]" is likely. Also, given the prevalence of night vision equipment in today's armed forces, signaling at night is usually done with lights that operate in the infrared (IR) spectrum, making them less likely to be detected. All modern forces have followed suit due to technological advances in digital communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jproc.ca/rrp/rrp2/visual_lights.html|title=Visual Signalling in the RCN - Light Signalling|website=www.jproc.ca|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air traffic control usage ==
{{main | Aviation light signals }}

In [[Air traffic control|air traffic control towers]], signal lamps are still used today, as a backup device in case of a complete failure of an aircraft's radio. Light signals can be green, red, or white, and steady or flashing. Messages are limited to a handful of basic instructions (e.g., "land", "stop", etc.); they are not intended to be used for transmitting messages in [[Morse code]]. Aircraft can acknowledge signals by rocking their wings or flashing their [[Aircraft landing lights|landing lights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/aim0403.html#N2Ab4ROBE FAA Aeronautical Information Manual, section 4-3-13.

'''Space surveillance''' is the study and monitoring of satellites [[orbit]]ing the earth. It involves the detection, tracking, cataloging and identification of artificial objects, i.e. active/inactive [[satellite]]s, spent [[rocket]] bodies, or [[Space debris|fragmentation debris]].

==Aims==
Space surveillance accomplishes the following:

* Predicting when and where a decaying space object will [[Atmospheric entry|re-enter]] the [[Earth's atmosphere]];
* Preventing a returning space object, which to [[radar]] looks like a missile, from triggering a [[false alarm]] in missile-attack warning sensors;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/usspc-fs/space.htm|title=Space Surveillance|website=www.au.af.mil|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charting the present position of space objects and plot their anticipated orbital paths;
* Detecting new man-made objects in space;
* Producing a running catalogue of man-made space objects;
* Determining which country owns a re-entering space object;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Informing countries whether or not objects may interfere with [[satellite]]s and [[International Space Station]] orbits;
* Providing data for future [[Anti-satellite weapon|anti-satellite weapons systems]].

==Systems==
Systems include:
* The [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] which has detectors such as the [[Space Fence]] (replacing the now defunct [[Air Force Space Surveillance System]]) and [[Space Surveillance Telescope]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The Russian [[Centre for Outer Space Monitoring|Main Control Centre of Outer Space]] with facilities such as [[Okno]] and [[Krona space object recognition station|Krona]]
* The European [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] with multiple assets in its [[Space Situational Awareness Programme#Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment|Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment]]

The '''TRANZ 330''' is a popular point-of-sale device manufactured by [[VeriFone]] in 1985.  The most common application for these units is bank and credit card processing, however, as a general purpose computer, they can perform other novel functions.  Other applications include gift/benefit card processing, prepaid phone cards, payroll and employee timekeeping, and even debit and ATM cards.  They are programmed in a proprietary VeriFone TCL language (Terminal Control Language), which is unrelated to the [[Tcl|Tool Command Language]] used in [[UNIX]] environments.
