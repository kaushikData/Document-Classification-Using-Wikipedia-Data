On 5 August 1984, a [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]] [[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-600]] crashed into a marsh near [[Zia International Airport]] (now [[Shahjalal International Airport]]) in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] while landing in poor weather.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; The aircraft was performing a scheduled domestic passenger flight between [[Shah Amanat International Airport|Patenga Airport]], [[Chittagong]] and Zia International Airport, Dhaka.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

With a total death toll of 49 people, it is the deadliest aviation disaster to occur on Bangladeshi soil and also the airline's worst accident.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/06/world/around-the-world-49-die-in-bangladesh-as-plane-plunges.html |title=AROUND THE WORLD; 49 Die in Bangladesh As Plane Plunges |date=6 August 1984 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft==

The aircraft, a [[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-600]] registered S2-ABJ, was manufactured in 1971.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; It first flew for [[Indian Airlines]] but it was given to Biman in 1972, as a part of all the support given to Bangladesh by the [[Government of India]] following [[History of Bangladesh after independence|Bangladesh's Independence]]. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had flown more than 24,000 cycles and more than 15,500 airframe hours.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

==Passengers and crew==
There were a total of 45 passengers and 4 crew members on board the flight, all of whom perished in the crash. There was one Briton and one Japanese among the passengers, and the rest of the passengers and crews were Bangladeshi. Thirty three of the passengers were traveling to Dhaka to catch connecting flights to the Middle East.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

The captain of the flight was Mr. Kayes Ahmed Majumdar, an experienced pilot by the time of the accident. He had logged 5000 flying hours. The co-pilot was [[Kaniz Fatema Roksana]], who was also known as the first female commercial pilot of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=First_female&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking the Glass Ceiling|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2010/03/01/cover.htm|website=thedailystar.net|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

The weather conditions in Dhaka were poor on the day of the accident; there was turbulence and heavy rain made visibility very poor.&lt;ref name="FI1985-35"/&gt; Amid these conditions, the crew first attempted a [[VOR/DME|VOR]] approach to [[Zia International Airport]]'s runway 32. As the runway was not spotted by either crew member, a [[missed approach]] was executed. The crew then tried an [[Instrument approach|ILS approach]] on runway 14 of the same airport, but a missed approach had to be executed again as both pilots had failed to spot the runway once again. On the crew's third approach (second on runway 14), the plane got too low while it was still several hundred meters from the runway but neither crew member realized this (due to the poor visibility) and the plane crashed into a swamp about 550 meters short of the runway.{{efn|It was also stated that the aircraft crashed beyond the runway, but considering the crash location (north west of Dhaka) and the fact that the flight was approaching runway 14 of DAC (approach is from north west of Dhaka city), it is clear that the plane crashed short of the runway and not beyond it.}}&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

On 10 March 1997 a [[multiple-vehicle collision]] occurred on the [[M42 motorway]] near [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]], in central England. Three people were killed and more than 60 others were injured in the crash, which happened in dense fog during the early morning rush hour.

At around 6:20 a.m. a [[truck|lorry]], driven by David Fairclough of Wednesfield, entered the M42 from a slip-road at a speed of {{convert|56|mph}} and, after slowing to {{convert|32|mph}}, rammed into the rear of a [[Tank truck|tanker]], which then struck a car in front and exploded. The ensuing pile-up involved 160 vehicles on a {{convert|400|yard|adj=on}} stretch of the motorway, including 30 on the opposite carriageway 20 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Victim%27s+father+still+angry+as+M42+crash+driver+is+jailed.-a060538524|title=Victim's father still angry as M42 crash driver is jailed|last=Aitchison|first=Neil|publisher=The Birmingham Post|agency=Thefreelibrary.com|date=8 April 1999|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five [[air ambulance]]s and 25 [[ambulance]]s ferried injured drivers and passengers from the scene to three hospitals. A [[police car]] was also involved in the pile-up; one firefighter responding to the crash criticised other motorists for overtaking his fire engine in excess of {{convert|70|mph}} in the dense fog. Several cars and lorries were burnt to a shell and more than 30 occupants had to be cut free from their vehicles by firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CARNAGE+IN+THE+FOG%3B+THREE+DIE+AND+62+HURT+IN+INFERNO+AS+100+VEHICLES...-a061109264|title=Carnage In The Fog: Three die and 62 hurt in inferno as 100 vehicles crash in tragic rush hour madness|last1=Chaytor|first1=Rod|last2=Miller|first2=Ian|publisher=The Mirror|agency=Thefreelibrary.com|date=11 March 1997|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Dodson, a 21-year-old student from [[Chaddesley Corbett]], was the driver of the car, a [[Peugeot 205]], struck by the tanker and she died from [[asphyxia]]tion. Malcolm MacDonald, 53 and from [[Redditch]], and 63-year-old Margaret Vining, from [[Gloucester]], suffered fatal injuries in the pile-up.

Fairclough, then aged 46, suffered bleeding to the brain and leg injuries. In 1999, he was acquitted at Worcester Crown Court of [[causing death by dangerous driving]] but convicted of [[dangerous driving]] for his role in the collision. His [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licence]] was suspended for four years and he served three months in [[Hewell (HM Prison)|Hewell Grange prison]]. In November 2001 he successfully brought legal action to have the licence reinstated. A judge ordered him to take an extended driving test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2001/11/10/7733366.M42_death_crash_driver_wins_back_his_licence/?ref=arc |title=M42 death crash driver wins back his licence |publisher=Archive.worcesternews.co.uk |date=10 November 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I2rGKeHD?url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2001/11/10/7733366.M42_death_crash_driver_wins_back_his_licence/?ref=arc |archivedate=12 July 2013 |deadurl=y |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey''' ('''ARIEL'''), is a [[space observatory]] planned for launch in 2028 as the fourth medium-class mission of the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Cosmic Vision]] programme. The mission is aimed at observing at least 1,000 known [[exoplanets]] using the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], studying and characterising the planets' chemical composition and thermal structures.

== Mission ==

== Spacecraft ==
The design of the ARIEL spacecraft is based on that intended for the ''[[EChO|Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory]]'' (''EChO'') mission, and has heritage from the thermal design of ''[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]''.&lt;ref name="ariel-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa-1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Science &amp; Technology Portal staff|title=ARIEL: Spacecraft|url=http://sci.esa.int/ariel/59800-spacecraft/|website=ESA Science &amp; Technology Portal|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=22 March 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180322044912/http://sci.esa.int/ariel/59800-spacecraft/|archivedate=22 March 2018|language=en-GB|date=20 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the spacecraft is split into two distinct modules known as the Service Module (SVM) and the Payload Module (PLM). The SVM is shaped as a 'sandwich' structure, consisting of three [[aluminum]] V-Grooves and three pairs of low conductivity [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]] bipod struts supporting the PLM.&lt;ref name="esa-1"/&gt; A basic horizontal telescope configuration is used for the PLM itself, housing all of the spacecraft's scientific instruments and its oval 1.1 × 0.7 metre (3.6 × 2.3 feet) [[primary mirror]].&lt;ref name="esa-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ariel-2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=ARIEL Space Mission staff |title=Facts &amp; Figures |url=https://ariel-spacemission.eu/ariel-media/ |website=ARIEL Space Mission |publisher=ARIEL Consortium |accessdate=22 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322054107/https://ariel-spacemission.eu/ariel-media/ |archivedate=22 March 2018 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, the spacecraft will have a fuelled mass of ~{{convert|1200|kg|lbs}}, and will have a dry mass of ~{{convert|950|kg|lbs}}.&lt;ref name="ariel-2"/&gt; The PLM will account for around {{convert|300|kg|lbs}} of that mass.&lt;ref name="ariel-2"/&gt;

=== Telescope ===
The ARIEL telescope's assembly is an off-axis [[Cassegrain telescope]] followed by a third parabolic mirror to recollimate the beam.  The telescope uses an oval 1.1 × 0.7 metre (3.6 × 2.3 feet) [[primary mirror]]; the system has a diffraction limit of about 3 µm, and a focal ratio (f) of 13.4.&lt;ref name='ARIEL Payload'&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/ariel/59801-payload/ ARIEL - Payload]. ESA. 20 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The system will acquire images in the visible and near-infrared spectrum.&lt;ref name='ARIEL Payload'/&gt; Its [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectroscope]] will operate between 1.95 µm and 7.8 µm, which requires to be  passively cooled to a temperature of -218°C (55 K).&lt;ref name="ariel-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name='ARIEL Payload'/&gt;

==Background==
Following the release of ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011), Adele was considering quitting the music industry altogether, stating she thought it was better to "go out on a high".

The '''Battle of Bi''' ({{zh|t=邲之戰|p=Bì zhī Zhàn}}) was fought during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] in 597 BC, between the major states of [[Chu (state)|Chǔ]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jìn]]. Occurring three and a half decades after the [[Battle of Chengpu]], where Jin decisively defeated Chu, the battle was a major victory for Chu, cementing the position of its ruler King Zhuang as a hegemon among the states of the Zhou Dynasty.

==Background==
The states of Jin and Chu were both among the most powerful of their time, but while Jin was considered a legitimate Zhou state in terms of culture and lineage, the state of Chu - whose territory encompassed many non-Chinese cultures in the middle [[Yangtze River]] - was considered a half-civilised state at best.

Jin-Chu rivalry last came to a head with the decisive defeat of Chu at the Battle of Chengpu, where [[Duke Wen of Jin]] became hegemon among the states; after the death of Duke Wen, Chu attempted to reassert its position with northern campaigns, but the presence of Zhao Dun as premier of Jin rendered them unwilling to risk direct conflict.

This situation would change dramatically with the death of Zhao Dun in 601 BC, as well as the death of [[Duke Cheng of Jin]] the following year, followed by that of Zhao's successor [[Xi Que]] ([[:zh:郤缺|郤缺]]) in 598 BC. King Zhuang made use of the resulting instability among the Jin leadership, and personally led a campaign northward.

==Campaign==
King Zhuang targeted the state of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], which was an ally of Jin, and successfully forced Zheng to switch allegiance to Chu. Meanwhile, Xun Linfu, the new commander of the Jin armies, led his forces to relieve Zheng, only to learn of the surrender of Zheng en route, while camped along the northern bank of the [[Yellow River]]. This created a rift among the Jin commanders, about whether to meet the Chu forces in battle.

At the same time, Chu's armies retreated by 30 ''li'' and decamped, awaiting the Jin offensive.

==Battle==
Xun Linfu, after hearing of Zheng's switch of allegiance, was in favour of retreating; however, his adjutant [[Xian Hu]], maintaining that it would be cowardly to avoid battle as the hegemonic state, led his own troops across the Yellow River without instructions. This forced the rest of the army to follow suit.

Meanwhile, on the Chu side, King Zhuang was intimidated by the presence of the Jin army; even his commander Sunshu Ao was initially in favour of retreat. [[Wu Can (Spring and Autumn period)|Wu Can]], a Chu commander, advised against this, citing the inexperience of Xun Linfu as the supreme commander, the rashness of Xian Hu as adjutant, and the conflict between the Jin commanders. King Zhuang thus resolved to face down the Jin army, even though negotiations for a truce continued between the two armies.

The battle began only when two generals from the Jin army, dissatisfied at Xun Linfu's hesitation, decided to provoke the Chu forces. King Zhuang personally pursued the generals; Xun Linfu sent a force to escort the two generals back to Jin lines, but the rolling dust from this relief force was mistaken as a general advance by the Jin army. Fearing that the king could be cut off by the army, Sunshu Ao immediately ordered a general advance from the Chu army; this unexpected attack overwhelmed Jin forces, which then collapsed and were routed.

King Zhuang, upon winning the battle, led his generals to water their horses from the Yellow River; a request to pursue and destroy the remnant forces was rebuffed on the grounds that, with the humiliation of Chengpu avenged, there was no need for more slaughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11445">'''CoffeeCon''' is the only coffee festival for enthusiasts. Unlike coffee festivals for the coffee industry this festival is for the end user. The another difference is its coffee university typically offering over 30 different coffee classes. CoffeeCon travels to major coffee cities in the United States. It was created by coffee author and video producer Kevin Sinnott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/johnstossel/2005/05/04/coffee_talk/page/full|title=Coffee talk|work=townhall.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-05/features/9406050031_1_gourmet-coffees-roast-percolator|title=The Real Mr. Coffee|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the book ''The Art &amp; Craft of Coffee'' and produced a how to video called ''Coffee Brewing Secrets''.

==History==
While working on specialized projects, Sinnott noticed several industry B-to-B coffee events such as the [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] and the [[National Coffee Association]] and that some local coffee shops were holding brewing seminars but there were simply no large scale festivals exclusively for coffee consumers. He decided to turn his book and his video into a live event. He created CoffeeCon as a place where coffee enthusiasts could taste samples from regional coffee roasters side-by-side, learn about coffee from national and local coffee experts by attend coffee topic classes on almost every brewing method. He hosts the event and calls it a coffee meet-up.

The first CoffeeCon was on February 25, 2012 started with a grant for the local tourism commission in Warrenville, IL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120223/news/702239887/|title=Learn how to brew the perfect cup of Joe at CoffeeCon in Warrenville|work=Daily Herald|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/02/14/all-means-of-brewing-to-be-on-display-at-coffeecon/|title=All Means Of Brewing To Be On Display At CoffeeCon « CBS Chicago|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sprudge.com/consumer-convention-in-warrenville-illinois-coffeecon-2012.html|title=Consumer Convention: CoffeeCON 2012|work=[[Sprudge]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted over 1,000 consumers.

[[File:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake - affected countries.png|thumb|Countries directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami]]
This article lists the '''countries affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting tsunami]]''' in alphabetical order – for detailed information about each country affected by the [[earthquake]] and [[tsunami]], see their individual articles. Countries with a smaller number of casualties, as well as those that lost citizens who were travelling abroad, are listed further on in the article.

==Countries suffering major casualties and damage==

[[File:2004 Tsunami casualties and damage.png|thumb|upright=1.5|{{legend|red|severe damage and loss of life}}{{legend|orange|moderate damage and some loss of life}}{{legend|yellow|minor damage and no loss of life}}{{legend|dodgerblue|loss of citizens abroad}}]]
; {{flagdeco|IND}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on India|Effect on India]]
10,749 casualties were confirmed on 27 January 2008, most of them in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. There were 5,640 people missing, nearly all of them on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]].

[[Indonesia]]'s Ministry of Health confirmed 131,028 deaths on June 18, 2005, mainly in the northern province [[Aceh]] of the island [[Sumatra]]. Some 37,000 people are missing.

; {{flagdeco|MAS}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Malaysia|Effect on Malaysia]]
Despite its proximity to the incident, [[Malaysia]] escaped the kind of damage that struck countries thousands of miles further away (most of its western coast is shielded by Sumatra). The number of deaths currently stands at 68 with 5 people missing.

; {{flagdeco|Maldives}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives|Effect on the Maldives]]
In the [[Maldives]], 82 were killed and 26 reported missing and presumed dead.

; {{flagdeco|MYA}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Myanmar|Effect on Myanmar]]
Independent media reports 90 people killed in [[Myanmar]] due to the tsunami. The official death toll is 61. Witnesses in Myanmar estimate up to 600 deaths.

; {{flagdeco|SOM}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Somalia|Effect on Somalia]]
Villages and coastal communities in [[Somalia]], as far as {{convert|4,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the epicenter of the earthquake, were swept away and destroyed by the huge waves. 176 people were confirmed dead, 136 were missing and more than 50,000 were displaced.

; {{flagdeco|SRI}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Sri Lanka|Effect on Sri Lanka]]

One and a half million people were [[displaced person|displaced]] from their homes, and many orphaned or separated from their families.

; {{flagdeco|THA}} [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Thailand|Effect on Thailand]]
The [[Thailand|Thai]] government reports 5,395 confirmed deaths, 8,457 injuries and 2,817 missing on 20 June 2005. Damage was confined to the six southern provinces facing the [[Andaman Sea]].

==Countries suffering some casualties and damage==

{| class="wikitable" 
|class=nowrap|{{flag|Kenya}}
|Waves struck Kenya causing some minor damage. One person was reported to have drowned at Watamu, near [[Mombasa, Kenya|Mombasa]].
|-
|class=nowrap|{{flag|Seychelles}}
|Three killed, six people missing. A major bridge in [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]] was destroyed.
|-
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|South Africa}}
|One boy died after swimming in the Quinera River at [[Gonubie]], close to [[East London, South Africa|East London]]; an adult dead at Blue Horizon Bay near [[Port Elizabeth]], the furthest point from the [[epicenter]] of the [[earthquake]] where a tsunami-related death was reported. ''General observations:'' Ocean level variance two to three meters outside normal reported in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and [[Eastern Cape]], and a surge of 1.5 m was observed as far as [[Struisbaai]] in the [[Western Cape]], 8500&amp;nbsp;km from the epicentre of the earthquake. Some steps were taken in South Africa to warn ports and disaster management centers, although full details are not public.

Large concrete blocks were uprooted in [[East London, South Africa|East London]] harbor, where boats also broke from their moorings. Boats and cars were submerged at the Algoa Bay Yacht Club in [[Port Elizabeth]] harbor. [[Durban]] harbor, Africa's busiest general cargo port and home to the largest and busiest container terminal in the Southern Hemisphere, was closed for some time on 27 December because of unusually strong surges across the entrance channel.
|-
|class=nowrap|{{flag|Tanzania}}
|10 killed, an unknown number of people missing. An oil tanker temporarily ran aground in [[Dar es Salaam]] harbor, damaging an oil pipeline.
|-
|class=nowrap|{{flag|Yemen}}
|One child killed, 40 fishing boats wrecked on [[Socotra]] Island.
|}

==Countries suffering damage only==
{| class="wikitable"
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|Australia}}
|Tremors felt along the north-western coast, some minor flooding. Seas off Western Australia reportedly surged between [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]], 425&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], where several boats were ripped from their moorings, and [[Busselton, Western Australia|Busselton]], 230&amp;nbsp;km south of Perth, where a father and son in a boat were washed out to sea, but were later rescued. No direct casualties were reported within Australia.

Despite early worries about [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], no casualties were reported. People swimming at [[Christmas Island]] were sucked 150m out to sea, but were safely carried back to shore after a pause. At roughly 2 pm that day a single wave surged between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;m beyond the normal high water point on Mullaloo Beach, Perth engulfing people. No injuries were reported.
|-
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|Madagascar}}
|Flooding in low-lying coastal districts. No reported casualties. Waves reported variously between 1.6 and 10 meters in height swept through southeastern coastal areas. Over a thousand displaced. Problems were exacerbated by the approach of [[Cyclone Chambo]].
|-
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|Mauritius}}
|No reports of casualties, however a village in the north of the island was completely submerged. Police issued warnings to bathers to stay out of the water, although this had the opposite effect. Crowds thronging the beaches to watch the phenomenon. Speculation is that coral reefs surrounding much of the island protected the coastline.
|-
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|Oman}}
|Waves hit coastline; no casualties.
|-
|class=nowrap style=vertical-align:top|{{flag|Réunion}}
|Over 200 boats sunk; damage to port infrastructure estimated at over €500,000.

'''Cyberterrorism''' is the use of the [[Internet]] to conduct violent acts that result in, or threaten, loss of life or significant bodily harm, in order to achieve political or ideological gains through [[threat]] or [[intimidation]]. It is also sometimes considered an act of Internet terrorism where [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities, including acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially of personal computers attached to the Internet by means of tools such as [[computer viruses]], [[computer worm]]s, [[phishing]], and other malicious software and hardware methods and programming scripts.

Cyberterrorism is a controversial term. Some authors opt for a very narrow definition, relating to deployment by known terrorist organizations of disruption attacks against information systems for the primary purpose of creating alarm, panic, or physical disruption. Other authors prefer a broader definition, which includes cybercrime. Participating in a cyberattack affects the terror threat perception, even if it isn't done with a violent approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canetti|first=Daphna|last2=Gross|first2=Michael|last3=Waismel-Manor|first3=Israel|last4=Levanon|first4=Asaf|last5=Cohen|first5=Hagit|date=2017-02-01|title=How Cyberattacks Terrorize: Cortisol and Personal Insecurity Jump in the Wake of Cyberattacks|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2016.0338|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–77|doi=10.1089/cyber.2016.0338}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some definitions, it might be difficult to distinguish which instances of online activities are cyberterrorism or cybercrime.&lt;ref name="Cyberterrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hower|first1=Sara|last2=Uradnik|first2=Kathleen|title=Cyberterrorism|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=140–149|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uarFTBpg11wC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberterrorism can be also defined as the intentional use of computers, networks, and public internet to cause destruction and harm for personal objectives. Experienced cyberterrorists, who are very skilled in terms of [[Hack (computer security)|hacking]] can cause massive damage to government systems, hospital records, and national security programs, which might leave a country, community or organization in turmoil and in fear of further attacks.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Walter|last2=C.|first2=Smith|last3=Spector|first3=Michael|title=Cyberterrorism|date=2002|publisher=Facts on File|pages=52–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of such terrorists may be political or ideological since this can be considered a form of terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=India Quarterly : a Journal of International Affairs|publisher=Indian Council of World Affairs|date=1986|volume=42–43|page=122|quote=The difficulty of defining terrorism has led to the cliche that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much [[Criticism of the War on Terrorism#Role of U.S. media|concern]] from government and media sources about potential damage that could be caused by cyberterrorism, and this has prompted efforts by government agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI) and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to put an end to [[cyber attack]]s and cyberterrorism.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

There have been several major and minor instances of cyberterrorism. [[Al-Qaeda]] utilized the internet to communicate with supporters and even to recruit new members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worth|first1=Robert|title=Terror on the Internet: The New Arena, The New Challenges|journal=New York Times Book Review|date=June 25, 2016|page=21|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25worth.html|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], a Baltic country which is constantly evolving in terms of technology, became a battleground for cyberterror in April, 2007 after disputes regarding the removal of a WWII soviet statue located in Estonia's capital Tallinn.&lt;ref name="Cyberterrorism"/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Main|Definitions of terrorism}}
There is debate over the basic definition of the scope of cyberterrorism. There is variation in qualification by motivation, targets, methods, and centrality of computer use in the act.  Depending on context, cyberterrorism may overlap considerably with [[cybercrime]], [[cyberwar]] or ordinary [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hlrecord.org/news/what-is-cyberterrorism-even-experts-can-t-agree-1.861186 |title=What is cyberterrorism? Even experts can't agree |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112093639/http://www.hlrecord.org/news/what-is-cyberterrorism-even-experts-can-t-agree-1.861186 |archivedate=November 12, 2009 |df= }}. Harvard Law Record. Victoria Baranetsky. November 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Kaspersky]], founder of [[Kaspersky Lab]], now feels that "cyberterrorism" is a more accurate term than "cyberwar". He states that "with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism."&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/experts-we-lost-the-cyber-war-now-were-in-the-era-of-cyber-terror/ "Latest viruses could mean 'end of world as we know it,' says man who discovered Flame"], ''The Times of Israel'', June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He also equates large-scale cyber weapons, such as the [[Flame (malware)|Flame Virus]] and [[NetTraveler Virus]] which his company discovered, to [[biological weapons]], claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaspersky2&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-cyber-bug-targeting-middle-east-but-israel-untouched-so-far/ "Cyber espionage bug attacking Middle East, but Israel untouched — so far"], ''The Times of Israel'', June 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

If cyberterrorism is treated similarly to traditional [[terrorism]], then it only includes attacks that threaten property or lives, and can be defined as the leveraging of a target's computers and information, particularly via the [[Internet]], to cause physical, real-world harm or severe disruption of infrastructure.

Many academics and researchers who specialize in terrorism studies suggest that cyberterrorism does not exist and is really a matter of [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] or [[information warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Jim|title=There's no such thing as cyber terrorism|url=http://rt.com/news/no-cyber-terrorism-obama/|publisher=RT|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They disagree with labeling it as terrorism because of the unlikelihood of the creation of fear, significant physical harm, or death in a population using electronic means, considering current attack and protective technologies.

If death or physical damage that could cause human harm is considered a necessary part of the cyberterrorism definition, then there have been few identifiable incidents of cyberterrorism, although there has been much policy research and public concern. Modern terrorism and political violence is not easily defined, however, and some scholars assert that it is now "unbounded" and not exclusively concerned with physical damage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruggiero|first=Vincenzo|title=Understanding Political Violence: A Criminological Approach|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=_XbiI0CgoksC&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;ots=TlZbF-Hmye&amp;dq=political%20violence%20is%20unbounded&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20violence%20is%20unbounded&amp;f=false|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an old saying that death or loss of property are the side products of terrorism, the main purpose of such incidents is to ''create terror'' in peoples' minds and harm bystanders. If any incident in [[cyberspace]] can ''create terror'', it may be rightly called cyberterrorism. For those affected by such acts, the fears of cyberterrorism are quite real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Michael|title=The psychological effects of cyber terrorism|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370589/|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[cybercrime]] in general, the threshold of required knowledge and skills to perpetrate acts of cyberterror has been steadily diminishing thanks to freely available hacking suites and online courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Agency Intelligence Assessment:Pathways into Cybercrime|url=http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/publications/791-pathways-into-cyber-crime/file|publisher=National Crime Agency|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the physical and virtual worlds are merging at an accelerated rate, making for many more targets of opportunity which is evidenced by such notable cyber attacks as [[Stuxnet]], the Saudi petrochemical sabotage attempt in 2018 and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rudawski|first=Anna|title=The Future of Cyber Threats: When Attacks Cause Physical Harm|url=https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/06/01/the-future-of-cyber-threats-when-attacks-cause-physical-harm/?slreturn=20180713033135|publisher=New York Law Journal|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining cyberterrorism===

Assigning a concrete definition to cyberterrorism can be hard, due to the difficulty of defining the term terrorism itself. Multiple organizations have created their own definitions, most of which are overly{{quantify|date=July 2018}} broad. There is also controversy concerning overuse of the term, [[hyperbole]] in the media and by security vendors trying to sell "solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://praguepost.com/opinion/5996-virtual-hostage.html|title= Virtual Hostage: Cyber terrorism and politically motivated computer crime|last= Anderson|first= Kent|date= October 13, 2010|publisher= The Prague Post|accessdate= 2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of understanding cyberterrorism involves the idea that terrorists could cause massive loss of life, worldwide economic chaos and environmental damage by hacking into critical infrastructure systems.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Hardy, Keiran, and George Williams. "What is 'cyberterrorism'? Computer and internet technology in legal definitions of terrorism". ''Cyberterrorism''. Springer New York, 2014. 1–23. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-0962-9_1 "The idea that terrorists could cause massive loss of life, worldwide economic chaos and irreparable environmental damage by hacking into critical infrastructure systems has captured the public imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of cyberterrorism covers conduct involving computer or Internet technology that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-0962-9_1|title= Cyberterrorism|first1= Keiran|last1= Hardy|first2= George|last2= Williams|date= 18 November 2017|publisher= Springer, New York, NY|pages= 1–23|via= link.springer.com|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4939-0962-9_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2018}}
# is motivated by a political, religious or ideological cause
# is intended to intimidate a government or a section of the public to varying degrees
# seriously interferes with infrastructure

The term "cyberterrorism" can be used in a variety of different ways, but there are limits to its use. An attack on an [[Internet business]] can be labeled{{by whom|date=July 2018}} cyberterrorism, however when it is done for economic motivations rather than ideological it is typically regarded as [[cybercrime]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Convention also limits the label "cyberterrorism" to actions by individuals, independent groups, or organizations. Any form of [[cyberwarfare]] conducted by governments and states would be regulated and punishable under international law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gable, Kelly A. "Cyber-Apocalypse Now: Securing the Internet against Cyberterrorism and Using Universal Jurisdiction as a Deterrent". ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'', Vol. 43, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Technolytics Institute]] defines cyberterrorism as &lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= INTELLIGENCE|first= ARMY TRAINING AND DOCTRINE COMMAND FORTLEAVENWORTH KS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR|date= 2005-08-15|title= Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism, Handbook Number 1.02|url= http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA439217|language= en|journal= |access-date= 2010-05-04|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110823130310/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA439217|archive-date= 2011-08-23|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The term appears first in defense literature, surfacing (as "cyber-terrorism") in reports by the [[U.S. Army War College]] as early as 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= White|first1= Kenneth C.|title= Cyber-terrorism: Modern mayhem|date= 1998|publisher= U.S. Army War College|url= https://www.amazon.com/Cyber-terrorism-Modern-strategy-research-project/dp/B0006QY6BM |accessdate= 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]], an organization of legislators created to help policymakers in the [[United States of America]] with issues such as economy and [[homeland security]] defines cyberterrorism as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he use of information technology by terrorist groups and individuals to further their agenda. This can include use of information technology to organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and telecommunications infrastructures, or for exchanging information or making threats electronically. Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, [[Denial-of-service attack]]s, or terroristic threats made via electronic communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030110120948/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/lis/CIP/cyberterrorism.htm Cyberterrorism] National Conference of State Legislatures.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NATO]] defines cyberterrorism as "[a] cyberattack using or exploiting computer or communication networks to cause sufficient destruction or disruption to generate fear or to intimidate a society into an ideological goal".&lt;ref&gt;

The United States [[National Infrastructure Protection Center]] defined cyberterrorism as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A criminal act perpetrated by the use of computers and telecommunications capabilities resulting in violence, destruction, and/or disruption of services to create fear by causing confusion and uncertainty within a given population, with the goal of influencing a government or population to conform to a political, social, or ideological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FBI, another United States agency, defines "cyber terrorism" as “premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which results in violence against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents”.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These definitions tend to share the view of cyberterrorism as politically and/or ideologically inclined.  One area of debate is the difference between cyberterrorism and [[hacktivism]]. Hacktivism is ”the marriage of hacking with political activism”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Conway|first= Maura|date= 2008|title= What is Cyberterrorism and How Real is the Threat?|url= |journal= Cyber Behavior|volume= |pages= 217–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both actions are politically driven and involve using computers, however cyberterrorism is primarily used to cause harm. It becomes an issue because acts of violence on the computer can be labeled{{by whom|date=July 2018}} either{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} cyberterrorism or hacktivism.

===Types of cyberterror capability===

The following three levels of cyberterror capability are defined by Monterey group

* Simple-Unstructured: The capability to conduct basic hacks against individual systems using tools created by someone else. The organization possesses little target analysis, command, and control, or learning capability.
* Advanced-Structured: The capability to conduct more sophisticated attacks against multiple systems or networks and possibly, to modify or create basic hacking tools. The organization possesses an elementary target analysis, command and control, and learning capability.
* Complex-Coordinated: The capability for a coordinated attack capable of causing mass-disruption against integrated, heterogeneous defenses (including cryptography). Ability to create sophisticated hacking tools. Highly capable target analysis, command, and control, and organization learning capability.&lt;ref name="cs.georgetown.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.georgetown.edu/~denning/infosec/cyberterror.html | title=Cyberterrorism | work=cs.georgetown.edu | date=May 23, 2000 | accessdate=June 19, 2016 | author=Dorothy E.

===Concerns===
Cyberterrorism is becoming more and more prominent on social media today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warf|first=Barney|date=August 2016|title=Relational Geographies of Cyberterrorism and Cyberwar.|doi=10.1080/13562576.2015.1112113|journal=Space &amp; Polity|volume= 20|issue=2|pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Internet becomes more pervasive in all areas of human endeavor, individuals or groups can use the anonymity afforded by [[cyberspace]] to threaten citizens, specific groups (i.e. with membership based on ethnicity or belief), communities and entire countries, without the inherent threat of capture, injury, or death to the attacker that being physically present would bring.
Many groups such as [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], use tools such as [[denial-of-service attack]] to attack and censor groups who oppose them, creating many concerns for freedom and respect for differences of thought.

Many believe that cyberterrorism is an extreme threat to countries' economies, and fear an attack could potentially lead to another Great Depression. Several leaders agree that cyberterrorism has the highest percentage of threat over other possible attacks on U.S. territory. Although natural disasters are considered a top threat and have proven to be devastating to people and land, there is ultimately little that can be done to prevent such events from happening. Thus, the expectation is to focus more on preventative measures that will make Internet attacks impossible for execution.

As the Internet continues to expand, and computer systems continue to be assigned increased responsibility while becoming more complex and interdependent, sabotage or terrorism via the Internet may become a more serious threat and is possibly one of the top 10 events to "end the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/yahoocanada/101027/canada/top10_events_that_may_end_the_human_race | title = Top 10 events that may end the human race | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | date = October 27, 2010 | publisher = Yahoo News | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101030224924/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/yahoocanada/101027/canada/top10_events_that_may_end_the_human_race | archivedate = 2010-10-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; People have much easier access to illegal involvement within the cyberspace by the ability to access a part of the internet known as the Dark Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilić|first=Vida|date=December 2017|title=Dark Web, Cyber Terrorism and Cyber Warfare: Dark Side of the Cyberspace.|url=libraryproxy.tulsacc.edu:2069/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=127927428&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Balkan Social Science Review|volume= 10|pages=7–24|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet of Things promises to further merge the virtual and physical worlds, which some experts see as a powerful incentive for states to use terrorist proxies in furtherance of objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costigan|first1=Sean|title=Cyber terrorism must be jointly tackled|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/extra/cyber-terrorism-must-be-jointly-tackled|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Sunday Guardian|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependence on the internet is rapidly increasing on a worldwide scale, creating a platform for international cyber terror plots to be formulated and executed as a direct threat to national security.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For terrorists, cyber-based attacks have distinct advantages over physical attacks. They can be conducted remotely, anonymously, and relatively cheaply, and they do not require significant investment in weapons, explosive and personnel. The effects can be widespread and profound. Incidents of cyberterrorism are likely to increase. They will be conducted through denial of service attacks, malware, and other methods that are difficult to envision today.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Brenner and Jon R. Lindsay, “Debating the Chinese Cyber Threat,” International Security, Vol. 40, No. 1, Summer 2015, pp. 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; One example involves the deaths involving the Islamic State and the online social networks Twitter, Google, and Facebook lead to legal action being taken against them, that ultimately resulted in them being sued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Softness|first=Nicole|date=Winter 2016|title=Terrorist Communications: Are Facebook, Twitter, and Google Responsible for the Islamic State's Actions?|url=libraryproxy.tulsacc.edu:2069/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=120438209&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume= 70|pages=201–215|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about cyber attacks by Iran and North Korea, ''[[The New York Times]]'' observes, "The appeal of digital weapons is similar to that of nuclear capability: it is a way for an outgunned, outfinanced nation to even the playing field. 'These countries are pursuing cyberweapons the same way they are pursuing nuclear weapons,' said James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] in Washington. 'It's primitive; it's not top of the line, but it's good enough and they are committed to getting it.'"&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/technology/corporate-cyberattackers-possibly-state-backed-now-seek-to-destroy-data.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp; | work=The New York Times | first1=Nicole | last1=Perlroth | first2=David E. | last2=Sanger | title=Corporate Cyberattacks, Possibly State-Backed, Now Seek to Destroy Data | date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Public interest in cyberterrorism began in the late 1990s, when the term was coined by Barry C. Collin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leb.fbi.gov/2011/november/cyber-terror], William L. Tafoya, Ph.D.,"Cyber Terror", FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin (FBI.gov), November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As 2000 approached, the fear and uncertainty about the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]] heightened, as did the potential for attacks by cyber terrorists. Although the millennium bug was by no means a terrorist attack or plot against the world or the United States, it did act as a catalyst in sparking the fears of a possibly large-scale devastating cyber-attack. Commentators noted that many of the facts of such incidents seemed to change, often with exaggerated media reports.

The high-profile terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 and the ensuing [[War on Terror]] by the US led to further media coverage of the potential threats of cyberterrorism in the years following. Mainstream media coverage often discusses the possibility of a large attack making use of computer networks to sabotage critical infrastructures with the aim of putting human lives in jeopardy or causing disruption on a national scale either directly or by disruption of the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;"White House shifts Y2K focus to states, CNN (February 23, 1999)". CNN. 23 February 1999. Retrieved 25 September 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Winn Schwartau]] and [[John Arquilla]] are reported to have had considerable financial success selling books which described what were purported to be plausible scenarios of mayhem caused by cyberterrorism. Many critics claim that these books were unrealistic in their assessments of whether the attacks described (such as nuclear meltdowns and chemical plant explosions) were possible. A common thread throughout what critics perceive as cyberterror-hype is that of non-[[falsifiability]]; that is, when the predicted disasters fail to occur, it only goes to show how lucky we've been so far, rather than impugning the theory.

In 2016, for the first time ever, the Department of Justice charged Ardit Ferizi with cyberterrorism. He is accused of allegedly hacking into a military website and stealing the names, addresses, and other personal information of government and military personnel and selling it to ISIS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/24/ardit-ferizi-hacker-who-aided-islamic-state-senten/|title=Ardit Ferizi, hacker who aided Islamic State, sentenced for helping terror group with 'kill list'|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International attacks and response==

===Conventions===
As of 2016 there have been seventeen conventions and major legal instruments that specifically deal with terrorist activities and can also be applied to cyber terrorism. 
* 1963: Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft
* 1970: Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft

=== Motivations for cyberattacks ===
There are many different motives for cyberattacks, with the majority being for financial reasons. However, there is increasing evidence that hackers are becoming more politically motivated. Cyberterrorists are aware that governments are reliant on the internet and have exploited this as a result. For example, Mohammad Bin Ahmad As-Sālim's piece '39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad' discusses how an electronic jihad could disrupt the West through targeted hacks of American websites, and other resources seen as anti-Jihad, modernist, or secular in orientation (Denning, 2010; Leyden, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exploring the Subculture of Ideologically Motivated Cyber-Attackers|first1=Thomas J.|last1=Holt|first2=Joshua D.|last2=Freilich|first3=Steven M.|last3=Chermak|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|volume=33|issue=3|pages=212–233|doi=10.1177/1043986217699100|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International institutions ===
As of 2016 the United Nations only has one agency that specializes in cyberterrorism, the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunications Union]].

===U.S. military/protections against cyberterrorism===
The [[US Department of Defense]] (DoD) charged the [[United States Strategic Command]] with the duty of combating cyberterrorism. This is accomplished through the [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations]], which is the operational component supporting [[USSTRATCOM]] in defense of the DoD's [[Global Information Grid]]. This is done by integrating [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations|GNO]] capabilities into the operations of all DoD computers, networks, and systems used by DoD combatant commands, services and agencies.

On November 2, 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the creation of the Air Force's newest [[MAJCOM]], the [[Air Force Cyber Command (Provisional)|Air Force Cyber Command]], which would be tasked to monitor and defend American interest in cyberspace. The plan was however replaced by the creation of [[Twenty-Fourth Air Force]] which became active in August 2009 and would be a component of the planned [[United States Cyber Command]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. DeBlois, et al., "Space Weapons: Crossing the U.S. Rubicon," International Security, Vol. 29, No. 2, Fall 2004, pp. 50–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2009, the White House named its head of [[computer security]] as [[Howard Schmidt]] to coordinate U.S Government, military and intelligence efforts to repel hackers. He left the position in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Chabrow, Eric. [http://www.govinfosecurity.com/obama-cybersecurity-coordinator-resigns-a-4778/op-1 Obama Cybersecurity Coordinator Resigns].

More recently, Obama signed an executive order to enable the US to impose sanctions on either individuals or entities that are suspected to be participating in cyber related acts. These acts were assessed to be possible threats to US national security, financial issues or foreign policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/01/fact-sheet-executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-engaging-si|title=FACT SHEET: Executive Order Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities|date=2015-04-01|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. authorities indicted a man over 92 cyberterrorism hacks attacks on computers used by the Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cybersecurity|last=Marshall|first=Patrick|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2010022600|access-date=|website=CQ Researcher|date=26 September 2003|pp=797–820}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nebraska-based consortium apprehended four million hacking attempts in the course of eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2016111100|title=Protecting the power grid|last=Begos|first=Kevin|date=November 11, 2016 |website=CQ Researcher|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 cyberterrorism attacks grew 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2013021500|title=Improving cybersecurity|last=Flamini|first=Roland|date=Feb 15, 2013|website=CQ Researcher|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonia and NATO===
{{Main|2007 cyberattacks on Estonia}}

The Baltic state of Estonia was target to a massive denial-of-service attack that ultimately rendered the country offline and shut out from services dependent on Internet connectivity in April 2007. The infrastructure of Estonia including everything from online banking and mobile phone networks to government services and access to health care information was disabled for a time. The tech-dependent state experienced severe turmoil and there was a great deal of concern over the nature and intent of the attack.

The cyber attack was a result of an Estonian-Russian dispute over the removal of a bronze statue depicting a World War II-era Soviet soldier from the center of the capital, Tallinn.&lt;ref name="Cyberterrorism"/&gt; In the midst of the armed conflict with Russia, Georgia likewise was subject to sustained and coordinated attacks on its electronic infrastructure in August 2008. In both of these cases, circumstantial evidence point to coordinated Russian attacks, but attribution of the attacks is difficult; though both the countries blame Moscow for contributing to the cyber attacks, proof establishing legal culpability is lacking.

Estonia joined NATO in 2004, which prompted NATO to carefully monitor its member state's response to the attack. NATO also feared escalation and the possibility of cascading effects beyond Estonia's border to other NATO members. In 2008, directly as a result of the attacks, NATO opened a new center of excellence on cyberdefense to conduct research and training on cyber warfare in Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;Maryann Cusimano Love. (2011). ''Beyond Sovereignty: Issues for a Global Agenda''. Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaos resulting from the attacks in Estonia illustrated to the world the dependence countries had on information technology. This dependence then makes countries vulnerable to future cyber attacks and terrorism.&lt;ref name="Cyberterrorism"/&gt;

===Republic of Korea===
According to 2016 Deloitte Asia-Pacific Defense Outlook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/kr/ko/footerlinks/pressreleasespage/2016/press-release-20160224.html|title=한국, 아태지역 국가 중 사이버 테러 취약성 1위 – Deloitte Korea – Press Release|website=딜로이트}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's 'Cyber Risk Score' was 884 out of 1,000 and South Korea is found to be the most vulnerable country to cyber attacks in the Asia-Pacific region. Considering Korea's high speed internet and cutting edge technology, the infrastructure cyber security is relatively weak. In 2013, there was a [[2013 South Korea cyberattack]] which had a huge damage on Korean economy. In 2017, there was a [[ransomware]] attack which harassed private companies and users who had to experience personal information leakage. Additionally, there were North Korea's cyber attacks which risked national security of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of countermeasure and stratege analysis on North Korean cyber terror, 신충근 and 이상진&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, South Korean government's countermeasure is to protect the information security centres the National Intelligence Agency. Currently, 'cyber security' is one of the major goals of NIS Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.nis.go.kr&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, South Korea had established policies related to National cyber security and trying to prevent cyber crises via sophisticated investigation on potential threats. Meanwhile, scholars emphasise on improving the national consciousness towards cyber attacks as South Korea had already entered the so-called 'hyper connected society'.

===China===
The Chinese Defense Ministry confirmed the existence of an online defense unit in May 2011. Composed of about thirty elite internet specialists, the so-called "Cyber Blue Team", or "Blue Army", is officially claimed to be engaged in cyber-defense operations, though there are fears the unit has been used to penetrate secure online systems of foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yu|first=Eileen|title=China dispatches online army|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/china-dispatches-online-army-62300502.htm|accessdate=3 June 2011|newspaper=[[ZDNet|ZDNet Asia]]|date=27 May 2011|quote=Geng Yansheng, spokesperson for China's Defense Ministry, was quoted to say that the PLA set up the cyberwar unit, or 'cyber blue team', to support its military training and upgrade the army's Internet security defense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Confirms Existence of Elite Cyber-Warfare Outfit the 'Blue Army'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/05/26/china-confirms-existence-blue-army-elite-cyber-warfare-outfit/|accessdate=3 June 2011|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=26 May 2011|quote=China set up a specialized online 'Blue Army' unit that it claims will protect the People's Liberation Army from outside attacks, prompting fears that the crack team was being used to infiltrate foreign governments' systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Pakistan Government has also taken steps to curb the menace of cyberterrorism and extremist propaganda. [http://nacta.gov.pk National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta)] is working on joint programs with different NGOs and other cyber security organizations in Pakistan to combat this problem. [http://surfsafe.pk Surf Safe Pakistan] is one such example. Now people in Pakistan can report extremist and terrorist related content online on Surf Safe Pakistan portal. The National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) provides the Federal Government's leadership for the Surf Safe Campaign. In March 2008 an al Qaeda forum posted a training website with six training modules to learn cyberterrorism techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/36306_6.pdf|title=Terrorism and the Internet|last=Mantel|first=Barbara|date=November 2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
A series of [[2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine|powerful cyber attacks]] began 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.

==Examples==
An operation can be done by anyone anywhere in the world, for it can be performed thousands of miles away from a target. An attack can cause serious damage to a critical infrastructure which may result in casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayers|first=Cynthia|title=The Worst is Yet To Come|journal=Futurist|date=September 2009|pages=49|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attacks are conducted in furtherance of political and social objectives, as the following examples illustrate:

* In 1996, a computer hacker allegedly associated with the White Supremacist movement temporarily disabled a Massachusetts ISP and damaged part of the ISP's record keeping system. The ISP had attempted to stop the hacker from sending out worldwide racist messages under the ISP's name. The hacker signed off with the threat: "you have yet to see true electronic terrorism. This is a promise."
* In 1998, Spanish protesters bombarded the Institute for Global Communications (IGC) with thousands of bogus e-mail messages. E-mail was tied up and undeliverable to the ISP's users, and support lines were tied up with people who couldn't get their mail. The protestors also spammed IGC staff and member accounts, clogged their Web page with bogus credit card orders, and threatened to employ the same tactics against organizations using IGC services. They demanded that IGC stop hosting the Web site for the Euskal Herria Journal, a New York-based publication supporting Basque independence. Protestors said IGC supported terrorism because a section on the Web pages contained materials on the terrorist group ETA, which claimed responsibility for assassinations of Spanish political and security officials, and attacks on military installations. IGC finally relented and pulled the site because of the "mail bombings."
* In 1998, ethnic Tamil guerrillas attempted to disrupt Sri Lankan embassies by sending large volumes of e-mail. The embassies received 800 e-mails a day over a two-week period. The messages read "We are the Internet Black Tigers and we're doing this to disrupt your communications." Intelligence authorities characterized it as the first known attack by terrorists against a country's computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denning|first1=Dorothy|title=Cyberterrorism: The Logic Bomb versus the Truck Bomb|journal=Global Dialogue|date=Autumn 2000|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=111|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627073012/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=111|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-27|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the Kosovo conflict in 1999, NATO computers were blasted with e-mail bombs and hit with denial-of-service attacks by hacktivists protesting the NATO bombings. In addition, businesses, public organizations and academic institutes received highly politicized virus-laden e-mails from a range of Eastern European countries, according to reports. Web defacements were also common. After the Chinese Embassy was accidentally bombed in Belgrade{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, Chinese hacktivists posted messages such as "We won't stop attacking until the war stops!" on U.S. government Web sites.
* Since December 1997, the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) has been conducting Web sit-ins against various sites in support of the Mexican Zapatistas.

===Sabotage===
Non-political acts of [[sabotage]] have caused financial and other damage. In 2000, disgruntled employee Vitek Boden caused the release of 800,000 litres of untreated sewage into waterways in [[Maroochy Shire]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/ics/documents/Maroochy-Water-Services-Case-Study_report.pdf |format=PDf |title=Malicious Control System Cyber Security Attack Case Study–Maroochy Water Services, Australia |publisher=csrc.nist.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage |title=Hacker jailed for reverse sewage |publisher= The Register |date=October 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in May 2007 [[Estonia]] [[Cyberattacks on Estonia 2007|was subjected to a mass cyber-attack]] in the wake of the removal of a Russian World War II war memorial from downtown Tallinn. The attack was a distributed [[denial-of-service attack]] in which selected sites were bombarded with traffic to force them offline; nearly all Estonian government ministry networks as well as two major Estonian bank networks were knocked offline; in addition, the political party website of Estonia's Prime Minister Andrus Ansip featured a counterfeit letter of apology from Ansip for removing the memorial statue. Despite speculation that the attack had been coordinated by the Russian government, Estonia's defense minister admitted he had no conclusive evidence linking cyber attacks to Russian authorities. Russia called accusations of its involvement "unfounded", and neither [[NATO]] nor [[European Commission]] experts were able to find any conclusive proof of official Russian government participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20070906/76959190.html|title=Estonia has no evidence of Kremlin involvement in cyber attacks|first=|last=Sputnik|website=en.rian.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2008 a man from Estonia was convicted for launching the attacks against the [[Estonian Reform Party]] website and fined.&lt;ref name="bbc_gal"&gt;{{cite news|publisher= BBC|date = 2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-02-23|title = Estonia fines man for 'cyber war'|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7208511.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Leyden|first=John|title=Estonia fines man for DDoS attacks|newspaper=The Register|date=2008-01-24|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/24/estonian_ddos_fine|accessdate=2008-02-22|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russia-Georgia War]], on 5 August 2008, three days before Georgia launched its invasion of South Ossetia, the websites for [[OSInform News Agency]] and [[OSRadio]] were hacked. The OSinform website at osinform.ru kept its header and logo, but its content was replaced by a feed to the [[Alania TV]] website content. Alania TV, a Georgian government-supported television station aimed at audiences in South Ossetia, denied any involvement in the hacking of the websites. [[Dmitry Medoyev]], at the time the South Ossetian [[Envoy (title)|envoy]] to [[Moscow]], claimed that Georgia was attempting to cover up information on events which occurred in the lead-up to the war.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news

[http://www.today.az/news/politics/46885.html Russian intelligence services undertook large scale attack against Day.Az server]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website defacement and denial of service===
Even more recently, in October 2007, the website of Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was attacked by hackers. A radical Russian nationalist youth group, the [[Eurasian Youth Union|Eurasian Youth Movement]], claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kievukraine.info/2007/10/russian-nationalists-claim.html|title=Russian Nationalists Claim Responsibility For Attack On Yushchenko's Web Site|website=news.kievukraine.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/30/europe/EU-GEN-Ukraine-Web-Attack.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219174431/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/30/europe/EU-GEN-Ukraine-Web-Attack.php|title=Russian nationalists claim responsibility for attack on Yushchenko's Web site|work=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-10-30|archivedate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 hackers attacked [[NATO]] computers. The computers flooded them with email and hit them with a [[denial-of-service attack]]. The hackers were protesting against the NATO bombings of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Businesses, public organizations and academic institutions were bombarded with highly politicized emails containing viruses from other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9905/10/hack.attack/ | work=CNN | title=Hackers attack U.S. government Web sites in protest of Chinese embassy bombing | accessdate=2010-04-30}} (See also [[Chinese embassy bombing]])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''D1NZ''' is a production car [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] series in [[New Zealand]]. There is currently no New Zealand drifting championship   so D1NZ is the premier series running as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand. It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events on the circuit. Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars. The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport. New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before entering the Pro championship (unless coming from an equivalent international series). Organizers aim to promote and educate Drifting in New Zealand, with a regulated safe environment. Despite similar moniker, the series is not related to the Japanese [[D1 Grand Prix]] series. It has been recognised as the longest running drifting series in the world.

==Format of the competition==
The format of a round consists of scrutineering and a drivers briefing in the morning. This is followed by a test sessions with cars being allowed out onto the track to practice and adjust settings for the particular track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d1nz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=33 |title=D1NZ competitor info |accessdate=2007-08-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304093305/http://www.d1nz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=33 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifying is then held with the competitors allowed two passes to try qualify for the Top 32 competition.&lt;ref name=judging&gt;[http://www.d1nz.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=38 D1NZ judging overview], Retrieved August 25, 200&lt;/ref&gt; The drivers are judged based on line, angle, and style.&lt;ref name=judging /&gt; Line involves taking a predetermined line set by the judges at drivers briefing. The line generally includes apexing each corner, or "inside clip", and may include "outside clip" points. The closer to these points, the higher the line score. Angle means maintaining an aggressive angle throughout the judged section and aggressive direction switches (aka transitions). Style refers to how aggressive the driving is during the run, the amount of smoke produced, how hard the car is pushed and the presentation of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=judging /&gt;

The judging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few corners that provide good viewing and lend themselves to be ideal for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, except as it pertains to gridding the vehicles by marshalls and setting up the car for the first judged corner.

The competition is held after the qualifying session, with only the Top 32 drivers competing, as per the judges decision in the qualifying. Drivers are entered into a battle tree (competition order) and paired off, and each battle comprises two passes with each driver taking a turn to lead. The best of the 16 battles go to the top 8 battles, then to the top 4, and then to the final or 3rd/4th place. The passes are judged as explained above, however there are a few new rules such as:

*Increasing the lead under drift conditions helps to win that pass.
*Maintaining a close gap while chasing under drift conditions helps to win that pass.
*The lead car is to try run an ideal qualifying pass, the chase car is to use the rear of the lead car as a moving clipping point and mimic (within reason) the lead cars movements.
*Points are awarded for each pass, and usually one driver prevails. 
*The points for each battle are awarded as a total of 10 (i.e. 6/4, 7/3, 8.5/1.5). The sum of the two battles produces the winner.
*A Spin during Battle will result in gaining zero (0) points for that run.
*One wheel off the track will result in a points deduction. Two wheels off will result in zero points for that competitor for that run.&lt;ref name=judging /&gt;

Sometimes the judges cannot agree or cannot decide. In such cases more passes may be run (i.e.: a re-run) until a winner is produced. Sometimes mechanical failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a battle. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) will drive a solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'. It is also extremely important that crowd members pull gang signs whilst their favorite driver drifts by, this will vastly increase their chance of winning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbomagazine.com/features/0401tur_drifting_inaugural_d1_grand_prix/index.html Drift Mania!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7310">'''DWI courts''' (sometimes called DUI courts) are a form of court that exists in some United States legal jurisdictions, that use substance-abuse interventions and treatment with defendants who plead guilty of [[Driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]] or impaired. DUI courts may focus on repeat offenders and drivers with very high levels of blood alcohol at the time of the offense.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a DWI Court?|url=https://www.dwicourts.org/uncategorized/what-dwi-court/|website=National Center for DWU Courts|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December, 2011, there were approximately 192 designated DUI courts in the United States, and approximately 406 [[drug court]]s that also accept DUI offenders.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;

==Terminology==
The term DWI stands for driving while intoxicated, while the term DUI stands for driving under the influence. Both charges relate to operating a motor vehicle while impaired as the result of the consumption of alcohol or another intoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Drunk Driving Terminology - DUI, DWI, BAC, and Related Terms|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk_Terminology.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name given to a DWI court may vary depending upon the terminology used in the state for its impaired driving offenses.

==Goals==
DWI courts tend to focus on the most serious cases and repeat offenders, and thus apply strict standards to the cases and defendants that come before them.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; Drunk and impaired driving offenses involves a substantial risk of harm and death to the driver and to others, as a foreseeable consequence of such conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuman|first1=Gary|title=Dying Under The Influence|journal=Tort Trial &amp; Insurance Practice Law Journal|date=2008|volume=43|pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, DWI cases accounted for 32 percent of motor vehicle traffic fatalities in the United States&lt;ref name="Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention"&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Drunk Driving Crackdown —  August 15–September 1, 2008|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|date=8 August 2008|volume=57|issue=31|pages=854|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=764240|jstor=23318693|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, alcohol was involved in 9,967 motor vehicle accident deaths, accounting for 31 percent of all traffic fatalities.&lt;ref name=niaaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcohol Facts and Statistics|url=https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics|website=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 6.2 percent of adults aged eighteen and older have an alcohol use disorder, characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use. &lt;ref name=niaaa/&gt; DWI courts focus on defendants who are deemed at high risk of re-offending if given a less intensive disposition.&lt;ref name=dwibp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vlavianos|first1=Richard|last2=Floerke|first2=Shaun|last3=Carey|first3=Shannon|title=DWI Court Research and   Best Practices|url=https://www.nadcp.org/sites/default/files/2014/C-6.pdf|website=National Association of Drug Court Professionals|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; DWI courts seek to reduce impaired driving by treating [[alcoholism]], while requiring offenders to take responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hess|first=Kären M.|author2=Christine Hess Orthmann|title=Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2008|edition=9|pages=582|chapter=Courts|isbn=0-495-39090-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdxKm_ypYyMC&amp;pg=PT515#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that DWI Courts reduce both DWI recidivism and general criminal recidivism by an average of more than twelve percent, with the most successful DWI courts reducing recidivism by as much as fifty to sixty percent as compared to other forms of sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harron|first1=Ashley|title=The  Bottom Line|url=https://www.dwicourts.org/wp-content/uploads/The%20Bottom%20Line_0.pdf|website=National Center for DWI Courts|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
Defendants who want DWI court treatment are required to abstain from drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name=dwibp/&gt; Participants may also be subject to various requirements&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Adult DUI/DWI  Treatment Court  Programs|url=https://www.courts.state.md.us/sites/default/files/import/opsc/dtc/pdfs/manuals/adultduidwidrugtreatmentmanual.pdf|website=Maryland Drug Courts|publisher=Office of Problem- Solving Courts|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
* Random visits from probation or law enforcement officers
* Attending treatment
* Participation in recovery support meetings, such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]
* Community service
* Frequent urine analysis or blood alcohol tests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/12905576.html |title=DWI court succeeds by keeping keen eye on offenders |last=Olson |first=Rochelle |date=30 December 2007 |work=Star Tribune |accessdate=2009-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010020918/http://www.startribune.com/local/west/12905576.html |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defining DWI offenses, states and courts must consider whether or not the charge or a specific drunk driving offense should be classified as a ''crime of violence''. If a court rules the incident as a ''crime of violence'', which would result in the charge being treated as an "aggravated" felony for purposes if immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Eric|title=Comments on Sentencing Procedures|journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter|date=April 2011|volume=23|jstor=10.1525/fsr.2011.23.4.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davenport|first1=Maria-Teresa|title=Deportation and Driving: Felony Dui and Reckless Driving as Crimes of Violence Following Leocal v.

==The search for bin Laden==
{{Main|Search for Osama bin Laden}}
Accounts of how bin Laden was located by U.S. intelligence differ. The White House and CIA director [[John O. Brennan|John Brennan]] stated that the process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] and NBC News, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention in exchange for a bounty.

In August 2010, a former Pakistani intelligence officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad and offered to reveal bin Laden's location, in return for the $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst [[Raelynn Hillhouse]].&lt;ref name=intercepthersh/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBChersh/&gt; The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt;

According to the retired senior U.S. intelligence official speaking to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and kept by the ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt; According to the official, retired CIA officials emphasized the importance of bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.

In May 2015 the German newspaper ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' reported that Germany's [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]] (BND) was aware that bin Laden was in Pakistan with the knowledge of Pakistani intelligence services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11611550/German-spy-agency-helped-US-find-Osama-bin-Laden.html|title=German spy agency 'helped US find Osama bin Laden'|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=May 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BND informed the CIA that bin Laden was in Pakistan and ''Bild am Sonntag'' states that the CIA then found his "precise location" through a courier. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' questioned the veracity of the report, produced in the midst of [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|a scandal over BND and NSA collaboration]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Identity of courier===
According to the earlier official version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA [[black site]]s and the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders.&lt;ref name="phonecall" /&gt; Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched [[Operation Infinite Reach|missile strikes]] against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracking use of bin Laden's satellite phone|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/05/28/tracking-use-of-bin-ladens-satellite-phone/ |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. official had stated that by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the ''[[Kunya (Arabic)#Kunya as a nom de guerre|kunya]]'' [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]] (sometimes referred to as [[Sheikh]] Abu Ahmed from Kuwait).&lt;ref name="phonecall" /&gt; One of those claims came from [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]], a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti who was part of the inner circle of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/opinion/bergen-zero-dark-thirty Bergen, Peter "'Zero Dark Thirty': Did torture really net bin Laden?"] CNN, December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2003, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but that the man was not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt;

According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a prisoner named [[Hassan Ghul]] revealed that bin Laden relied on a trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20131017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Documents reveal NSA's extensive involvement in targeted killing program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/documents-reveal-nsas-extensive-involvement-in-targeted-killing-program/2013/10/16/29775278-3674-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story_2.html|accessdate=October 17, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 17, 2013|first1=Greg |last1=Miller |first2=Julie |last2=Tate |first3=Barton |last3=Gellman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]]. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt; Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006.&lt;ref name="miamifaraj" /&gt; He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that he was part of bin Laden's inner circle.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt;

In 2007, officials learned al-Kuwaiti's real name,&lt;ref name="realname" /&gt; though they said they would disclose neither the name nor how they learned it.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt; Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, from Pakistan's [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat Valley]]. He and his brother Abrar and their families were living at bin Laden's compound, the officials said.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Kathy, "[http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2011/06/ap-bin-ladens-trusted-confidante-identified-060111/ Bin Laden's trusted confidante identified]", ''[[Military Times]]'', June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the name Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan appears in the JTF-GTMO detainee assessment for Abu Faraj al-Libbi released by [[WikiLeaks]] on April 24, 2011,&lt;ref name="wikileaksfaraj" /&gt; there was speculation that the U.S. assault on the Abbottabad compound was expedited as a precaution.&lt;ref name="dailymailwikileaks" /&gt; The CIA never found anyone named Maulawi Jan and concluded that the name was an invention of al-Libbi.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt;

A 2010 wiretap of another suspect picked up a conversation with al-Kuwaiti. CIA paramilitary operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound, which led them to speculate it was bin Laden's location.&lt;ref name="phonecall" /&gt;

The courier and a relative (who was either a brother or a cousin) were killed in the May 2, 2011 raid.&lt;ref name="torture" /&gt; Afterward, some locals identified the men as [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] named Arshad and Tareq Khan.&lt;ref name="pashtuns" /&gt; Arshad Khan was carrying an old, noncomputerized Pakistani [[Identity document|identification card]], which identified him as from Khat Kuruna, a village near [[Charsadda]] in northwestern Pakistan. Pakistani officials have found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and suspect the men were living under false identities.&lt;ref name="nytpakinvest" /&gt;

===Bin Laden's compound===
{{Main|Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad}}
[[File:Osama bin Laden compound1.jpg|thumb|View of the compound]]
The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden.&lt;ref name="MazzettiCooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dedman"/&gt; Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family.&lt;ref name="Dedman"/&gt;

Built in 2004, the three-story&lt;ref name="ZengerleBull"/&gt; compound was at the end of a narrow dirt road.&lt;ref name="ref-96"/&gt; [[Google Earth]] maps made from satellite photographs show that the compound was not present in 2001 but had been built by the time that new images were taken in 2005.&lt;ref name="ref-88"/&gt; It is located {{convert|2.5|mi}} northeast of the city center of Abbottabad.&lt;ref name="MazzettiCooper"/&gt; Abbottabad is about {{convert|100|mi}} from the Afghanistan border on the far eastern side of Pakistan (about {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=x| (|)}} from India). The compound is {{convert|0.8|mi}} southwest of the [[Pakistan Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="deadlyraid"/&gt; Located on a plot of land eight times larger than those of nearby houses, the compound was surrounded by a 12-to-18-foot (3.7–5.5&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;ref name="Dedman"/&gt; concrete wall topped with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="MazzettiCooper"/&gt; It had two security gates, and the third-floor balcony had a seven-foot-high (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) privacy wall, tall enough to hide the {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} bin Laden.

The compound had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, unlike their neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection.&lt;ref name="ZengerleBull"/&gt; Local residents called the building the ''Waziristan [[Haveli]]'', because they believed the owner was from [[Waziristan]].&lt;ref name="WaziristanHaveli"/&gt; Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ladd |first=Trevor J. |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-ladens-pakistani-compound-demolished/story?id=15800784 |title=Osama Bin Laden's Pakistani Compound Demolished |publisher=ABC News |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligence gathering===
[[File:CIA aerial view Osama bin Laden compound Abbottabad.jpg|thumb|[[CIA]] aerial photo of the compound]]
The CIA led the effort to surveil and gather intelligence on the compound; other critical roles in the operation were played by other United States agencies, including the [[National Security Agency]], [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) and [[U.S. Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]].&lt;ref name="fedtimes"/&gt; U.S. officials told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the intelligence-gathering effort "was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in December [2010] to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it."&lt;ref name="waposurveil"/&gt;

The CIA rented a home in Abbottabad from which a team staked out and observed the compound over a number of months. The CIA team used informants and other techniques – including a widely criticized fake [[polio vaccination]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/02/aid-groups-cia-osama-bin-laden-polio-crisis |title=CIA tactics to trap Bin Laden linked with polio crisis, say aid groups |work=The Guardian |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/06/world/asia/pakistan-polio-vaccination/index.html |title=Bin Laden raid harms Pakistan polio fight |publisher=CNN |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – to gather intelligence on the compound. The safe house was abandoned immediately after bin Laden's death.&lt;ref name="waposurveil"/&gt; The U.S. [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] helped the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] create mission simulators for the pilots, and analyzed data from an [[RQ-170]]&lt;ref name="CIA flew stealth drones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=CIA flew stealth drones into Pakistan to monitor bin Laden house|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-flew-stealth-drones-into-pakistan-to-monitor-bin-laden-house/2011/05/13/AF5dW55G_story.html|accessdate=August 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; drone before, during and after the raid on the compound. The NGA created three-dimensional renderings of the house, created schedules describing residential traffic patterns, and assessed the number, height and gender of the residents of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/the-little-known-agency-that-helped-kill-bin-laden/238454/ |title=The Little-Known Agency That Helped Kill Bin Laden |work=The Atlantic |date=May 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also involved in the intelligence gathering measures were an arm of the National Security Agency known as the [[Office of Tailored Access Operations|Tailored Access Operations group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paterson|first=Andrea|title=The NSA has its own team of elite hackers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/29/the-nsa-has-its-own-team-of-elite-hackers/|accessdate=August 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, among other things, is specialized in surreptitiously installing spyware and tracking devices on targeted computers and mobile-phone networks. Because of the work of the Tailored Access Operations group, the NSA could collect intelligence from mobile phones that were used by al-Qaeda operatives and other "persons of interest" in the hunt for bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To hunt Osama bin Laden, satellites watched over Abbottabad, Pakistan, and Navy SEALs|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/to-hunt-osama-bin-laden-satellites-watched-over-abbottabad-pakistan-and-navy-seals/2013/08/29/8d32c1d6-10d5-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html|accessdate=August 31, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 29, 2013|first1=Craig |last1=Whitlock |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of bin Laden's compound may have ultimately contributed to his discovery. A former CIA official involved in the [[manhunt (military)|manhunt]] told ''The Washington Post'': "The place was three [[Second floor|stories]] high, and you could watch it from a variety of angles."&lt;ref name="waposurveil"/&gt;

The CIA used a process called "[[red team]]ing" on the collected intelligence to independently review the circumstantial evidence and available facts of their case that bin Laden was living at the Abbottabad compound.&lt;ref name="sfgredteam"/&gt; An administration official stated, "We conducted red-team exercises and other forms of alternative analysis to check our work. No other candidate fit the bill as well as bin Laden did."&lt;ref name="timered"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite what officials described as an extraordinarily concentrated collection effort leading up to the operation, no U.S. spy agency was ever able to capture a photograph of bin Laden at the compound before the raid or a recording of the voice of the mysterious male figure whose family occupied the structure's top two floors.&lt;ref name="waposurveil"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The official mission [[code name]] was ''Operation Neptune Spear''.&lt;ref name="deadlyraid"/&gt; [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune's]] spear is the [[trident]], which appears on the U.S. Navy's [[Special Warfare insignia]], with the three prongs of the trident representing the operational capacity of SEALs on sea, air and land.

===Objective===
The [[Associated Press]] reported at the time two U.S. officials as stating the operation was "a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender", but that "it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering".&lt;ref name="aprisks"/&gt; [[United States Homeland Security Council|White House counterterrorism advisor]] [[John O. Brennan]] said after the raid: "If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that."&lt;ref name="stormedroom"/&gt; CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]] said on ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'': "The authority here was to kill bin Laden.&amp;nbsp;... Obviously under the [[rules of engagement]], if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him. But, they had full authority to kill him."&lt;ref name="pbsinterview"/&gt;

A U.S. national security official, who was not named, told [[Reuters]] that "'this was a kill operation', making clear there was no desire to try to capture bin Laden alive in Pakistan".&lt;ref name="commandos"/&gt; Another source referencing a ''kill'' (rather than ''capture'') order stated, "Officials described the reaction of the special operators when they were told a number of weeks ago that they had been chosen to train for the mission. 'They were told, "We think we found Osama bin Laden, and your job is to kill him,"' an official recalled. "The SEALs started to cheer."&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

===Planning and final decision===
The CIA briefed [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[William H. McRaven]], the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011. McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response. He assigned a captain from the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) to work with a CIA team at their campus in [[Langley, Virginia]]. The captain, named "Brian", set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA's Langley compound and, with six other JSOC officers, began to plan the raid.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; Administration attorneys considered legal implications and options before the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Before Osama bin Laden Raid, Obama Administration’s Secret Legal Deliberations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/obama-legal-authorization-osama-bin-laden-raid.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 28, 2015|access-date=October 28, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Charlie|last=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a helicopter raid, planners considered attacking the compound with [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bombers. They also considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces. Obama decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain [[operational security]] for the operation against bin Laden. "There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond," a senior adviser to the President told ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

Obama met with the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on March 14 to review the options; he was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At the end of the meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two [[U.S. Air Force]] officers were tasked with exploring that option further.&lt;ref name="spymilitary"/&gt;

The CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground [[bunker]] below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 {{convert|2000|lb|adj=on}} bombs fitted with [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] guidance systems would be required to destroy it.&lt;ref name="behindthehunt"/&gt; With that amount of [[Ammunition|ordnance]], at least one other house was in the [[blast radius]]. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore, it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29, Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid. The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone-fired [[Pyros (bomb)|small tactical munition]] as he paced in his compound's vegetable garden.&lt;ref name="Bowden144"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bowden |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Bowden |title=The Hunt For 'Geronimo' |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=November 2012 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/11/inside-osama-bin-laden-assassination-plot|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}, p.&amp;nbsp;144&lt;/ref&gt;

McRaven hand-picked a team drawing from the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron,&lt;ref name="RelentStrike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Sean|title=Relentless Strike|location=Chapter 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of four that make up DEVGRU. Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention. The team had language skills and experience with cross-border operations into Pakistan.&lt;ref name="spymilitary"/&gt; Almost all of the Red Squadron operators had 10 or more deployments to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="NoEasyDay"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bissonnette|first1=Mark|title=No Easy Day|pages=158, 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without being told the exact nature of their mission, the team performed rehearsals of the raid in two locations in the U.S.—around April 10 at [[Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity]] facility in [[North Carolina]] where a 1:1 version of bin Laden's compound was built, and April 18 in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="behindthehunt"/&gt; The location in Nevada was at {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} [[elevation]]—chosen to test the effects the [[altitude]] would have on the raiders' helicopters. The Nevada mock-up used [[chain-link fence]]s to simulate the compound walls, which left the U.S. participants unaware of the potential effects of the high compound walls on the helicopters' lift capabilities.&lt;ref name="Bowden144"/&gt;

Planners believed the SEALs could get to Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcons]] to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman |first=Siobhan |last2=Barnes |first2=Julian E. |title=Spy, Military Ties Aided bin Laden Raid |work=The Wall Street Journal Online |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704083904576334160172068344 |date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If bin Laden surrendered, he would be held near [[Bagram Air Base]]. If the SEALs were discovered by the Pakistanis in the middle of the raid, [[Joint Chiefs]] Chairman Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] would call Pakistan's army chief General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] and try to negotiate their release.&lt;ref name="targetchapter6"/&gt;

When the National Security Council (NSC) met again on April 19, Obama gave provisional approval for the helicopter raid. He was worried that the plan for dealing with the Pakistanis was too uncertain, Obama asked Admiral McRaven to equip the team to fight its way out if necessary.&lt;ref name="spymilitary"/&gt;

McRaven and the SEALs left for Afghanistan to practice at a one-acre, full-scale replica of the compound built on a restricted area of Bagram known as Camp Alpha.&lt;ref name="fortbragg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretteam"/&gt; The team departed the U.S. from [[Naval Air Station Oceana]] on April 26 in a C-17 aircraft, refueled on the ground at [[Ramstein Air Base]] in Germany, landed at [[Bagram Air Base]], then moved to Jalalabad on April 27.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

On April 28, Admiral Mullen explained the final plan to the NSC. To bolster the "fight your way out" scenario, [[Chinook helicopter]]s with additional troops would be positioned nearby. Most of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option, but changed his support the next day to the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowden144"/&gt;

On April 29 at 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern daylight time|EDT]],&lt;ref name=targetchapter6/&gt; Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go-ahead. The raid would take place the following day. That evening the president was informed that the operation would be delayed one day due to cloudy weather.

On April 30, Obama called McRaven one more time to wish the SEALs well and to thank them for their service.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; That evening, the President attended the annual [[White House Correspondent's Association]] dinner, which was hosted by comedian and television actor [[Seth Meyers]]. At one point, Meyers joked: "People think bin Laden is hiding in the [[Hindu Kush]], but did you know that every day from 4 to 5 he hosts a show on [[C-SPAN]]?" Obama laughed, despite his knowledge of the operation to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Carbone |first=Nick |author-link=Nick Carbone |title=Obama's Poker Face: President Reacts to Bin Laden Joke at Correspondents' Dinner |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 2011 |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/02/obamas-poker-face-president-reacts-to-bin-laden-joke-at-correspondents-dinner/|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1 at 1:22&amp;nbsp;p.m., Panetta, acting on the president's orders, directed McRaven to move forward with the operation. Shortly after 3&amp;nbsp;p.m., the president joined national security officials in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]] to monitor the raid. They watched [[night vision|night-vision]] images taken from a [[Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel|Sentinel drone]] while Panetta, appearing in a corner of the screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening.&lt;ref name="Bowden144"/&gt;&lt;ref name="targetchapter6"/&gt; Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General [[Marshall B. Webb|Marshall Webb]], assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day."&lt;ref&gt;quotes from Hillary Clinton's book, ''Hard Choices'', as quoted in ''Daily Telegraph'', June 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the U.S. [[embassy]] in Islamabad.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

===Execution of the operation===

====Approach and entry====
[[File:Osama bin Laden hideout-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|Osama bin Laden's hideout]], showing the high concrete walls that surround the compound]]

The raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] from [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]]'s Red Squadron. For legal reasons (namely that the U.S. was not [[Declaration of war by the United States|at war]] with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref name="soldierspy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42852700/ns/world_news-south_and_central_asia/ |title=US forces kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan |publisher=MSNBC |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SEALs operated in teams and used weapons including the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416|HK416]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/washington-whispers/articles/2011/05/11/the-gun-that-killed-osama-bin-laden-revealed |title=The Gun That Killed Osama bin Laden Revealed |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; assault rifle (their main weapon), [[Mark 48 machine gun|Mark. 48]] machine guns used for fire support, and the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7|MP7]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidle |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_schmidle |title=Planning &amp; Executing the Mission to Get Bin Laden |work=The New Yorker |date=August 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal defense weapon used by some SEALs for close quarters and greater silence.

According to ''The New York Times'', a total of "79 commandos and a dog" were involved in the raid.&lt;ref name="ref-96"/&gt; The [[Dogs in warfare|military working dog]]&lt;ref name="seal"/&gt; was a [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|Belgian Malinois]] named Cairo.&lt;ref name="dogname"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecneptune"/&gt; According to one report, the dog was tasked with tracking "anyone who tried to escape and to alert SEALs to any approaching Pakistani security forces".&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; The dog was to be used to help deter any Pakistani ground response to the raid and to help look for any hidden rooms or hidden doors in the compound.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; Additional personnel on the mission included a language interpreter,&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; the dog handler, helicopter pilots, plus intelligence collectors, and navigators using [[Classified information|highly classified]] [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral imagers]] to view the operation.&lt;ref name="secretteam"/&gt;

The SEALs flew into Pakistan from a staging base in the city of [[Jalalabad]] in eastern Afghanistan after originating at [[Bagram Air Base]] in northeastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Calvin, "[http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2011/05/ap-inside-bin-ladens-lair-with-seal-team-six-050411/ Inside bin Laden's lair with SEAL Team 6]", ''[[Military Times]]'', May 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR)]], a [[U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] unit known as the "[[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Night Stalkers]]", provided the two modified [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Max |last=Behrman |url=https://gizmodo.com/5797783/the-berzerker-black-hawk-helicopter-that-helped-kill-osama-bin-laden |title=The Berzerker Black Hawk Helicopter That Helped Kill Osama bin Laden |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were used for the raid itself, as well as the much larger [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] [[heavy-lift helicopters]] that were employed as backups.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretteam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt;

The Black Hawks used  previously unseen "stealth" versions of the helicopter that fly more quietly and are harder to detect on [[radar]] than conventional models;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/world/asia/06helicopter.html |title=Attack on Bin Laden Used Stealthy Helicopter That Had Been a Secret |first=Christopher |last=Drew |work=The New York Times |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dangerroomstealth"/&gt; due to the weight of the extra stealth equipment on the Black Hawks, cargo was "calculated to the ounce, with the weather factored in."&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt;

The Chinooks kept on standby were on the ground "in a deserted area roughly two-thirds of the way" from Jalalabad to Abbottabad, with two additional SEAL teams consisting of approximately 24 DEVGRU operators&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; for a [[Quick reaction force|"quick reaction force" (QRF)]]. The Chinooks were equipped with 7.62mm [[Minigun|GAU-17/A miniguns]] and [[GAU-21]]/B .50-caliber machine guns and extra fuel for the Black Hawks. Their mission was to interdict any Pakistani military attempts to interfere with the raid. Other Chinooks, holding 25 more SEALs from DEVGRU, were stationed just across the border in Afghanistan in case reinforcements were needed during the raid.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

The 160th SOAR helicopters were supported by multiple other aircraft, including fixed-wing fighter jets and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]].&lt;ref name="ref-24"/&gt; According to CNN, "the [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] had a full team of combat search-and-rescue helicopters available".&lt;ref name="ref-24"/&gt;

The raid was scheduled for a time with little moonlight so the helicopters could enter Pakistan "low to the ground and undetected".&lt;ref name="ref-87"/&gt; The helicopters used hilly terrain and [[nap-of-the-earth]] techniques to reach the compound without appearing on radar and alerting the Pakistani military. The flight from Jalalabad to Abbottabad took about 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

According to the mission plan, the first helicopter would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs [[fast-rope]]d to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to the northeast corner of the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaaph.com/laden-mission-obama/ |title=Bin Laden mission was roll of the dice for Obama |publisher=Zaaph |accessdate=May 11, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517034208/http://www.zaaph.com/laden-mission-obama/|archivedate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they hovered above the target the first helicopter experienced a hazardous airflow condition known as a [[vortex ring state]]. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecneptune"/&gt;) and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing.&lt;ref name="globalsecneptune"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-05/commando-black-hawk-downed-by-air-vortex-not-mechanics-in-bin-laden-raid.html|title=Helicopter Carrying SEALs Downed by Vortex, Not Mechanical Flaw or Gunfire|last=Capaccio|first=Tony|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date= May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-97"/&gt; The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls,&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt; damaging its [[tail rotor]],&lt;ref name="ST6return"/&gt; and the helicopter rolled onto its side.&lt;ref name="phonecall"/&gt; The pilot quickly buried the helicopter's nose to keep it from tipping over.&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside.&lt;ref name="graphic"/&gt; The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt;

====Entry into the House====
[[File:Obama and Biden await updates on bin Laden.jpg|thumb|The U.S. national security team gathered in the [[White House Situation Room]] to monitor the progress of Operation Neptune Spear (see also [[Situation Room (photograph)|''Situation Room'']])]]

The SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family. The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There were reportedly "small knots of children&amp;nbsp;... on every level, including the balcony of bin Laden's room".&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt;

Osama bin Laden was killed in the raid&lt;ref&gt;Gal Perl Finkel, [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=14263 Back to the ground?], [[Israel Hayom]], November 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and initial versions said three other men and a woman were killed as well: bin Laden's adult son Khalid,&lt;ref name="paknews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytonesided"/&gt; bin Laden's courier [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]], al-Kuwaiti's brother Abrar, and Abrar's wife Bushra.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

Conflicting reports of an initial firefight exist.  Owen's states that the team were in a "short firefight" before reaching bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/navy-seal-shot-osama-bin-laden-sight/story?id=17200191&lt;/ref&gt;
An intelligence official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no firefight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti is said to have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed.&lt;ref name="deadlyraid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt; His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder.&lt;ref name="newamerica1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen |first=Peter |url=http://newamerica.net/publications/articles/2012/the_last_days_of_osama_bin_laden_66847 |title=The Last Days of Osama bin Laden |publisher=NewAmerica.net |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/03/opinion/bergen-bin-laden-lair/index.html |title=A visit to Osama bin Laden's lair |publisher=CNN.com |date=May 3, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team on the first floor of the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDWcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19|title=Killing bin Laden: A Moral Analysis|first=B.|last=Strawser|date=October 2, 2014|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son is said to have encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team.&lt;ref name="deadlyraid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytonesided"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt; An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]], was armed.&lt;ref name="APsource"/&gt; The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Bowden144"/&gt; The SEALs wore night vision goggles.

====Killing of bin Laden====
The SEALs encountered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building.&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="montrealtechnology"/&gt; Bin Laden was "wearing the local loose-fitting tunic and pants known as a ''[[kurta]] paijama''", which were later found to have [[500 euro note|€500]] and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric.&lt;ref name="behindthehunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ST6return"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;

Bin Laden peered through his bedroom door at the Americans advancing up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot or shots at him.  Reports differ, though agree eventually he was hit by shots to the body and head.  The initial shots either missed, hit him in the side, or hit him in the head.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/zero-dark-thirty-osama-bin-laden-seals/ see account #4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert O'Neill (Navy SEAL)|Robert O’Neill]], who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden,&lt;ref name="wp 20141106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday 20141106"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/08/navy-seals-bin-laden-shooter/18659109/ |title=Navy SEALs 'frustrated' by bin Laden raid disclosures |work=USA Today |date=November 8, 2014 |accessdate=November 8, 2014 |author=Michaels, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour M.

O'Neill states that bin Laden was standing behind a woman with his hands on her shoulders, pushing her forward. O'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Warrick, Joby, "[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ex-seal-reveals-himself-as-osama-bin-laden-shooter/ar-BBdlw9l Ex-SEAL reveals himself as Osama bin Laden shooter]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[No Easy Day|Matt Bissonnette]], who entered the room at about the same time, also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body.&lt;ref&gt;Kulish, Nicholas, Christopher Drew, and Sean D.

The lead SEAL shot her in the leg, then grabbed both women and shoved them aside. The weapon used to kill bin Laden was an [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416|HK416]] using [[5.56mm NATO]] 77-grain OTM (open-tip [[Match grade|match]]) rounds made by [[Black Hills Ammunition]].&lt;ref name="Bowden144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfarrer|first=Chuck|title=SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden|year=2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-00635-6|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEAL team leader radioed, "For God and country—Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo" and then, after being prompted by McRaven for confirmation, "Geronimo EKIA" (enemy killed in action).

As the SEALs encountered women and children during the raid, they restrained them with [[plastic handcuffs]] or [[zip tie]]s.&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt; After the raid was over, U.S. forces moved the surviving residents outside&lt;ref name="stormedroom"/&gt; "for Pakistani forces to discover".&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt; The injured Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah continued to harangue the raiders in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; Bin Laden's 12-year-old daughter Safia was allegedly struck in her foot or ankle by a piece of flying debris.&lt;ref name="deadlyraid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianBooth"&gt;{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |title=Osama bin Laden death: How family scene in compound turned to carnage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/05/bin-laden-death-family-compound |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_Intel_Failure"/&gt;

While bin Laden's body was taken by U.S. forces, the bodies of the four others killed in the raid were left behind at the compound and later taken into Pakistani custody.&lt;ref name="nytpakinvest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-108"/&gt;

====Conclusion====
[[File:US Navy 110404-N-6505H-511 An E-2C Hawkeye approaches USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Carl Vinson}} conducting flight operations in the Persian Gulf (April 4, 2011)]]
The raid was intended to take 40 minutes. The time between the team's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt; According to the Associated Press, the assault was completed in the first 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt;

Time in the compound was spent killing defenders,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; "moving carefully through the compound, room to room, floor to floor" securing the women and children, clearing "weapons stashes and barricades"&lt;ref name="nbcpentagon"/&gt; including a false door,&lt;ref name="abcnbarricades"/&gt; and searching the compound for information.&lt;ref name="realname"/&gt; U.S. personnel recovered three [[Kalashnikov rifle]]s and two pistols, ten computer hard drives, documents, DVDs, almost a hundred [[USB flash drive|thumb drives]], a dozen cell phones, and "electronic equipment" for later analysis.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APGoldman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hayes |first=Stephen F. |date=September 15, 2014 |title=Al Qaeda Wasn't 'on the Run' |url=http://m.weeklystandard.com/articles/al-qaeda-wasn-t-run_804366.html |magazine=The Weekly Standard |volume=15 |issue=1 |accessdate=October 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019013528/http://m.weeklystandard.com/articles/al-qaeda-wasn-t-run_804366.html |archivedate=October 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEALs also discovered a large amount of [[opium]] stored in the house.&lt;ref name="esquire.com"&gt;Bronstein, Phil, "[http://www.esquire.com/features/man-who-shot-osama-bin-laden-0313 The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden&amp;nbsp;...

Since the helicopter that had made the emergency landing was damaged and unable to fly the team out, it was destroyed to safeguard its classified equipment, including an apparent [[Stealth technology|stealth]] capability.&lt;ref name="dangerroomstealth"/&gt; The pilot smashed "the instrument panel, the radio, and the other classified fixtures inside the cockpit", and the SEALs "[packed] the helicopter with explosives and [blew] it up". Since the SEAL team was reduced to one operational helicopter, one of the two Chinooks held in reserve was dispatched to carry part of the team and bin Laden's body out of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Dedman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="behindthehunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-110"/&gt;

While the official Department of Defense narrative did not mention the airbases used in the operation,&lt;ref name="DODCNN"/&gt; later accounts indicated that the helicopters returned to [[Bagram Airfield]].&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; The body of Osama bin Laden was flown from Bagram to the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Carl Vinson}} in a [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Osprey]] tiltrotor aircraft escorted by two U.S. Navy [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18]] fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Gertz|Gertz, Bill]], "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/11/inside-the-ring-320207052/?page=4 Inside the Ring: Osama's Escorts]", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', May 12, 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony, "V-22 Osprey Flew Osama Bin Laden To Navy Ship After Death", [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]], June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burial of Bin Laden ====
According to U.S. officials, bin Laden was buried at sea because no country would accept his remains.&lt;ref name="remains"/&gt; Before disposing of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi Arabian government, who approved of burying the body in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; [[Islamic funeral|Muslim religious rites]] were performed aboard ''Carl Vinson'' in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11&amp;nbsp;am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward on one side and the body slid off into the sea.&lt;ref name="navyburial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret details of Bin Laden burial revealed|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/11/2012112243823204328.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=November 22, 2012|date=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace'',&lt;ref name="worthfights"/&gt; [[Leon Panetta]] wrote that bin Laden's body was draped in a white shroud, given final prayers in Arabic and placed inside a black bag loaded with {{convert|300|lbs}} of iron chains, apparently to ensure that it would sink and never float. The body bag was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship, and the table was tipped to let the body bag slide into the sea, but the body bag did not slide and took the table with it. The table bobbed on the surface while the weighted body sank.&lt;ref name="worthfights"/&gt;

====Pakistan–U.S. communication====
According to Obama administration officials, U.S. officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over.&lt;ref name="ref-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn20110502"/&gt; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Michael Mullen]] called Pakistan's army chief [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] at about 3&amp;nbsp;am local time to inform him of the operation.&lt;ref name="nyt20110505"/&gt;

According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the operation was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces.&lt;ref name="ref-32"/&gt; Pakistan [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) officials said they were present at what they called a joint operation;&lt;ref name="LAT20110502"/&gt; President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] flatly denied this.&lt;ref name="ref-111"/&gt; Pakistan's foreign secretary [[Salman Bashir]] later confirmed that Pakistani military had [[scrambling (military)|scrambled]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after the U.S. helicopters had left.&lt;ref name="wsj20110505"/&gt;

====Identification of the body====
U.S. forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden:
* Measurement of the body: Both the corpse and bin Laden were {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|abbr=on}}; SEALs on the scene did not have a [[tape measure]] to measure the corpse, so a SEAL of known height laid down next to the body and the height was so approximated by comparison.&lt;ref name="ST6return"/&gt; Obama quipped: "We donated a $60 million helicopter to this operation. Could we not afford to buy a tape measure?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20060734-503543.html |title=Navy SEALs forgot to bring a tape measure&amp;nbsp;– World Watch |publisher=CBS News |date=May 7, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facial recognition software: A photograph transmitted by the SEALs to CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]], for [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] analysis yielded a 90 to 95 percent likely match.&lt;ref name="ref-94"/&gt;
* In-person identification: One or two women from the compound, including one of bin Laden's wives,&lt;ref name="ref-47"/&gt; identified bin Laden's body.&lt;ref name="ref-94"/&gt; A wife of bin Laden called him by name during the raid, inadvertently assisting in his identification by U.S. military forces on the ground.&lt;ref name="ref-114"/&gt;
* DNA testing: The [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that bin Laden's body could be identified by [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]]&lt;ref name="ref-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-13"/&gt; using tissue and blood samples taken from his sister who had died of brain cancer.&lt;ref name="ref-14"/&gt; ABC News stated, "Two samples were taken from bin Laden: one of these DNA samples was analyzed, and information was sent electronically back to Washington, D.C., from Bagram. Someone else from Afghanistan is physically bringing back a sample."&lt;ref name="ref-94"/&gt; A military medic took [[bone marrow]] and swabs from the body to use for the DNA testing.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; According to a senior U.S. Department of Defense official:

{{quote|DNA ([[deoxyribonucleic acid]]) analysis conducted separately by Department of Defense and CIA labs has positively identified Osama bin Laden. DNA samples collected from his body were compared to a comprehensive DNA profile derived from bin Laden's large extended family. Based on that analysis, the DNA is unquestionably his. The probability of a mistaken identity on the basis of this analysis is approximately one in 11.8&amp;nbsp;[[Names of large numbers|quadrillion]].&lt;ref name="globalDOD"/&gt;}}

* Inference: Per the same DoD official, from the initial review of the materials removed from the Abbottabad compound the Department "assessed that much of this information, including personal correspondence between Osama bin Laden and others, as well as some of the video footage&amp;nbsp;... would only have been in his possession."&lt;ref name="globalDOD"/&gt;

===Local accounts===
Beginning at 12:58&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad resident Sohaib Athar sent a series of [[Twitter|tweets]] starting with "Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event)." By 1:44&amp;nbsp;a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="livetwitter"/&gt; Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as U.S. special operations forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, "I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste [[Pashto language|Pashto]] to turn off the lights and stay inside."&lt;ref name="deceit"/&gt; Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed. The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field.&lt;ref name="spooked"/&gt; A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army. "There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured", he said. "There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound." Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service,&lt;ref name="chopper"/&gt; went out around the time of the raid and apparently included the military academy.&lt;ref name="placeinhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="livingnextdoor"/&gt; Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout. One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine [[rolling blackout]].&lt;ref name="osamaoperation"/&gt;

ISI reported after questioning survivors of the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound at the time of the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by U.S. forces and dragged to a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42892575/ns/world_news-death_of_bin_laden/ "Differing accounts emerge of bin Laden raid"]. msnbc.com.

''[[Daily Mail]]''. UK. May 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shotdead"/&gt;

===Compound residents===
U.S. officials said there were 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name="secretteam"/&gt; Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors.&lt;ref name="nytchildren"/&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents.&lt;ref name="pocketguide"/&gt; The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound.&lt;ref name="binladenmole"/&gt; Because of a lack of accurate information, some of what follows cannot be verified as true.&lt;ref name="nytchildren"/&gt;
* 5 adults dead: [[Osama bin Laden]], 54;&lt;ref name="abuhamza"/&gt; [[Bin Laden family#Osama bin Laden's children|Khalid]], his son by Siham (identified as [[Hamza bin Laden|Hamza]] in early accounts), 23;&lt;ref name="nytchildren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binladenmole"/&gt; Arshad Khan, a.k.a.

* 4 children of Arshad Khan: Two sons, Abdur Rahman and Khalid, 6 or 7; a daughter, age unknown; and another child, age unknown.&lt;ref name="goodneighbours"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plainsight"/&gt;

===Leaks of the news===
At around 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening.&lt;ref name="leakedout"/&gt; At 10:24:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/keithurbahn/status/64877790624886784|title=So I'm told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden.

===U.S. presidential address===
[[File:President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden.ogv|thumb|[[Barack Obama|President Obama's]] address (9:28)&lt;br /&gt;
''Also available:'' [[:File:050111 Osama Bin Laden Death Statement audioonly.ogg|Audio only]]; {{Cws |title=Full text |link=Remarks by the President on Osama bin Laden |nobullet=yes}}]]
At 11:35&amp;nbsp;p.m., Obama appeared on major television networks:&lt;ref name="leakedout"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Good evening. Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who was responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children&amp;nbsp;... {{Cws |title=''(cont'd)'' |link=Remarks by the President on Osama bin Laden |nobullet=yes}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

President Obama recalled the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]. He praised the nearly ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the [[Taliban]] government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. "To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror," he said, "justice has been done." This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that "justice will be done." &lt;!--Source is the video.--&gt;

[[File:Times Square on the night Osama bin Laden killed.jpg|thumb|Woman in [[Times Square]] celebrating bin Laden's death]]

Before the official announcement, large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[The Pentagon]] and in New York's [[Times Square]] to celebrate. In [[Dearborn, Michigan]], where there is a large Muslim and Arab population, a small crowd gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them being of Middle Eastern descent.&lt;ref name="ref-56"/&gt; From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 5,000 tweets per second were posted on Twitter.&lt;ref name="ref-57"/&gt; As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a  [[Sunday Night Baseball|nationally televised]] [[Major League Baseball]] game in [[Philadelphia]] between [[Mets–Phillies rivalry|rivals]] [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[New York Mets]], [[U-S-A! cheer|"U-S-A!" cheers]] began.&lt;ref name="ref-58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Video-Phillies-fans-chant-8216-U-S-A-8217-?urn=mlb-wp5081 |title=Video: Phillies fans chant 'U-S-A!' after Osama bin Laden news |last1=Kaduk |first1=Kevin |date=May 2, 2011 |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tampa, Florida]], at the conclusion of a professional wrestling event which was occurring at the time, [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[John Cena]] announced to the audience that bin Laden had been "caught and compromised to a permanent end", prompting chants while he exited the arena to the march "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrestler's bizarre declaration of Osama bin Laden's death |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8490123/Wrestlers-bizarre-declaration-of-Osama-bin-Ladens-death.html |location=London |date=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy leader of Egypt's [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said that, with bin Laden dead, Western forces should now pull out of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]; authorities in Iran made similar comments.&lt;ref name="ref-59"/&gt; [[Palestinian Authority]] leaders had contrasting reactions. [[Mahmoud Abbas]] welcomed bin Laden's death, while [[Ismail Haniyeh]], the head of the [[Hamas]] administration in the [[Gaza Strip]], condemned what he saw as the assassination of an "Arab holy warrior".&lt;ref name="ref-60"/&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] was quoted by the ''Los Angeles Times'' as saying, "Forgiveness doesn't mean forget what happened.&amp;nbsp;... If something is serious and it is necessary to take counter-measures, you have to take counter-measures." This was widely reported as an endorsement of bin Laden's killing and was criticized in Buddhist circles, but another journalist cited a video of the discussion to argue that the comment was taken out of context and the Dalai Lama only supports killing in self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/ME13Ad04.html |first=Peter |last=Lee |title=Osama and the real Dalai Lama |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBS/''The New York Times'' poll taken after bin Laden's death showed that 16% of Americans feel safer as the result of his death while 60% of Americans of those polled believe killing bin Laden would likely increase the threat of terrorism against the U.S. in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/bin-ladens-killing-helps-presidents-poll-numbers/ |title=Bin Laden's Killing Helps President's Poll Numbers |work=The New York Times |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[P. Chidambaram]] said that bin Laden hiding "deep inside" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India and showed that "many of the perpetrators of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai terror attacks]], including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan". He also called on Pakistan to arrest them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Uses Osama Death to Pressure Pakistan|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704569404576298211101277924|date=May 2, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|last=Wright|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; amidst calls for similar strikes being conducted by India against [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed|Hafiz Saeed]] and [[Dawood Ibrahim]].&lt;ref name="indiahunt"/&gt;

===Freedom of Information Act requests and denials===
Although the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials, no physical evidence constituting "proof of death" has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref name="FOIA1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/associated-press-case-releasing-bin-laden-photo/37510/|title=The Associated Press's Case for Releasing the Bin Laden Photo|first=John |last=Hudson|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including [[The Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[CBS News]], [[Judicial Watch]], [[Politico]], [[Fox News]], [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]], and [[NPR]].&lt;ref name="FOIA2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/look-whos-foiaing-bin-laden-death-photo/37493/|title=A Look at Who's FOIAing the Bin Laden Death Photo|first=John |last=Hudson |publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2012, Judge [[James E.

According to a draft report by the Pentagon's inspector general, Admiral William McRaven, the top special operations commander, ordered the Department of Defense to purge from its computer systems all files on the bin Laden raid after first sending them to the CIA.&lt;ref name="lardner-2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lardner|first=Richard|title=Bin Laden Raid Records Shielded From Public In Secret Move|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bin-laden-raid-records-shielded-from-public-in-secret-move.php?ref=fpb|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130717081757/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bin-laden-raid-records-shielded-from-public-in-secret-move.php?ref=fpb|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 17, 2013|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 15, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harper-2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Lauren|title="The Shell Game" and the Osama bin Laden Documents|url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/the-shell-game-and-the-osama-bin-laden-documents/|work=Unredacted: The National Security Archive, Unedited and Uncensored|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=July 15, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ig-draft-2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Release of Department of Defense Information to the Media — Draft Report|url=http://pogoarchives.org/m/ns/pogo_document_2013_ig.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|author=Inspector General of the United States Department of Defense|year=2013|quote=This effort included purging the combatant command's system of all records related to the operation and providing these records to another Government Agency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lardner|first=Richard|title=Secret Move Keeps Bin Laden Records in the Shadows|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/secret-move-keeps-bin-laden-records-shadows|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any mention of this decision was expunged from the final version of the inspector general's report.&lt;ref name="harper-2013"/&gt; According to the Pentagon, this was done to protect the identities of the Navy SEALs involved in the raid.&lt;ref name="harper-2013"/&gt; The legal justification for the records transfer is that the SEALs were effectively working for the CIA at the time of the raid, which ostensibly means that any records of the raid belong to the CIA.&lt;ref name="lardner-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harper-2013"/&gt; "Documents related to the raid were handled in a manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under the direction of the CIA director", CIA agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an emailed statement.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What the transfer really did was ensure that the files would be placed in the CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 [[CIA Operational Files exemption]]—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the public from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.&lt;ref name="harper-2013"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States Defense Department can prevent the release of its own military files citing risks to national security, but that can be contested in court, and a judge can compel the Pentagon to turn over non-sensitive portions of records. The CIA has special authority to prevent the release of "operational files" in ways that cannot be challenged in federal court.&lt;ref name="APHP20130708"/&gt; Richard Lardner, reporting for the Associated Press, wrote that the maneuver "could represent a new strategy for the U.S. government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public scrutiny."&lt;ref name="larder-2013"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Pentagon DELETES files about Osama bin Laden raid after transferring them to CIA where they can't be made public|date=July 8, 2013|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2358256/Osama-Bin-Laden-files-deleted-Pentagon-transferred-CIA.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=September 5, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspector general's draft report also described how former Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] disclosed classified information to the makers of ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', including the unit that conducted the raid and the ground commander's name.&lt;ref name="pogo-2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unreleased: Probe Finds CIA Honcho Disclosed Top Secret Info to Hollywood|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/articles/2013/unreleased-probe-finds-cia-disclosed-secret-info.html|publisher=Project on Government Oversight|first1=Adam |last1=Zagorin|first2=David S. |last2=Hilzenrath|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legality===

====Under U.S. law====
Following the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], which authorized the [[President of the U.S.|President]] to use "necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons" he determines were involved in the attacks.&lt;ref name="WSJlegal"/&gt; The [[Obama administration]] justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as [[international law]] set forth in treaties and customary [[laws of war]].&lt;ref name="ABC_13538365"/&gt;
[[File:Osama Bin Laden marked deceased on FBI Ten Most Wanted List May 3 2011.jpg|thumb|Website of the Federal Bureau of Investigation listing bin Laden as deceased on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Most Wanted List]] on May 3, 2011]]

[[John Bellinger III]], who served as the [[U.S. State Department]]'s senior lawyer during [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]]'s second term, said the strike was a legitimate military action and did not run counter to the U.S.' self-imposed prohibition on assassinations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The killing is not prohibited by the long-standing assassination prohibition in [[Executive Order 12333|executive order 12333]] [signed in 1981], because the action was a military action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al-Qaeda, and it is not prohibited to kill specific leaders of an opposing force. The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.&lt;ref name="killingslegality"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Harold Hongju Koh]], [[Legal Adviser of the Department of State|Legal Adviser of the U.S. State Department]], said in 2010 that "under domestic law, the use of lawful weapons systems—consistent with the applicable laws of war—for precision [[targeted killing|targeting]] of specific high-level belligerent leaders when acting in self-defense or during an armed conflict is not unlawful, and hence does not constitute 'assassination'."&lt;ref name="killingslegality"/&gt;

[[David Scheffer]], director of the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor. "Normally when an individual is under indictment the purpose is to capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him&amp;nbsp;... The object is not to literally [[summary execution|summarily execute]] him if he's under indictment."&lt;ref name="reuters-legality"/&gt; Scheffer and another expert stated that it was important to determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him. If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden without trying first to capture him, it "may have violated American ideals if not international law."&lt;ref name="reuters-legality"/&gt;

In an address to the [[Pakistani parliament]], Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] said, "Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S. air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad.&amp;nbsp;... The Security Council, while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism, has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with [[international law]], human rights and [[humanitarian law]]."&lt;ref name="pmspeech"/&gt; Former Pakistani President Gen. [[Pervez Musharraf]] denied a report in ''The Guardian'' that his government made a secret agreement permitting U.S. forces to conduct unilateral raids in search of the top three al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name="secretagreement"/&gt;

In testimony before the U.S. [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] said, "The operation against bin Laden was justified as an act of national self-defense. It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field." He called the killing of bin Laden "a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001."&lt;ref name="holdersenate"/&gt; Commenting on the legality under international law, [[University of Michigan]] Law Professor Steven Ratner said, "A lot of it depends on whether you believe Osama bin Laden is a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder." In the latter case, "you would only be able to kill a suspect if they represented an immediate threat".&lt;ref name="reuters-legality"/&gt;

Holder testified that bin Laden made no attempt to surrender, and "even if he had there would be a good basis on the part of those very brave Navy SEAL team members to do what they did in order to protect themselves and the other people who were in that building."&lt;ref name="holdersenate"/&gt; According to Anthony Dworkin, an international law expert at the [[European Council on Foreign Relations]], if bin Laden was ''[[hors de combat]]'' (as his daughter is said to have alleged)&lt;ref name="shotdead"/&gt; that would have been a violation of [[Protocol I]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name="expertsdivided"/&gt;

Former Nuremberg prosecutor [[Benjamin B. Ferencz]] stated it was unclear if bin Laden's killing was justified self-defense or [[Targeted killing|premeditated illegal assassination]],&lt;ref name="ferencz_g"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|last2=Walsh|first2=Declan|last3=Borger|first3=Julian|title=US confirms it will not release Osama bin Laden death photo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-photos-raid|accessdate=August 10, 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "killing a captive who poses no immediate threat is a crime under military law as well as all other law,"&lt;ref name="ferencz_b"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Aidan|title=Osama Bin Laden: Legality of killing questioned|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13318372|accessdate=August 10, 2016|publisher=BBC|date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view also held by legal scholar [[Philippe Sands]].&lt;ref name="ferencz_g"/&gt;

The UN Security Council released a statement applauding the news of bin Laden's death, and [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] said he was "very much relieved."&lt;ref name="bankimoon"/&gt; Two [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s issued a joint statement seeking more information regarding the circumstances in which bin Laden was killed and cautioning that "actions taken by States in combating terrorism, especially in high profile cases, set precedents for the way in which the right to life will be treated in future instances."&lt;ref name="twoexperts"/&gt;

===Handling of the body===
Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision.&lt;ref name="ref-47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-117"/&gt; [[Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb]], the head of [[Al-Azhar University]], Egypt's seat of [[Sunni]] Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values.&lt;ref name="ref-118"/&gt; Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam's holy city of [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="ref-41"/&gt;

A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or "terrorist shrine".&lt;ref name="ref-41"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' questioned whether bin Laden's grave would have become a shrine, as this is strongly discouraged in [[Wahhabism]]. Addressing the same concern, Egyptian Islamic analyst and lawyer [[Montasser el-Zayat]] said that if the Americans wished to avoid making a shrine to bin Laden, an unmarked grave on land would have accomplished the same goal.&lt;ref name="ref-46"/&gt;

''The Guardian'' also quoted a U.S. official explaining the anticipated difficulty of finding a country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil.&lt;ref name="guardian01"/&gt; A professor of [[Islamic Law]] at the [[University of Jordan]] stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Islamic scholars criticize bin Laden's sea burial |first=Hamza |last=Hendawi |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/may/02/islamic-scholars-criticize-bin-ladens-sea-burial/ |newspaper=[[San Diego Union Tribune]] |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body".&lt;ref name="ref-46"/&gt; On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand [[mufti]], stated: "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This is not one of them."&lt;ref name="ref-46"/&gt; Khalid Latif, an [[imam]] who serves as a chaplain and the director of the Islamic Center of [[New York University]], argued that the sea burial was respectful.&lt;ref name="ref-120"/&gt;

Leor Halevi, a professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] and the author of ''Muhammad's Grave: Death Rites and the Making of Islamic Society'', explained that Islamic law does not prescribe ordinary funerals for those killed in battle, and pointed to controversy within the Muslim world over whether bin Laden was, as a "mass murderer of Muslims", entitled to the same respect as mainstream Muslims. At the same time, he suggested that the burial could have been handled with more cultural sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/opinion/08halevi.html |work=The New York Times |first=Leor |last=Halevi |title=Watery Grave, Murky Law |date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omar bin Laden]], son of Osama bin Laden, published a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the burial at sea deprived the family of a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/world/asia/binladen-statement.html "Statement From the Family of Osama bin Laden"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bin Laden's will===
After bin Laden's death, it was reported he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|title=Bin Laden's will says his children must not join al-Qaida|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/03/bin-laden-will-wives-children|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 3, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he urged his children not to join al-Qaeda and not to continue the Jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flock|first=Elizabeth|title=Osama bin Laden tells his children not to fight jihad in his will|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/osama-bin-laden-tells-children-not-to-fight-jihad-in-his-will/2011/05/04/AFDP4UmF_blog.html|accessdate=October 12, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of photographs===
CNN cited a senior U.S. official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an [[aircraft hangar]] in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS ''Carl Vinson'' before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid.&lt;ref name="cnnpictures"/&gt;

A source told ABC News that the photos taken by the military servicemen on the scene depict the physical damage done by a high-[[caliber]] bullet.&lt;ref name="ST6return"/&gt; ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' reported that the photo shows that the bullet which hit above bin Laden's left eye blew out his left eyeball and blew away a large portion of his frontal skull, exposing his brain.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBS Evening News]], May 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN stated that the pictures from the Afghanistan hangar depict "a massive open head wound across both eyes. It's very bloody and gory."&lt;ref name="cnnpictures"/&gt; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Jim Inhofe]], who viewed the photos, stated that the photos taken of the body on the ''Carl Vinson'', which showed bin Laden's face after much of the blood and material had been washed away, should be released to the public.&lt;ref name="photographicproof"/&gt;

A debate on whether the military photos should be released to the public took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/05/to-release-or-not-to-release-bin-laden-death-photos-spark-debate/1 |title=White House: Releasing 'gruesome' bin Laden photo could be 'inflammatory' |work=USA Today |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |first=Michael |last=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered [[public records]],&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Drum, [http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/05/public-records-should-bepublic "Public Records Should be.....Public"]" (May 4, 2011).

Obama decided not to release the photos.&lt;ref name="abcnophotos"/&gt; In an interview aired on May 4 on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', he said: "We don't trot out this stuff as trophies. We don't need to [[Spike (gridiron football)#Spiking after scoring|spike the football]]." Obama said that he was concerned with ensuring that "very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, or as a propaganda tool. That's not who we are."&lt;ref name="kroft"/&gt; Among Republican members of Congress, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] criticized the decision and stated that he wanted to see the photos released, while Senator [[John McCain]] and Representative [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], the chair of the [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], supported the decision.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosen and Steven Thomma, "[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24629344.html S.C.

On May 11, selected members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] (the congressional leadership and those who serve on the House and Senate intelligence, homeland security, judiciary, foreign relations, and armed forces committees) were shown 15 bin Laden photos. In an interview with [[Eliot Spitzer]], Senator Jim Inhofe said that three of the photos were of bin Laden alive for identification reference. Three other photos were of the burial-at-sea ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/11/congress.bin.laden.photos/index.html Members of Congress see bin Laden photos] (May 11, 2011), CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Seal Target Geronimo''====
&lt;!-- QUESTION/COMMENT: Please expand on the Razor 1/Razor 2 terminology used in this section, as it is not referenced or explained elsewhere in the article. --&gt;
A book published in November 2011, ''Seal Target Geronimo'', by [[Chuck Pfarrer]], a former SEAL, contradicted the account as given by U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed at the beginning of the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.&lt;ref name="nypost18"&gt;[[Susannah Cahalan]], "[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/real_story_of_team_charge_IHMzMvBw4Q7l6reGL20etJ Real Story Of Team 6's Charge]", ''[[New York Post]]'', November 6, 2011, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfarrer&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfarrer|first=Chuck|title=SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden|year=2011|publisher=St.Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-00635-6|pages=190–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two SEALs broke through the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was on the edge of the bed shouting in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an [[AKS-74U]] kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.&lt;ref name="nypost18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfarrer"/&gt;

Around the same time, snipers in the hovering Razor 2 helicopter shot and killed Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti when he came to the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.&lt;ref name="nypost18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfarrer"/&gt;

Twenty minutes into the operation, Razor 1 took off from the roof of the main house to reposition to a landing spot outside the compound. As Razor 1 was crossing over the courtyard, both "green unit" flight deck control systems went off line. The helicopter settled slowly, bounced off the ground, and then broke apart as it hit the ground a second time. Both failed green units were removed for later examination.&lt;ref name="nypost18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfarrer"/&gt;

Media accounts had reported that the plan had been to [[fast rope]] to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls and then into the house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation.&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt; Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.&lt;ref name="Pfarrer"/&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of Defense|Pentagon]] disputed Pfarrer's account of the raid, calling it "incorrect".&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stripes.com/blogs/stripes-central/stripes-central-1.8040/pentagon-says-new-bin-laden-raid-book-gets-details-wrong-1.160041 |title=Pentagon says new bin Laden raid book gets details wrong |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |last=Carroll |first=Chris |date=November 7, 2011 |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Special Operations Command]] also disputed Pfarrer's account, saying, "It's just not true.

====''No Easy Day''====
{{Main|No Easy Day}}
Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL who participated in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book ''[[No Easy Day]]'' (2012), which significantly contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right side of the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot several rounds into bin Laden's chest until he was motionless. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a [[Makarov pistol]]—were unloaded.&lt;ref name=Owen_book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=Mark|title=No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden|date=September 4, 2012|publisher=Dutton Penguin|isbn=978-0-525-95372-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7f1-MAEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hillhouse and Hersh reports====
{{Main|Seymour Hersh#Death of Osama bin Laden}}
In 2011 American intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse wrote that according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis.&lt;ref name="crilly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crilly|first1=Rob|title=Osama bin Laden was 'protected by Pakistan in return for Saudi cash', analyst claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8693547/Osama-bin-Laden-was-protected-by-Pakistan-in-return-for-Saudi-cash-analyst-claims.html|accessdate=July 20, 2016|agency=The Telegraph|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Telegraph'', Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid.&lt;ref name=crilly/&gt;

Hillhouse later also stated that bin Laden's body had been thrown-out of a helicopter over the [[Hindu Kush]]. Hillhouse's account was picked-up and published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the ''[[National Post]]'', ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', ''[[The Calgary Herald]]'', the ''[[Windsor Star]]'', ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' and the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwarz|first1=Jon|title=Sy Hersh's bin Laden Story First Reported in 2011 — With Seemingly Different Sources|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/05/11/former-professor-reported-basics-hershs-bin-laden-story-2011-seemingly-different-sources/|accessdate=October 10, 2015|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a detailed article in the [[London Review of Books]] by journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] said that the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief [[Pervez Kayani]] and ISI director [[Ahmad Shuja Pasha]] aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden.&lt;ref name=hersh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Seymour|title=The Killing of Osama bin Laden|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden|accessdate=May 11, 2015|agency=The London Review of Books|publisher=The London Review of Books|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Osama Bin Laden was an unarmed elderly 'invalid' when Navy Seals killed him and Barack Obama lied about the mission, report claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/osama-bin-laden-was-an-unarmed-elderly-invalid-when-navy-seals-killed-him-and-barack-obama-lied-about-the-mission-report-claims-10241635.html|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=The Independent|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hersh, Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining. Pakistani officials were aware of the raid, and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out. According to Hersh, bin Laden was basically an invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour M.]], "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden The Killing of Osama bin Laden]", ''[[London Review of Books]]'', May 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier.&lt;ref name=hersh/&gt;&lt;ref name=intercepthersh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwarz|first1=Jon|last2=Devereaux|first2=Ryan|title=CLAIM: SY HERSH’S BIN LADEN STORY IS TRUE — BUT OLD NEWS|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/11/former-professor-reported-basics-hershs-bin-laden-story-2011-seemingly-different-sources/|accessdate=May 12, 2015|agency=The Intercept|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC News and [[Agence France-Presse]] subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden.&lt;ref name=NBChersh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Matthew|last2=Esposito|first2=Richard|last3=Windrem|first3=Robert|last4=Mitchell|first4=Andrea|title=Pakistanis Knew Where Osama Bin Laden Was, U.S. Sources Say|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistanis-knew-where-bin-laden-was-say-us-sources-n357306|accessdate=May 12, 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afpbinladen&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan military officials admit defector's key role in Bin Laden operation|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1181530/pakistan-military-officials-admit-defectors-key-role-in-bin-laden-operation|accessdate=May 18, 2015|agency=Agence France Presse|work=Dawn|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the ''[[News International]]'' reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/11616775/Was-Osama-bin-Laden-brought-down-by-a-London-pensioner.html|author=Colin Freeman|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=June 14, 2015|title=Was Osama bin Laden brought down by a London pensioner?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House denied Hersh's report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White House dismisses new Osama bin Laden raid claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11597928/White-House-dismisses-new-Osama-bin-Laden-raid-claims.html|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=Telegraph|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Utter nonsense': CIA and White House blast Seymour Hersh's explosive Osama bin Laden raid story |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/05/11/utter-nonsense-cia-and-white-house-blast-explosive-osama-bin-laden-raid-story/|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=Washington Post|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar in claims, both Hillhouse and Hersh's accounts of the bin Laden death appeared to be based on different sources which ''[[The Intercept]]'' concluded might corroborate the claims if their identities were known. After the Hersh story broke, [[NBC News]] also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report, and not the courier.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
{{Main|Osama bin Laden death conspiracy theories}}
The reports of bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally accepted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold |first=Matea |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-bin-laden-conspiracy-20110503,0,3052618.story |title=Osama bin Laden dead: Bin Laden's burial at sea fuels 'death hoax' rumor |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity,&lt;ref name="ref-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-13"/&gt; bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death,&lt;ref name="BBC_Intel_Failure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-us |location=London |work=The Guardian  |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Osama bin Laden killing prompts U.S.-Pakistan war of words |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death.&lt;ref name="revenge"/&gt; The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, the speed of the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Egan |first=Mark |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/us-binladen-conspiracies-idUSTRE7427LY20110503 |title=Bin Laden dead?

==Role of Pakistan==
{{See also|Allegations of support system in Pakistan for Osama bin Laden}}
Pakistan came under intense international scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009.&lt;ref name="scrutiny"/&gt;

[[Carlotta Gall]], in her 2014 book ''[[The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014]]'', accuses the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], Pakistan's clandestine intelligence service, of hiding and protecting [[Osama bin Laden]] and his family after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. She claims that she learned from a Pakistani official (with whom she later clarified that she did not speak, the information coming through a friend)&lt;ref name=Gall2015&gt;{{cite news |last=Gall |first=Carlotta |authorlink=Carlotta Gall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/magazine/the-detail-in-seymour-hershs-bin-laden-story-that-rings-true.html_r=1 |title=The Detail in Seymour Hersh’s Bin Laden Story That Rings True |date=May 12, 2015 |work=The New York Times Magazine |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) chief, [[Lieutenant general (Pakistan)|Lt.

After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the wreckage of the crashed helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rttnews.com/Content/Policy.aspx?Id=1694420 |title=Panetta: U.S. Concerned Over Pakistan's Relationships |publisher=Rttnews.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections with Abbottabad===
[[File:Abbottabad View.JPG|thumb|View of [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan (2011)]]

Abbottabad attracted refugees from fighting in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|tribal areas]] and [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat Valley]], as well as [[Afghanistan]]. "People don't really care now to ask who's there", said [[Gohar Ayub Khan]], a former foreign minister and resident of the city. "That's one of the reasons why, possibly, he came in there."&lt;ref name="failuretodiscover"/&gt;

The city was home to at least one al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi reportedly moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003.&lt;ref name="Abbottabad2003"/&gt; Pakistan [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him.&lt;ref name="AbbottabadScrutiny"/&gt; This account was contradicted by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field.&lt;ref name="Reuters20110505"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/05/us-binladen-pakistan-isi-idUSTRE74408220110505|title=Special report: Why the U.S. mistrusts Pakistan's spies|last=Allbritton|first=Chris|last2=Hosenball|first2=Mark|date=May 5, 2011|agency=Reuters |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts at the time that the city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name="mistrust"/&gt; In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without knowing who lived there.&lt;ref name="AbbottabadScrutiny"/&gt;

On January 25, 2011,&lt;ref name="Frenchmen"/&gt; ISI arrested [[Umar Patek]], an Indonesian wanted in connection with the [[2002 Bali bombings|2002 Bali nightclub bombings]], while he was staying with a family in Abbottabad. Tahir Shehzad, a clerk at the post office, was arrested on suspicion of facilitating travel for al-Qaeda militants.&lt;ref name="Abbottabad2003"/&gt;

===Allegations against Pakistan===
Numerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden.&lt;ref name="LAT20110502" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj20110503" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-62" /&gt; Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].&lt;ref name="ref-62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-61" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref-63" /&gt; U.S. government files, leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight [[NATO]] troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the [[government of Tajikistan]] had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.&lt;ref name="DT20110502" /&gt;

CIA chief [[Leon Panetta]] said the CIA had ruled out involving Pakistan in the operation, because it feared that "any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission. They might alert the targets."&lt;ref name="time20110503" /&gt; Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] stated that "cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding".&lt;ref name="ref-86" /&gt; Obama echoed her sentiments.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; [[John O. Brennan]], Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan. He said: "People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight. We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long."&lt;ref name="Guard20110502" /&gt;

The [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Indian Minister for Home Affairs]], [[P. Chidambaram]], said that bin Laden hiding "deep inside" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India, and showed that "many of the perpetrators of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai terror attacks]], including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan". He called on Pakistan to arrest them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Uses Osama Death to Pressure Pakistan|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704569404576298211101277924|date=May 2, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Tom|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani-born British [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Khalid Mahmood (politician, born 1961)|Khalid Mahmood]] stated that he was "flabbergasted and shocked" after he learned that bin Laden was living in a city with thousands of Pakistani troops, reviving questions about alleged links between al-Qaeda and elements in Pakistan's security forces.&lt;ref name="ind20110502" /&gt;

On August 7, 2011, [[Raelynn Hillhouse]], an American spy novelist and security analyst,  posted "The Spy Who Billed Me" on her national security blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/2011/08/bin-laden-turned-in-by-informant-courier-was-cover-story.html |title=Bin Laden Turned in by Informant&amp;nbsp;– Courier Was Cover Story |publisher=The Spy Who Billed Me |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that Pakistan's ISI had sheltered bin Laden in return for a $25&amp;nbsp;million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]]; ISI and government officials have denied her allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crilly|first=Rob|title=Osama bin Laden 'protected by Pakistan in return for Saudi cash'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8693111/Osama-bin-Laden-protected-by-Pakistan-in-return-for-Saudi-cash.html|accessdate=August 11, 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 10, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Pakistani Army Chief, General [[Ziauddin Butt]] has said that, according to his knowledge, Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the [[Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan]] (2004–2008), Brigadier [[Ijaz Shah]]. This had occurred with the "full knowledge" of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamal, Arif (December 22, 2011), [http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?cHash=b3da5dd4a1af2664ec4821b405dae77b&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38819 Former Pakistan Army Chief Reveals Intelligence Bureau Harbored Bin Laden in Abbottabad], Jamestown.org&lt;/ref&gt; Emails from the private American security firm, [[Stratfor]], published by WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, indicate that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's ISI knew of Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad safe house. Stratfor had been given access to the papers collected by American forces from bin Laden's Abbottabad house. The emails reveal that these Pakistani officers included "Mid to senior level ISI and Pak Mil with one retired Pak Mil General".&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Damien (February 27, 2012) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/9109457/Stratfor-Osama-bin-Laden-was-in-routine-contact-with-Pakistans-spy-agency.html "Stratfor: Osama bin Laden 'was in routine contact with Pakistan's spy agency'"], ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, British journalist [[Carlotta Gall]] revealed that she had been told by an undisclosed ISI source that the ISI "ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden". The desk was "led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior [...] but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told".&lt;ref name=Gall2014 /&gt;

===Pakistani response===
{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-W_kAfRLlQ Pakistan After bin Laden- Vice.]}}
According to a Pakistani intelligence official, raw phone-tap data had been transferred to the U.S. without being analyzed by Pakistan. While the U.S. "was concentrating on this" information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had "slipped from" Pakistan's "radar" over the months. Bin Laden left "an invisible footprint" and he had not been contacting other militant networks. It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound. The transfer of intelligence to the U.S. was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that "I think they came in undetected and went out the same day", and Pakistan did not believe that U.S. personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

According to the Pakistani high commissioner to the United Kingdom, [[Wajid Shamsul Hasan]], Pakistan had prior knowledge that an operation would happen. Pakistan was "in the know of certain things" and "what happened, happened with our consent. Americans got to know him—where he was first—and that's why they struck it and struck it precisely." Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the U.S., had said that Pakistan would have pursued bin Laden had the intelligence of his location existed with them and Pakistan was "very glad that our American partners did. They had superior intelligence, superior technology, and we are grateful to them."&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

Another Pakistani official stated that Pakistan "assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace" and the operation was conducted by the United States. He also said that "in any event, we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong."&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

In June the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] arrested the owner of a safe house rented to the CIA to observe Osama bin Laden's compound and five CIA informants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2077798,00.html |title=Bin Laden: Pakistan Arrests CIA Informants AP |work=Time |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618210001/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C2077798%2C00.html |archivedate=June 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code name==
{{See also|Code name Geronimo controversy}}
Several officials who were present in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]], including the president,&lt;ref name="kroft"/&gt; told reporters that the code name for bin Laden was "Geronimo". They had watched [[Leon Panetta]], speaking from [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]], while he narrated the action in Abbottabad. Panetta said, "We have a visual on Geronimo", and later, "Geronimo EKIA"—enemy [[killed in action]].&lt;ref name="behindthehunt"/&gt; The words of the commander on the ground were, "For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo."&lt;ref name="guthrie"/&gt; Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an "Execution Checklist", which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic. "Geronimo" indicated the raiders had reached step "G", the capture or killing of bin Laden.&lt;ref name="oneshotdeal"/&gt; Osama bin Laden was identified as "Jackpot", the general code name for the target of an operation.&lt;ref name="guthrie"/&gt; ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was "Cakebread".&lt;ref name="targetchapter6"/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that bin Laden's codename was "Crankshaft".&lt;ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/&gt;

Many Native Americans were offended that [[Geronimo]], the renowned 19th-century [[Apache]] leader, was irrevocably linked with bin Laden.

U.S. officials&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Matthew, [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/05/04/tortured_logic "Tortured Logic: The United States Didn't Need to Waterboard Anyone to Get Osama Bin Laden"], ''Foreign Policy,'' May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and legislators, including Republican [[John McCain]]&lt;ref name="stoplying"/&gt; and Democrat [[Dianne Feinstein]], chairwoman of the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], countered that those statements were "false". They noted that a report by CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]] stated that the first mention of the courier's nickname did not come from Mohammed, but rather from another government's interrogation of a suspect whom they said they "believe was not tortured."&lt;ref name="WashPostMcCain"/&gt;

McCain called on Mukasey to retract his statements.&lt;ref name="WashPostMcCain"/&gt;

{{quote|I have sought further information from the staff of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], and they confirm for me that, in fact, the best intelligence gained from a CIA detainee—information describing Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's real role in Al-Qaeda and his true relationship to Osama bin Laden—was obtained through standard, non-coercive means, not through any 'enhanced interrogation technique'.&lt;ref name="stoplying"/&gt;|John McCain}}

Panetta had written a letter to McCain on the issue, saying: "Some of the detainees who provided useful information about the facilitator/courier's role had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Whether those techniques were the 'only timely and effective way' to obtain such information is a matter of debate and cannot be established definitively."&lt;ref name="WashPostMcCain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="informantstreatment"/&gt; Although some information may have been obtained from detainees who were subjected to torture, Panetta wrote to McCain that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We first learned about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also important to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.&lt;ref name="cialetterwapo"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, other U.S. officials state that shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, detainees in [[CIA secret prisons]] told interrogators about the courier's pseudonym "al-Kuwaiti" and that when Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was later captured, he only "confirmed" the courier's pseudonym. After [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] was captured, he provided false or misleading information: he denied that he knew al-Kuwaiti and he made up another name instead.&lt;ref name="phonecall"/&gt; Also, a group of interrogators asserted that the courier's nickname was not divulged "during torture, but rather several months later, when [detainees] were questioned by interrogators who did not use abusive techniques."&lt;ref&gt;Mulrine, Anna, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0505/Military-interrogators-Waterboarding-didn-t-yield-tips-that-led-to-bin-Laden/(page)/2 "Military interrogators: Waterboarding didn't yield tips that led to bin Laden"], ''Christian Science Monitor,'' May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence postmortem==
Evidence seized from the compound is said to include ten [[Mobile phone|cell phones]], five to ten computers, twelve hard drives, at least 100 computer disks (including [[USB flash drive|thumb drives]] and DVDs), handwritten notes, documents, weapons and "an assortment of personal items".&lt;ref name="cbsphonenos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"&gt;{{cite news|title=New bin Laden documents released|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-bin-laden-documents-released/2012/05/03/gIQAYOcnyT_story.html |date=May 3, 2012|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 3, 2012|first1=Greg |last1=Miller |first2=Peter |last2=Finn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by a senior Pentagon intelligence official as "the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever."&lt;ref name="firstlook"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devereaux|first1=Ryan|title=The al Qaeda Files: Bin Laden Documents Reveal a Struggling Organization|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/13/al-qaeda-files-bin-laden-documents-reveal-struggling-organization|accessdate=March 22, 2015|agency=The Intercept|publisher=First Look Media|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2017 the CIA released to the public approximately 470,000 files and a copy of bin Laden's diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/11/01/osama-bin-ladens-video-collection-included-where-in-the-world-is-osama-bin-laden/|title=Osama bin Laden’s video collection included ‘Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?’|first1=Cleve |last1=R.

Intelligence analysts also studied [[call detail record]]s from two phone numbers that were found to be sewn into bin Laden's clothing.&lt;ref name="cbsphonenos"/&gt; They helped over the course of several months to apprehend several al-Qaeda members in several countries and to kill several of bin Laden's closest associates by [[CIA]] [[drone attacks in Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt;

The material gathered at the compound was stored at the [[FBI Laboratory]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]], where [[Forensic science|forensic]] experts analyzed [[fingerprint]]s, [[DNA]] and other [[trace evidence]] left on the material.&lt;ref name="cbsphonenos"/&gt; Copies of the material were provided to other agencies; officials want to preserve a [[chain of custody]] in case any of the information is needed as evidence in a future trial.

A special CIA team has been given the responsibility of combing through the digital material and documents removed from the bin Laden compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-laden-evidence-trove-us-al-qaedas/story?id=13517804|title=Osama Bin Laden Evidence Trove: U.S. Hopes to Follow al Qaeda's Money Trail|first=Matthew|last=Mosk|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA team is working in collaboration with other U.S. government agencies "to triage, catalog and analyze this intelligence."&lt;ref name="globalDOD"/&gt;

Bin Laden's youngest wife told Pakistani investigators that the family lived in the [[Feudalism in Pakistan|feudal]] village of [[Chak Shah Muhammad]], in the nearby district of [[Haripur District|Haripur]], for two and a half years before moving to Abbottabad in late 2005.&lt;ref name="haripur"/&gt;

The material seized from the compound contained al-Qaeda's strategy for Afghanistan after America's withdrawal from the country in 2014,&lt;ref name="WP20120428"/&gt; as well as thousands of electronic memos and missives that captured conversations between bin Laden and his deputies around the world.&lt;ref name="WP20120501"/&gt; It showed that bin Laden stayed in touch with al-Qaeda's established affiliates and sought new alliances with groups such as [[Boko Haram]] from Nigeria.&lt;ref name="WP20120428"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=Al-Qaeda is weaker without bin Laden, but its franchise persists|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/manhunt-details-us-mission-to-find-osama-bin-laden/2012/04/27/gIQAz5pLoT_story.html|accessdate=May 1, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the material, he sought to reassert control over factions of loosely affiliated jihadists from Yemen to Somalia, as well as independent actors whom he believed had sullied al-Qaeda's reputation and muddied its central message.&lt;ref name="WP20120501"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bin Laden's last stand: In final months, terrorist leader worried about his legacy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/bin-ladens-last-stand-in-final-months-terrorist-leader-worried-about-his-legacy/2012/04/30/gIQAStCjsT_story.html|accessdate=May 1, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 1, 2012|first=Joby |last=Warrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden was worried at times about his personal security and was annoyed that his organization had not utilized the [[Arab Spring]] to improve its image.&lt;ref name="WP20120501"/&gt; He acted, according to the ''Washington Post'', on the one hand as "chief executive fully engaged in the group's myriad crises, grappling with financial problems, recruitment, rebellious field managers and sudden staff vacancies resulting from the unrelenting U.S. drone campaign",&lt;ref name="WP20120501"/&gt; and on the other hand as "a hands-on manager who participated in the terrorist group's operational planning and strategic thinking while also giving orders and advice to field operatives scattered worldwide."&lt;ref name="WP20120501"/&gt; The material also described Osama bin Laden's relation with [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]].&lt;ref name="WP20120501"/&gt;

Seventeen documents seized during the Abbottabad raid, consisting of electronic letters or draft letters dating from September 2006 to April 2011, were released by the [[Combating Terrorism Center]] at West Point one year and one day after bin Laden's death.&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt; and made available at the ''Washington Post'' homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Osama bin Laden documents captured during raid|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/documents/osama-bin-laden-compound-documents.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 3, 2012|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents covered subjects such as the [[News media (United States)|news media in America]], affiliate organization, targets, America, security, and the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corera|first=Gordon|title=Analysis: Bin Laden papers details|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17943175|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 3, 2012|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the documents, bin Laden stated that al-Qaeda's strength was limited and therefore suggested that the best way to attack the U.S., which he compared to a tree, "is to concentrate on sawing the trunk".&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt; He refused the promotion of [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] when this was requested by [[Nasir al-Wuhayshi]], leader of [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]. "We here become reassured of the people when they go to the line and get examined there",&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt; bin Laden said. He told al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to expand operations in the U.S. in the wake of the [[2009 Christmas Day bomb plot]] by writing "We need to extend and develop our operations in America and not keep it limited to blowing up airplanes."&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt;

The seized material shed light on al-Qaeda's relationship with [[Iran]], which detained jihadis and their relatives in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, including members of bin Laden's family. Al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran was, according to the Combating Terrorism Center, an "unpleasant byproduct of necessity, fueled by mutual distrust and antagonism."&lt;ref name="WP 20120503"/&gt; An explicit reference to any institutional support from Pakistan for al-Qaeda wasn't mentioned in the documents; instead, bin Laden instructed his family members how to avoid detection so that members of Pakistani intelligence couldn't track them to find him.&lt;ref name="BBC20120503"&gt;{{cite news|title=Osama Bin Laden documents released|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17941778|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 3, 2012|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the seized material, former commander of the international forces in Afghanistan [[David Petraeus]] and US President Barack Obama should be assassinated during any of their visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan, if there was an opportunity to do so. Bin Laden opined that U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] should not be a target because "Biden is totally unprepared for that post [of president], which will lead the US into a crisis."&lt;ref name="BBC20120503"/&gt; Bin Laden was also against one-person suicide attacks and was of the opinion that at least two persons should undertake these attacks instead.&lt;ref name="BBC20120503"/&gt; He planned to reform in a way so that al-Qaeda's central leadership would have a greater say in the naming of the al-Qaeda branch leaders and their deputies. He expressed his opinion that killing Muslims has weakened his organization and not helped al-Qaeda, writing that it "cost the mujahedeen no small amount of sympathy among Muslims. The enemy has exploited the mistakes of the mujahedeen to mar their image among the masses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keath|first=Lee|title=Al Qaeda Leader Worried About Image|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/04/osama-bin-laden-documents_n_1476878.html|agency=Associated Press|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=May 5, 2012|date=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helicopter stealth technology revelations==
The [[Tail rotor|tail section]] of the secret helicopter survived demolition and lay just outside the compound wall.&lt;ref name="helostealth"/&gt; Pakistani security forces put up a cloth barrier at first light to hide the wreckage.&lt;ref name="myneighbor"/&gt; Later, a tractor hauled it away hidden under a tarp.&lt;ref name="littlenotice"/&gt; Journalists obtained photographs that  revealed the previously undisclosed [[stealth technology]]. ''Aviation Week'' said the helicopter appeared to be a significantly modified [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60 Black Hawk]]. Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009.&lt;ref name="notnew"/&gt; Its performance during the operation confirmed that a [[stealth helicopter]] could evade detection in a militarily sensitive, densely populated area. Photos showed that the Black Hawk's tail had stealth-configured shapes on the boom and the [[Aircraft fairing|fairings]], swept [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizers]] and a "hubcap" over the noise-reducing five- or six-blade tail rotor. It appeared to have a silver-loaded [[Infrared signature|infrared suppression]] finish similar to some [[V-22 Osprey]]s.&lt;ref name="helostealth"/&gt;

The U.S. requested return of the wreckage and the Chinese government also expressed interest, according to Pakistani officials. Pakistan had custody of the wreckage for over two weeks before its return was secured by [[U.S. Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref name="kerry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama nominates John Kerry as secretary of state|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-to-nominate-john-kerry-for-secretary-of-state-today/2012/12/21/d21003ee-4b83-11e2-a6a6-aabac85e8036_story.html|accessdate=December 22, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 21, 2012|first1=Anne |last1=Gearan |first2=Scott |last2=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts disagreed as to how much information could have been gleaned from the tail fragment. Stealth technology was already operational on several [[Stealth aircraft|fixed-wing aircraft]] and the cancelled [[Boeing-Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche|RAH-66 Comanche]] helicopter; the modified Black Hawk was the first confirmed operational "stealth helicopter". It is likely that the most valuable information obtainable from the wreckage was the composition of the [[Radiation-absorbent material|radar-absorbing paint]] used on the tail section.&lt;ref name="helostealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="armsrace"/&gt; Local children were seen picking up pieces of the wreckage and selling them as souvenirs.&lt;ref name="goodneighbours"/&gt; In August 2011, Fox News reported that Pakistan had allowed Chinese scientists to examine the helicopter's tail section and were especially interested in its radar-absorbing paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/15/report-pakistan-granted-china-access-to-uss-top-secret-bin-laden-raid-chopper|title=Report: Pakistan Granted China Access to U.S.'s Top-Secret Bin Laden Raid Chopper|publisher=Fox News | date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan and the PRC denied these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/232466/army-denies-providing-china-access-to-bin-laden-raid-chopper/ |title=US helicopter wreckage: Pakistan denies giving China access  |work=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Edward The King''''' is a 2008 two-act play by American playwright [[David Brendan Hopes]]. The play is an adaptation of [[Christopher Marlowe|Christopher Marlowe's]] play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', which in turn is a dramatization of the real-life story of [[Edward II of England]].

==Overview==
Beset by the duties of his birth and dominated by a heroic father, Edward looks forward to a life of apparent conformity and desperate subterfuge, until he meets [[Piers Gaveston]] in a dirty alley. It is love and rebellion at first sight. From then on, Edward steers a perilous course between desire and safety, which does not entirely end even when he becomes king, and faces not only the usual enemies of unconventional love, but his queen and her lover as well. Edward the King neatly straddles the 14th and 21st centuries, which manage to appear almost equally violent and inhospitable to love.

'''''Evening Primrose''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[James Goldman]] and lyrics and music by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. It is based on a [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]] [[short story]] published in the 1951 collection ''Fancies and Goodnights''.

Written originally for television, the musical focuses on a poet who takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing.  He meets a community of night people who live in the store and falls in love with a beautiful young girl named Ella.  Bizarre complications arise when the leader of the group forbids their relationship.

==Synopsis==
Poet Charles Snell takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing ("If You Can Find Me, I'm Here"). Once there he finds a secret group who have lived in the store for years. The leader of the group, Mrs. Monday, permits Charles to stay after he convinces her that he is a poet.

Charles meets and is smitten with a beautiful young girl, Ella Harkins, Mrs. Monday's maid. Ella, who is now 19, has lived in the store since she was separated from her mother at age six, falling asleep in the women's hat department. Ella is unhappy and wants to leave, but is afraid of the "Dark Men". Should someone try to return to the outside world and risk revealing the group's existence, the Dark Men take them away and another [[mannequin]] appears in the clothing department.

Charles realizes Ella has not seen the sun for thirteen years, but she replies that she remembers ("I Remember"). Charles has fallen in love with Ella; as he plays cards with members of the group, he has a quiet duet with Ella ("When"). Ella finally decides to leave with Charles ("Take Me To The World").  Charles is initially reluctant to leave his now-comfortable life, but then understands that he loves Ella more than poetry. Mrs. Monday and the others hear their plans, and they call the Dark Men, as Ella and Charles try to escape.

The store opens the next morning with a couple on the sidewalk who resemble Ella and Charles from behind, but turn out to be strangers when the camera pans to their faces. They're looking at a window display in which Ella and Charles are now mannequins dressed as a bride and groom, with the night watchman acting as their minister.

'''Goodspeed Musicals''' is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and advancement of musical theater and the creation of new works, located in [[East Haddam, Connecticut]]. A distinctive feature of the view from the [[Connecticut River]], the Goodspeed Opera House is the birthplace of some of the world's most famous musicals, including ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' and ''[[Shenandoah (musical)|Shenandoah]]''.

== Goodspeed Opera House ==
The Opera House was originally built by a local merchant and banker, William Goodspeed.  Construction began in 1876 and finished in 1877. Despite the name, it was not in fact an [[opera house]], but rather a venue for presenting plays. Its first play, ''Charles II'', opened on October 24, 1877.  After William Goodspeed's death, the opera house fell into disrepair, facing a series of less glamorous uses—from a militia base during [[World War I]] to a [[general store]] and a Department of Transportation storage facility.

The building is unique for a theater.  The theater itself is actually located on the top two floors of the building making for interesting and sometimes difficult scenery and show load-ins.  Scenery is loaded-in from the dock area up a vacant elevator shaft that is now outfitted with a winch system to haul the scenery up to the stage level.  Much care has to be taken in order to get the scenery up the shaft without scratching or ruining the scenery.  One story told around Goodspeed is that while loading in the scenery for Annie's original pre-Broadway run, a strong gust of wind took a large piece of scenery out of the hands of the loaders and blew it into the Connecticut River.

== Goodspeed Musicals ==

Goodspeed Musicals was formed in 1959 by a group of concerned citizens after the state of Connecticut had condemned the building. The state agreed to sell the building to the group for one dollar, provided they acquire enough funding to restore and maintain it. The restoration project took nearly four years, and the Goodspeed Opera House was rededicated on June 8, 1963.  The first performance in the new opera house was ''[[Oh, Lady! Lady!]]'' Under the direction of [[Michael P. Price]] since 1968, Goodspeed Musicals has sent 19 productions to Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Goodspeed-Opera-House/#.U7LoUbGzmYk|title=Goodspeed Opera House Theatre Credits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goodspeed productions have won more than a dozen [[Tony Award]]s, while Goodspeed Musicals itself has won two special Tonys, one for outstanding contributions to American Musicals and the other for outstanding achievement by a regional theatre.

In 1984, Goodspeed Musicals added a second performance venue—the [[Norma Terris Theatre]]—in nearby [[Chester, Connecticut]].  While the main stage presents a mixture of revivals and new musicals as part of its 3 production season, The Norma Terris also presents three new musicals each season.  Several original plays debuted there or at the opera house before going on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and winning [[Tony Award]]s.

In addition to the two theaters, Goodspeed Musicals pursues its mission through the Max Showalter Center for Education in Musical Theatre, which offers internships and new writers' residency programs, as well as the Scherer Library of Musical Theatre, which houses the largest musical theatre research facility in the United States. Goodspeed Musicals has also built state-of-the-art production facilities including scenery shops, costume shops and a large costume storage facility.

Critic fellows from the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in Waterford, CT travel to the Goodspeed each summer to practice reviewing full productions.

Tours of many of the Goodspeed facilities can be scheduled in advance for a small fee.  Tickets to the opera house or theatre productions should be ordered in advance as most performances in the relatively small theater sell-out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |title=Visit CT |work=Visit CT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194527/http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5101">'''Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith al-Taghlibi''' ({{fl.|868–895}}) was a [[Taghlib]]i Arab chieftain in the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], and the patriarch of the [[Hamdanid dynasty]]. Alongside other Arab chieftains of the area, he resisted the attempts at re-imposition of [[Abbasid]] control over the Jazira in the 880s, and joined the [[Kharijite Rebellion (866–896)|Kharijite Rebellion]]. He was finally defeated and captured by Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] in 895, but was later released as a reward for the distinguished services of his son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan|Husayn]] to the Caliph.

== Life ==
[[File:Hamdanid family tree.svg|thumb|300px|Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty]]
His family belonged to the [[Banu Taghlib]] tribe, established in the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] since before the [[Muslim conquests]]. The tribe was particularly strong in the region of [[Mosul]], and came to dominate the area during the decade-long [[Anarchy at Samarra]] (861–870), when the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of the authority of the central [[Abbasid]] government to assert their autonomy.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=265–266}} Hamdan himself appears for the first time in 868, fighting alongside other Taghlibis against the [[Kharijite Rebellion (866–896)|Kharijite Rebellion]] in the Jazira.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=126}}

In 879, however, the Abbasid government, in an effort to restore its control, replaced the succession of Tahglibi chieftains as governors of Mosul by a Turkish commander, [[Ishaq ibn Kundajiq]]. This prompted the defection of the Taghlib chiefs, including Hamdan ibn Hamdun, to the Kharijite rebels.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=126}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=266}} Hamdan became a prominent leader in the rebellion; thus he is mentioned—with the Kharijite sobriquet of "al-Shari"—among the Kharijite and Arab tribal leaders in the great victory won by Ibn Kundajiq in April/May 881, when the rebel army was routed and pursued to [[Nisibis]] and [[Amid]].{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=126}}{{sfn|Fields|1987|p=50}}

[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]])]]
In 892, a new Caliph, [[al-Mu'tadid]], took the throne, determined to restore Abbasid control over the Jazira. In a series of campaigns, he achieved the submission of most local potentates, but Hamdan offered tenacious opposition. Holding the fortresses of [[Maridin]] and [[Ardamusht]] (near modern [[Cizre]]), and allied with the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribes of the mountains north of the Jaziran plain, he held out until 895. In that year, the Caliph took first Mardin and then Ardamusht, which was yielded by Hamdan's son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan|Husayn]]. Hamdan fled before the caliphal army, but after an "epic chase" (H. Kennedy), finally gave up and surrendered himself at Mosul and was thrown in prison.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=126}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=266}}

As H. Kennedy comments, "this surrender might have seemed the end of the family fortunes as it was for other local leaders in the area", but Hamdan's son, Husayn managed to preserve the family's fortunes. Husayn entered the Caliph's service and was instrumental in ending the Kharijite Rebellion and capturing its leader, Harun al-Shari. He was rewarded by the grateful Mu'tadid with a pardon for his father and the right to raise and command his own corps of Taghlibi horse, which he led on several expeditions over the next few years, becoming one of the Caliphate's most prominent commanders. His influence enabled him to become, in Kennedy's description, the "intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira", thereby cementing the family's dominance in the area and laying the foundation for the rise of the Hamdanid dynasty to power under his two nephews, [[Nasir al-Dawla]] and [[Sayf al-Dawla]].{{sfn|Canard|1971|pp=126ff.}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=266ff.}}

In political theory and theology, to '''immanentize the eschaton''' means trying to bring about the [[eschatology|eschaton]]&lt;!-- don't link to [[Eschaton]], which is a dab page; see [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links]] --&gt; (the final, heaven-like stage of history) in the [[Immanence|immanent]] world.   In all these contexts it means "trying to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now (on Earth)".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Theologically the belief is akin to [[postmillennialism]] as reflected in the [[Social Gospel]] of the 1880–1930 era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W. Miller |title=God at Work : The History and Promise of the Faith at Work Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeyqcbS6xx0C&amp;pg=PA28|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Protestant reform movements during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the 1830s and 1840s such as abolitionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas M. Strong|title=Perfectionist Politics: Abolitionism and the Religious Tensions of American Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5T2tGOKYOMC&amp;pg=PA30|date= 2002|publisher=Syracuse U.P.|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Modern usage of the phrase started with [[Eric Voegelin]] in ''The New Science of Politics'' in 1952. Conservative spokesman [[William F. Buckley]] popularized Voegelin's phrase as "Don't immanentize the eschaton!" Buckley's version became a political slogan of [[Young Americans for Freedom]] during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref  name="JGoldberg"&gt;{{cite web | title = Immanent Corrections | author = Jonah Goldberg | url = http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODQ5Y2ZiNjAzMjdlNDAwMTk2MTgxNGVlYTE1Nzc5YjQ=#more | publisher = [[National Review]] | date = 2002-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin identified a number of similarities between ancient [[Gnosticism]] and the beliefs held by a number of modern political theories, particularly Communism and Nazism. He identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as belief in a lack of concord within society as a result of an inherent disorder, or even evil, of the world. He described this as having two effects:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*The belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a ''Gnostic Speculation'' by Voegelin (the Gnostics themselves referred to this as ''[[gnosis]]'').
*The desire to implement a policy to actualize the speculation, or as Voegelin said, to ''Immanentize the Eschaton'', to create a sort of heaven on earth within history.

One of the more oft-quoted passages from Voegelin's work on Gnosticism is that "The problem of an ''[[Theory of forms|eidos]]'' in history, hence, arises only when a Christian [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] fulfillment becomes immanentized. Such an immanentist [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostasis]] of the eschaton, however, is a theoretical fallacy."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The book ''[[Fire in the Minds of Men]]'' explores the idea further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paperbacks: New and Noteworthy | author= | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFDB1539F933A15750C0A965948260 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=1983-03-20 | accessdate=2008-11-06 | quote=At once erudite and dramatic, the book explores the roots of the modern belief that a just and beautiful new world will spring into being if only we can overthrow evil powers and institutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4PRx21WVqMC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Fire in the Minds of Men'', introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

The [[Lutheran Confessions]] directly reject the idea of an immanentized eschaton, condemning the belief "that before the resurrection of the dead the godly shall take possession of the kingdom of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed."&lt;ref  name="ACXVII"&gt;{{cite web | title = Augsburg Confession ACXVII | url = http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article17.5 |  accessdate = 2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' makes an oblique reference to the desire to "Immanentize the Eschaton" in article 676:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the "intrinsically perverse" political form of a secular messianism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the end of the 12th century, [[Joachim of Fiore]] theorized the coming of an age of earthly bliss right before the end of time. Although not a full immanentization, Joachim has opened the way to an anticipation of the eschaton in the course of time. His ideas have influenced the thoughts on an immanentized eschaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gioacchino da Fiore nella cultura contemporanea: atti del 6 Congresso Internazionale di Studi Gioachimiti, San Giovanni in Fiore, 23 - 25 settembre 2004|last=Potestà|first=Gian Luca (Ed.)|publisher=Viella|year=2005|isbn=8883341872|location=Roma|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Interpretations==
In contemporary terminology this process is sometimes described as "hastening the eschaton" or "hastening the [[apocalypse]]. In this sense it refers to a phenomenon related to [[millenarianism]] and the specific Christian form [[millennialism]] which is based on a particular reading of the Christian Bible's [[Book of Revelation]] especially popular among evangelicals in the United States 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landes |first1=Richard Allen |title=Heaven on Earth: The varieties of the Millennial experience |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Conservatism|conservative critics]] sometimes use these terms as a pejorative reference to certain projects such as [[Nazism]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]].&lt;ref  name="JGoldberg"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The phrase is cited in the [[Discordian]] text ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', first published in 1965, and appears fifteen times in [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Robert Shea]]'s 1975 ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', in the first of which the first line of the novel is, "It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton."

In [[Ken Macleod]]'s 1997 science fiction novel ''The Stone Canal'', one of the chapters is called, "Another crack at Immanentising the Eschaton." The phrase is also used in issue four of Warren Ellis' 2007 comic, ''[[Doktor Sleepless]]''. It appears to be the goal of the title character to bring about the end of the world, driven by disappointment over how the future of the past has transpired. Sleepless wants to end the world to keep it from getting worse. The phrase is quoted several times, and can be regarded as the driving force behind the comic.

It is quoted (on a banner) in  [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Escape from Hell (novel)|Escape from Hell]]''.

It was used in the lyrics of the two [[Rave music|rave]] singles "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" by [[The KLF#The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu|The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] in 1987, and the [[Shamen]]'s "Destination Eschaton" in 1995.

'''Jim LeRoy''' (April 5, 1961 – July 28, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[aerobatics]] pilot. He died upon impact in a crash at the Dayton Air Show in Ohio.

==Background==
A former [[US Marine Corps]] [[Reconnaissance|Scout]]/[[Sniper]], Jim LeRoy held a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Aeronautical]]/[[Aerospace]] engineering as well as an [[Aircraft Maintenance Technician|Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P) license]].

==Stunt flying==
Initially flying solo performances, he gained a reputation with his highly energetic aerobatic displays. In 2003, LeRoy joined a daring and successful [[airshow]] troupe, the X-team, who referred to themselves as the [[Masters of Disaster]]. Their performance generally consisted of three pilots flying a simultaneous, chaotic, interweaving aerobatic display through clouds of smoke generated by circling jet-powered trucks below. After two seasons of successful airshows, an accident occurred on July 10, 2005 during a routine performance when [[Jimmy Franklin]] and Bobby Younkin collided in mid-air. Jim LeRoy was not involved in the collision and landed safely.

LeRoy was one of only eleven pilots ever to be awarded both the ''[[Art Scholl]] Showmanship Award'' (2002) and the ''[[Bill Barber (pilot)|Bill Barber]] Award for Showmanship'' (2003). He was also one of only a handful of full-time [[air show]] pilots in the world who actually made his living by performing for air show audiences.

LeRoy also held the following pilot ratings: single-engine, multi-engine, airplane instructor, helicopter, helicopter instructor, instrument instructor and aerobatic competency evaluator.

==Death==
{{wikinews|Deadly crash at Dayton, Ohio air show}}

Around 2:15PM [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EST]] at the [[Vectren]] [[Dayton Air Show]] at [[Dayton International Airport]] outside [[Dayton, Ohio]], LeRoy crashed his [[Pitts Special|S2S Bulldog II]], while in performance with the X-Team ''Codename: Mary's Lamb'' aerobatics team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiotv.com/news/13774845/detail.html Dayton Air Show Crash Kills Pilot - News Story - WHIO Dayton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201231032/http://www.whiotv.com/news/13774845/detail.html |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial indications showed that he was performing a [[Aerobatic maneuver|1/2 Cuban 8]] and snap rolls on the 45-degree down line,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/3533213/ Jim LeRoy Dies In Airshow Crash — Civil Aviation Forum | Airliners.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but recovered too low to the ground to pull out. He hit the runway at {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, although his vertical speed was only around {{convert|75|mph|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}; the plane slid {{convert|300|yards|m}} and burst into flames.&lt;ref name=investigation&gt;[http://www.whiotv.com/news/13780478/detail.html Coroner: Pilot Died Instantly - News Story - WHIO Dayton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222180158/http://www.whiotv.com/news/13780478/detail.html |date=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planecrashinfo.com/famous2000s.htm planecrashinfo.com Famous People Who Died in Aviation Accidents: 2000s]&lt;/ref&gt;  LeRoy was pronounced dead in a military [[MEDEVAC]] helicopter while in transit to [[Miami Valley Hospital]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The [[Forensic pathology|coroner]]'s report states that LeRoy died on impact due to a [[fracture]] of his neck, but that he also was badly burned.&lt;ref name=investigation/&gt;

The '''Kossuth Prize''' ({{lang-hu|Kossuth-díj}}) is a state-sponsored award in [[Hungary]], named after the Hungarian politician and revolutionary [[Lajos Kossuth]]. The Prize was established in 1948 (on occasion of the centenary of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|March 15th revolution]], the day on which it is still handed over every year) by the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], to acknowledge outstanding personal and group achievements in the fields of science, culture and the arts, as well as in the building of [[Socialism]] in general.

In 1950s the award was given to Gabor Bela Fodor for his contributions in the field of Chemistry as the prize was given to selected scientists. Since 1963, the domain was restricted to culture and the arts. Today, it is regarded as the most prestigious cultural award in Hungary, and is awarded by the [[President of Hungary|President]].

'''''Liu Hulan''''' (刘胡兰) is a 1954 [[Chinese-language western-style opera]] by [[Chen Zi]]. It is based on the death of a 14-year-old communist party girl [[Liu Hulan]], who was elevated into a [[revolutionary martyr]]. Part of The original opera was composed in 1949, only 2 years after her death, and revised into a full-scale opera in 1954. Several other composers such as [[Ge Guangrui]] also contributed to Chen's opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2006-06/30/content_83398.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065605/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2006-06/30/content_83398.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar opera based on another revolutionary martyr is ''[[Sister Jiang]]''.

A severe geomagnetic storm struck Earth on March 13, 1989. It occurred during [[solar cycle 22]] and caused a nine-hour outage of [[Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system]].

==Geomagnetic storm and auroras==
The geomagnetic storm causing this event was itself the result of an ejection known as a [[coronal mass ejection]] on March 9, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=246 Geomagnetic Storms Can Threaten Electric Power Grid] ''Earth in Space'', Vol. 9, No. 7, March 1997, pp.9-11 (American Geophysical Union)&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before, on March 6, a very large X15-class [[solar flare]] also occurred.&lt;ref name="sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov"&gt;http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/X17/&lt;/ref&gt;
Three-and-a-half days later, at 2:44 [[12-hour clock|am]] [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on March 13, a severe geomagnetic storm struck [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Bnet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Space weather: Page 1 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_n8_v16/ai_17253896/pg_1 |publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |accessdate=2008-01-20 |date=August 1995 |first=Eric J. |last=Lerner |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602100449/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_n8_v16/ai_17253896/pg_1 |archivedate=2013-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists probe northern lights from all angles |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/10/22/northern_lights_051022.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2005-10-22 |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm began on Earth with extremely intense [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] at the poles. The aurora could be seen as far south as [[Texas]] and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt; As this occurred near the end of the [[Cold War]], an unknown number of people worried that a nuclear first strike might be in progress.&lt;ref name="storm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarstorms.org/SWChapter1.html|title=A Conflagration of Storms|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others incorrectly considered the intense auroras to be associated with the Space Shuttle mission [[STS-29]], which had been launched on March 13 at 9:57:00 AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-29/mission-sts-29.html |title=STS-29 |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burst caused short-wave radio interference, including the disruption of radio signals from [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] into Russia. It was initially believed that the signals had been [[Radio jamming|jammed]] by the Soviet government.

As midnight came and went, a river of charged particles and electrons in the ionosphere flowed from west to east, inducing powerful electrical currents in the ground that surged into many natural nooks and crannies.&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt;

Some satellites in polar orbits lost control for several hours. [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES weather satellite]] communications were interrupted, causing weather images to be lost. NASA's TDRS-1 communication satellite recorded over 250 anomalies caused by the increased particles flowing into its sensitive electronics.&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt; The Space Shuttle Discovery was having its own problems: a sensor on one of the tanks supplying hydrogen to a fuel cell was showing unusually high pressure readings on March 13. The problem went away after the solar storm subsided.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that one of the UK's nuclear submarines noticed a variation in [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] signal strength around the same time{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.  Because the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] files are still classified, this is not yet possible to confirm or deny.

== Quebec blackout ==
[[File:ExtremeEvent 19890310-00h 19890315-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-7 monitors the space weather conditions during the Great Geomagnetic storm of March 1989, the Moscow neutron monitor recorded the passage of a CME as a drop in levels known as a [[Forbush decrease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The variations in the [[earth's magnetic field]] also tripped [[circuit breaker]]s on [[Hydro-Québec]]'s [[Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system|power grid]]. The utility's very long transmission lines and the fact that most of Quebec sits on [[Canadian Shield|a large rock shield]] prevented current flowing through the earth, finding a less resistant path along the 735 kV power lines.&lt;ref name="HQ_solarstorm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydroquebec.com/learning/notions-de-base/tempete-mars-1989.html |title=Understanding Electricity - March 1989 - Hydro-Québec |author=Hydro-Québec |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Bay Project|James Bay]] network went offline in less than 90 seconds, giving [[Quebec]] its second massive [[power outage|blackout]] in 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/environnement/catastrophes_naturelles/clips/14150/ |title=Le Québec dans le noir |date=13 March 1989|first=Michel |last=Morin |first2=Gilles |last2=Sirois |first3=Bernard |last3=Derome |publisher=[[Radio-Canada]]| language=French |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power failure lasted nine hours and forced the company to implement various mitigation strategies, including raising the trip level, installing [[Flexible AC transmission system|series compensation]] on [[High voltage|ultra high voltage]] lines and upgrading various monitoring and operational procedures. Other [[public utility|utilities]] in North America and Northern Europe and elsewhere implemented programs to reduce the risks associated with [[geomagnetically induced current]]s.&lt;ref name="HQ_solarstorm"/&gt;

== Military ==

One of the few publicly reported military operations impacted was the [[Australian Army]] component of the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[peacekeeping]] force which was deployed to [[Namibia]] at the time. The storm occurred just as the advance elements of the contingent arrived in Namibia, but the effects were believed to last for weeks afterwards. The [[Australian contribution to UNTAG]] was heavily reliant on HF radio communications which were severely impacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Aftermath==
In August 1989, another storm caused a halt of all trading on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com//article/mg12316812.400-solar-storms-halt-stock-market-as-computers-crash|title=Solar storms halt stock market as computers crash|last=Dayton|first=Leigh|date=1989-09-09|website=New Scientist|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, geomagnetic storms and [[solar flare]]s have been monitored from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) satellite, a joint project of [[NASA]] and the [[European Space Agency]].

Because of serious concerns that utilities have failed to set protection standards and are unprepared for a severe solar storm such as the [[Solar storm of 1859|Carrington Event]], the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] has ordered the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] to create standards that would require power grids to be somewhat protected from solar storms and equipment to be continuously tested for possible effects of solar storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/electricity-solar-storms/column-u-s-orders-power-grid-to-prepare-for-solar-storms-kemp-idUSL6N0LN3HU20140218|title=COLUMN-U.S. orders power grid to prepare for solar storms: Kemp|last=Kemp|first=John|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Veronica|work=Reuters|date=2014-02-18|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Reliability Standards for Geomagnetic Disturbances|type=Order|number=779|date=May 16, 2013|article=Part 40|articletype=18 CFR|page=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2013/051613/E-5.pdf|access-date=2018-08-01|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has begun a phased rule-making, published in the [[Federal Register]], to examine the sufficiency of cooling systems of stored spent fuel rods of nuclear power plants now considered vulnerable to long-term power outages from events such as space weather, high-altitude nuclear burst [[electromagnetic pulse]]s or cyber attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register|77|16175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">'''Marvin Hewitt''' (born 1922) was an [[United States|American]] [[impostor]] who became, among other things, a university [[physics]] professor.

Hewitt was a [[high school]] drop-out with no qualifications who wanted to become an academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/columnists/gary_slapper/article3990945.ece|title=Weird cases: faking it|date=May 23, 2008|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=6 January 2010 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Slapper}}&lt;/ref&gt; He always used names and identities of real-life people in his impostures. He later claimed that he had a "compulsion to teach".

Hewitt's first imposture began in 1945 when he selected a famous name from a list of university teachers and used it to apply for a position of an aerodynamic engineer. However, the name was too recognizable and he was soon exposed.

The next identity Hewitt adopted was that of [[Julius Ashkin]], a physics professor. He applied and was accepted first into a pharmacological college in [[Philadelphia]] and the next year into teacher's college in [[Minnesota]]. When he began to gain academic fame, the real Ashkin wrote him to suggest that he stop.

Hewitt proceeded to adopt the persona of Georg Hewitt, former chief researcher of [[Radio Corporation of America]]. When he was found out, he switched to that of philosophy professor Clifford Berry.

In 1954, Hewitt was on his fifth teaching job as Dr. Kenneth Yates, an associate professor of physics at the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They had only removed him from the [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] and the university authorities had decided to let him leave quietly when the details leaked out.

The president of the university, Dr. Robert F. Chandler, had described Hewitt as good physicist with talent for teaching. Officially he was not fired for incompetence but because he had misrepresented his qualifications. He received support from previous and current colleagues who showered praises on him. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[British Admiralty]] approached him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Since approximately that time, there have been no reports of any further exploits by Hewitt in the media.

[[File:Elevationvanda.jpg|thumb|Machine for the fireworks for the peace of Aix la Chapelle in May 1749 performed in Green Park; structure designed by Franco-Italian architect [[Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni]]]]
The '''''Music for the Royal Fireworks''''' ([[HWV]] 351) is a [[Suite (music)|suite]] for wind instruments composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1749 under contract of [[George II of Great Britain]] for the fireworks in London's [[Green Park]] on 27 April 1749. It was to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] (Aachen) in 1748.

== Rehearsal and final production ==
During the preparations Handel and the [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|Duke of Montagu]], the [[Master General of the Ordnance]] and the officer responsible for the Royal Fireworks, had an argument about adding violins. The duke made clear to Handel that King George had a preference for only martial instruments and drums, and hoped there would be "no fiddles". Handel omitted the string instruments against his will. Also against Handel's will, there was a full rehearsal of the music in [[Vauxhall Gardens]] and not in Green Park. On 21 April 1749 an audience, claimed to be over twelve thousand people, each paying two [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s and six [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] ([[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]]) rushed to get there, causing a three-hour traffic jam of carriages on [[London Bridge]], the only vehicular route to the area south of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=David |date= |title=The Lives of George Frideric Handel |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uwc3CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Royal+Fireworks+%22no+fiddles%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdr4zh3e3XAhVsKsAKHfABCB4Q6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Royal%20Fireworks%20%22no%20fiddles%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |page=85 |isbn=978-1783270613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days later, on 27 April, the performing musicians were in a specially constructed building that had been designed by [[Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni|Servandoni]], a theatre designer, who used four Italians to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Simon (1985) Handel, a celebration of his life and times, 1685–1759, p. 212.  National Portrait Gallery (Great Britain).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Casali]] and [[Andrea Soldi]] designed the decorations. The fireworks themselves were devised and controlled by [[Gaetano Ruggieri]] and [[Giuseppe Sarti]], both from [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=Hogwood&gt;"The Ruggieri family represents one of the longest surviving dynasties in the pyrotechnical trade; they later fired the celebrations for the French Revolution and were still around to supervise the display in New York Harbour when the Statue of Liberty was rededicated in 1986."

Also, a woman's clothes were set on alight by a stray rocket and other fireworks burned two soldiers and blinded a third. Yet another soldier had blown his hand off during an earlier rehearsal for the 101 cannons which were used during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londonist.com/2013/03/fire-and-18th-century-traffic-jams-handel-and-the-royal-fireworks |title=Fire And 18th Century Traffic Jams: Handel And The Royal Fireworks |last=Holdsworth |first=Rachel |date=March 2013 |website=londonist.com |publisher=The Londonist Ltd |access-date=3 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music and instrumentation ==
''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' opens with a [[French overture]] and includes a [[bourrée]] and two [[minuet]]s.

The work is in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:

{{Listen|type=music

|title       = 1. Overture

}}

A [[siciliana]] movement was popular in [[baroque music]].

It was scored for a large wind band ensemble consisting of 24 [[oboe]]s, 12 [[bassoon]]s and a [[contrabassoon]], nine [[natural trumpet]]s, nine [[natural horn]]s, three pairs of [[kettledrum]]s, and side drums which were given only the direction to play ''[[ad libitum]]''; no side drum parts were written by Handel.  Handel was specific about the numbers of instruments to each written part.  In the overture there are assigned three players to each of the three trumpet parts; the 24 oboes are divided 12, 8 and 4; and the 12 bassoons are divided 8 and 4.  The side drums were instructed when to play in ''La Réjouissance'' and the second ''Menuet'', but very likely also played in the ''Ouverture''.

Handel re-scored the suite for full orchestra for a performance on 27 May in the [[Foundling Hospital]]. Handel noted in the score that the violins were to play the oboe parts, the cellos and double basses the bassoon part, and the violas either a lower wind or bass part. The instruments from the original band instrumentation play all the movements in the revised orchestral edition except the ''Bourrée'' and the first ''Menuet'', which are played by the oboes, bassoons, and strings alone.&lt;ref&gt;Preface notes and score Fr. Chrysander, ''Water-Music, Firework-Music, Concertos and Double Concertos for Full Orchestra by George Frederic Handel'', reprinted 1965, Gregg Press Inc., New Jersey, U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recordings ==
There are many recordings. Handel's ''[[Water Music]]'', although it was composed more than thirty years earlier, is often paired with the ''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' as both were written for outdoor performance. Together, these works constitute Handel's most famous music for what we would now consider the orchestra. Older recordings tend to use arrangements of Handel's score for the modern orchestra, for example, the arrangements by [[Hamilton Harty]] and [[Leopold Stokowski]]. More recent recordings tend to use more [[historically informed performance]] methods appropriate for [[baroque music]] and often use authentic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gfhandel.org/reviews/waterfireglossa.htm | title=Le Concert Spirituel (on period instruments) | last=Vickers | first=David | date=June 2003 | website=Music for the Royal Fireworks | publisher=gfhandel.org | accessdate=20 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421081719/http://gfhandel.org/reviews/waterfireglossa.htm | archivedate=21 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also arrangements for pipe organ, alone or with brass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes | title=Handel-Biggs: Firework Music (Suite from the Music for the Royal Fireworks) for Organ Solo (with Pipe Organ Registrations) | year=1944 | first=E.

The '''Ohio Renaissance Festival''' is an annual event that takes place on weekends from late August through October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=David|title=Day Trips from Cincinnati: Getaways Less than Two Hours Away|date=2003|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=0762727497|pages=256|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Renaissance festival]] is held at a permanent site located near [[Harveysburg, Ohio|Harveysburg]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. It was voted Best Festival in Warren County in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kochersperger|first1=Bridget|title=Fall Festivals in Warren County Draw a Crowd with Apple Pies, Sauerkraut and Turkey Legs|url=http://www.ohioslargestplayground.com/about/media-pr/warren-county-news/fall-festivals-draw-crowds|website=Ohio's Largest Playground|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ohio Renaissance Festival first opened its gates in 1990 in between [[Harveysburg, Ohio]] and [[I-71]]. Over the 25 years the site has been opened, it has grown into a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} permanent village with over 100 shops and 12 outdoor stages. 
The festival is set in the fictional 16th-century English village of '''"Willy Nilly-on-the-Wash,"''' during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]], [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Sir John Hawkins]] and [[John Dee]] are a few historical figures that reside in Willy Nilly, along with some not so historical but very much entertaining residents. The festival features costumed performers on stages and in the streets, craft shops selling and demonstrating period themed handcrafted goods and artwork, renaissance themed food, and regularly scheduled comedy, music, and acrobatic shows. Featured shows include Theatre in the Ground, [[jousting]] with the Knights of Valour and Shane Adams (the host of Full Metal Jousting -an American reality television jousting themed show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bourdeau|first1=Annette|title='Full Metal Jousting' Host Shane Adams: 'It's The Next Extreme Sport'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/04/full-metal-jousting-host-shane-adams-interview_n_1403449.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) DaVinci Bros. Comedy Opera, Dirk and Guido: The Swordsmen! and the Kamikaze Fireflies (the duo that were featured on America's Got Talent).

The performing cast including the Queen and her entourage along with representatives from each festival shop make a parade circuit through the fairgrounds once a day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Oraşul de Floci''', also ''Cetatea de Floci'' or ''Târgul de Floci'' is a lost city of [[Wallachia]], now in [[Romania]].

The city was located at the confluence of [[Ialomiţa River]] and the [[Danube]], on the old riverbed of the Ialomiţa. The name meant "The [[Wool|Fleece]] City" in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], as it was an important [[market town]]. The city is first mentioned in 1431 during the rule of [[Dan II of Wallachia]], but probably existed as trading post in the previous century.

It was set on fire by [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] during the wars with Wallachia under the rule of [[Radu The Beautiful]] (who was an ally of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The city recovered quickly, but it was once again destroyed by the [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Tatars|Tatar]] troops of [[Simion Movilă]].

[[Michael the Brave]], the famous Prince of [[Wallachia]], was presumably born in this city

The city finally decayed due to the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]], when most inhabitants fled due to the fighting. In the place of the city was formed the village [[Piua-Petrii]], which was destroyed, in turn, during the floods of early 20th century. Currently, the ruins of the city are located in the territory of the [[Giurgeni]] commune.

The '''Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival''' is a [[Renaissance fair]] located in [[West Newton, Pennsylvania]]. As of 2011, the fair is in its 17th season. In 2005 the fair had 55,000 attendees.&lt;ref name="abrupt" /&gt; The faire covers {{convert|20|acre|m2}} and, as of 2008, contained six stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Diana |title=Experience the Renaissance|url=http://thetartan.org/2008/9/8/pillbox/renfest|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Tartan]]|date=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The setting for the fair is a village called Morelandshire, sometime between 1533 and 1536.&lt;ref name="rebirth" /&gt;

== History ==
The fair was founded in 1994, and held for three seasons at the Butler County Fairgrounds, while the organizers searched for a suitable property.  The present site, an abandoned farm which had subsequently been strip mined and landscaped, was selected for its ideal location and setting, and first hosted the fair in the summer of 1997.&lt;ref name="abrupt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zemba|first=Liz|title=Organizers put abrupt end to Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_460373.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=TRIBUNE-REVIEW|date=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the fair was canceled due to lack of financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor attendance forces cancellation of renaissance festival|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06184/703051-42.stm|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later, the fair was purchased by Rocky Mountain Festivals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCaffrey|first=Kate |title=Stage Preview: Medieval merriment makes a comeback in West Newton  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07235/811278-325.stm|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reopened under the direction of the company's CEO.&lt;ref name="rebirth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Alice T. |title=Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival gets rebirth|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/news/s_524961.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Tribune-Review|date=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2011, [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] confirmed that [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] [[Death of Osama bin Laden|had been killed]] in [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|his compound]] in [[Abbottabad]], northeastern Pakistan. Bin Laden's death was welcomed throughout most  of the world as a fitting end to a figure who had inspired mass bloodshed, and a positive and significant turning point in the fight against [[al-Qaeda]] and related groups. Those who welcomed it included the [[United Nations]], [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and some nations in Asia, Africa, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East, including [[Yemen]], [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Indonesia]], [[Somalia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], and the rebel [[National Transitional Council|Libyan Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0B4t5TOkA9TulK0IK4JYjRG8UqA?docId=CNG.f6de33d85ff1350769dec913bc2a4047.01|title=Death of Bin Laden: Live report|last=|first=|date=May 2, 2011|work=|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131013904/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0B4t5TOkA9TulK0IK4JYjRG8UqA?docId=CNG.f6de33d85ff1350769dec913bc2a4047.01|archive-date=January 31, 2013|dead-url=yes|publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|arxiv=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His killing was condemned, however, by the [[Hamas]] administration of the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]],&lt;ref name="WSJ_SB10001424052748704569404576298362912711604"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704569404576298362912711604 | title = World Cheers Bin Laden Killing, Prepares for Strikes | last = MacDonald | first = Alistair | last2 = Bradley | first2 = Matt | date = May 2, 2011 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = May 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taliban]]. [[Iran]] and the Muslim Brotherhood opined that bin Laden's death removed "the last excuse" for western forces to remain in the Middle East, and urged their withdrawal. The monitoring of Jihadist websites after bin Laden's death, by intelligence agency [[SITE Institute|SITE]], revealed encouragement of attacks in retaliation for his killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Osama+Laden+followers+strike+Canada/4713814/story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506151349/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Osama+Laden+followers+strike+Canada/4713814/story.html|archivedate=2011-05-06|title=Osama bin Laden's followers may strike in Canada|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the raid, the Pakistani government lashed out at the U.S., saying that the United States had taken "an unauthorized unilateral action" that would not be tolerated in the future. The foreign ministry further said, "Such an event shall not serve as a future precedent for any state, including the United States."&lt;ref name="NYT20110503"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/world/asia/04pakistan.html|title=Pakistan Pushes Back Against U.S. Criticism on Bin Laden|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)|JUI-F]] deputy parliamentary leader Mufti Kifayatullah, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, declared "Osama is a hero..." and that "The great Muslim heroes are being killed here in Pakistan and it is a matter of shame for the Pakistan Army when the foreign forces come and kill people on our soil."&lt;ref name="TN20110503"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=44885&amp;Cat=7&amp;dt=5/4/2011|title=JUI-F shocked over Osama bin Laden's killing|last=Shah|first=Syed Bukhar|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[The News International]]|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign Secretary [[Salman Bashir]] said, "Any other country that would ever act on assumption that it has the right to unilateralism of any sort will find as far as Pak is concerned that it has made a basic mistake".&lt;ref name="NDTV"/&gt; He further stated that Pakistani military had scrambled [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.&lt;ref name="wsj20110505"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704810504576305033789955132|title=Pakistan Warns U.S. Against Raids |author1=Wright, Tom |author2=Rosenberg, Matthew | date=May 6, 2011|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}{{verify source|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir also warned the U.S. and India against any such [[Operation Neptune Spear|covert operations]] in the future, saying this would lead to a "terrible catastrophe".&lt;ref name="NDTV"&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | date = May 5, 2011 | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/pakistan-slams-us-for-unilateral-action-warns-india-too-103614|title=Pakistan Slams U.S. for Unilateral Action, Warns India Too|publisher=[[NDTV]] | accessdate = August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/159157/pakistan-warns-us-india-against.html |title= Pakistan Warns US, India Against Covert Operations| agency  = [[Indo-Asian News Service]] | work = [[Deccan Herald]] |date= May 5, 2011 |accessdate= August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockinvestips.com/2011/05/pakistan-warns-india-us-against.html "Pakistan Warns India, Us Against Invading Its Territory And Further Raids"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519023943/http://www.stockinvestips.com/2011/05/pakistan-warns-india-us-against.html |date=2011-05-19 }}.

Former [[President of Pakistan|Pakistani President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] criticized the operation, saying, "America coming to our territory and taking action is a violation of our sovereignty, handling and execution of the operation [by U.S. forces] is not correct. The Pakistani government should have been kept in the loop."&lt;ref name="Guard20110502"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-awkward-questions|title=Osama Bin Laden: Dead, But How Did He Hide So Long?|date=May 2, 2011|work= [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 2, 2011|author1=MacAskill, Ewen |author2=Walsh, Declan |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[Lahore Press Club]], former Foreign Minister [[Shah Mehmood Qureshi]] criticised the government and openly demanded an explanation from top officials regarding the incident. He also called for President Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani to resign.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/163842/zardari-and-gilani-should-resign-qureshi/|title=Zardari and Gilani Should Resign: Qureshi|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terming the American raid as "unprovoked aggression", Qureshi added that instead of addressing the nation during the crisis, Zardari instead chose to write an opinion piece in a foreign newspaper.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;

Cricketer-turned-politician [[Imran Khan]] said Pakistan had "lost its dignity and self-esteem" in the wake of the Osama operation and lashed out at the government and the intelligence. "The big questions that everyone began asking, and for which no answers have been forthcoming, were: who allowed the Americans to come to Pakistan and carry out this attack? And whatever happened to the [[Pakistani Army]] and its intelligence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-04/news/29509012_1_pakistani-army-prime-minister-gilani-pakistan-government |title=Pakistan Has Lost Dignity, Self-Esteem Following US' Osama Operation: Imran Khan |work=Economic Times |date=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403025839/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-04/news/29509012_1_pakistani-army-prime-minister-gilani-pakistan-government |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement by [[Pakistan Air Force]] Chief Marshal [[Rao Qamar Suleman]], there had been an air-surveillance failure. Qamar covered the inquiry by saying that the air space was unable to detect the American helicopters because the [[radar]] installed on the western borders were inactive on the day of the incident. The U.S. helicopters also reportedly used radar-evading measures, such as [[stealth technology]], to avoid detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news704752.html|title=Pak Radars Were Inactive During Osama Raid| publisher = [[Zee News]]|date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/secret-radarevading-stealth-helicopters-used-in-commando-raid-20110506-1ec07.html|title=Secret Radar-Evading Stealth Helicopters Used in Commando Raid|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public===

* [[Amnesty International]] had concerns about the nature and circumstances surrounding Osama bin Laden's death. "We are seeking information from the US and Pakistani authorities about how many people were in the compound at the time of the operation, what happened to them and specifically what is the status and current whereabouts of the survivors," said [[Claudio Cordone]], Senior Director at Amnesty International. Since he was unarmed, they raised concerns that there was no attempt to capture him alive. While condemning bin Laden for [[crimes against humanity]], Amnesty International stressed the importance of doing so in compliance with international law.
:* Pakistani and U.S. officials responded, saying there were 18 people in the compound. They report that five people were killed, and two women wounded, both of whom were left with at least six children, at the compound.

But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an [[crime against international law|international crime]], because, like it or not, that's how it works."

[[George Will]] suggested that America could use bin Laden's death to "draw a deep breath and some pertinent conclusions", among them that "bin Laden was brought down by intelligence gathering that more resembles excellent police work than a military operation." He added, "There remains much more to al-Qaeda than bin Laden, and there are many more tentacles to the terrorism threat than al-Qaeda and its affiliates. So 'the long war' must go on. But perhaps such language is bewitching our minds, because this is not essentially war."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will|Will, George]] (May 3, 2011).

'''Joseph Lorenzo Lionel Boileau''' (May 18, 1904 &amp;ndash; June 9, 1969), known as '''René Boileau''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] player who played seven games in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[New York Americans]] and five seasons in various minor-professional leagues.  As a publicity stunt, the Americans billed Boileau, a [[French Canadian]], as "the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] in the NHL" and claimed his name was Rainy Drinkwater. René is the father of the former NHL hockey player, [[Marc Boileau]].

==Playing career==
Boileau, a {{convert|150|lb|abbr=on}} native of [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]], played his only season in the NHL in [[1925–26 NHL season|1925–26]].&lt;ref name="THN"&gt;{{citation |last=Goodhand |first=Glen |year=2005 |title=The Lighter Side of Hockey |periodical=The Hockey News |issn=0018-3016 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining the Americans, he played three seasons of amateur hockey in Montreal.&lt;ref name="LOH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12027 |title=Rene Boileau player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans manager Tommy Duggan was anxious to promote the first-year Americans and upon signing Boileau used him as part of a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="THN" /&gt; The Americans official announcement on the signing promoted Boileau under the pseudonym "Rainy Drinkwater" and announced that the French-Canadian player was instead from the Caughnawaga Indian Reservation, and the first Native American to play in the NHL.&lt;ref name="LOH" /&gt; The Canadian press took note of the promotion; former ''[[Toronto Star]]'' sports editor Milt Dunnell said that "He received more ink than [[Sitting Bull]]".&lt;ref name="THN" /&gt; He played only seven games with the Americans, scoring no points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/b/boilere01.html |title=Rene Boileau career statistics |publisher=Hockey-Reference |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boileau spent the next five seasons playing professional hockey with the [[Niagara Falls Cataracts]] of the  [[Canadian Professional Hockey League]], [[New Haven Eagles]] of the [[Canadian American Hockey League]] and [[St. Louis Flyers]] of the [[American Hockey Association (1926–1942)|American Hockey Association]].   He then played two seasons of semi-professional hockey in Quebec teams before retiring in 1934.&lt;ref name="LOH" /&gt;  His son, [[Marc Boileau|Marc]], played and coached in the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12026 |title=Marc Boileau player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Lirico''' (known until 1894 as the '''Teatro alla Canobbiana''') is a theatre in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was particularly notable for [[opera]] performances, including the world premieres of  [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' and [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]]'s ''[[Fedora (Giordano)|Fedora]]''. The theatre, located on Via Rastrelli, closed in 1998. However, a restoration project was begun in April 2007, and it was due to re-open in 2009 as the Teatro Lirico [[Giorgio Gaber]].

==History==
[[File:Milano, Teatro Lirico, interno 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Teatro Lirico in 1938, after the restoration of [[Antonio Cassi Ramelli]]]]
The Court Theatre of the Ducal Palace in Milan was destroyed by fire on February 26, 1776. With the city deprived of its only theatre, [[Giuseppe Piermarini]] was commissioned to design and build two new theatres on land surrounding the Palace. The church of Santa Maria della Scala was demolished to build the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]]. A second theatre was built nearby, on the site of the Scuole Cannobiane and was called the Teatro alla Canobbiana. The Teatro alla Scala was intended for the more aristocratic audiences, while the Cannobiana was considered the theater for the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilmirino.it/2014/11/18/vecchio-teatro-cannobiana/ Il Mirino] article on the Teatro Cannobiana, 18 novembre 2014 – by Carlo Radollovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inaugurated on August 21, 1779 (a little more than year after the opening of La Scala) with an [[opera buffa]] and [[ballet]] by [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]]. Like La Scala and many Italian opera houses of the time, it was built in a horseshoe shape, surmounted by a [[cupola]], with four tiers of boxes and a gallery (or ''loggione''). For nearly a century it was Milan's second opera house.

By the 1880s, with the increasing lack of public funds and fewer and fewer private subscriptions, the Teatro alla Canobbiana had fallen on hard times. In 1894, it was taken over by [[Edoardo Sonzogno]] and renamed the Teatro Lirico Internazionale, although it is normally referred to in Milan simply as the Teatro Lirico. The theatre continued to be used for opera, ballet, and plays into the 20th century, but was taken over by the city of Milan in 1926, after which  it was increasingly used for public assemblies. It was in the Teatro Lirico that [[Benito Mussolini]] made one of his first public speeches in 1921 and his last public speech and radio broadcast in 1944.  The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1938, but was repaired in time to host the 1943 season for [[La Scala]] after its own theatre had been largely destroyed by the American aerial bombardment of Milan during [[World War II]].

Theatrical performances, and public meetings resumed after the War, and for a period in the 1960s, the Teatro Lirico was the home of [[Giorgio Strehler]]'s [[Piccolo Teatro di Milano]]. In 1998, facing financial difficulties, Milan could no longer afford to run the theatre, and in the absence of outside funding, it was closed.

In April 2007, after several false starts, work was begun to renovate and modernise the theatre while keeping the Piermarini facade and the basic design of the original interior. When it re-opens, it will be called the Teatro Lirico [[Giorgio Gaber]] in honour of the Milanese singer, songwriter, actor and playwright who had frequently performed at the Teatro Lirico from the early 1960s until its closure in 1998. The renovated theatre will also house the archives of the Fondazione Giorgio Gaber.

'''''The Barbarian and the Geisha''''' (working titles '''''The Townsend Harris Story''''' and '''''The Barbarian''''') is a 1958 American [[Biography|biographical]] film [[drama]] in [[CinemaScope]] and [[DeLuxe Color]] from [[20th Century Fox]]. It was produced by [[Eugene Frenke]], directed by [[John Huston]], and stars [[John Wayne]], [[Sam Jaffe]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] actress [[Eiko Ando]]. The film was shot primarily on location in Japan.

Townsend Harris is appointed the first [[Consul General]] to Japan. Upon his arrival, Harris discovers that the Japanese thoroughly mistrust all foreigners, despite a two-year old treaty between Japan and the United States. Harris slowly earns the respect of the local governor and trust of the local townsfolk and is eventually granted an audience with Japan's military dictator, the [[Shōgun]]. 

==Plot==
In 1856, [[Townsend Harris]] ([[John Wayne]]) is sent by President [[Franklin Pierce]] to serve as the first U.S. Consul General to Japan, following the treaty written by [[Commodore Matthew Perry]] two years before. Accompanied only by his translator-secretary, Huesken (Jaffe), Townsend comes ashore at the town of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda prefecture]], as specified in the treaty as the location for an American consulate.

However, the Japanese governor ([[Sō Yamamura]]) refuses to accept his credentials, denying him any official status, due to a conflict between interpretations of the treaty terms. While Harris believes that the Consul shall be present whenever either country requires, the Japanese believe the terms to permit a consul only when both countries require. The governor holds to his interpretation, largely because of objections over the threats under which the treaty was forced upon them. Harris is permitted to remain in Shimoda, but only as a private citizen, with no recognition of his official status. He is provided the use of an abandoned home, adjacent to the town cemetery.

The governor explains that, in the two years following Perry's visit, various natural disasters had taken place. Some Japanese believed them to be warnings from the gods to avoid foreign influences.  In the weeks that follow, Harris is the target of distrust and hostility, to the extent that Tamura orders townspeople to not even sell him food. Some in Japan wanted the country opened, but many others feared the corruption of foreign influences, and invasion by the barbarians of other lands. For this reason, Harris is not permitted to leave Shimoda, nor to go any closer to the capitol in [[Edo]], 100 miles away.

For his own part, Harris does his best to cooperate with the Governor, even obeying orders to take down the American flag which had been raised to mark the location of the Consulate. His cooperation noted, after several months, Harris is eventually invited to dine with the Governor, a dinner following which Tamura sends a [[geisha]] named Okichi ([[Eiko Ando]]) to take care of Harris' needs.

The relationship between Harris and Okichi grows closer and more intimate, and she helps him understand Japanese culture.

Harris makes a number of blunders, one of which leads to a [[cholera]] epidemic and the destruction of the town. However, out of this disaster comes Harris' opportunity to go to Edo, where he must then convince the [[Shogunate]] to open the country, while facing his greatest crisis.

==Production==
Director [[Anthony Mann]] initially owned the story but he sold the rights to [[20th Century Fox]] after being unable to sign a big star to play the lead.

Exteriors were shot on location in Japan at [[Kyoto]] and the [[Tōdai-ji]] shrine in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Interiors and additional scenes were completed at [[Toho|Toho Studios]] in [[Tokyo]] and  20th Century Fox Studios, [[Los Angeles]]. During filming, Wayne and director John Huston did not get along; in one altercation, Wayne throttled and punched Huston on set.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S6XlR9_emRQC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;lpg=PA437&amp;dq=john+wayne+john+huston&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cQA4A9YGn_&amp;sig=Vk_dxkFgSNLRwB_RSBSRlyozPBI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PAzBUbCIO4fX0QWy2IGYDA&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wayne%20john%20huston&amp;f=false John Wayne:American (biography) p.436-437]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanuellevy.com/comment/barbarian-and-the-geisha-john-wayne-on-john-huston-9/ Emanuel Levy, comment on Barbarian and the Geisha: John Wayne on John Huston]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was heavily re-edited by 20th Century Fox before release. Director John Huston denounced this version and even wanted to have his name removed from the credits.&lt;ref&gt;The Innocent Bystander
Robinson, David. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 42, Iss. 1, &lt;/ref&gt; Huston had wanted to make a particularly [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] in terms of photography, pacing, color and narration but according to him only a few edits – representing his vision – were left intact in the theatrical version.

==Reception==
The film performed disappointingly at the box office. Despite Huston's anger at studio interference, the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bosley Crowther liked the film's cinematography calling it a "whole picture out of patience and pageantry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9401E4DD1E39E632A25750C0A9669D946992D6CF|title=The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958)|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=October 3, 1958|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blu-ray.com's Casey Broadwater observed this about the film: "Wayne's restrained and uncomfortable "other-ness" as a [[gaijin]] in Japan is essential to the story. With his cowboy swagger and deep commanding drawl, Wayne typifies every Japanese stereotype about brash, take-charge Americans, and ''Barbarian''{{'}}s specific [[frisson]] comes from seeing his character stumped and stymied by a culture that values group-think over individualism".

==Historical background==
[[File:Shimoda 1856.jpg|thumb|right|Lithograph of "Shimoda as seen from the American Grave Yard" looking towards the harbor – artist, [[Wilhelm Heine]] (1856).]]
The film is based on American diplomat [[Townsend Harris]] and his time in Japan during the [[Edo period|final years]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. President [[Franklin Pierce]] named Harris the first [[Consul (representative)|Consul General]] to the Empire of Japan in July 1856. He opened the first U.S. Consulate at the [[Gyokusen-ji Temple]] in the city of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. This consolidated the mission by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Perry]] who established the first trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgj.org/150th/html/nyepiE2a.htm "Townsend Harris: America's First Consul to Japan" – biography by the Consulate General of Japan in New York] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312182849/http://www.cgj.org/150th/html/nyepiE2a.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/Annual-Shimoda-Visit-2006.cfm Japanese Delegation Visits CCNY July 24 2006 to honor founder Townsend Harris: Visit Coincides With 150th Anniversary of Harris' Appointment as First U.S. Consul to Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; Harris left Japan in 1861.

In Harris' time, Japan was living through the final years of its period when the country remained in [[Sakoku|international isolation]] and adhered to strict [[Edo society|customs and regulations]] intended to promote stability. In 1868, just seven years after Harris' departure, the [[Meiji Restoration]] started Japan's emergence as a modernized nation in the early twentieth century through massive industrialization, and enormous reforms to its political and social structure.

{{anchor|Okichi}} The film incorporates the enduring Japanese legend about Harris and a 17-year-old [[geisha]] named {{nihongo|Okichi|お吉|}}. The story says she was pressured by Japanese authorities into forming a relationship with Harris in order to make the trade meetings go more smoothly. However, after Harris departed Japan to return to America, she was insultingly called the "Barbarian Okichi" and was ostracized by her people; as a result, she began drinking and eventually committed suicide in 1892.&lt;ref name="okichi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.doshisha.ac.jp/kkitao/Japan/shimoda/s1.htm|title=History and Legend in Shimoda, Japan|author=Kitao, S.

The [[wiktionary:biennial|biennial]]  '''USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival''' is a free [[science festival]] held in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The festival is the largest celebration of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) disciplines in the United States. Serial Entrepreneur [[Larry Bock]] and senior directors of the [[Lockheed Martin]] Corporation founded the festival.

The inaugural event was held from October 10, 2010, through October 24, 2010, the second festival was April 27–29, 2012 (attended by a quarter million visitors), and the third festival (attended by over 325,000 visitors) was April 24–27, 2014. The third festival featured the first X-STEM Symposium on April 24, 2014, with interactive presentations and workshops. The fourth festival was held on April 16-17, 2016. The fifth festival was held on April 7-8, 2018. Celebrating a decade of STEM, the sixth festival will return on April 25-26, 2020. The theme for the upcoming event is "the Vision for STEM". 

The second X-STEM Symposium was held as a stand-alone event on April 2015 and continues on an annual basis. X-STEM features interactive presentations by an exclusive group of visionaries aimed to inspire kids to pursue careers in STEM. X-STEM is open to students in grades 6-12. The next event will take place on March 19, 2019, in Washington, DC. The Festival organizers are seeking to make X-STEM a national program with events across the country.

'''Veterans Day''' (originally known as '''Armistice Day''') is an official [[Public holidays in the United States|United States public holiday]] observed annually on November 11, honoring [[Veteran|military veterans]], that is, persons who have served in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. It coincides with other holidays including [[Armistice Day]] and [[Remembrance Day]] which are celebrated in other countries that mark the anniversary of the end of [[World War I]]. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the [[Armistice with Germany]] went into effect. At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

Veterans Day is distinct from [[Memorial Day]], a U.S. public holiday in May. Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans, while Memorial Day honors those who ''died'' while in military service.&lt;ref name="kelber"&gt;{{cite news| title=Today is not Veterans Day| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/parenting/homefront/bal-memorial-day-vs-veterans-day-20120528,0,1402423.story| date=May 28, 2012| last=Kelber| first=Sarah Kickler| work=[[Baltimore Sun]]| accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another military holiday, [[Armed Forces Day#United States|Armed Forces Day]], a minor U.S. remembrance that also occurs in May, which honors those ''currently serving'' in the U.S. military.

==History==
On November 11, 1919, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;ADDRESS TO FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN 
The White House, November 11, 1919. 

A year ago today our enemies laid down their arms in accordance with an armistice which rendered them impotent to renew hostilities, and gave to the world an assured opportunity to reconstruct its shattered order and to work out in peace a new and juster set of international relations. The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured for more than four years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something more than a year and a half.

With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we remodeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought. 

Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men. 

To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations. 

WOODROW WILSON&lt;ref name = cmh&gt;{{cite web| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WYg_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8803&amp;lpg=PA8803&amp;dq=%22a+year+ago+today+our+enemies+laid+down+their+arms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SAyvxEs4yr&amp;sig=tkkBHzQnk_V0Cnessu7W0Xyl6Ag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMIrYvdjcOJyQIViHgmCh1ytwxt#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20year%20ago%20today%20our%20enemies%20laid%20down%20their%20arms%22&amp;f=false| title = Supplement to the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: Covering the Second Term of Woodrow Wilson, March 4, 1917, to March 4, 1921 | date = 11 November 2015| publisher = Bureau of National Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President [[Calvin Coolidge]] issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.&lt;ref name = cmh/&gt; A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: "a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Day History|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp|publisher=Veteran's Affairs|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veterans Day parade in Baltimore, 2016.jpg|thumb|Veterans Day parade in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], 2016]]
In 1945, [[World War II]] veteran Raymond Weeks from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in [[World War I]]. Weeks led a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first national celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at the White House with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the "Father of Veterans Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://unrememberedhistory.com/2016/11/11/raymond-weeks-the-father-of-veterans-day/ | title=Raymond Weeks: The Father of Veterans Day | publisher=Unremembered History | first=Ken | last=Zurski | date=November 11, 2016 | accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Edward Herbert Rees|Ed Rees]] from [[Emporia, Kansas]], presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], also from Kansas, signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954. It had been eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Julie |title=Where Veterans Day began |journal=VFW Magazine |date=November 2003 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LIY/is_3_91/ai_110734282 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714045910/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LIY/is_3_91/ai_110734282 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |publisher=Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing "Armistice" with "Veterans," and it has been known as Veterans Day since.&lt;ref name=VAhistory&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=November 6, 2008 |url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp |title=History of Veterans Day |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |date=November 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728130527/http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp |archive-date=July 28, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/reference/holidays/vetsday/vetshist.html |title=The History of Veterans Day |publisher=United States Army Center of Military History (CMH) |date=October 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama, for his support offering legislation to make Veterans Day a federal holiday.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]], Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (October 25, 1971; October 23, 1972; October 22, 1973; October 28, 1974; October 27, 1975; October 25, 1976, and October 24, 1977). In 1978, it was moved back to its original celebration on November 11. While the legal holiday remains on November 11, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then organizations that formally observe the holiday will normally be closed on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Observance==
[[File:Veterans Day poster 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for Veterans Day 2018, the 100th anniversary of the [[Armistice Day|end]] of [[World War I]]]]
Because it is a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]], some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employee can choose some other day. A [[Society for Human Resource Management]] poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 Holiday Schedules SHRM Poll |author=Society for Human Resource Management |date=November 4, 2010 |url= http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Articles/Pages/2011HolidaySchedules.aspx |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101204201227/http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Articles/Pages/2011HolidaySchedules.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-date= December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-essential federal government offices are closed. No mail is delivered. All federal workers are paid for the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive holiday pay for that day in addition to their wages.

In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: "Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness," he remarked.&lt;ref name="Smith 2007 290"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Oxford companion to American food and drink |last= Smith|first= Andrew F.|year= 2007|publisher= Oxford University Press, Inc|location= New York|isbn= 0-19-530796-8|page= 290|url= https://books.google.com/?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PT317&amp;lpg=PT317&amp;dq=armistice+day#v=onepage&amp;q=armistice%20day&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Veterans Day and the birthday of the [[United States Marine Corps]] (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period.

[[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] is a regular working day, while Veterans Day, which typically falls the following week, is a federal holiday. The [[National Commission on Federal Election Reform]] called for the holidays to be merged, so citizens can have a day off to vote. They state this as a way to honor voting by exercising democratic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutter|first1=John D.|title=Election Day should be a federal holiday|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/opinion/ctl-election-holiday/|accessdate=October 20, 2016|work=CNN|date=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spelling of Veterans Day===
While the holiday is commonly printed as ''Veteran's Day'' or ''Veterans' Day'' in calendars and advertisements (spellings that are grammatically acceptable), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the [[attributive noun|attributive]] (no apostrophe) rather than the [[possessive case]] is the official spelling "because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp Veterans Day Frequently Asked Questions], Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

'''Zenga Zenga''' is an [[Auto-Tune|auto-tuned]] song and [[Viral video|viral]] [[YouTube]] video that parodied the Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. The song, released on February 22, 2011, quickly became popular among the [[Anti-Gaddafi forces|Libyan opposition]] active in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]].

The song was created by [[Noy Alooshe]], an [[Israelis|Israeli]] journalist and musician. The original video has more than 4 million views and the edited "clean" version has surpassed 1 million hits.

==Background==
[[File:Muammar al-Gaddafi at the AU summit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi]]
On February 22, 2011, Gaddafi gave a televised speech amidst violent [[social unrest]] against his government. In the speech (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), Gaddafi vowed to hunt down rebel fighters "inch by inch, house by house, home by home, ''alleyway by alleyway'' [Arabic: زنقة زنقة prounouced in Libyan dialect as ''Zenga Zenga''], person by person."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Qaddafi YouTube Spoof by Israeli Gets Arab Fans |author=Isabel Kershner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/world/middleeast/28youtube.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 February 2011 |page=A10 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Israeli journalist and musician, Noy Alooshe, was watching the speech and saw Gaddafi's strange dress and gesticulations as something out of a [[Trance music|trance]] party. Using the natural beat of Gaddafi's words, Alooshe spent a few hours at his computer and using [[Auto-Tune]] technology set the speech to the music of "[[Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)|Hey Baby]]," a song by American rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] featuring another American rap artist, [[T-Pain]]. The original video features clips from Gaddafi's speech alongside mirror images of a scantily clad woman dancing.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Alooshe titled the new song "Zenga Zenga," based on Gaddafi's repetition in his speech of the word ''zanqa'', Arabic for [[alley]]way in the Libyan dialect. American comedian [[Conan O'Brien]] ostensibly first popularized the transformation of ''zanqa'' into "zenga zenga" and Alooshe named the clip accordingly.&lt;ref name="mfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/IsraelExperience/Israeli_behind_Zenga_Zenga_2-Mar-2011.htm |title=The Israeli behind ‘Zenga Zenga' |author=Avigayil Kadesh |date=2 March 2011|publisher=[[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early Wednesday morning in [[Israel]], Alooshe had uploaded the "electro hip hop remix" to YouTube. By Sunday night, through promotion on [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]], the video had [[Viral video|gone viral]], receiving nearly 500,000 hits.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Reception==
Reactions were largely positive, presumably from members of the Libyan opposition who embraced it for its mockery of Gaddafi. Some also found the video distasteful, not only because it contains a woman provocatively dancing, but also because the creator of the video, Alooshe, is an [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jew]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; At the request of web users who wanted to be able to share the video with their more conservative parents, Alooshe created another version without the clips of the dancer.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

However, Gaddafi and his loyalist supporters apparently co-opted the song for their own purposes. As reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'', at a speech given by Gaddafi's daughter, [[Ayesha Gaddafi]], "Zenga Zenga" blared in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gaddafi's daughter whips supporters into a frenzy with speech in Tripoli |author=Harriet Sherwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/15/gaddafi-daughter-supporters-tripoli |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
