==Etymology==
The word ''Ahimsa''—sometimes spelled as ''Ahinsa''&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0125-ahalyA.jpg Sanskrit dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, E. M. (1924). THE SUPER‐VEGETARIANS. New Blackfriars, 5(50), pages 103–108&lt;/ref&gt;—is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hiṃs'' – to strike; ''hiṃsā'' is injury or harm, ''a-hiṃsā'' is the opposite of this, i.e. ''non harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shukavak N. Dasa"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html A Hindu Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408135457/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html |date=8 April 2011 }}, by [http://www.sanskrit.org/www/shukavak.htm Shukavak N.

Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. It is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of ''Ahimsa'', the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0-12-373985-8}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701–849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapple1990&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Nonviolence to animals, earth and self in Asian Traditions (see Chapter 1). State University of New York Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsvanatha]], the twenty-third ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism, revived,  advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Parshvanatha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Parshvanatha |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth and the last ''tirthankara'' further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha|Rushabhdev]] over a million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavira |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahavira-Jaina-teacher |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+million&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-beChPTZAhVELI8KHaB5AD0Q6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20million&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

===Ancient Vedic texts===
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C. Eppert &amp; H. Wang (Eds.), Cross cultural studies in curriculum: Eastern thought, educational insights, pages 171–192, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5673-6}}, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izawa, A. (2008). Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-625-5|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055|pages=22–24, 73–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: ''Ahimsa'', ''Satya'', ''Asteya'', ''Brahmacharya'', ''Daya'', ''Arjava'', ''Kshama'', ''Dhriti'', ''Mitahara'' and ''Saucha''.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3). Sarup &amp; Sons; see pages 630–631&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, J. R., &amp; Yogīndra, S. (1850). A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

===The Epics===
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, 
Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, 
Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, 
Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, 
Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

===Self-defence, criminal law, and war===
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K. Klostermaier]] (1996), in Harvey Leonard Dyck and Peter Brock (Ed), The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, see ''Chapter on Himsa and Ahimsa Traditions in Hinduism'', {{ISBN|978-0-8020-0777-3}}, University of Toronto Press, pages 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthashastra]] discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003&gt;Paul F. Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

;Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where human's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human life===
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu texts dated to 1st millennium BC, initially mention meat as food, then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'' (pages 168–177). Springer New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn, G. (2006). Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkural]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. The Kural dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book I]] to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. The Kural says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkural] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

===Modern times===
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.]]

In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Shrimad Rajchandraji]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8P0KAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;dq=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7uC9uMjaAhVLqY8KHU3wAbYQ6AEIPTAF &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swami Vivekananda]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics ([[Swaraj]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 116–124.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent resistance movement [[satyagraha]] had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various [[civil and political rights]] movements such as the American civil rights movement's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[James Bevel]]. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa.&lt;ref name="XXII-XLVII 1986, p. 11-12"&gt;Walli pp. XXII-XLVII; Borman, William: ''Gandhi and Non-Violence'', Albany 1986, p. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, "Divine Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pp. 39–54. Religion East &amp; West. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo]] criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gandhi stated that he viewed "Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; He added, "Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism)."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, "I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (...&amp;nbsp;The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis."&lt;ref name=par&gt;Prabhu and Rao (1966), [http://gandhiashramsevagram.org/pdf-books/mind-of-mahatma-gandhi.pdf The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Encyclopedia of Gandhi's Thoughts, p. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mgarat&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. 1962.

Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture &amp; Mahatma Gandhi Institute. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s principle of "reverence for life". Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for ethics of Ahimsa as, "the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind", but suggested that "not-killing and not-harming" is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert: [https://archive.org/stream/indianthoughtsan027860mbp#page/n95/mode/2up Indian Thought and its Development], London 1956, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of [[Patañjali]]'s eight limb [[Raja yoga]] system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five [[Yamas]] (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

On Âsanas] THE HAṬHA YOGA PRADIPIKA&lt;/ref&gt;
The significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word and deed]] through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
{{See also|Jain vegetarianism}}
[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|right|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolises the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is "Ahimsa". The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|1984|p=171}}
{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}}}

==Buddhism==
&lt;!--"Buddhist devotion#Chanting" is linking here.--&gt;
{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|
These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.
|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

===War===
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal queen/king as a pacifist, such a queen/king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

In the [[Aughts]] she created a net.art piece that simulated a series of imagined art installations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">The '''candle problem''' or '''candle task''', also known as '''Duncker's candle problem''', is a [[cognitive test|cognitive]] [[Performance test (assessment)|performance test]], measuring the influence of [[functional fixedness]] on a participant's [[problem solving]] capabilities. The test was created by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Karl Duncker]]&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html|title=Dan Pink on the surprising science of motivation|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published posthumously in 1945.  Duncker originally presented this test in his thesis on problem-solving tasks at [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name="5th European Conference on e-Learning "&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel Biella and Wolfram Luther|title=5th European Conference on e-Learning |pages=23|chapter=A Synthesis Model for the Replication of Historical Experiments in Virtual Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhS1sd3gEB4C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=the+candle+problem+karl+duncker&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20candle%20problem%20karl%20duncker&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-905305-30-8 | publisher=Academic Conferences Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
The test presents the participant with the following task: how to fix and light a [[candle]] on a wall (a [[cork board]]) in a way so the candle wax won't drip onto the table below.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "&gt;{{cite book|title=Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction Volume 3: Conative and Affective Process Analysis |editor=Richard E. Snow and Marshall J. Farr|chapter=Positive Affect and Organization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNepLHdEhUMC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=duncker+candle+task&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqrF8VXHLB&amp;sig=G0P3JWGkkSvnA9fxmc2_BeRuO0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=69pRS4bcEo-Ytgecy_2mCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=duncker%20candle%20task&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-89859-721-9 | year=1987 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, one may only use the following along with the candle:

*a book of matches
*a box of thumbtacks

==Solution==
[[File:Genimage.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The candle problem]]
The solution is to empty the box of thumbtacks, use the thumbtacks to nail the box to the wall, put the candle into the box,  and light the candle with the match.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; The concept of functional fixedness predicts that the participant will only see the box as a device to hold the thumbtacks and  not immediately perceive it as a separate and functional component available to be used in solving the task.

==Response==
Many of the people who attempted the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods to achieve the goal. For example, some tried to tack the candle to the wall without using the thumbtack box,&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt; and others attempted to melt some of the candle’s wax and use it as an [[adhesive]] to stick the candle to the wall.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; Neither method works.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; However, if the task is presented with the tacks piled ''next'' to the box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown to achieve the optimal solution, which is self defined.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf|title=Against Informational Atomism|last=Frank|first=Michael|accessdate=15 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184646/http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf#|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has been given to numerous people, including [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] students at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] in a study investigating whether living abroad and creativity are linked.&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index.php/Kellogg/article/living_outside_the_box|title=Living Outside the Box: Living abroad boosts creativity |date=April 2009|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glucksberg==
[[Sam Glucksberg|Glucksberg]] (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glucksberg | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1037/h0044683 | title = The influence of strength of drive on functional fixedness and perceptual recognition | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | pages = 36–41 | year = 1962 | pmid =  13899303| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; used a 2 × 2 design manipulating whether the tacks and matches were inside or outside of their boxes and whether subjects were offered cash prizes for completing the task quickly. Subjects who were offered no prize, termed ''low-drive'', were told "We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide which will be the best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve." The remaining subjects, termed ''high-drive'', were told "Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the ''S''s [subjects] in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used." (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in {{inflation-year|US}} dollars would be approximately ${{inflation|US|5|1962}} and ${{inflation|US|20|1962}}, respectively.{{inflation-fn|US}}) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed ''worse'' than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of "neobehavioristic drive theory": "high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy". An explanation in terms of the [[overjustification effect]] is made difficult by the lack of a main effect for drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition.

Another way to explain the higher levels of failure during the high-drive condition is that the process of turning the task into a competition for limited resources can create mild levels of stress in the subject, which can lead to a [[sympathetic nervous system]] response known as [[fight-or-flight]].  This stress response effectively shuts down the creative thinking and problem solving areas of the brain in the [[prefrontal cortex]].

==Linguistic implications==
[[E. Tory Higgins]] and W. M. Chaires found that having subjects repeat the names of common pairs of objects in this test, but in a different and unaccustomed linguistic structure, such as "box ''and'' tacks" instead of "box ''of'' tacks", facilitated performance on the candle problem.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; This phrasing helps one to distinguish the two entities as different and more accessible.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt;
     
In a written version of the task given to people at [[Stanford University]], Michael C. Frank and [[language acquisition]] [[List of language acquisition researchers|researcher]] Michael Ramscar reported that simply underlining certain relevant materials ("''on the table there is a &lt;u&gt;candle&lt;/u&gt;, a &lt;u&gt;box&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;tacks&lt;/u&gt;, and a &lt;u&gt;book&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;matches&lt;/u&gt;''...") increases the number of candle-problem solvers from 25% to 50%.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt;

'''Common knowledge''' is a special kind of [[knowledge]] for a group of [[wiktionary:agent|agent]]s. There is ''common knowledge'' of ''p'' in a group of agents ''G'' when all the agents in ''G'' know ''p'', they all know that they know ''p'', they all know that they all know that they know ''p'', and so on ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;Osborne, Martin J., and [[Ariel Rubinstein]]. ''A Course in Game Theory''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first introduced in the philosophical literature by [[David Kellogg Lewis]] in his study ''Convention'' (1969).  The sociologist Morris Friedell defined common knowledge in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedell, "On the Structure of Shared Awareness," Behavioral Science 14 (1969): 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first given a mathematical formulation in a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] framework by [[Robert Aumann]] (1976). [[computer science|Computer scientists]] grew an interest in the subject of [[epistemic logic]] in general&amp;nbsp;– and of common knowledge in particular&amp;nbsp;– starting in the 1980s.{{ref|CSTexts}}  There are numerous [[Logic puzzle|puzzles]] based upon the concept which have been extensively investigated by mathematicians such as [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Math Hysteria| author=Ian Stewart |year=2004 |publisher=OUP |chapter=I Know That You Know That... |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Stephen Schiffer]], in his book ''Meaning'', independently developed a notion he called "mutual knowledge" which functions quite similarly to Lewis's "common knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schiffer, ''Meaning'', 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1988.  The first edition was published by OUP in 1972.  For a discussion of both Lewis's and Schiffer's notions, see Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

=== Puzzle ===

The idea of common knowledge is often introduced by some variant of the following puzzle:{{ref|Sevitan}}

On an island, there are ''k'' people who have blue eyes, and the rest of the people have green eyes. At the start of the puzzle, no one on the island ever knows their own eye color. By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers they have blue eyes, that person must leave the island at dawn; anyone not making such a discovery always sleeps until after dawn. On the island, each person knows every other person's eye color, there are no reflective surfaces, and there is no communication of eye color.

At some point, an outsider comes to the island, calls together all the people on the island, and makes the following public announcement: "At least one of you has blue eyes". The outsider, furthermore, is known by all to be truthful, and all know that all know this, and so on: it is common knowledge that he is truthful, and thus it becomes common knowledge that there is at least one islander who has blue eyes. The problem: assuming all persons on the island are completely logical and that this too is common knowledge, what is the eventual outcome?

=== Solution ===

The answer is that, on the ''k''th dawn after the announcement, all the blue-eyed people will leave the island.

==== Proof ====
The solution can be seen with an inductive argument. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (that is, there is exactly one blue-eyed person), the person will recognize that they alone have blue eyes (by seeing only green eyes in the others) and leave at the first dawn. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, no one will leave at the first dawn. The two blue-eyed people, seeing only one person with blue eyes, ''and'' that no one left on the 1st dawn (and thus that ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1), will leave on the second dawn. Inductively, it can be reasoned that no one will leave at the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 dawns if and only if there are at least ''k'' blue-eyed people. Those with blue eyes, seeing ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 blue-eyed people among the others and knowing there must be at least ''k'', will reason that they must have blue eyes and leave.

What's most interesting about this scenario is that, for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the outsider is only telling the island citizens what they already know: that there are blue-eyed people among them. However, before this fact is announced, the fact is not ''common knowledge''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is merely "first-order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that there is someone with blue eyes, but each blue eyed person does ''not'' know that the other blue-eyed person has this same knowledge.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, it is "second order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a ''third'' blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement.

In general: For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, it is "(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)th order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third blue-eyed person knows that.... (repeat for a total of ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 levels) a ''k''th person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a "''k''th" blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement. The notion of ''common knowledge'' therefore has a palpable effect. Knowing that everyone knows does make a difference. When the outsider's public announcement (a fact already known to all) becomes common knowledge, the blue-eyed people on this island eventually deduce their status, and leave.

== Formalization ==

=== Modal logic (syntactic characterization) ===

Common knowledge can be given a logical definition in [[Modal logic|multi-modal logic]] systems in which the modal operators are interpreted [[epistemic logic|epistemically]]. At the propositional level, such systems are extensions of [[propositional logic]]. The extension consists of the introduction of a group ''G'' of ''agents'', and of ''n'' modal operators ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (with ''i'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'') with the intended meaning that "agent ''i'' knows." Thus ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of the calculus) is read "agent ''i'' knows &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;." We can define an operator ''E&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the intended meaning of "everyone in group ''G'' knows" by defining it with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;E_G \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i \in G} K_i \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

By abbreviating the expression &lt;math&gt;E_GE_G^{n-1} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E_G^n \varphi&lt;/math&gt;  and defining &lt;math&gt;E_G^0 \varphi = \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we could then define common knowledge with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;C \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i = 0}^\infty E^i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

There is however a complication. The languages of epistemic logic are usually ''finitary'', whereas the [[axiom]] above defines common knowledge as an infinite conjunction of formulas, hence not a [[well-formed formula]] of the language. To overcome this difficulty, a ''fixed-point'' definition of common knowledge can be given. Intuitively, common knowledge is thought of as the fixed point of the "equation" &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi=\varphi\wedge E_G (C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, it is possible to find a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;E_G (\varphi \wedge C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; from which, in the limit, we can infer common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

This ''syntactic'' characterization is given semantic content through so-called ''Kripke structures''. A Kripke structure is given by (i) a set of states (or possible worlds) ''S'', (ii) ''n'' ''accessibility relations'' &lt;math&gt;R_1,\dots,R_n&lt;/math&gt;, defined on &lt;math&gt;S \times S&lt;/math&gt;, intuitively representing what states agent ''i'' considers possible from any given state, and (iii) a valuation function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; assigning a [[truth value]], in each state, to each primitive proposition in the language. The semantics for the knowledge operator is given by stipulating that &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_i&lt;/math&gt;. The semantics for the common knowledge operator, then, is given by taking, for each group of agents ''G'', the reflexive and transitive closure of the &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all agents ''i'' in ''G'', call such a relation &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt;, and stipulating that &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set theoretic (semantic characterization) ===

Alternatively (yet equivalently) common knowledge can be formalized using [[set theory]] (this was the path taken by the Nobel laureate  [[Robert Aumann]] in his seminal 1976 paper).  We will start with a set of states ''S''.  We can then define an event ''E'' as a subset of the set of states ''S''.  For each agent ''i'', define a [[Partition of a set|partition]] on ''S'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  This partition represents the state of knowledge of an agent in a state.  In state ''s'', agent ''i'' knows that one of the states in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') obtains, but not which one. (Here ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') denotes the unique element of ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing ''s''. Note that this model excludes cases in which agents know things that are not true.)

We can now define a knowledge function ''K'' in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt;K_i(e) = \{ s \in S \mid P_i(s) \subset e\}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e'') is the set of states where the agent will know that event ''e'' obtains. It is a subset of ''e''.

Similar to the modal logic formulation above, we can define an operator for the idea that "everyone knows ''e''".

: &lt;math&gt;E(e) = \bigcap_i K_i(e)&lt;/math&gt;

As with the modal operator, we will iterate the ''E'' function, &lt;math&gt;E^1(e) = E(e)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{n+1}(e) = E(E^{n}(e))&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this we can then define a common knowledge function,

: &lt;math&gt;C(e) = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} E^n(e).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence with the syntactic approach sketched above can easily be seen: consider an Aumann structure as the one just defined. We can define a correspondent Kripke structure by taking (i) the same space ''S'', (ii) accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; that define the equivalence classes corresponding to the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, and (iii) a valuation function such that it yields value ''true'' to the primitive proposition ''p'' in all and only the states ''s'' such that &lt;math&gt;s \in E^p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E^p&lt;/math&gt; is the event of the Aumann structure corresponding to the primitive proposition ''p''. It is not difficult to see that the common knowledge accessibility function &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt; defined in the previous section corresponds to the finest common coarsening of the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in G&lt;/math&gt;, which is the finitary characterization of common knowledge also given by Aumann in the 1976 article.

== Applications ==

Common knowledge was used by David Lewis in his pioneering game-theoretical account of convention. In this sense, common knowledge is a concept still central for linguists and philosophers of language (see Clark 1996) maintaining a Lewisian, conventionalist account of language.

[[Robert Aumann]] introduced a set theoretical formulation of common knowledge (theoretically equivalent to the one given above) and proved the so-called [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]] through which: if two agents have common [[prior probability]] over a certain event, and the [[posterior probabilities]] are common knowledge, then such posterior probabilities are equal. A result based on the agreement theorem and proven by Milgrom shows that, given certain conditions on market efficiency and information, speculative trade is impossible.

The concept of common knowledge is central in [[game theory]]. For several years it has been thought that the assumption of common knowledge of rationality for the players in the game was fundamental. It turns out (Aumann and Brandenburger 1995) that, in 2-player games, common knowledge of rationality is not needed as an epistemic condition for [[Nash equilibrium]] [[strategy (game theory)|strategies]].

Computer scientists use languages incorporating epistemic logics (and common knowledge) to reason about distributed systems. Such systems can be based on logics more complicated than simple propositional epistemic logic, see Wooldridge ''Reasoning about Artificial Agents'', 2000 (in which he uses a first-order logic incorporating epistemic and temporal operators) or van der Hoek et al. "Alternating Time Epistemic Logic".

In his 2007 book,  ''[[The Stuff of Thought|The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature]],'' [[Steven Pinker]] uses the notion of common knowledge to analyze the kind of indirect speech involved in innuendoes.

A '''coordinate-free''', or '''component-free''', treatment of a [[scientific theory]] or [[mathematical]] topic develops its concepts on any form of [[manifold]] without reference to any particular [[coordinate system]]. 

==Benefits==
Coordinate-free treatments generally allow for simpler systems of equations and inherently constrain certain types of inconsistency, allowing greater [[mathematical elegance]] at the cost of some [[abstraction]] from the detailed formulae needed to evaluate these equations within a particular system of coordinates. 

==History==
Coordinate-free treatments were the only available approach to [[geometry]] (and are now known as [[synthetic geometry]]) before the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Descartes]]. After several centuries of generally coordinate-based exposition, the modern tendency is generally to introduce students to coordinate-free treatments early on, and then to derive the coordinate-based treatments from the coordinate-free treatment, rather than ''vice versa''.

==Applications==
Fields that are now often introduced with coordinate-free treatments include [[vector calculus]], [[tensor]]s, [[differential geometry]], and [[computer graphics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeRose|first1=Tony D.|title=Three-Dimensional Computer Graphics: A Coordinate-Free Approach|url=http://graphics.pixar.com/people/derose/publications/GeometryBook/|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In physics, the existence of coordinate-free treatments of physical theories is a corollary of the principle of [[general covariance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61241">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[differential geometry]] and [[tensor calculus]], '''differential forms''' are an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define [[integrand]]s over curves, surfaces, volumes, and higher-dimensional [[manifold]]s.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by [[Élie Cartan]].  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.

For instance, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} from one-variable calculus is an example of a {{math|1}}-form, and can be [[integral|integrated]] over an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' + ''g''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dz'' + ''h''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} is a {{math|2}}-form that has a [[surface integral]] over an [[oriented]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] {{math|''S''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy + g(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dz + h(x,y,z)\,dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt;
The symbol {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior product]], sometimes called the ''wedge product'', of two differential forms. Likewise, a {{math|3}}-form {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} represents a [[volume element]] that can be integrated over a region of space. In general, a {{mvar|k}}-form is an object that may be integrated over {{mvar|k}}-dimensional sets, and is homogeneous of degree {{mvar|k}} in the coordinate differentials.

The [[exterior algebra|algebra]] of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the domain of integration.  There is an operation {{math|''d''}} on differential forms known as the [[exterior derivative]] that, when acting on a {{math|''k''}}-form, produces a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form.  This operation extends the [[differential of a function]], and is directly related to the [[divergence]] and the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field in a manner that makes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and [[Stokes' Theorem#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|Stokes' theorem]] special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized [[Stokes' theorem]].  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the [[topology]] of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as [[de Rham's theorem]].

The general setting for the study of differential forms is on a [[differentiable manifold]].  Differential {{math|1}}-forms are naturally dual to [[vector field]]s on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and {{math|1}}-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the [[interior product]].  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the [[change of variables formula]] for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

==History==
Differential forms are part of the field of differential geometry, influenced by linear algebra.  Although the notion of a differential is quite old, the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential forms is usually credited to [[Élie Cartan]] with reference to his 1899 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sur certaines expressions différentielles et le problème de Pfaff | first=Élie  |last=Cartan |journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure |url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1899_3_16__239_0|year=1899 |pages=239–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of the exterior algebra of differential forms appears in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s 1844 work, ''Die Lineale&lt;!--sic--&gt; Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics]

==Concept==

Differential forms provide an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.

===Integration===
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] of dimension {{math|''k''}}.  A differential one-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) length, or one-dimensional density.  A differential two-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) area, or two-dimensional density.  And so on.

Integration of differential forms is well-defined only on [[Orientability|oriented]] [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]].  An example of a one dimensional manifold is an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and intervals can be given an orientation: they are positively oriented if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}, and negatively oriented otherwise.  If {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}} then the integral of the differential one-form {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} (with its natural positive orientation) is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
which is the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval, when equipped with the opposite orientation.  That is:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_b^a f(x)\,dx = -\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
This gives a geometrical context to the [[Integral#Conventions|conventions]] for one-dimensional integrals, that the sign changes when the orientation of the interval is reversed.  A standard explanation of this in one-variable integration theory is that, when the limits of integration are in the opposite order ({{math|''b'' &lt; ''a''}}), the increment {{math|''dx''}} is negative.  The integrals are negatives of one another because the oriented lengths "''dx''" have opposite directions.

More generally, an {{math|''m''}}-form is an oriented density that can be integrated over an {{math|''m''}}-dimensional oriented manifold.  (For example, a {{math|1}}-form can be integrated over an oriented curve, a {{math|2}}-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, etc.)  If {{math|''M''}} is an oriented {{math|''m''}}-dimensional manifold, and {{math|''M''′}} is the same manifold with opposed orientation and {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form, then one has:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = - \int_{M'} \omega \,.&lt;/math&gt;
These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chain]]. In [[measure theory]], by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to a measure {{mvar|μ}} and integrates over a subset {{mvar|A}}, without any notion of orientation; one writes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_A f\,d\mu = \int_{[a,b]} f\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate integration over a subset {{mvar|A}}. This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see [[#Relation with measures|below]] for details.

Making the notion of an oriented density precise, and thus of a differential form, involves the [[exterior algebra]].  The basic {{math|1}}-forms are the differentials of the coordinates: {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}.  Each of these represents a [[covector]] that measures a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction.  A general {{math|1}}-form is a linear combination of these differentials
:&lt;math&gt;f_1dx^1+\cdots+f_ndx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the coordinates.  A differential {{math|1}}-form is integrated along an oriented curve as a line integral.

The basic two-forms are expressions {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}}.  This represents an infinitesimal oriented square parallel to the {{math|''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}–{{math|''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}-plane.  A general two-form is a linear combination of these, and it is integrated just like a surface integral.

A fundamental operation defined on differential forms is the [[exterior product]] (the symbol is the [[Wedge (symbol)|wedge]] {{math|∧}}).  This is similar to the [[cross product]] from vector calculus, in that it is an alternating product.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge dx^2=-dx^2\wedge dx^1&lt;/math&gt;
because the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be regarded as having the opposite orientation as the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and whose second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The exterior product allows higher dimensional differential forms to be built out of lower-dimensional ones, in much the same way that the cross product in vector calculus allows one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vectors pointing up the two sides.

In addition to the exterior product, there is also the [[exterior derivative]] operator {{math|''d''}}.  Like the [[differential of a function]], the exterior derivative gives a way of quantifying a differential form's sensitivity to change.  In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''f'' ''dx''{{i sup|''a''}}}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form, then {{math|''dω''}} is a {{math|''k'' + 1}}-form defined by

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^a.&lt;/math&gt;

with extension to general {{math|''k''}}-forms occurring linearly.

This more general approach allows for a more natural coordinate-free approach to integration on [[manifold]]s. It also allows for a natural generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (see {{section link||Stokes' theorem}}).

===Differential calculus===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A differential {{math|0}}-form ("zero-form") is defined to be a [[smooth function]] {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. If {{math|''v''}} is any vector in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a [[directional derivative]] {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''}}, which is another function on {{math|''U''}} whose value at a point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}} is the rate of change (at {{math|''p''}}) of {{math|''f''}} in the {{math|''v''}} direction:

:&lt;math&gt; (\partial_v f)(p) = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f(p+tv)\right|_{t=0} .&lt;/math&gt;

(This notion can be extended to the case that {{math|''v''}} is a [[vector field]] on {{math|''U''}} by evaluating {{math|''v''}} at the point {{math|''p''}} in the definition.)

In particular, if {{math|1=''v'' = ''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} is the {{math|''j''}}th [[coordinate vector]] then {{math|∂{{sub|''v''}} ''f''}} is the [[partial derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} with respect to the {{math|''j''}}th coordinate function, i.e., {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are the coordinate functions on {{math|''U''}}. By their very definition, partial derivatives depend upon the choice of coordinates: if new coordinates {{math|''y''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''y''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''y''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are introduced, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y^i} .&lt;/math&gt;

The first idea leading to differential forms is the observation that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''v''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (\partial_{v + w} f)(p) &amp;= (\partial_v f)(p) + (\partial_w f)(p) \\
    (\partial_{c v} f)(p) &amp;= c (\partial_v f)(p)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors {{math|''v''}}, {{math|''w''}} and any real number {{math|''c''}}. This [[linear map]] from {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|'''R'''}} is denoted {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the [[derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Thus {{math|1=''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') = ∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}}. The object {{math|''df''}} can be viewed as a function on {{math|''U''}}, whose value at {{math|''p''}} is not a real number, but the linear map {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is just the usual [[Fréchet derivative]] – an example of a differential [[1-form|{{math|1}}-form]].

Since any vector {{math|''v''}} is a [[linear combination]] {{math|∑ ''v''{{i sup|''j''}}''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} of its [[Euclidean vector#Vector components|components]], {{math|''df''}} is uniquely determined by {{math|''df''{{sub|''p''}}(''e''{{sub|''j''}})}} for each {{math|''j''}} and each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}, which are just the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. Thus {{math|''df''}} provides a way of encoding the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}}. It can be decoded by noticing that the coordinates {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are themselves functions on {{math|''U''}}, and so define differential {{math|1}}-forms {{math|''dx''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''dx''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}. Let {{math|1=''f'' = ''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}. Since {{math|1=∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}} / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}} = ''δ''{{i sup|''j''}}{{sub|''i''}}}}, the [[Kronecker delta function]], it follows that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|*|&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}}}

The meaning of this expression is given by evaluating both sides at an arbitrary point {{math|''p''}}: on the right hand side, the sum is defined "[[pointwise]]", so that
:&lt;math&gt;df_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p) (dx^i)_p .&lt;/math&gt;
Applying both sides to {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the result on each side is the {{math|''j''}}th partial derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Since {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''j''}} were arbitrary, this proves the formula {{EquationNote|*|(*)}}.

More generally, for any smooth functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}, we define the differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|1=''α'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dh''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} pointwise by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_p = \sum_i g_i(p) (dh_i)_p&lt;/math&gt;

for each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}. Any differential {{math|1}}-form arises this way, and by using {{EquationNote|*|(*)}} it follows that any differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}} may be expressed in coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\, dx^i&lt;/math&gt;

for some smooth functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}.

The second idea leading to differential forms arises from the following question: given a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}}, when does there exist a function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}? The above expansion reduces this question to the search for a function {{math|''f''}} whose partial derivatives {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}} are equal to {{math|''n''}} given functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, such a function does not always exist: any smooth function {{math|''f''}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} =  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^j \, \partial x^i} ,&lt;/math&gt;

so it will be impossible to find such an {{math|''f''}} unless

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x^j} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}.

The [[skew symmetry|skew-symmetry]] of the left hand side in {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} suggests introducing an antisymmetric product {{math|∧}} on differential {{math|1}}-forms, the [[exterior product]], so that these equations can be combined into a single condition

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∧}} is defined so that:

: &lt;math&gt; dx^i \wedge dx^j = - dx^j \wedge dx^i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a differential {{math|2}}-form.  This {{math|2}}-form is called the [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''dα''}} of {{math|1=''α'' = ∑{{su|b=''j''=1|p=''n''}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}.  It is given by

:&lt;math&gt; d\alpha = \sum_{j=1}^n df_j \wedge dx^j = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j .&lt;/math&gt;

To summarize: {{math|1=''dα'' = 0}} is a necessary condition for the existence of a function {{math|''f''}} with {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}.

Differential {{math|0}}-forms, {{math|1}}-forms, and {{math|2}}-forms are special cases of differential forms. For each {{math|''k''}}, there is a space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i_1,i_2\ldots i_k=1}^n f_{i_1i_2\ldots i_k} dx^{i_1} \wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge\cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for a collection of functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Antisymmetry, which was already present for {{math|2}}-forms, makes it possible to restrict the sum to those sets of indices for which {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Differential forms can be multiplied together using the exterior product, and for any differential {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}}, there is a differential {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form {{math|''dα''}} called the exterior derivative of {{math|''α''}}.

Differential forms, the exterior product and the exterior derivative are independent of a choice of coordinates. Consequently, they may be defined on any [[smooth manifold]] {{math|''M''}}. One way to do this is cover {{math|''M''}} with [[coordinate chart]]s and define a differential {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} to be a family of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on each chart which agree on the overlaps. However, there are more intrinsic definitions which make the independence of coordinates manifest.

==Intrinsic definitions==
{{see also|Exterior algebra}}

Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A smooth differential form of degree {{math|''k''}} is a [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth section]] of the {{math|''k''}}th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  The set of all differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on a manifold {{math|''M''}} is a [[vector space]], often denoted {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.

The definition of a differential form may be restated as follows.  At any point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}}, a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''β''}} defines an element
:&lt;math&gt; \beta_p \in \bigwedge^k T_p^* M,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} is the [[tangent space]] to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}} is its [[dual space]].  This space is naturally isomorphic to the fiber at {{math|''p''}} of the dual bundle of the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the [[tangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  That is, {{math|''β''}} is also a linear functional

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_p \colon \bigwedge^k T_pM \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the universal property of exterior powers, this is equivalently an [[alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]]
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_p\colon \bigoplus_{n=1}^k T_p M \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, a differential {{math|''k''}}-form may be evaluated against any {{math|''k''}}-tuple of tangent vectors to the same point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}}.  For example, a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} assigns to each point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} a [[linear functional]] {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. In the presence of an [[inner product]] on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} (induced by a [[Riemannian metric]] on {{math|''M''}}), {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be [[Riesz representation theorem|represented]] as the inner product with a [[tangent vector]] {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Differential {{math|1}}-forms are sometimes called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant vector fields]], covector fields, or "dual vector fields", particularly within physics.

The exterior algebra may be embedded in the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map.  The alternation map is defined as a mapping  
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigotimes^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
For a tensor at a point {{math|''p''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(\omega_p)(x_1, \dots, x_k) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \sgn(\sigma) \omega_p(x_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(k)}),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''k''}} elements.  The alternation map is constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generated by the symmetric 2-forms, and therefore descends to an embedding
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigwedge^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

This map exhibits {{math|''β''}} as a [[antisymmetric tensor|totally antisymmetric]] [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] [[tensor field]] of rank {{math|''k''}}. The differential forms on {{math|''M''}} are in one-to-one correspondence with such tensor fields.

==Operations==

As well as the addition and multiplication by scalar operations which arise from the vector space structure, there are several other standard operations defined on differential forms. The most important operations are the [[exterior product]] of two differential forms, the [[exterior derivative]] of a single differential form, the [[interior product]] of a differential form and a vector field, the [[Lie derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the [[covariant derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection.

=== Exterior product ===
The exterior product of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}} and an {{math|''l''}}-form {{math|''β''}} is a ({{math|''k'' + ''l''}})-form denoted {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}}. At each point {{math|''p''}} of the manifold {{math|''M''}}, the forms {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} are elements of an exterior power of the tangent space at {{math|''p''}}. When the exterior algebra is viewed as a quotient of the tensor algebra, the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product (modulo the equivalence relation defining the exterior algebra).

The antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra means that when {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is viewed as a multilinear functional, it is alternating. However, when the exterior algebra embedded a subspace of the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map, the tensor product {{math|''α'' ⊗ ''β''}} is not alternating. There is an explicit formula which describes the exterior product in this situation.  The exterior product is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = \frac{(k + \ell)!}{k!\ell!}\operatorname{Alt}(\alpha \otimes \beta).&lt;/math&gt;
This description is useful for explicit computations. For example, if {{math|1=''k'' = ''l'' = 1}}, then {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is the {{math|2}}-form whose value at a point {{math|''p''}} is the [[alternating bilinear form]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (\alpha\wedge\beta)_p(v,w)=\alpha_p(v)\beta_p(w) - \alpha_p(w)\beta_p(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''v'', ''w'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}.

The exterior product is bilinear: If {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are any differential forms, and if {{math|''f''}} is any smooth function, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (\beta + \gamma) = \alpha \wedge \beta + \alpha \wedge \gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (f \cdot \beta) = f \cdot (\alpha \wedge \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''skew commutative'' (also known as ''graded commutative''), meaning that it satisfies a variant of [[anticommutativity]] that depends on the degrees of the forms: if {{math|''α''}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''β''}} is an {{math|''l''}}-form, then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = (-1)^{kl} \beta \wedge \alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Riemannian manifold ===
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], the metric defines a fibre-wise isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent spaces.  This makes it possible to convert vector fields to covector fields and vice versa.  It also enables the definition of additional operations such as the [[Hodge star operator]] &lt;math&gt;\star \colon \Omega^k(M)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \Omega^{n-k}(M)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Hodge star#Codifferential|codifferential]] &lt;math&gt;\delta\colon \Omega^k(M)\rightarrow \Omega^{k-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, which has degree {{math|−1}} and is adjoint to the exterior differential {{math|''d''}}.

==== Vector field structures ====
On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, {{math|1}}-forms can be identified with vector fields; vector fields have additional distinct algebraic structures, which are listed here for context and to avoid confusion.

Firstly, each (co)tangent space generates a [[Clifford algebra]], where the product of a (co)vector with itself is given by the value of a quadratic form – in this case, the natural one induced by the [[metric tensor|metric]]. This algebra is ''distinct'' from the [[exterior algebra]] of differential forms, which can be viewed as a Clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes (since the exterior product of any vector with itself is zero). Clifford algebras are thus non-anti-commutative ("quantum") deformations of the exterior algebra. They are studied in [[geometric algebra]].

Another alternative is to consider vector fields as derivations. The (noncommutative) algebra of [[differential operator]]s they generate is the [[Weyl algebra]] and is a noncommutative ("quantum") deformation of the ''symmetric'' algebra in the vector fields.

===Exterior differential complex===
One important property of the exterior derivative is that {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}. This means that the exterior derivative defines a [[cochain complex]]:

:&lt;math&gt;0\ \to\ \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^2(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^3(M)\ \to\ \cdots \ \to\ \Omega^n(M)\ \to \ 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This complex is called the de Rham complex, and its [[cohomology]] is by definition the [[de Rham cohomology]] of {{math|''M''}}.  By the [[Poincaré lemma]], the de Rham complex is locally [[exact sequence|exact]] except at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.  The kernel at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of [[locally constant function]]s on {{math|''M''}}.  Therefore, the complex is a resolution of the constant [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn implies a form of de Rham's theorem: de Rham cohomology computes the [[sheaf cohomology]] of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Pullback==
{{see also|Pullback (differential geometry)}}

Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is smooth.  The differential of {{math|''f''}} is a smooth map {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} between the tangent bundles of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  This map is also denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the '''pushforward'''.  For any point {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}} and any {{math|''v'' &amp;isin; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, there is a well-defined pushforward vector {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'')}} in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  However, the same is not true of a vector field.  If {{math|''f''}} is not injective, say because {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} has two or more preimages, then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is not surjective, then will be a point {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} at which {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not determine any tangent vector at all.  Since a vector field on {{math|''N''}} determines, by definition, a unique tangent vector at every point of {{math|''N''}}, the pushforward of a vector field does not always exist.

By contrast, it is always possible to pull back a differential form.  A differential form on {{math|''N''}} may be viewed as a linear functional on each tangent space.  Precomposing this functional with the differential {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}} and therefore a differential form on {{math|''M''}}.  The existence of pullbacks is one of the key features of the theory of differential forms.  It leads to the existence of pullback maps in other situations, such as pullback homomorphisms in de Rham cohomology.

Formally, let {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} be smooth, and let {{math|''ω''}} be a smooth {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}.  Then there is a differential form {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}} on {{math|''M''}}, called the '''pullback''' of {{math|''ω''}}, which captures the behavior of {{math|''ω''}} as seen relative to {{math|''f''}}.  To define the pullback, fix a point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}} and tangent vectors {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} is defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(f^*\omega)_p(v_1, \ldots, v_k) = \omega_{f(p)}(f_*v_1, \ldots, f_*v_k).&lt;/math&gt;

There are several more abstract ways to view this definition.  If {{math|''ω''}} is a {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then it may be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle {{math|''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N''}} of {{math|''N''}}.  Using {{i sup|∗}} to denote a dual map, the dual to the differential of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|(''df''){{i sup|∗}} : ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N'' → ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''M''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} may be defined to be the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ T^*N\ \stackrel{(df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a section of the cotangent bundle of {{math|''M''}} and hence a differential {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  In full generality, let &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k (df)^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the dual map to the differential.  Then the pullback of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} is the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ \wedge^k T^*N\ \stackrel{\wedge^k (df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

Another abstract way to view the pullback comes from viewing a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} as a linear functional on tangent spaces.  From this point of view, {{math|''ω''}} is a morphism of [[vector bundle]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''N'' × '''R'''}} is the trivial rank one bundle on {{math|''N''}}.  The composite map
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM\ \stackrel{\wedge^k df}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}}, and therefore it factors through the trivial bundle {{math|''M'' × '''R'''}}.  The vector bundle morphism &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM \to M \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined in this way is {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}}.

Pullback respects all of the basic operations on forms.  If {{math|''ω''}} and {{math|''η''}} are forms and {{math|''c''}} is a real number, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
             f^*(c\omega) &amp;= c(f^*\omega), \\
       f^*(\omega + \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega + f^*\eta, \\
  f^*(\omega \wedge \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega \wedge f^*\eta, \\
             f^*(d\omega) &amp;= d(f^*\omega).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The pullback of a form can also be written in coordinates. Assume that {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''M''}}, that {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''N''}}, and that these coordinate systems are related by the formulas {{math|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all {{math|''i''}}. Locally on {{math|''N''}}, {{math|''ω''}} can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \omega_{i_1\cdots i_k} \, dy^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dy^{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;

where, for each choice of {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a real-valued function of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Using the linearity of pullback and its compatibility with exterior product, the pullback of {{math|''ω''}} has the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f) \, df_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge df_{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each exterior derivative {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be expanded in terms of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The resulting {{math|''k''}}-form can be written using [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \sum_{j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f)\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})} \, dx^{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{j_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the determinant of the matrix whose entries are &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_{i_m}}{\partial x^{j_n}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1\leq m,n\leq k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Integration==
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over an oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional manifold.  When the {{math|''k''}}-form is defined on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold with {{math|''n'' &amp;gt; ''k''}}, then the {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds.  If {{math|1=''k'' = 0}}, this is just evaluation of a function at points. Other values of {{math|1=''k'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}} correspond to line integrals, surface integrals, volume integrals, and so on.  There are several equivalent ways to formally define the integral of a differential form, all of which depend on reducing to the case of Euclidean space.

===Integration on Euclidean space===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} its standard orientation and {{math|''U''}} the restriction of that orientation.  Every smooth {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on {{math|''U''}} has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = f(x)\,dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some smooth function {{math|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''}}.  Such a function has an integral in the usual Riemann or Lebesgue sense.  This allows us to define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the integral of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_U \omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \int_U f(x)\,dx^1 \cdots dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Fixing an orientation is necessary for this to be well-defined.  The skew-symmetry of differential forms means that the integral of, say, {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be the negative of the integral of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Riemann and Lebesgue integrals cannot see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinates, so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined.  The orientation resolves this ambiguity.

===Integration over chains===
Let {{math|''M''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-manifold and {{math|''ω''}} an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  First, assume that there is a parametrization of {{math|''M''}} by an open subset of Euclidean space.  That is, assume that there exists a diffeomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \colon D \to M&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''D'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|''M''}} the orientation induced by {{math|''φ''}}.  Then {{Harv|Rudin|1976}} defines the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''M''}} to be the integral of {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''}} over {{math|''D''}}.  In coordinates, this has the following expression.  Fix a chart on {{math|''M''}} with coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}({\mathbf x})\,dx^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx^{i_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose that {{math|''φ''}} is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi({\mathbf u}) = (x^1({\mathbf u}),\dots,x^n({\mathbf u})).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integral may be written in coordinates as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = \int_D \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}(\varphi({\mathbf u})) \frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}\,du^1 \cdots du^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}&lt;/math&gt;
is the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]].  The Jacobian exists because {{math|''φ''}} is differentiable.

In general, an {{math|''n''}}-manifold cannot be parametrized by an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  But such a parametrization is always possible locally, so it is possible to define integrals over arbitrary manifolds by defining them as sums of integrals over collections of local parametrizations.  Moreover, it is also possible to define parametrizations of {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets for {{math|''k'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}, and this makes it possible to define integrals of {{math|''k''}}-forms.  To make this precise, it is convenient to fix a standard domain {{math|''D''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, usually a cube or a simplex.  A {{math|''k''}}-'''chain''' is a formal sum of smooth embeddings {{math|''D'' → ''M''}}.  That is, it is a collection of smooth embeddings, each of which is assigned an integer multiplicity.  Each smooth embedding determines a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifold of {{math|''M''}}.  If the chain is
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \varphi_i,&lt;/math&gt;
then the integral of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''c''}} is defined to be the sum of the integrals over the terms of {{math|''c''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_c \omega = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \int_D \varphi_i^*\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach to defining integration does not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold {{math|''M''}}.  However, it is still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] in an essentially unique way, and the integral over {{math|''M''}} may be defined to be the integral over the chain determined by a triangulation.

===Integration using partitions of unity===
There is another approach, expounded in {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, which does directly assign a meaning to integration over {{math|''M''}}, but this approach requires fixing an orientation of {{math|''M''}}.  The integral of an {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold is defined by working in charts.  Suppose first that {{math|''ω''}} is supported on a single positively oriented chart.  On this chart, it may be pulled back to an {{math|''n''}}-form on an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Here, the form has a well-defined Riemann or Lebesgue integral as before.  The change of variables formula and the assumption that the chart is positively oriented together ensure that the integral of {{math|''ω''}} is independent of the chosen chart.  In the general case, use a partition of unity to write {{math|''ω''}} as a sum of {{math|''n''}}-forms, each of which is supported in a single positively oriented chart, and define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the sum of the integrals of each term in the partition of unity.

It is also possible to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms on oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds using this more intrinsic approach.  The form is pulled back to the submanifold, where the integral is defined using charts as before.  For example, given a path {{math|''γ''(''t'') : [0, 1] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, integrating a {{math|1}}-form on the path is simply pulling back the form to a form {{math|''f''(''t'')&amp;thinsp;''dt''}} on {{math|[0, 1]}}, and this integral is the integral of the function {{math|''f''(''t'')}} on the interval.

===Integration along fibers===
{{main|Integration along fibers}}

[[Fubini's theorem]] states that the integral over a set that is a product may be computed as an iterated integral over the two factors in the product.  This suggests that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable as an iterated integral as well.  The geometric flexibility of differential forms ensures that this is possible not just for products, but in more general situations as well.  Under some hypotheses, it is possible to integrate along the fibers of a smooth map, and the analog of Fubini's theorem is the case where this map is the projection from a product to one of its factors.

Because integrating a differential form over a submanifold requires fixing an orientation, a prerequisite to integration along fibers is the existence of a well-defined orientation on those fibers.  Let {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} be two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, respectively.  Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  This implies that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-dimensional and that, around each point of {{math|''M''}}, there is a chart on which {{math|''f''}} looks like the projection from a product onto one of its factors.  Fix {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} and set {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}.  Suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_x &amp;\in \wedge^m T_x^*M, \\
\eta_y &amp;\in \wedge^n T_y^*N,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and that {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not vanish.  Following {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, there is a unique
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*(f^{-1}(y))&lt;/math&gt;
which may be thought of as the fibral part of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  More precisely, define {{math|''j'' : ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'') → ''M''}} to be the inclusion.  Then {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined by the property that,
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_x = (f^*\eta_y)_x \wedge \sigma'_x \in \wedge^m T_x^*M,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is any {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-covector for which
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = j^*\sigma'_x.&lt;/math&gt;
The form {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may also be notated {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Moreover, for fixed {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} varies smoothly with respect to {{math|''x''}}.  That is, suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega \colon f^{-1}(y) \to T^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is a smooth section of the projection map; we say that {{math|''ω''}} is a smooth differential {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Then there is a smooth differential {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''σ''}} on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} such that, at each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \omega_x / \eta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
This form is denoted {{math|''ω'' / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The same construction works if {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form in a neighborhood of the fiber, and the same notation is used.  A consequence is that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is orientable.  In particular, a choice of orientation forms on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} defines an orientation of every fiber of {{math|''f''}}.

The analog of Fubini's theorem is as follows.  As before, {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, and {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  Fix orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}, and give each fiber of {{math|''f''}} the induced orientation.  Let {{math|''θ''}} be an {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}, and let {{math|''ζ''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} that is almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of {{math|''N''}}.  Then, for almost every {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, the form {{math|''θ'' / ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a well-defined integrable {{math|''m'' &amp;minus; ''n''}} form on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Moreover, there is an integrable {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta_y\bigg)\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
Denote this form by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;
Then {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}} proves the generalized Fubini formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \theta = \int_N \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to integrate forms of other degrees along the fibers of a submersion.  Assume the same hypotheses as before, and let {{math|''α''}} be a compactly supported {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + ''k'')}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  Then there is a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} on {{math|''N''}} which is the result of integrating {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of {{math|''f''}}.  The form {{math|''α''}} is defined by specifying, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, how {{math|''α''}} pairs against each {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}}, and the value of that pairing is an integral over {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} that depends only on {{math|''α''}}, {{math|'''v'''}}, and the orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  More precisely, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k T_yN \to \wedge^{m-k} T_y^*N&lt;/math&gt;
defined by the interior product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \mapsto \mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}, then a {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}} determines an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''k'')}}-covector at {{math|''x''}} by pullback:
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y) \in \wedge^{m-k} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
Each of these covectors has an exterior product against {{math|''α''}}, so there is an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(\beta_{\mathbf{v}})_x = \left(\alpha_x \wedge f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y)\right) \big/ \zeta_y \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This form depends on the orientation of {{math|''N''}} but not the choice of {{math|''ζ''}}.  Then the {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} is uniquely defined by the property
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\gamma_y, \mathbf{v}\rangle = \int_{f^{-1}(y)} \beta_{\mathbf{v}}(x),&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''γ''}} is smooth {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  This form also denoted {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt;}} and called the '''integral of {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of ''f'''''.  Integration along fibers is important for the construction of Gysin maps in de Rham cohomology.

Integration along fibers satisfies the '''projection formula''' {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  If {{math|''λ''}} is any {{math|''ℓ''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\flat \wedge \lambda = (\alpha \wedge f^*\lambda)^\flat.&lt;/math&gt;

===Stokes' theorem===
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}
The fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration is given by the [[Stokes' theorem]]: If {{math|''ω''}} is an ({{math|''n'' − 1}})-form with compact support on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''∂M''}} denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of {{math|''M''}} with its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

A key consequence of this is that "the integral of a closed form over homologous chains is equal": If {{math|''ω''}} is a closed {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are {{math|''k''}}-chains that are homologous (such that {{math|''M'' − ''N''}} is the boundary of a ({{math|''k'' + 1}})-chain {{math|''W''}}), then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_M \omega = \int_N \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, since the difference is the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_W d\omega = \int_W 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} is the derivative of a potential function on the plane or {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over a path from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''b''}} does not depend on the choice of path (the integral is {{math|''f''(''b'') − ''f''(''a'')}}), since different paths with given endpoints are [[homotopic]], hence homologous (a weaker condition). This case is called the [[gradient theorem]], and generalizes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. This path independence is very useful in [[contour integration]].

This theorem also underlies the duality between [[de Rham cohomology]] and the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of chains.

=== Relation with measures ===
{{details|Density on a manifold}}

On a ''general'' differentiable manifold (without additional structure), differential forms ''cannot'' be integrated over subsets of the manifold; this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms, which are integrated over chains or oriented submanifolds, and measures, which are integrated over subsets. The simplest example is attempting to integrate the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[0, 1]}}. Assuming the usual distance (and thus measure) on the real line, this integral is either {{math|1}} or {{math|&amp;minus;1}}, depending on ''orientation:'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_0^1 dx = 1}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_1^0 dx = - \int_0^1 dx = -1}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the integral of the ''measure'' {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}} on the interval is unambiguously {{math|1}} (formally, the integral of the constant function {{math|1}} with respect to this measure is {{math|1}}). Similarly, under a change of coordinates a differential {{math|''n''}}-form changes by the [[Jacobian determinant]] {{math|''J''}}, while a measure changes by the ''absolute value'' of the Jacobian determinant, {{math|{{abs|''J''}}}}, which further reflects the issue of orientation. For example, under the map {{math|''x'' ↦ −''x''}} on the line, the differential form {{math|''dx''}} pulls back to {{math|−''dx''}}; orientation has reversed; while the [[Lebesgue measure]], which here we denote {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}, pulls back to {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}; it does not change.

In the presence of the additional data of an ''orientation'', it is possible to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms (top-dimensional forms) over the entire manifold or over compact subsets; integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrating the form over the [[fundamental class]] of the manifold, {{math|[''M'']}}. Formally, in the presence of an orientation, one may identify {{math|''n''}}-forms with [[densities on a manifold]]; densities in turn define a measure, and thus can be integrated {{Harv |Folland |1999 |loc = Section 11.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;361&amp;ndash;362}}.

On an orientable but not oriented manifold, there are two choices of orientation; either choice allows one to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms over compact subsets, with the two choices differing by a sign. On non-orientable manifold, {{math|''n''}}-forms and densities cannot be identified —notably, any top-dimensional form must vanish somewhere (there are no [[volume form]]s on non-orientable manifolds), but there are nowhere-vanishing densities— thus while one can integrate densities over compact subsets, one cannot integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms. One can instead identify densities with top-dimensional [[Volume form#Relation to measures|pseudoform]]s.

Even in the presence of an orientation, there is in general no meaningful way to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms over subsets for {{math|''k'' &lt; ''n''}} because there is no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets.  Geometrically, a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subset can be turned around in place, yielding the same subset with the reserve orientation; for example, the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotated by a half-circle.  Compare the [[Gram determinant]] of a set of {{math|''k''}} vectors in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space, which, unlike the determinant of {{math|''n''}} vectors, is always positive, corresponding to a squared number.  An orientation of a {{math|''k''}}-submanifold is therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold.

On a Riemannian manifold, one may define a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] for any {{math|''k''}} (integer or real), which may be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets of the manifold. A function times this Hausdorff measure can then be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets, providing a measure-theoretic analog to integration of {{math|''k''}}-forms. The {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Hausdorff measure yields a density, as above.

===Currents===
The differential form analog of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] or generalized function is called a '''current'''.  The space of {{math|''k''}}-currents on {{math|''M''}} is the dual space to an appropriate space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms.  Currents play the role of generalized domains of integration, similar to but even more flexible than chains.

==Applications in physics==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maxwell's equations]] --&gt;

Differential forms arise in some important physical contexts. For example, in Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]], the '''Faraday 2-form''', or [[electromagnetic field strength]], is

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = \frac 1 2 f_{ab}\, dx^a \wedge dx^b\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are formed from the electromagnetic fields &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt;; e.g., {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c''}}, {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = −''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or equivalent definitions.

This form is a special case of the [[curvature form]] on the {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[principal bundle]] on which both electromagnetism and general [[gauge theories]] may be described.  The [[connection form]] for the principal bundle is the vector potential, typically denoted by {{math|'''A'''}}, when represented in some gauge.  One then has
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = d\textbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''current {{math|3}}-form''' is

: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{J} = \frac 1 6 j^a\, \varepsilon_{abcd}\, dx^b \wedge dx^c \wedge dx^d\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the four components of the current density. (Here it is a matter of convention to write {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} instead of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. to use capital letters, and to write {{math|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} instead of {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, the vector rsp. tensor components and the above-mentioned forms have different physical dimensions. Moreover, by decision of an international commission of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], the magnetic polarization vector is called &lt;math&gt;\vec J&lt;/math&gt; since several decades, and by some publishers {{math|'''J'''}}, i.e. the same name is used for different quantities.)

Using the above-mentioned definitions, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written very compactly in [[geometrized units]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        d {\textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{0} \\
  d {\star \textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{J},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hodge star]] operator.  Similar considerations describe the geometry of gauge theories in general.

The {{math|2}}-form &lt;math&gt;{\star} \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the Faraday form, is also called '''Maxwell 2-form'''.

Electromagnetism is an example of a {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[gauge theory]].  Here the [[Lie group]] is {{math|U(1)}}, the one-dimensional [[unitary group]], which is in particular [[abelian group|abelian]].  There are gauge theories, such as [[Yang–Mills theory]], in which the Lie group is not abelian.  In that case, one gets relations which are similar to those described here. The analog of the field {{math|'''F'''}} in such theories is the curvature form of the connection, which is represented in a gauge by a [[Lie algebra]]-valued one-form {{math|'''A'''}}.  The Yang–Mills field {{math|'''F'''}} is then defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = d\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}\wedge\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the abelian case, such as electromagnetism, {{math|1='''A''' ∧ '''A''' = 0}}, but this does not hold in general.  Likewise the field equations are modified by additional terms involving exterior products of {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}}, owing to the [[Maurer–Cartan form|structure equations]] of the gauge group.

==Applications in geometric measure theory==

Numerous minimality results for complex analytic manifolds are based on the [[Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)|Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms]].  A succinct proof may be found in [[Herbert Federer]]'s classic text ''Geometric Measure Theory''.  The Wirtinger inequality is also a key ingredient in [[Gromov's inequality for complex projective space]] in [[systolic geometry]].

An '''eternal statement''' is a [[:wikt:statement|statement]] whose [[type-token distinction|token instances]] all have the same [[truth value]]. For instance, every inscription or [[utterance]] of the sentence "On July 15, 2009 it rains in Boston" has the same truth value, no matter when or where it is asserted. This type of statement is distinguished from others in that its context will not influence its truth value. Essentially, an eternal statement is a true statement, regardless of how it used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6484">The terms '''food critic''', '''food writer''', and '''restaurant critic''' can all be used to describe a [[writer]] who analyzes food or [[restaurant]]s and then publishes the results of their findings.  While these terms are not strictly synonymous they are often used interchangeably, at least in some circumstances.  Those who share their opinions via [[food column]]s in newspapers and magazines are known as '''food columnists'''. They are often experts in the field.

==Terminology==
"Food writer" is often used as a broad term that encompasses someone who writes about food and about restaurants. For example, [[Ruth Reichl]] is often described as a food writer/editor, who in the course of her career served as the "restaurant critic" for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/authordetail.cfm?authorID=9376 Ruth Reichl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[R. W. Apple, Jr.|R.W. "Johnny" Apple]] was also described as a food writer, but never served as a designated restaurant critic. Nonetheless, he wrote frequently about restaurants as he traveled in search of good eats. [[Calvin Trillin]] writes a great deal about food (among other things) and has been known to write occasionally about specific restaurants, e.g., [[Arthur Bryant's]] and Diedee's. But restaurants figure less prominently in his writing than in Apple's. Finally, [[Richard Olney (food writer)|Richard Olney]] was also a noted food writer, but rarely if ever wrote about restaurants.

Food critics and "restaurant critic" are synonyms, in practice, although there is still a distinction to be made. Both suggest a critical, evaluative stance that often involves some kind of rating system. The distinction, if any involves the range of possible investigation. "Food critic" has a more contemporary vibe, suggesting that restaurants, bakeries, food festivals, street vendors, and taco trucks are all fair game. [[Jonathan Gold]] of ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who holds the distinction of being the first food critic to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]], exemplifies this trend. "Restaurant critic" is the more traditional title and can connote a more restricted sphere of operations — traditional restaurants, with perhaps those serving [[French cuisine]] being the examples. The change in practice, if not in terminology, is often attributed to Reichl's arrival at the ''New York Times'', replacing Bryan Miller. In a series of well-documented incidents, Miller complained that Reichl was "giving SoHo noodle shops 2 and 3 stars" and destroying the rating system that had been built up by [[Craig Claiborne]], [[Mimi Sheraton]], and Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/nov96/interview961118.html The Salon Interview | Ruth Reichl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable food critics==
For most of the past century, the most highly visible food critics have been those who have written for daily newspapers throughout the world and a few who have been restaurant reviewers for influential magazines, such as [[Gourmet (magazine)|''Gourmet'']] in the United States. The ephemeral nature of radio and television has meant that very few food critics have used this medium effectively (as opposed to chefs who have used all media to great effect). An example is the BBC's ''The Food Programme''. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has also used both broadcast media and print to concentrate on food production rather than presentation, starting a new column in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in September 2006.

Restaurant critics range in their approach to writing from the acerbic (such as [[A. A. Gill]] from London), to the witty/humorous (such as [[Morgan Murphy (food critic)|Morgan Murphy]], "America's Funniest Food Critic," or Terry Durack from "[[The Independent on Sunday]]") to the "been there done that" approach of Ruth Reichl of ''Gourmet'' and formerly of ''The New York Times''. Other notable critics include Patricia Wells of the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', who writes knowledgeable and perceptive articles about food and restaurants and who occasionally uses the sword rather than her usual suave style. Another was R. W. Apple, Jr., from ''The New York Times'', who wrote long, thoughtful articles about his travels throughout the world in search of great food. Brad A. Johnson in Los Angeles is the only American restaurant critic to win both the coveted [[James Beard Award]] and the [[Le Cordon Bleu]] World Food Media Award for restaurant criticism.

Then there are myriad regional food critics, ranging from Nancy Leson in Seattle, to [[Pat Nourse]] in Sydney, Cooper Adams in Albany, and Stephen Downes and John Lethlean in Melbourne, who pen weekly and monthly reviews of the best of their respective cities.

[[Giles Coren]] was very known to his show, "Million Dollar Critic" who assesses the restaurants in [[Canada]] &amp; [[United States]] where he focuses on quality of services, food taste &amp; the ambiance of each and every restaurant that he visited. Aside from his hosting project, he is also a food columnist for [[The Times|The London Times]], [[GQ]], [[Tatler]] &amp; [[The Independent|The Independent UK]] to tell about his reviews of restaurants around the world, especially in [[United Kingdom]].

==Food criticism on the internet==
The internet has slowly become more important in forming opinions about restaurants. Food criticism on the Internet has allowed creation of shows with specific audiences.&lt;ref name="newsobserver"&gt;{{cite news|title=Web viewers warm up to frozen food show|first=Sue|last=Stock|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/18/440825/web-viewers-warm-up-to-frozen.html?storylink=misearch|newspaper=[[News &amp; Observer]]|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=10 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822204614/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/18/440825/web-viewers-warm-up-to-frozen.html?storylink=misearch|archivedate=22 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestry===
He was born at 205 South Prospect Street in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Chittenden County, Vermont]] in the house where he spent his entire life in the affluent "Burlington Hill" neighborhood next to the University of Vermont on  May 10, 1877.&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whipple294&gt;Whipple, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duffy232&gt;Duffy, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into a family with Midwestern roots that trace back to ''[[Mayflower]]'' passengers, [[Love Brewster]], a founder of the town of [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]]; Elder [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]], the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]]; and [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]], Governor of the Plymouth Colony and the second signer and primary architect of the [[Mayflower Compact]] in [[Provincetown Harbor]]. He was also a descendant of [[Martha Wadsworth Brewster]],&lt;ref name=Burt71&gt;Burt, 71&lt;/ref&gt; a notable 18th-century American poet and writer.

His father served as Dean of Arts and Sciences, vice president and was appointed interim president of the University of Vermont during World War I. He was also the state geologist of Vermont from 1898 to 1933. He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Yale University]], class of 1867; received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Yale in 1869.

His mother was Mary Judd Farnham,&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; an 1863 graduate of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], and a daughter of Eli Farnham&lt;ref name="Loomis-Farnham1" /&gt; and [[Loomis Homestead|Jerusha Brewster Loomis]].&lt;ref name=Loomis117&gt;Loomis, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858|debates]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A.

She was the president of the Vermont Chapter of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], and was active in her church and philanthropic work. Her first cousin was Dr. [[George Trumbull Ladd]] an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[educator]] and [[psychologist]].

Mary's parents had emigrated to [[Illinois]] in 1836 and were the among the founders and pioneers of [[Galesburg, Illinois]]. They built a temporary cabin in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, the settlers having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits. They were also instrumental in the founding of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]].

===Education===
He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the University of Vermont, Burlington in 1898, received his [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] in 1899 and was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Zoology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902. The title of his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] was ''The Development of Gonionema Murbachii'', which was on the development and life cycle of [[Jellyfish|Gonionema murbachii]] (a type of jellyfish).&lt;ref name="NaturalSciences750-790"&gt;NaturalSciences, pp. 750–790&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his doctorate, he joined the faculty of UVM where he remained until his retirement.

===Marriage and family===
He married on June 11, 1903 at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], Mary Edmunds, born at Baltimore, Maryland on October 18, 1874 the daughter of James Richard Edmunds and Anna Smith Keyser. She was the sister of Dr. Charles Keyser Edmunds, one of his fellow graduate students at Johns Hopkins. He was president of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Canton Christian College]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Guangdong|Kwangtung Province]], [[China]] and the fifth president of [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]].&lt;ref name=Howe292&gt;Howe, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howe312&gt;Howe, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother was [[James R.

===Career===
In 1903, he was appointed associate professor of Zoology at University of Vermont, Burlington. He taught biology, entomology, anatomy and physiology, and embryology during the first half of his career. In 1911 was promoted to full professor and served as chairman of the Zoology Department. His sporadic research projects involved field studies in the rapidly fading naturalist tradition: studies of birds, game fish, and marine invertebrates. He retired in 1945 and remained active in the UVM Alumni Association until his death in 1956.

His interest in eugenics began shortly after the end of World War I. It was after World War I that he learned of a study by the U.S. Army which was used as part of the draft process. The results from the Army study showed that men from Vermont had an inordinately high rate of "defects" (such as diabetes, epilepsy, "deformities" and "mental deficiency"). Perkins saw this as a problem that needed to be fixed. He went about trying to "fix" this through investigation and social reform.&lt;ref name=Gallagher38-39&gt;Gallagher, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; This reform, as denounced by historian Nancy Gallagher in her research titled ''Breeding better Vermonters'', also targeted French Canadians and American natives in Vermont state, considered ''insane invasion'' to eliminate.

Around the same time, he revamped his Zoology curriculum and began teaching courses specifically on Heredity and Evolution. His heredity class provided the first known venue for eugenics education at UVM and the inspiration for a "Eugenics Survey"—a field station to study Vermonters.

===Death===
He died on November 24, 1956 in Burlington, Vermont. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23351472 Henry Farnham Perkins] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, especially ([[Higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]], '''higher-dimensional algebra''' is the study of [[Categorification|categorified]] structures. It has applications in nonabelian [[algebraic topology]], and generalizes [[abstract algebra]].

==Higher-dimensional categories==

{{main article|Category theory#Higher-dimensional categories}}

A first step towards defining [[higher dimensional]] algebras is the concept of [[2-category]] of [[higher category theory]], followed by the more 'geometric' concept of   [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/fiorefolding.pdf double category].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |year = 1987
 |doi = 10.1112/plms/s3-54.1.176
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi = 10.1006/aima.1998.1724
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A higher level concept is thus defined as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of categories, or super-category, which generalises to higher dimensions the notion of [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &amp;ndash; regarded as any structure which is an interpretation of [[Lawvere]]'s axioms of the ''[[elementary theory of abstract categories]]'' (ETAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawvere | first1 = F. W. | year = 1964 | title = An Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets | url = http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/ | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 52| pages = 1506–1511 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.52.6.1506 | pmc = 300477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawvere, F. W.: 1966, The Category of Categories as a Foundation for Mathematics., in ''Proc. Conf. Categorical Algebra &amp;ndash; La Jolla''., Eilenberg, S. et al., eds. Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg and New York., pp. 1&amp;ndash;20. http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/&lt;/ref&gt; Ll.

,&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=420&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawvere | first1 = F. W. | year = 1969b | title = Adjointness in Foundations | url = http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/ | journal = Dialectica | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 281–295 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1969.tb01194.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a supercategory and also a [[functor category|super-category]], can be regarded as natural extensions of the concepts of [[multicategory|meta-category]],&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/AxiomsOfMetacategoriesAndSupercategories.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[multicategory]], and [[Turán graph|multi-graph, ''k''-partite graph]], or [[colored graph]] (see a [[color figure]], and also its definition in [[graph theory]]).

Supercategories were first introduced in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Supercategories3.html  Supercategory theory @ PlanetMath]&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently developed for applications in [[theoretical physics]] (especially [[quantum field theory]] and [[topological quantum field theory]]) and [[mathematical biology]] or [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/MathematicalBiologyAndTheoreticalBiophysics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pathways in HDA involve: [[bicategories]], homomorphisms of bicategories, [[variable categories]] (''aka'', indexed, or [[parametrized categories]]), [[topoi]], effective descent, and enriched and [[internal categories]].

==Double groupoids==
{{Main|double groupoid}}
In '''higher-dimensional algebra''' ('''HDA'''), a double groupoid is a generalisation of a one-dimensional [[groupoid]] to two dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=C.B. |last2=Spencer
 |title=Double groupoids and crossed modules
 |journal=Cahiers Top. Géom. Diff.
 |volume=17 |pages=343–362
 |year=1976
 |doi=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter groupoid can be considered as a special case of a category with all invertible arrows, or [[morphism]]s.

[[Double groupoid]]s are often used to capture information about [[geometrical]] objects such as [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional manifolds]] (or [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifolds]]).&lt;ref name="bangor"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, an [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifold]] is a space that locally looks like an [[n-dimensional Euclidean space|''n''-dimensional Euclidean space]], but whose global structure may be [[non-Euclidean]].

Double groupoids were first introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] in 1976, in ref.&lt;ref name="bangor" /&gt; and were further developed towards applications in [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/NAAT.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html ''Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology'' book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |date=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=249 Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Higher homotopy groupoids of filtered spaces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Nonabelian algebraic topology==
Many of the higher dimensional algebraic structures are [[noncommutative]] and, therefore, their study is a very significant part of nonabelian [[category theory]], and also of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT)&lt;ref name="bangor_a"&gt;*{{cite book |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=P.J. |last2=Higgins |first3=R. |last3=Sivera |title=Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology |url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |publisher= |volume=1 |year=2008 |isbn= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }} ([http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-t/partI010604.pdf Downloadable PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ems-ph.org/pdf/catalog.pdf Ronald Brown, Philip Higgins, Rafael Sivera, ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids'', in '''Tracts in Mathematics''' vol. '''15''' (2010), European Mathematical Society, 670 pages, {{ISBN|978-3-03719-083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407275 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' by Ronald Brown. 15 Jul 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Such algebraic structures in dimensions greater than 1 develop the nonabelian character of the fundamental group, and they are in a precise sense ''‘more nonabelian than the groups' ''.&lt;ref name="bangor_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/06/nonabelian_algebraic_topology.html ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' posted by John Baez&lt;/ref&gt; These noncommutative, or more specifically, [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] structures reflect more accurately the geometrical complications of higher dimensions than the known homology and [[homotopy groups]] commonly encountered in classical [[algebraic topology]].
An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of [[homotopy group]]oids and [[filtered space]]s. Noncommutative [[double groupoid]]s and double [[Lie algebroid|algebroid]]s are only the first examples of such higher dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) ''``can be applied to determine [[homotopy invariant]]s of spaces, and [[homotopy classification]] of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=374 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered Spaces, Crossed Complexes and Cubical Homotopy groupoids'', by Ronald Brown, Bangor University, UK, Philip J. Higgins, Durham University, UK Rafael Sivera, University of Valencia, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; Cubical omega-groupoids, higher [[homotopy group]]oids, [[crossed module]]s, [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|crossed complexes]] and [[Galois group]]oids are key concepts in developing applications related to homotopy of filtered spaces, higher dimensional space structures, the construction of the [[fundamental group]]oid of a topos E in the general theory of topoi, and also in their physical applications in nonabelian quantum theories, and recent developments in [[quantum gravity]], as well as categorical and [[topological dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/92r13230n3381746/ | doi=10.1007/s10516-007-9012-1 | volume=17 | title=A Non-Abelian, Categorical Ontology of Spacetimes and Quantum Gravity | year=2007 | journal=Axiomathes | pages=353–408 | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of [[noncommutative geometry]] formalizations of the [[noncommutative standard model]]s ''via'' fundamental double groupoids and [[spacetime]] structures even more general than [[topos|topoi]] or the lower-dimensional [[noncommutative spacetime]]s encountered in several [[topological quantum field theories]] and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity.

A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy [[van Kampen theorem]] proven by R. Brown which states that ``''the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable [[colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] over homotopy types of its pieces''''. A related example is that of van Kampen theorems for categories of [[covering morphism]]s in [[lextensive categories]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown and George Janelidze, van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, ''J. Pure Appl. Algebra''. '''119''':255–263, (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of generalisations of the van Kampen theorem include statements for [[2-category|2-categories]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050720094804/http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz [[Marta Bunge]] and Stephen Lack. Van Kampen theorems for 2-categories and toposes&lt;/ref&gt; and a topos of topoi [http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz].
Important results in HDA are also the extensions of the [[Galois theory]] in categories and [[variable categories]], or indexed/`parametrized' categories.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/gug14u1141214743/ | doi=10.1007/BF00872989 | volume=1 | title=Galois theory in variable categories | year=1993 | journal=Applied Categorical Structures | pages=103–110 | last1 = Janelidze | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt; The [[Joyal–Tierney representation theorem]] for topoi is also a generalisation of the Galois theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Joyal | first1 = Andres | last2 = Tierney | first2 = Myles | year = 1984| title = An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck | url = | isbn=0-8218-2312-4 |publisher=American Mathematical Society | volume = 309 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, indexing by bicategories in the sense of Benabou one also includes here the [[Joyal–Tierney theory]].&lt;ref&gt;'''MSC'''(1991): 18D30,11R32,18D35,18D05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Theoretical physics===
In [[quantum field theory]], there exist [[quantum category|quantum categories]].&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/QuantumCategory.html Quantum Categories of Quantum Groupoids&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AssociativityIsomorphism.html Rigid Monoidal Categories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quantum double groupoid]]s.&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress"&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/ March 18, 2009. A Note on Quantum Groupoids, posted by Jeffrey Morton under C*-algebras, deformation theory, groupoids, noncommutative geometry, quantization&lt;/ref&gt;/ One can consider [[quantum double groupoids]] to be [[fundamental group]]oids defined via a [[2-functor]], which allows one to think about the physically interesting case of [[quantum fundamental groupoid]]s (QFGs) in terms of the [[bicategory]] '''Span(Groupoids)''', and then constructing 2-[[Hilbert space]]s and 2-[[linear map]]s for manifolds and [[cobordism]]s. At the next step, one obtains [[cobordism]]s with corners via [[natural transformation]]s of such 2-functors. A claim was then made that, with the [[gauge group]] [[SU(2)]], "''the extended [[TQFT]], or ETQFT,  gives a theory equivalent to the [[Ponzano–Regge model]] of [[quantum gravity]]''";&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress" /&gt; similarly, the [[Turaev–Viro model]] would be then obtained with [[representation (mathematics)|representation]]s of SU&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(2). Therefore, one can describe the [[state space]] of a gauge theory – or many kinds of [[quantum field theories]] (QFTs) and local quantum physics, in terms of the [[transformation groupoid]]s given by symmetries, as for example in the case of a gauge theory, by the [[gauge transformation]]s acting on states that are, in this case, connections. In the case of symmetries related to [[quantum group]]s, one would obtain structures that are representation categories of [[quantum groupoid]]s,&lt;ref name="planetmath" /&gt; instead of the 2-[[vector space]]s that are representation categories of groupoids.

'''Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel'''  ([[colloquial]]: '''Infinite Hotel Paradox''' or '''Hilbert's Hotel''') is a [[thought experiment]] which illustrates a [[counterintuitive]] property of infinite sets. It is demonstrated that a fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms may still accommodate additional guests, even infinitely many of them, and this process may be repeated infinitely often. The idea was introduced by [[David Hilbert]] in a 1924 lecture "Über das Unendliche", reprinted in {{harv|Hilbert|2013|loc=p.730}}, and was popularized through [[George Gamow]]'s 1947 book ''[[One Two Three... Infinity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Kragh |first=Helge |title=The True (?) Story of Hilbert's Infinite Hotel |year=2014 |eprint=1403.0059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gamow |first=George |year=1947 |title=One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science |location=New York |publisher=Viking Press |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paradox==
Consider a hypothetical hotel with a [[countable set|countably infinite]] number of rooms, all of which are occupied. One might be tempted to think that the hotel would not be able to accommodate any newly arriving guests, as would be the case with a finite number of rooms, where the [[pigeonhole principle]] would apply.

===Finitely many new guests===
Suppose a new guest arrives and wishes to be accommodated in the hotel. We can (simultaneously) move the guest currently in room 1 to room 2, the guest currently in room 2 to room 3, and so on, moving every guest from his current room ''n'' to room ''n''+1.  After this, room 1 is empty and the new guest can be moved into that room. By repeating this procedure, it is possible to make room for any finite number of new guests.

===Infinitely many new guests===
It is also possible to accommodate a ''countably infinite'' number of new guests: just move the person occupying room 1 to room 2, the guest occupying room 2 to room 4, and, in general, the guest occupying room ''n'' to room 2''n'' (2 times ''n''),  and all the odd-numbered rooms (which are countably infinite) will be free for the new guests.

===Infinitely many coaches with infinitely many guests each===
{{Details|Pairing function}}
It is possible to accommodate countably infinitely many [[coach (bus)|coach]]loads of countably infinite passengers each, by several different methods. Most methods depend on the seats in the coaches being already numbered (or use the [[axiom of countable choice]]). In general any [[pairing function]] can be used to solve this problem. For each of these methods, consider a passenger's seat number on a coach to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and their coach number to be &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and the numbers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are then fed into the two arguments of the [[pairing function]].

====Prime powers method====

Empty the odd numbered rooms by sending the guest in room &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to room &lt;math&gt;2^i&lt;/math&gt;, then put the first coach's load in rooms &lt;math&gt;3^n&lt;/math&gt;, the second coach's load in rooms &lt;math&gt;5^n&lt;/math&gt;; for coach number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; we use the rooms &lt;math&gt;p^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;th odd [[prime number]]. This solution leaves certain rooms empty (which may or may not be useful to the hotel); specifically, all odd numbers that are not [[prime powers]], such as 15 or 847, will no longer be occupied. (So, strictly speaking, this shows that the number of arrivals is ''less than or equal to'' the number of vacancies created. It is easier to show, by an independent means, that the number of arrivals is also ''greater than or equal to'' the number of vacancies, and thus that they are ''equal'', than to modify the algorithm to an exact fit.) (The algorithm works equally well if one interchanges &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but whichever choice is made, it must be applied uniformly throughout.)

====Prime factorization method====

You can put each person of a certain seat &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and coach &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; into room &lt;math&gt;2^s 3^c&lt;/math&gt; (presuming ''c''=0 for the people already in the hotel, 1 for the first coach, etc. ...). Because every number has a unique [[prime factorization]], it's easy to see all people will have a room, while no two people will end up in the same room. For example, the person in room 2592 (&lt;math&gt;2^5  3^4&lt;/math&gt;) was sitting in on the 4th coach, on the 5th seat. Like the prime powers method, this solution leaves certain rooms empty.

This method can also easily be expanded for infinite nights, infinite entrances, etc. ... ( &lt;math&gt;2^s 3^c 5^n 7^e&lt;/math&gt; )

==== Interleaving method ====

For each passenger, compare the lengths of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; as written in any positional [[numeral system]], such as [[decimal]]. (Treat each hotel resident as being in coach #0.) If either number is shorter, add [[leading zero]]es to it until both values have the same number of digits. [[Interleave sequence|Interleave]] the digits to produce a room number: its digits will be [first digit of coach number]-[first digit of seat number]-[second digit of coach number]-[second digit of seat number]-etc. The hotel (coach #0) guest in room number 1729 moves to room 01070209 (i.e., room 1,070,209.) The passenger on seat 1234 of coach 789 goes to room 01728394 (or just 1728394).

Unlike the prime powers solution, this one fills the hotel completely, and we can reconstruct a guest's original coach and seat by reversing the interleaving process. First add a leading zero if the room has an odd number of digits. Then de-interleave the number into two numbers: the seat number consists of the odd-numbered digits and the coach number is the even-numbered ones. Of course, the original encoding is arbitrary, and the roles of the two numbers can be reversed (seat-odd and coach-even), so long as it is applied consistently.

====Triangular number method====

Those already in the hotel will be moved to room &lt;math&gt;(n^2+n)/2&lt;/math&gt;, or the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[triangular number]].  Those in a coach will be in room &lt;math&gt; ((c+n-1)^2+c+n-1)/2+n&lt;/math&gt;, or the &lt;math&gt;(c+n-1)&lt;/math&gt; triangular number plus &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In this way all the rooms will be filled by one, and only one, guest.

This pairing function can be demonstrated visually by structuring the hotel as a one-room-deep, infinitely tall [[pyramid]]. The pyramid's topmost row is a single room: room 1; its second row is rooms 2 and 3; and so on. The column formed by the set of rightmost rooms will correspond to the triangular numbers. Once they are filled (by the hotel's redistributed occupants), the remaining empty rooms form the shape of a pyramid exactly identical to the original shape. Thus, the process can be repeated for each infinite set. Doing this one at a time for each coach would require an infinite number of steps, but by using the prior formulas, a guest can determine what his room "will be" once his coach has been reached in the process, and can simply go there immediately.

====Arbitrary enumeration method====

Let &lt;math&gt; S := \{(a, b) \mid a, b \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is countable since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is countable, hence we may enumerate its elements &lt;math&gt;s_1, s_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt;. Now if &lt;math&gt;s_n = (a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, assign the &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;th guest of the &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;th coach to the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th room (consider the guests already in the hotel as guests of the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;th coach). Thus we have a function assigning each person to a room; furthermore, this assignment does not skip over any rooms.

===Further layers of infinity===

Suppose the hotel is next to an ocean, and an infinite number of [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferries]] arrive, each bearing an infinite number of coaches, each with an infinite number of passengers. This is a situation involving three "levels" of [[infinity]], and it can be solved by extensions of any of the previous solutions.

The prime factorization method can be applied by adding a new prime number for every additional layer of infinity ( &lt;math&gt;2^s 3^c 5^f&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; the ferry).

The prime power solution can be applied with further [[exponentiation]] of prime numbers, resulting in very large room numbers even given small inputs. For example, the passenger in the second seat of the third bus on the second ferry (address 2-3-2) would raise the 2nd odd prime (5) to 49, which is the result of the 3rd odd prime (7) being raised to the power of his seat number (2). This room number would have over thirty decimal digits.

The interleaving method can be used with three interleaved "strands" instead of two. The passenger with the address 2-3-2 would go to room 232, while the one with the address 4935-198-82217 would go to room #008,402,912,391,587 (the leading zeroes can be removed).

Anticipating the possibility of any number of layers of infinite guests, the hotel may wish to assign rooms such that no guest will need to move, no matter how many guests arrive afterward. One solution is to convert each arrival's address into a [[binary number]] in which ones are used as separators at the start of each layer, while a number within a given layer (such as a guests' coach number) is represented with that many zeroes. Thus, a guest with the prior address 2-5-1-3-1 (five infinite layers) would go to room 10010000010100010 (decimal 295458).

As an added step in this process, one zero can be removed from each section of the number; in this example, the guest's new room is 101000011001 (decimal 2585). This ensures that every room could be filled by a hypothetical guest. If no infinite sets of guests arrive, then only rooms that are a power of two will be occupied.

====Infinite layers of nesting====
Although a room can be found for any finite number of nested infinities of people, the same is not always true for an infinite number of layers, even if a finite number of elements exists at each layer.

The set of real numbers, and the set of guests in this example, is [[uncountably infinite]]. Because no one-to-one pairing can be made between countable and uncountable sets, rooms at the hotel cannot be made for all of these guests, although any countably infinite subset of them can still be accommodated.

If this variant is modified in certain ways, then the set of people is countable again. For example, suppose there ''were'' a largest ship, directly containing a finite (or countably infinite) number of both ships and people, and each of these ships in turn contained both ships and people, and so forth. This time, any given person is a finite number of levels "down" from the top, and thus can be identified with a unique finite address. The set of people is countable again, even if the total number of layers is infinite, because we do not have to consider an "infinitieth layer" in either direction.

== Analysis ==
Hilbert's paradox is a [[veridical paradox]]: it leads to a counter-intuitive result that is provably true. The statements "there is a guest to every room" and "no more guests can be accommodated" are not [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] when there are infinitely many rooms.

Initially, this state of affairs might seem to be counter-intuitive. The properties of "infinite collections of things" are quite different from those of "finite collections of things". The paradox of Hilbert's Grand Hotel can be understood by using Cantor's theory of [[transfinite number]]s. Thus, while in an ordinary (finite) hotel with more than one room, the number of odd-numbered rooms is obviously smaller than the total number of rooms. However, in Hilbert's aptly named Grand Hotel, the quantity of odd-numbered rooms is not smaller than the total "number" of rooms. In mathematical terms, the [[cardinality]] of the [[subset]] containing the odd-numbered rooms is the same as the cardinality of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all rooms. Indeed, infinite sets are characterized as sets that have proper subsets of the same cardinality. For countable sets (sets with the same cardinality as the [[natural number]]s) this cardinality is [[aleph-null|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Rucker&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rucker |first1=Rudy |authorlink=Rudy Rucker |title=Infinity and the Mind. The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite |date=1984 |origyear=1982&lt;!--Harvester Press--&gt; |publisher=Paladin |isbn=0-586-08465-7 |pages=73–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rephrased, for any countably infinite set, there exists a [[bijective]] function which maps the countably infinite set to the set of natural numbers, even if the countably infinite set contains the natural numbers. For example, the set of rational numbers—those numbers which can be written as a quotient of integers—contains the natural numbers as a subset, but is no bigger than the set of natural numbers since the rationals are countable: there is a bijection from the naturals to the rationals.

==Reckoning of time among other entities==
[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|frame|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]

===Among the Pitṛs (''forefathers'')===

* 1 day of pitras = 1 solar ''masa'' (month) &lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 30 days of pitras = 1 month of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 12 months of pitras = 1 year of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
The Lifespan of the pitras is 100 years of pitras (3,000 Solar years).&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;

===Among the Devas===

The life span of any Hindu [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] spans nearly (or more than) 4.5&amp;nbsp;million years. Statistically, we can also look it as:
* 12000 Deva Years = Life Span of Devas = 1 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ICDiER4Wy&amp;sig=mvB9BIjm8SmryEb0nKku0olSyoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6uHlktHVAhUGP48KHcKDDXQQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&amp;f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|page=50|author=Hans Kng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Time measurement section of the [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows:
* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas
* 4,000 + 400 + 400 = 4,800 divine years (= 1,728,000 human years) = 1 [[Satya Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 3,000 + 300 + 300 = 3,600 divine years (= 1,296,000 human years) = 1 [[Treta Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 2,000 + 200 + 200 = 2,400 divine years (= 864,000 human years) = 1 [[Dvapara Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 1,000 + 100 + 100 = 1,200 divine years (= 432,000 human years) = 1 [[Kali Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 12,000 divine year = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mahā-Yuga (also is equaled to 12000 Daiva (divine) Yuga)&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* [2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;

===For Brahma===
* 1000 Mahā-Yugas = 1 Kalpa = 1 day (day only) of Brahma
(2 ''Kalpas'' constitute a day and night of Brahma, 8.64&amp;nbsp;billion human years)
* 30 days of Brahma = 1 month of Brahma (259.2&amp;nbsp;billion human years)
* 12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma (3.1104&amp;nbsp;trillion human years)
* 50 years of Brahma = 1 Parārdha (156,764,160,000,000 human years)
* 2 parardhas = 100 years of Brahma = 1 Para = 1 Mahā-Kalpa (the lifespan of Brahma) (313,528,320,000,000 human years)

One day of Brahma is divided into 1000 parts called ''charaṇas''.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|author=Bryan E.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

The cycle repeats itself, so altogether there are 1,000 cycles of Mahā-Yuga in one day of Brahma.

:*One cycle of the above four ''Yuga''s is one '''Mahā-Yuga''' (4.32&amp;nbsp;million [[solar year]]s)
:*as is confirmed by the Gītā Śloka 8.17 (statement) "sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ", meaning, a day of brahma is of 1000 Mahā-Yuga. Thus a day of Brahma, Kalpa, is of duration: 4.32 billion solar years. Two ''Kalpa''s constitute a day and night (Adhi Sandhi) of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/8/verse/17|title=Bhagavad Gita The Song of God|author=Swami Mukundananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*A ''Manvantara'' consists of 71 Mahā-Yuga (306,720,000 solar years). Each Manvantara is ruled by a Manu.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*After each Manvantara follows one ''[[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla'' of the same duration as a ''Kṛta Yuga'' (1,728,000 = 4 Charaṇas). (It is said that during a [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla, the entire earth is submerged in water.)&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*A ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]'' consists of a period of 4.32 Billion solar years followed by 14 Manvataras and [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kalas.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:* A day of Brahma equals
::(14 times 71 Mahā-Yuga) + (15 × 4 Charaṇas)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga  +  (15 * 4800)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + (72,000 years)[deva years] / 6 = 12,000[deva years] viz. one maha yuga.
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + 6 Mahā-Yuga
::= 1,000 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;

==Current date==

Currently, 50 years of Brahma have elapsed. The last Kalpa at the end of the 50th year is called Padma Kalpa. We are currently in the first 'day' of the 51st year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Brahma's day, Kalpa is named as Shveta-Varaha Kalpa. Within this Day, six Manvantaras have already elapsed&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the seventh Manvantara, named as – Vaivasvatha Manvantara (or Sraddhadeva Manvantara). Within the Vaivasvatha Manvantara, 27 Mahayugas&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"/&gt; (4 Yugas together is a Mahayuga), and the Krita,&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 23&lt;/ref&gt; Treta and Dwapara Yugas of the 28th Mahayuga have elapsed. This Kaliyuga is in the 28th Mahayuga. This Kaliyuga began in the year 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian Calendar.&lt;ref name="Burgess, p17"&gt;Burgess, p17&lt;/ref&gt; Since 50 years of Brahma have already elapsed, this is the second Parardha, also called as Dvithiya Parardha.
 
===Calculating the elapsed time since current Brahma's creation===
 
432000 × 10 × 1000 × 2 = 8.64&amp;nbsp;billion years (2 Kalpa (day and night))
 
8.64 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; × 30 × 12 = 3.1104 Trillion Years (1 year of Brahma)&lt;br /&gt;3.1104 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; × 50 = 155.52&amp;nbsp;trillion years (50 years of Brahma)
 
(6 × 71 × 4320000) + 7 × 1.728 × 10^6 = 1852416000 years elapsed in first six Manvataras, and Sandhi Kalas in the current [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]
 
27 × 4320000 = 116640000 years elapsed in first 27 Mahayugas of the current Manvantara
 
1.728 × 10^6 + 1.296 × 10^6 + 864000 = 3888000 years elapsed in current Mahayuga
 
3102 + 2017 = 5119 years elapsed in current Kaliyuga.
 
So the total time elapsed since current Brahma is
 
155520000000000 + 1852416000 + 116640000 + 3888000 + 5119 = '''''155,521,972,949,120 years'''''

(one hundred fifty-five trillion, five hundred twenty-one billion, nine hundred seventy-two million, nine hundred forty-nine thousand, one hundred twenty years) as of 2018 AD

Total age of Brahma is 100 (Brahma Years) which is equal to '''''311,040,000,000,000 Human years'''''
 
The current Kali Yuga began at midnight 17 February / 18 February in 3102 BCE in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Ebenezer [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Translation of the Sûrya-Siddhânta: A text-book of Hindu astronomy, with notes and an appendix''] Originally published: ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''6''' (1860) 141–498 , p17"&lt;/ref&gt; As per the information above about Yuga periods, only 5,120 years are passed out of 432,000 years of current Kali Yuga, and hence another 426,880 years are left to complete this 28th Kali Yuga of Vaivaswatha Manvantara.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], guru of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]],  The ascending phase of the Kali Yuga began in September 499 CE. Since September 1699, we have been in the ascending phase of the Dwapara Yuga. According to Sri Yukteswar, nobody wanted to announce the bad news of the beginning of the descending Kali Yuga, so they kept adding years to the Dvapara date (at that time 2400 Dvapara) only retitling the epoch to Kali.{{sfn|Yukteswar|1949}}}}

The '''Hyde Park Barracks Museum''' is a brick building and [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] designed by convict architect [[Francis Greenway]] between 1818 and 1819; originally built at the head of [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] (1819) to house [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] men and boys.

The site is managed by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] as a [[museum]] open to the public for a modest fee. The site is listed on [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045722|Hyde Park Barracks|hr=00190|fn=S90/01189; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commonwealth Heritage List]], and is inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] as one of 11 pre-eminent [[Australian Convict Sites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories and Histories|url=http://www.hht.net.au/discover/highlights/articles/barracks_world_heritage_listing|website=Sydney Living History Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as amongst "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts."&lt;ref name="WorldHeritage02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1306|website=World Heritage Convention|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/australian-convict-sites-world%20heritage-nomination|website=Department of the Environment|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Image:HydeParkBarracksDrawingHardyWilson1914.jpg|Hyde Park Barracks in a 1914 drawing by [[William Hardy Wilson]]|thumb|upright|left]]

Constructed by convict labour by order of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]], the Barracks is one of the most familiar works of the accomplished colonial England-born, Australian architect [[Francis Howard Greenway]]. As the principal male convict barracks in [[New South Wales]] it provided lodgings for convicts working in government employment around Sydney until its closure in mid-1848.

It has had many occupants since then.  It was an Immigration Depot for single female immigrants seeking work as domestic servants and awaiting family reunion from 1848 to 1886 and also a female asylum from 1862 to 1886.  From 1887 to 1979 law courts and government offices were based at the Barracks. Construction began in 1817.

== Museum ==
In 1991, Hyde Park Barracks underwent conservation and adaptation work by award-winning architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and conservation architects [[Clive Lucas|Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners]]. The completed project won the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] national Lachlan Macquarie Award in 1992. Now, the newly installed Hyde Park Barracks is a museum operated by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.  Tourists who visit the building discover the daily lives of convicts and other occupants through exhibitions on Sydney's male convict labour force, Australia's convict system, an innovative soundscape, excavated artefacts, exposed layers of building fabric and the complex's rooms and spaces.

In June 2015, [[Mark Speakman]] the [[Minister for the Environment (New South Wales)|Minister for the Environment of New South Wales]] announced Unlocking Heritage, a two-year program aimed at giving children the opportunity to experience Sydney's living museums. This program will allow students to wear convict clothing and sleep in the Barrack's hammocks. A million dollars has been allocated for this program. Museum director Mark Goggin thinks that children will learn more about history if they can experience it hands-on, '"Particularly for the kids to wear the convict shirts, eat the gruel, sleep over with their mates in hammocks and imagining what life was like 200 years ago."' The program is starting out with children and hoping to expand to adult participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donegan|first1=John|title=Sydney's Hyde Park Barracks site of student sleepover as museum receives funding injection|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/new-funding-to-make-sydney-living-museums-more-accessible/6538892|publisher=702 ABC Sydney|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage listing ==
In July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Hyde Park Barracks and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the [[Australian Convict Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = UNESCO World Heritage Centre – World Heritage Committee inscribes seven cultural sites on World Heritage List |work = UNESCO World Heritage Centre website | publisher = United Nations | date = 31 July 2010 | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/642 | accessdate = 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing explains that the 11 sites present "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts". Of the 11 sites the [[Great North Road, Australia|Old Great North Road]], [[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House]] at Parramatta and [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] are also within the Sydney region.

== Operations ==
According to the Living Museum website, the fees for admission as of 2015 are $10 for adult admission, $5 for children or commissions, $20 for families (two adults and two children) and free to members.  Group and school tours are available by phoning the museum. Hours of operation are 10am – 5pm daily. Closed on Christmas and Good Friday. The Hyde Barracks are one fourth of the Sydney Living History Museum series. The other three are the [[Susannah Place Museum]], the [[Museum of Sydney]] and the Justice &amp; Police Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Living Museums – Hyde Park Barracks Museum|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/hyde-park-barracks-museum|website=Sydney Living Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pass can be purchased at any of the locations that will enable visitors to visit all four locations at a discounted price.

      <comment>Hard incompatibilism is the "bad" thing here, not giving up belief in it (what Smilansky endorses).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20367">In [[law]], [[economics]] and the [[social sciences]], '''inequality of bargaining power''' is where one party to a "bargain", [[contract]] or agreement, has more and better alternatives than the other party. This results in one party having greater "power" than the other to choose not to take the deal and makes it more likely that this party will gain more favourable terms. Inequality of bargaining power is where some believe that [[freedom of contract]] ceases to be real freedom, or that some have more freedom than others, and that it represents a place at which [[Market failure|markets fail]].

Where [[bargaining power]] is persistently unequal, the concept of inequality of bargaining power serves as a justification for the implication of mandatory terms into contracts by law, or the non-enforcement of a contract by the courts.

==Historical development==
The concept of inequality of bargaining power was long recognised, particularly with regard to workers. In the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' [[Adam Smith]] wrote,

{{Cquote|It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides, authorizes, or at least does not prohibit their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Beatrice Webb]] and [[Sidney Webb]] in their treatise ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' significantly expanded on the critique of 19th century labour conditions and advocated a comprehensive system of [[labour law]] contained a chapter called, "The Higgling of the Market". They argued that the labour market was dominated by employers, and therefore had the same effect as [[monopsony]]. Workers generally are more under pressure to sell their labour than an employer is under to buy it. An employer can hold out longer, because typically he will have greater financial reserves. This means that much labour is supplied merely out of necessity, than free choice (shifting the supply curve to the right) and it is a false kind of competitive environment. The Webbs also pointed out that discrimination can decrease job opportunities for women or minorities, and that the legal institutions underpinning the market were skewed in favour of employers. Most importantly, they believed that a large pool of unemployed people was a constant downward drag on the ability of workers to bargain for better conditions.

{{Cquote|When the unemployed are crowding round the factory gates every morning, it is plain to each man that, unless he can induce the foreman to select him rather than another, his chance of subsistence for weeks to come may be irretrievably lost. Under these circumstances bargaining, in the case of the individual isolated workmen, becomes absolutely impossible.&lt;ref&gt;S Webb and B Webb, ''Industrial Democracy'' (1897) 660&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Webbs felt that these factors all added up to systemic inequality of bargaining power between workers and employers. The first ever use of the phrase "inequality of bargaining power", however, appears to have been by the British philosopher, [[John Beattie Crozier]] in ''The Wheel of Wealth''.&lt;ref&gt;JB Crozier, ''The Wheel of Wealth; Being a Reconstruction of the Science and Art of Political Economy on the Lines'' (1906) Part III, ch 2, ‘On the tendency to inequality’, 377,&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|There must always be an inequality of bargaining power between masters and men in every contract, until that day shall arrive when the sacrifices of each master in a strike or lock out will affect his present comfort and future destiny as seriously, in its way, as it does that of each of his workmen.}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The real measure of market power is not whether a supplier presents his terms on a take-it-or-leave basis but whether the consumer, if he decides to ‘leave it’ has available to him a workably competitive range of alternative sources of supply. Whether this is or is not so simply cannot be derived intuitively from the fact that a particular supplier is offering non-negotiable standard-form terms. It is a matter for independent inquiry. If the market is workably competitive, any supplier offering uncompetitive standard form terms will have to reformulate his total package of price and non-price terms to prevent consumers (at least consumers at the margin, which are the decisive consideration in such a market) from switching their business to other competitors....

Non-economists often overlook the importance of marginal analysis in this context. For example, if only 10 per cent of the buyers of insurance policies or dry-cleaning services studied all terms scrupulously before contracting an were influence in their choice of policy by their evaluation of the so-called fine print clauses, and if no supplier of insurance or dry-cleaning services was able to ‘term discriminate’ between these consumers and other consumers in the market, there would be strong competitive pressures on each supplier to adjust the terms of his contracts so as to avoid losing this potential business....

When one asks why, many consumers probably rely in part on the constraints imposed by other consumers at the margin (ie, they let the market shop for them)."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[H Beale]], ‘Inequality of bargaining power’ (1986) 6(1) OJLS 123, 127
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The point is obvious but worth making because it affects the conditions under which relief should be given: whereas advice as to value will normally save the contract with the ‘poor and ignorant person’, the master of the ship drifting onto the rocks would still have been open to exploitation even if he had had the entire House of Lords on board to advise him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal use==

*''[[Schroeder Music Publishing Co Ltd v Macaulay]]'' [1974] 1 WLR 1308, 1316, per Lord Diplock: “To be in a position to adopt this [‘take it or leave it’] attitude toward a party desirous of entering into a contract to obtain goods or services provides a classic instance of superior bargaining power.”

===Consumer laws===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In so far as the reduction of costs of production and distribution thus achieved is reflected in reduced prices, society as a whole ultimately benefits from the use of standard contracts… The use of contracts has, however, another aspect which has become increasingly important. Standard contracts are typically used by enterprises with strong bargaining power. The weaker party, in need of the goods or services, is frequently not in a position to shop around for better terms, either because the author of the standard contract has a monopoly (natural or artificial) or because all competitors use the same clauses. His contractual intention is but a subjection more or less voluntary to terms dictated by the stronger party, terms whose consequences are often understood only in a vague way, if at all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In that regard, the matters to be taken into account by the competent national court include the economic and legal context in which the parties find themselves and, as the United Kingdom Government rightly points out, the respective [[bargaining power]] and conduct of the two parties to the contract. In particular, it is for the national court to ascertain whether the party who claims to have suffered loss through concluding a contract that is liable to restrict or distort competition found himself in a markedly weaker position than the other party, such as seriously to compromise or even eliminate his freedom to negotiate the terms of the contract and his capacity to avoid the loss or reduce its extent, in particular by availing himself in good time of all the legal remedies available to him."

===Labour laws===
{{see also|Labour law}}
*''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'' 169 US 366 (1898) Utah law limiting work hours upheld, Brown J
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many states has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules, and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Adair v. United States]]'', 209 U.S. 161, 175 (1908) "the employer and the employee have equality of right and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in our free land.”

*''[[France v James Coombes &amp; Co]]'' [1929] AC 496, 505-6, in a case restricting the definition of ‘employee’ for the purpose of s 8 Trade Boards Act 1909, 1918, for an order to give a minimum wage to boot workers, where the worker was not working all the time when he was in the shop Lord Atkin said, ‘the presumed necessity for fixing any minimum wage rate at all in any particular trade is due to the apprehension on the part of the Minister that in its absence workmen in that trade may have imposed upon them wages which they ought not to be asked to accept, but which, either as a result of competition in the labour market or deficient bargaining power, they are not in a position to refuse’
*[[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 Section 1, at 29 U.S.C. §151
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129, 1219, per Lord Devlin,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is easy now to see that Parliament in 1906 might have felt that the only way of giving labour an equality of bargaining power with capital was to give it special immunities which the common law did not permit. Even now, when the scales have been redressed, it is easy to see that Parliament might think that a strike, whether reprehensible or not, ought not to be made a ground for litigation and that industrial peace should be sought by other means."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]]'' [1996] [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1996/26.html#fnB51 ZACC 26], [66], "A related argument was that the principle of equality requires that, if the right to strike is included in the NT, so should the right to lock out be included. This argument is based on the proposition that the right of employers to lock out is the necessary equivalent of the right of workers to strike and that therefore, in order to treat workers and employers equally, both should be recognised in the NT. That proposition cannot be accepted. Collective bargaining is based on the recognition of the fact that employers enjoy greater social and economic power than individual workers. Workers therefore need to act in concert to provide them collectively with sufficient power to bargain effectively with employers. Workers exercise collective power primarily through the mechanism of strike action. In theory, employers, on the other hand, may exercise power against workers through a range of weapons, such as dismissal, the employment of alternative or replacement labour, the unilateral implementation of new terms and conditions of employment, and the exclusion of workers from the workplace (the last of these being generally called a lockout). The importance of the right to strike for workers has led to it being far more frequently entrenched in constitutions as a fundamental right than is the right to lock out. The argument that it is necessary in order to maintain equality to entrench the right to lock out once the right to strike has been included, cannot be sustained, because the right to strike and the right to lock out are not always and necessarily equivalent."

===Landlord and tenant===
*''[[Rugby Joint Water Board v Footit]]'' [1973] AC 202, Lord Simon, landlord and tenant
*''[[Johnson v Moreton]]'' [1980] AC 37, [[Jocelyn Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale|Lord Simon]], "There was one economic and social relationship where it was claimed that there were palpably lacking the prerequisites for the beneficent operation of laisser-faire - that of landlord and tenant. The market was limited and sluggish: the supply of land could not expand immediately and flexibly in response to demand, and even humble dwellings took more time to erect than those in want of them could spare. Generally, a man became a tenant rather than an owner-occupier because his circumstances compelled him to live hand-to-mouth; the landlord's purse was generally longer and his command of knowledge and counsel far greater than the tenant's. In short, it was held, the constriction of the market and the inequality of bargaining power enabled the landlord to dictate contractual terms which did not necessarily operate to the general benefit of society. It was to counteract this descried constriction of the market and to redress this descried inequality of bargaining power that the law - specifically, in the shape of legislation - came to intervene repeatedly to modify freedom of contract between landlord and tenant. Since Maine the movement of many "progressive" societies has been reversed. The holding of a statutory or a protected tenancy is rather a status than a pure creature of contract."
*''[[Attorney General of Canada v Nav Canada]]'' (2008) FC 71, [19] Hugessen J of the Canadian Federal Court, approved the purpose of the Residential Tenancy Act in the Northwest Territories (replicated across Canadian provinces) as follows: ‘Bearing in mind the usual disparity of bargaining power and financial resources between such tenants and their landlords, the Act is evidently intended to restore the balance of power through the public employment of a rental officer to try and mediate and, if necessary, to adjudicate disputes between them.’ The Canadian Residential Tenancy Acts say residential tenancies can only be terminated with good reasons, and limit annual rental increases to a figure set by a Central Board. It should be appreciated how this differs from rent control laws, which place inflexible ceilings on any increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Interactive cinema''' tries to give the audience an active role in the showing of movies. The movie ''[[Kinoautomat]]'' by [[Czechoslovakia]]n director [[Raduz Cincera]] presented in the Czech Pavilion at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]] is considered to be the first cinema-like interactive movie.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The availability of computers for the display of [[interactive video]] has made it easier to create interactive movies.

Another newer definition of interactive cinema is a [[video game]] which is a hybrid between participation and viewing, giving the player - or viewer, as it were - a strong amount of control in the characters' decisions. A prominent pioneer of such a technique is the successful [[Hideo Kojima]], whose gameplay often takes a priority to the storyline and long cutscenes. His game ''[[Policenauts]]'', a point and click adventure game which has shootout sequences (that make use of the [[lightgun]] peripheral on the [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game), has a subtitle which reads "Interactive cinema" on the cover art of all versions of said game, which is an early example of a prominent game developer labelling their game as such. In 1999, [[Sega]]'s [[Shenmue]] video game series was highly praised for its implementation of interactive cinematic elements. Designed by [[Yu Suzuki]], he stated that his goal "was to create a game that was intricate and lifelike by merging the cinematic qualities of movies and the interactivity of computer games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moltenbrey |first=Karen |url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2001/Volume-24-Issue-3-March-2001-/Gaming-gets-real.aspx |title=Gaming gets real |publisher=cgw.com |date=2001-03-03 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent incarnation of an idea similar to this one is ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'', (censored version released in US and Canada as "Indigo Prophecy") a game dubbed as "interactive cinema" by its France-based developer, [[Quantic Dream]].

1992 saw the release of [[North America]]'s first interactive motion picture, [[I'm Your Man (film)|I'm Your Man]]. Certain [[Loews Theatres]] locations were retrofitted with controllers to allow audiences to vote on decisions made by the main character. Although initially touted as the first step toward [[virtual reality]] cinema, the experiment was a failure and the equipment was removed from theaters by 1994.

The '''internal affairs doctrine''' is a [[choice of law]] rule in [[corporations law]].  Simply stated, it provides that the "internal affairs" of a [[corporation]] (e.g. conflicts between [[shareholder]]s and [[management]] figures such as the [[board of directors]] and [[corporate officer]]s) will be governed by the corporate [[statute]]s and [[case law]] of the state in which the corporation is [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], sometimes referred to as the '''''lex incorporationis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar v. MITE Corp.'', 457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McDermott Inc. v. Lewis'', 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical effects of the doctrine==
The internal affairs doctrine ensures that such issues as voting rights of shareholders, distributions of [[dividend]]s and corporate [[property]], and the [[fiduciary]] obligations of management are all determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the company is incorporated.  On the other hand, the "external affairs" of a corporation, such as [[labor law|labor and employment]] issues and [[Tax law|tax liability]], are typically governed by the law of the state in which the corporation is doing business. Some issues and activities, such as [[contract]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], and sales of [[Security (finance)|securities]] to third parties, may be governed both by the laws of the state of incorporation and by the laws of the state in which the transaction takes place, and in some cases, by [[federal law]] as well (for example, [[United States securities law]] and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]).

==Relation to federalism==
{{see also|Federalism in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], each [[U.S. state|state]] has the power to set its own corporate law.  Because of this, and the fact that the internal affairs doctrine has been used by courts to allow application of the ''lex incorporationis'', this has created a competitive market for incorporations among the states.  Several states have taken advantage of this situation by becoming [[corporate haven]]s, particularly [[Delaware]] and [[Nevada]].  Likewise, many jurisdictions apply the internal affairs doctrine internationally, which has permitted [[offshore financial centre]]s to flourish.

'''Irreducible complexity''' ('''IC''') is the idea that certain [[biological system]]s cannot [[evolution|evolve]] by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through [[natural selection]]. Irreducible complexity is central to the [[creationism|creationist]] concept of [[intelligent design]], but it is rejected by the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"&gt;"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."

The theological [[teleological argument|argument from design]] was presented in [[creation science]] with assertions that evolution could not explain complex molecular mechanisms, and in 1993 [[Michael Behe]], a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, presented these arguments in a revised version of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; In his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' he called this ''irreducible complexity'' and said it made evolution through natural selection of random mutations impossible.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael |title= Darwin's Black Box |publisher= Free Press |location= New York |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-0-684-82754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the mistaken assumption that evolution relies on improvement of existing functions, ignoring how complex adaptations originate from changes in function, and disregarding published research.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; [[evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] have published rebuttals showing how systems discussed by Behe can evolve,&lt;ref name="thornton2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redundant Complexity"/&gt; and examples documented through [[comparative genomics]] show that complex molecular systems are formed by the addition of components as revealed by different temporal origins of their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602072257/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |archivedate=2014-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-341|title=Evolution of xyloglucan-related genes in green plants|first1=Luiz Eduardo V.|last1=Del Bem|first2=Michel GA|last2=Vincentz|date=5 November 2010|publisher=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=10|pages=341|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=BioMed Central|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Michael Behe]] defined irreducible complexity in natural selection in his book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Black Box'' page 39 in the 2006 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second definition given by Behe (his "evolutionary definition") is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex evolutionary pathway is one that contains one or more unselected steps (that is, one or more necessary-but-unselected mutations). The degree of irreducible complexity is the number of unselected steps in the pathway.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison'', July 31, 2000, [http://www.discovery.org/a/442 Discovery Institute article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906193225/http://www.discovery.org/a/442 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Intelligent design advocate [[William A. Dembski]] gives this definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system.&lt;ref&gt;''No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence.'' by William Dembski pp. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The argument from irreducible complexity is a descendant of the [[teleological argument]] for God (the argument from design or from complexity). This states that because certain things in nature appear very complicated, they must have been designed. [[William Paley]] famously argued, in his 1802 [[watchmaker analogy]], that complexity in nature implies a God for the same reason that the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker.&lt;ref name="paley"/&gt; This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ii.34,&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature of the Gods'', translated by Francis Brooks, London: Methuen, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Henry Hallam]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpDzTASTVwsC&amp;pg=PA385 ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1854] volume 2 page 385 part iii chapter iii section i paragraph 26 footnote ''u''&lt;/ref&gt; written in 45 BC.

====Up to the 18th century====

[[Galen]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) wrote about the large number of parts of the body and their relationships, which observation was cited as evidence for creation.&lt;ref&gt;''De Formatione Foetus''=''The Construction of the Embryo'', chapter 11 in ''Galen: Selected Works'', translated by P. N. Singer, ''The World's Classics'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-19-282450-9}}. One 18th-century reference to Galen is [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm#A13 [[David Hume]] ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', 1779, Part 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122134556/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm |date=2005-11-22 }}, &amp;sect; 3, page 215. Also see Galen's ''De Usu Partium''=''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'', translated and edited by Margaret Tallmadge May, Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1968, especially book XVII. For a relevant discussion of Galen and other ancients see pages 121-122, {{cite book |author= Goodman, Lenn Evan |title= Creation and evolution |location= Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon and New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-415-91380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the interdependence between parts would have implications for the origins of living things was raised by writers starting with [[Pierre Gassendi]] in the mid-17th century&lt;ref&gt;''De Generatione Animalium'', chapter III. Partial translation in: Howard B. Adelmann, ''Marcello Malpighi and the Evolution of Embryology'' Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1966, volume 2, pages 811-812.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John Wilkins]] (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree."&lt;ref&gt;John Wilkins,''Of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion'', London, 1675, book I, chapter 6, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th-century, [[Thomas Burnet]] referred to "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" to argue against the [[eternity]] of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm ''The Sacred Theory of the Earth''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020060523/http://sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm |date=2007-10-20 }}, 2nd edition, London: Walter Kettilby, 1691.

Chapter XV of Paley's ''Natural Theology'' discusses at length what he called "relations" of parts of living things as an indication of their design.&lt;ref name="paley"&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 William Paley:''Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity.

[[Georges Cuvier]] applied his principle of the ''correlation of parts'' to describe an animal from fragmentary remains. For Cuvier, this  related to another principle of his, the ''conditions of existence'', which excluded the possibility of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially chapters VI and VII of {{cite book|author= William Coleman |title= Georges Cuvier, Zoologist: A Study in the History of Evolution Theory |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1964}} See also the discussion of these principles in the Wikipedia article on [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While he did not originate the term, [[Charles Darwin]] identified the argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction of the theory of evolution at the outset. In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), he wrote, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray.

By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite book|author= Alan R.

In the late 19th century, in a dispute between supporters of the adequacy of [[natural selection]] and those who held for [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], one of the arguments made repeatedly by [[Herbert Spencer]], and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as ''co-adaptation'' of ''co-operative'' parts, as in: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We come now to Professor [[August Weismann|Weismann]]'s endeavour to disprove my second thesis — that it is impossible to explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts.

====20th century====
[[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]], in the early 20th century, discussed a concept similar to irreducible complexity. However, far from seeing this as a problem for evolution, he described the "interlocking" of biological features as a consequence to be expected of evolution, which would lead to irreversibility of some evolutionary changes.&lt;ref name="Muller_1918"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors |journal= Genetics |volume= 3 |issue= 5 |pages= 422–99 |year= 1918 |url= http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |pmid= 17245914 |pmc= 1200446 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518220445/http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |archivedate= 2007-05-18 |df=  }}, especially pages 463–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics |journal= Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= 14 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–80, quotation from 272 |year= 1939 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1939.tb00934.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] introduced a similar concept in his book ''Scientific Creationism'', in which he wrote; "This issue can actually be attacked quantitatively, using simple principles of mathematical probability. The problem is simply whether a complex system, in which many components function unitedly together, and in which each component is uniquely necessary to the efficient functioning of the whole, could ever arise by random processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Henry M. Morris|Morris, Henry]] |title= Scientific creationism |publisher= Creation-Life Publishers |location= San Diego, Calif |year= 1974 |page= 59 |isbn= 0-89051-003-2 |edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 [[Thomas H. Frazzetta]] published a book-length study of a concept similar to irreducible complexity, explained by gradual, step-wise, non-teleological evolution. Frazzetta wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A complex adaptation is one constructed of ''several'' components that must blend together operationally to make the adaptation "work". It is analogous to a machine whose performance depends upon careful cooperation among its parts. In the case of the machine, no single part can greatly be altered without changing the performance of the entire machine."&lt;/blockquote&gt; The machine that he chose as an analog is the [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]], and one biological system given extended description was the jaw apparatus of a python. The conclusion of this investigation, rather than that evolution of a complex adaptation was impossible, "awed by the adaptations of living things, to be stunned by their complexity and suitability", was "to accept the inescapable but not humiliating fact that much of mankind can be seen in a tree or a lizard."&lt;ref&gt;T.

In 1981, Ariel Roth, in defense of the [[creation science|creation-science]] position in the trial ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'', said of "complex integrated structures": "This system would not be functional until all the parts were there ... How did these parts survive during evolution ...?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Keough, Mark J. |author2= Geisler, Norman L. |title= The Creator in the courtroom "Scopes II": the 1981 Arkansas creation-evolution trial |publisher= Mott Media |location= Milford, Mich |year= 1982 |page= 146 |isbn= 0-88062-020-X |url= http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070623192424/http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |archivedate= 2007-06-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Cairns-Smith]] wrote of "interlocking": "How can a complex collaboration between components evolve in small steps?" and used the analogy of the scaffolding called [[centring|centering]] - used to [[arch#Construction|build an arch]] then removed afterwards: "Surely there was 'scaffolding'.

An early concept of irreducibly complex systems comes from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901-1972), an Austrian biologist.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1952). ''Problems of Life: An Evaluation of Modern Biological and Scientific Thought, pg 148'' {{ISBN|1-131-79242-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that complex systems must be examined as complete, [[irreducibility|irreducible]] systems in order to fully understand how they work. He extended his work on biological complexity into a general theory of systems in a book titled ''[[systems theory|General Systems Theory]]''.

After [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published the structure of [[DNA]] in the early 1950s, General Systems Theory lost many of its adherents in the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Monod, Jacques 
|title= Chance and necessity: an essay on the natural philosophy of modern biology |publisher= Vintage Books |location= New York |year= 1972 |isbn= 0-394-71825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Systems theory remained popular in the social sciences long after its demise in the physical and biological sciences.

[[File:Darwinsblackbox.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Michael Behe]]'s controversial book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' popularized the concept of irreducible complexity.]]

[[Michael Behe]] developed his ideas on the concept around 1992, in the early days of the '[[wedge strategy|wedge movement]]', and first presented his ideas about "irreducible complexity" in June 1993 when the "Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars" met at Pajaro Dunes in California.&lt;ref name=bfwedge&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm#I The Wedge at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=2014-09-05 }}.

He first used the term "irreducible complexity" in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', to refer to certain complex biochemical [[cell (biology)|cellular]] systems. He posits that evolutionary mechanisms cannot explain the development of such "irreducibly complex" systems. Notably, Behe credits philosopher [[William Paley]] for the original concept (alone among the predecessors) and suggests that his application of the concept to biological systems is entirely original.

Intelligent design advocates argue that irreducibly complex systems must have been deliberately engineered by some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]].

In 2001, [[Michael Behe]] wrote: "[T]here is an asymmetry between my current definition of irreducible complexity and the task facing natural selection. I hope to repair this defect in future work." Behe specifically explained that the "current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system", but the "difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Behe MJ |title=Reply to My Critics: A Response to Reviews of Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=685–709 |date=November 2001 |url=http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |doi=10.1023/A:1012268700496 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040554/http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe testified under oath that he "did not judge [the asymmetry] serious enough to [have revised the book] yet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am2.html Behe's testimony in ''Kitzmiller v.

Behe additionally testified that the presence of irreducible complexity in organisms would not rule out the involvement of evolutionary mechanisms in the development of organic life. He further testified that he knew of no earlier "peer reviewed articles in scientific journals discussing the intelligent design of the blood clotting cascade," but that there were "probably a large number of peer reviewed articles in science journals that demonstrate that the blood clotting system is indeed a purposeful arrangement of parts of great complexity and sophistication."&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael 2005 [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science (p. 88)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The judge ruled that "intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature".)&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 6: Conclusion, section H]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of evolution, genetic variations occur without specific design or intent. The environment "selects" the variants that have the highest fitness, which are then passed on to the next generation of organisms. Change occurs by the gradual operation of natural forces over time, perhaps slowly, perhaps more quickly (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]). This process is able to [[adaptation|adapt]] complex structures from simpler beginnings, or convert complex structures from one function to another (see [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]). Most intelligent design advocates accept that evolution occurs through mutation and natural selection at the "[[microevolution|micro level]]", such as changing the relative frequency of various beak lengths in finches, but assert that it cannot account for irreducible complexity, because none of the parts of an irreducible system would be functional or advantageous until the entire system is in place.

===The mousetrap example===
[[File:Mausefalle 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Behe]] believes that many aspects of life show evidence of design, using the [[mousetrap]] in an analogy disputed by others.&lt;ref name=trap&gt;[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html A reducibly complex mousetrap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041104/http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html |date=2014-02-22 }} (graphics-intensive, requires [[JavaScript]])&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.

In his 2008 book ''[[Only A Theory]]'', biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] challenges Behe's claim that the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=Only /&gt; Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls that one of his classmates&lt;blockquote&gt;...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly.... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap.... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the hold-down bar and catch-- off the trap to make it easier to conceal and more effective as a catapult... [leaving] the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher.... I realized why [Behe's] mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.&lt;ref name=Only&gt;{{cite book |title= Only A Theory |first= Kenneth R. |last= Miller |location= New York |year= 2008 |publisher= Viking Penguin |pages= 54–55 |isbn= 978-0-670-01883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other systems identified by Miller that include mousetrap components include the following:&lt;ref name= Only/&gt;
*use the spitball launcher as a tie clip (same three-part system with different function)
*remove the spring from the spitball launcher/tie clip to create a two-part key chain (base + hammer)
*glue the spitball launcher/tie clip to a sheet of wood to create a clipboard (launcher + glue + wood)
*remove the hold-down bar for use as a toothpick (single element system)

The point of the reduction is that - in biology - most or all of the components were already at hand, by the time it became necessary to build a mousetrap. As such, it required far fewer steps to develop a mousetrap than to design all the components from scratch.

Thus, the development of the mousetrap, said to consist of five different parts which had no function on their own, has been reduced to one step: the assembly from parts that are already present, performing other functions.

The Intelligent Design argument focuses on the functionality to catch mice. It skips over the case that many, if not all, parts are already available in their own right, at the time that the need for a mousetrap arises.

===Consequences===

Supporters of intelligent design argue that anything less than the complete form of such a system or organ would not work at all, or would in fact be a ''detriment'' to the organism, and would therefore never survive the process of natural selection. Although they accept that some complex systems and organs ''can'' be explained by evolution, they claim that organs and biological features which are ''irreducibly complex'' cannot be explained by current models, and that an intelligent designer must have created life or guided its evolution. Accordingly, the debate on irreducible complexity concerns two questions: whether irreducible complexity can be found in nature, and what significance it would have if it did exist in nature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Behe's original examples of irreducibly complex mechanisms included the bacterial [[flagellum]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[coagulation|the blood clotting cascade]], [[cilia]], and the [[adaptive immune system]].

Behe argues that organs and biological features which are irreducibly complex cannot be wholly explained by current models of [[evolution]]. In explicating his definition of "irreducible complexity" he notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irreducible complexity is not an argument that evolution does not occur, but rather an argument that it is "incomplete". In the last chapter of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', Behe goes on to explain his view that irreducible complexity is evidence for [[intelligent design]]. Mainstream critics, however, argue that irreducible complexity, as defined by Behe, can be generated by known evolutionary mechanisms. Behe's claim that no scientific literature adequately modeled the origins of biochemical systems through evolutionary mechanisms has been challenged by [[TalkOrigins Archive|TalkOrigins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html Claim CA350: Professional literature is silent on the subject of the evolution of biochemical systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304172657/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html |date=2007-03-04 }} TalkOrigins Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael J. |authorlink= Michael Behe |title= Darwin's black box: the biochemical challenge to evolution |isbn= 0-684-82754-9 |page= 72 |chapter= |quote= "Yet here again the evolutionary literature is totally missing.

Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..."&lt;ref name=kitz74&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 74 of 139|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], December 2005. Page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stated examples==
Behe and others have suggested a number of biological features that they believe may be irreducibly complex.

===Blood clotting cascade===
The process of blood clotting or [[coagulation]] cascade in vertebrates is a complex biological pathway which is given as an example of apparent irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Action, George [http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html "Behe and the Blood Clotting Cascade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050605075004/http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html |date=2005-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary, and therefore could not have been added sequentially. However, in evolution, something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boudry |first=Maarten |authorlink=Maarten Boudry |last2=Blancke |first2=Stefaan |last3=Braeckman |first3=Johan |authorlink3=Johan Braeckman |title=Irreducible Incoherence and Intelligent Design: A Look into the Conceptual Toolbox of a Pseudoscience |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=473–82 |publisher= |date=September 2010 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |issn= |doi=10.1086/656904 |accessdate= |pmid=21243965 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095300/http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= |hdl=1854/LU-952482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural selection]] can lead to complex biochemical systems being built up from simpler systems, or to existing functional systems being recombined as a new system with a different function.&lt;ref name=kitz74/&gt; For example, one of the clotting factors that Behe listed as a part of the clotting cascade ([[Factor XII]], also called Hageman factor) was later found to be absent in whales, demonstrating that it is not essential for a clotting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semba U, Shibuya Y, Okabe H, Yamamoto T |title=Whale Hageman factor (factor XII): prevented production due to pseudogene conversion |journal=Thromb Res |year=1998 |pages=31–7 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pmid=9678675 |doi= 10.1016/S0049-3848(97)00307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many purportedly irreducible structures can be found in other organisms as much simpler systems that utilize fewer parts. These systems, in turn, may have had even simpler precursors that are now extinct. Behe has responded to critics of his clotting cascade arguments by suggesting that [[homology (biology)|homology]] is evidence for evolution, but not for natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael [http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm "In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917181325/http://arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm |date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "improbability argument" also misrepresents natural selection. It is correct to say that a set of simultaneous mutations that form a complex protein structure is so unlikely as to be unfeasible, but that is not what Darwin advocated. His explanation is based on small accumulated changes that take place without a final goal. Each step must be advantageous in its own right, although biologists may not yet understand the reason behind all of them—for example, [[jawless fish]] accomplish blood clotting with just six proteins instead of the full ten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 Creationism special: A sceptic's guide to intelligent design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506100626/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 |date=2015-05-06 }}, New Scientist, 9 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye===

The [[eye]] is an example of a supposedly irreducibly complex structure, due to its many elaborate and interlocking parts, seemingly all dependent upon one another. It is frequently cited by intelligent design and creationism advocates as an example of irreducible complexity. Behe used the "development of the eye problem" as evidence for intelligent design in ''Darwin's Black Box''. Although Behe acknowledged that the evolution of the larger anatomical features of the eye have been well-explained, he pointed out that the complexity of the minute biochemical reactions required at a molecular level for light sensitivity still defies explanation. Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] has described the eye as evolutionary biologists' "greatest challenge as an example of superb 'irreducible complexity' in God's creation", specifically pointing to the supposed "vast complexity" required for transparency.&lt;ref name="aig"&gt;[[Jonathan Sarfati|Sarfati, Jonathan]] (2000). [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/re2/chapter10.asp Argument: 'Irreducible complexity'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123070148/http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/re2/chapter10.asp |date=2005-11-23 }}, from ''[[Refuting Evolution]]'' ([[Answers in Genesis]]).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|redirects to http://www.answersingenesis.org/get-answers/topic/design-features, an unauthored blog|date=June 2012}}

However, the quote in context shows that Darwin actually had a very good understanding of the evolution of the eye (see [[fallacy of quoting out of context]]). He notes that "to suppose that the eye ... could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree". Yet this observation was merely a [[procatalepsis|rhetorical device]] for Darwin. He goes on to explain that if gradual evolution of the eye could be shown to be possible, "the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection ... can hardly be considered real". He then proceeded to roughly map out a likely course for evolution using examples of gradually more complex eyes of various species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859).

Since Darwin's day, the eye's ancestry has become much better understood. Although learning about the construction of ancient eyes through fossil evidence is problematic due to the soft tissues leaving no imprint or remains, genetic and comparative anatomical evidence has increasingly supported the idea of a common ancestry for all eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=New perspectives on eye evolution |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=602–9 |date=October 1995 |pmid=8664548 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |doi=10.1016/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507170439/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |archivedate=2018-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=Induction of ectopic eyes by targeted expression of the eyeless gene in Drosophila |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5205 |pages=1788–92 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7892602 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7892602 |doi=10.1126/science.7892602 |bibcode=1995Sci...267.1788H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomarev SI, Callaerts P, Kos L, etal |title=Squid Pax-6 and eye development |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2421–6 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9122210 |pmc=20103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9122210 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2421 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2421T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current evidence does suggest possible evolutionary lineages for the origins of the anatomical features of the eye. One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of [[photoreceptor cell]]s that could detect the presence or absence of light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be "selected for" as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken [[aperture]] of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how [[collimated]] the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a [[pinhole camera]] which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes—the [[nautilus]] is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images.&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, Russell D. (2001).

Behe maintains that the complexity of light sensitivity at the molecular level and the minute biochemical reactions required for those first "simple patches of photoreceptor[s]" still defies explanation, and that the proposed series of infinitesimal steps to get from patches of photoreceptors to a fully functional eye would actually be considered great, complex leaps in evolution if viewed on the molecular scale. Other intelligent design proponents claim that the evolution of the entire visual system would be difficult rather than the eye alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Meaningful World|year=2006|author1=Benjamin Wiker |author2=Jonathan Witt |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flagella===
{{Main article|Evolution of flagella}}

The [[flagella]] of certain bacteria constitute a [[molecular motor]] requiring the interaction of about 40 different protein parts. Behe presents this as a prime example of an irreducibly complex structure defined as "a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning", and argues that since "an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional", it could not have evolved gradually through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Flagellum Unspun"/&gt;

'''Reducible complexity'''. In contrast to Behe's claims, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, even though sometimes at reduced efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajagopala SV, Titz B, Goll J, Parrish JR, Wohlbold K, McKevitt MT, Palzkill T, Mori H, ((Finley RL Jr)), Uetz P |year= 2007 |title= The protein network of bacterial motility |url= |journal= Mol Syst Biol |volume= 3 |issue= |page= 128 |doi= 10.1038/msb4100166 |pmid= 17667950 |pmc=1943423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the composition of flagella is surprisingly diverse across bacteria with many proteins only found in some species but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Titz B, Rajagopala SV, Ester C, Häuser R, Uetz P |date= Nov 2006 |title= Novel conserved assembly factor of the bacterial flagellum |journal= J Bacteriol |volume= 188 |issue= 21 |pages= 7700–6 |doi= 10.1128/JB.00820-06 |pmid= 16936039 |pmc=1636259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components.

===Cilium motion===

The [[cilium]] construction of [[axoneme]] microtubules movement by the sliding of [[dynein]] protein was cited by Behe as an example of irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;page 90: "Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules, connectors, and motors.  Therefore we can conclude that the cilium is irreducibly complex - an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian evolution."{{cite book | title = Signs of Intelligence, article Darwin's Breakdown: Irreducible Complexity and Design at the Foundation of Life | author = [[Michael Behe|Behe, Michael]]| year = 1999

===Bombardier beetle's defense mechanism===
{{main|Bombardier beetle}}

The [[bombardier beetle]] is able to defend itself by directing a spray of hot fluid at an attacker. The mechanism involves a system for mixing [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which react violently to attain a temperature near boiling point, and in some species a nozzle which allows the spray to be directed accurately in any direction.&lt;ref name=Anesh&gt;{{cite web |author="Aneshansley, D.

==Response of the scientific community==
Like intelligent design, the concept it seeks to support, irreducible complexity has failed to gain any notable acceptance within the [[scientific community]]. One science writer called it a "full-blown intellectual surrender strategy".&lt;ref&gt;Mirsky, Steve [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00022DE1-0C15-11E6-B75283414B7F0000 Sticker Shock: In the beginning was the cautionary advisory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017213318/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00022DE1-0C15-11E6-B75283414B7F0000 |date=2007-10-17 }} ''Scientific American'', February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Niall Shanks and Karl H.

They claim that Behe overestimated the significance of irreducible complexity because of his simple, linear view of biochemical reactions, resulting in his taking snapshots of selective features of biological systems, structures, and processes, while ignoring the redundant complexity of the context in which those features are naturally embedded. They also criticized his over-reliance of overly simplistic metaphors, such as his mousetrap.

A computer model of the co-evolution of proteins binding to DNA in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'' consisted of several parts (DNA binders and DNA binding sites) which contribute to the basic function; removal of either one leads immediately to the death of the organism. This model fits the definition of irreducible complexity exactly, yet it evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Thomas D. Schneider|Schneider TD]] |title=Evolution of Biological Information |journal= Nucleic Acids Research |year=2000 |pages=2794–2799 |volume=28 |issue=14 |pmid=10908337 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.14.2794 |pmc=102656}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The program can be run from [http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/ Ev program].)

In addition, research published in the peer-reviewed journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] has shown that computer simulations of evolution demonstrate that it is possible for complex features to evolve naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Richard Lenski|Lenski RE]], Ofria C, Pennock RT, Adami C |title= The evolutionary origin of complex features |journal= Nature |year= 2003 |pages= 139–44 |volume= 423 |issue= 6936 |pmid= 12736677 |doi= 10.1038/nature01568|bibcode= 2003Natur.423..139L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can compare a mousetrap with a cat in this context. Both normally function so as to control the mouse population. The cat has many parts that can be removed leaving it still functional; for example, its tail can be bobbed, or it can lose an ear in a fight. Comparing the cat and the mousetrap, then, one sees that the mousetrap (which is not alive) offers better evidence, in terms of irreducible complexity, for intelligent design than the cat. Even looking at the mousetrap analogy, several critics have described ways in which the parts of the mousetrap could have independent uses or could develop in stages, demonstrating that it is not irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;

Moreover, even cases where removing a certain component in an organic system will cause the system to fail do not demonstrate that the system could not have been formed in a step-by-step, evolutionary process. By analogy, stone arches are irreducibly complex&amp;mdash;if you remove any stone the arch will collapse—yet humans [[arch#Construction|build them]] easily enough, one stone at a time, by building over [[centring|centering]] that is removed afterward. Similarly, [[natural arch|naturally occurring arches]] of stone form by the weathering away of bits of stone from a large concretion that has formed previously.

Evolution can act to simplify as well as to complicate. This raises the possibility that seemingly irreducibly complex biological features may have been achieved with a period of increasing complexity, followed by a period of simplification.

A team led by [[Joseph Thornton (biologist)|Joseph Thornton]], assistant professor of biology at the [[University of Oregon]]'s Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, using techniques for resurrecting ancient genes, reconstructed the evolution of an apparently irreducibly complex molecular system. The April 7, 2006 issue of ''Science'' published this research.&lt;ref name="thornton2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridgham JT, Carroll SM, Thornton JW |title=Evolution of hormone-receptor complexity by molecular exploitation |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5770 |pages=97–101 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16601189 |doi=10.1126/science.1123348 |bibcode= 2006Sci...312...97B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033744/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 |date=2007-09-30 }} University of Oregon, April 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreducible complexity may not actually exist in nature, and the examples given by Behe and others may not in fact represent irreducible complexity, but can be explained in terms of simpler precursors. The theory of [[facilitated variation]] challenges irreducible complexity. [[Marc W. Kirschner]], a professor and chair of Department of Systems Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[John C. Gerhart]], a professor in Molecular and Cell Biology, [[University of California, Berkeley]], presented this theory in 2005. They describe how certain mutation and changes can cause apparent irreducible complexity. Thus, seemingly irreducibly complex structures are merely "very complex", or they are simply misunderstood or misrepresented.

===Gradual adaptation to new functions===
{{Main article|Exaptation}}
The precursors of complex systems, when they are not useful in themselves, may be useful to perform other, unrelated functions. Evolutionary biologists argue that evolution often works in this kind of blind, haphazard manner in which the function of an early form is not necessarily the same as the function of the later form. The term used for this process is [[exaptation]]. The [[evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|mammalian middle ear]] (derived from a jawbone) and the [[giant panda|panda]]'s thumb (derived from a wrist bone spur) provide classic examples. A 2006 article in ''Nature'' demonstrates intermediate states leading toward the development of the ear in a [[Devonian]] fish (about 360 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature |volume= 439 |pages= 318–21 |date= January 19, 2006 |author1=M.

Arguments for irreducibility often assume that things started out the same way they ended up&amp;mdash;as we see them now. However, that may not necessarily be the case. In the ''Dover'' trial an expert witness for the plaintiffs, Ken Miller, demonstrated this possibility using Behe's mousetrap analogy. By removing several parts, Miller made the object unusable as a mousetrap, but he pointed out that it was now a perfectly functional, if unstylish, [[tie clip]].&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVAChapter8&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |title= NOVA: Transcripts: Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial Chapter 8 |date= November 13, 2007 |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate= 2008-12-17 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081123085214/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |archivedate= November 23, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods by which irreducible complexity may evolve===
{{further|Evolvability}}

Irreducible complexity can be seen as equivalent to an "uncrossable valley" in a [[fitness landscape]]. A number of mathematical models of evolution have explored the circumstances under which such valleys can, nevertheless, be crossed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Desai|first2=Michael M.|last3=Fisher|first3=Daniel S. |last4=Feldman |first4=Marcus W.|title=The rate at which asexual populations cross fitness valleys|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 2009 |volume=75 |issue=4|pages=286–300|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2009.02.006|pmid=19285994|pmc=2992471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=D.

===Falsifiability and experimental evidence===
Some critics, such as [[Jerry Coyne]] (professor of [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]) and [[Eugenie Scott]] (a [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] and former executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]]) have argued that the concept of irreducible complexity and, more generally, [[intelligent design]] is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] and, therefore, not [[scientific]].

Behe argues that the theory that irreducibly complex systems could not have evolved can be falsified by an experiment where such systems are evolved. For example, he posits taking bacteria with no [[flagella|flagellum]] and imposing a selective pressure for mobility. If, after a few thousand generations, the bacteria evolved the bacterial flagellum, then Behe believes that this would refute his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolutionnews.org/2016/10/philosophical_o/|title=Philosophical Objections to Intelligent Design: A Response to Critics|last=Behe|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2016|website=Evolution News &amp; Science Today|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=August 2018}}

Other critics take a different approach, pointing to experimental evidence that they believe falsifies the argument for Intelligent Design from irreducible complexity. For example, [[Kenneth R. Miller|Kenneth Miller]] cites the lab work of Barry G. Hall on [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], which he asserts is evidence that "Behe is wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Miller K |title= Finding Darwin's God: a scientist's search for common ground between God and evolution |publisher= Cliff Street Books |location= New York |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-06-093049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence that irreducible complexity is not a problem for evolution comes from the field of [[computer science]], which routinely uses computer analogues of the processes of evolution in order to automatically design complex solutions to problems. The results of such [[genetic algorithm]]s are frequently irreducibly complex since the process, like evolution, both removes non-essential components over time as well as adding new components. The removal of unused components with no essential function, like the natural process where rock underneath a [[natural arch]] is removed, can produce irreducibly complex structures without requiring the intervention of a designer. Researchers applying these algorithms automatically produce human-competitive designs—but no human designer is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|title=Human Competitive|author=|date=|website=www.genetic-programming.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708052427/http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|archivedate=8 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from ignorance===
Intelligent design proponents attribute to an intelligent designer those biological structures they believe are irreducibly complex and therefore they say a natural explanation is insufficient to account for them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Behe. [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 Evidence for Intelligent Design from Biochemistry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185728/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 |date=2006-09-03 }} 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics view irreducible complexity as a special case of the "complexity indicates design" claim, and thus see it as an [[argument from ignorance]] and as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument.&lt;ref name="isaak_ci101"&gt;Index to Creationist Claims.

Scott]] and Glenn Branch, [http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists "Intelligent Design" Not Accepted by Most Scientists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330203658/http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |date=2009-03-30 }}, National Center for Science Education website, September 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Behe has been accused by critics &lt;ref&gt;Patheos.com essay: An argument premised on the author's lack of imagination.{{cite web |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715212827/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amerikanbeat.net: A Critique of Behe, Dembski on "Irreducible Complexity"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100910063051/http://amerikanbeat.net/contact-amerikanbeat/a-critique-of-behe-dembski-on-%E2%80%9Cirreducible-complexity%E2%80%9D/]&lt;/ref&gt; of using an "argument by lack of imagination".

===False dilemma===
Irreducible complexity is at its core an argument against evolution. If truly irreducible systems are found, the argument goes, then [[intelligent design]] must be the correct explanation for their existence. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that current [[evolution]]ary theory and intelligent design are the only two valid models to explain life, a [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html IC and Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813171254/http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html |date=2004-08-13 }} makes the point that: if "irreducible complexity" is tautologically redefined to allow a valid argument that [[intelligent design]] is the correct explanation for life then there is no such thing as "irreducible complexity" in the mechanisms of life; while, if we use the unmodified original definition then "irreducible complexity" has nothing whatever to do with evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover]]'' noted that this implicit assumption of the defendant school board created a "flawed and illogical contrived dualism" (Opinion p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Dover trial==
While testifying during the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex [[molecular]] systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed nor are there any peer-reviewed articles supporting his argument that certain complex molecular structures are "irreducibly complex."&lt;ref name="Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science"/&gt;

In the final ruling of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Judge Jones specifically singled out Behe and irreducible complexity:&lt;ref name=Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science|Memorandum Opinion, Judge John E. Jones III, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Professor Behe admitted in "Reply to My Critics" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address "the task facing natural selection." and that "Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to "repair this defect in future work..." (Page 73)
*"As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by "irreducible complexity" renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. (3:40 (Miller)). In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exaptation as a well-recognized, well-documented explanation for how systems with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means." (Page 74)
*"By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of exaptation by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument. Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..." (Page 75)
*"As irreducible complexity is only a negative argument against evolution, it is refutable and accordingly testable, unlike ID [Intelligent Design], by showing that there are intermediate structures with selectable functions that could have evolved into the allegedly irreducibly complex systems. (2:15-16 (Miller)). Importantly, however, the fact that the negative argument of irreducible complexity is testable does not make testable the argument for ID. (2:15 (Miller); 5:39 (Pennock)). Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe's assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex." (Page 76)
*"...on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not "good enough." (23:19 (Behe))." (Page 78)
*"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. (17:45-46 (Padian); 3:99 (Miller)). Additionally, even if irreducible complexity had not been rejected, it still does not support ID as it is merely a test for evolution, not design. (2:15, 2:35-40 (Miller); 28:63-66 (Fuller)). We will now consider the purportedly "positive argument" for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the "purposeful arrangement of parts." Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the [[William Paley|Reverend William Paley]]'s argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller))." (Pages 79–80)

'''Jamaicans for Justice (JFJ)''' is a non-profit, non-partisan human rights organization in Jamaica. JFJ was founded in 1999 in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicansforjustice.org/nmcms.php?content=about%20us |title=About Jamaicans For Justice (JFJ) |accessdate=12 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201427/http://www.jamaicansforjustice.org/nmcms.php?content=about+us |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was co-founded by Jamaican human rights activist Dr. [[Carolyn Gomes]] who in 2008 was awarded the [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights#2008 Prizewinners|United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/president/63/letters/humanrightsprize11208.pdf |accessdate=12 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417202453/http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/letters/humanrightsprize11208.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is most widely known for providing legal support to hundreds of victims of state abuse in Jamaica and litigation of human rights issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courtofappeal.gov.jm/sites/default/files/judgments/Jamaicans%20for%20Justice%20v%20Police%20Service%20Commission%20%26%20Attorney%20General%20%28The%29.pdf|title=Jamaicans for Justice v Police Service Commission and Attorney General|last=|first=|date=|work=Court of Appeal Jamaica|access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Jamaican and international tribunals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/JFJ-takes-children-s-case-to-IACHR_14366303|title=JFJ Takes Children's Case to IACHR|last=Walker|first=Karl|date=May 29, 2013|work=The Jamaica Observer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Origin ==
Jamaican for Justice (JFJ) arose out of the Gas Riots of 16 April 1999. On 19 August 1999 four months after the riots, JFJ came into being. On 15 October, it was officially a legal entity. The founders of JFJ saw strong need for a human rights action group to address the frustrations of the Jamaican people and the systemic abuse by the security forces&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamaicansforjustice.org/whoweare/history/|title=History {{!}} Jamaicans for Justice (JFJ)|website=jamaicansforjustice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These frustrations included many instances of alleged corruption in the public sphere, apparent miscarriages of Justice in the judicial system and imbalances in the socio-economic system. Since its formation, JFJ has also developed working relationships with [[Amnesty International]], [[USAID]] Jamaica, [[The Carter Center]], Article 21, [[Street Law (organization)|Street Law]], CEJIL and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]].

==Notable cases==
JFJ has represented hundreds of low-income victims of state abuse, leading a number of campaigns in high-profile cases.

* Police beating death of twenty-six-year-old Michael Gayle. Gayle, who was mentally ill, died on 23 August 1999 of injuries he sustained after attempting to pass through a police and army road block two days earlier. He was subjected to such a severe beating by police and army officers that he suffered a traumatic rupture of his stomach lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR38/014/2004/en |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |website=Amnesty.org |date=2004-10-07 |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cidh.org/annualrep/2005eng/Jamaica.12418eng.htm|title=Jamaica Case 12.418 - Merits|website=cidh.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police Killing of the Braeton Seven in March 2001. The police, under questionable circumstances shot and killed Reagon Beckford, 14; Christopher Grant, 17; Dane Whyte, 19; Tamoya Wilson, 20; Andre Virgo, 20; Lancebert Clarke, 19; and Curtis Smith, 20.

==Child rights==
The protection of the rights of children in the care of the Jamaican state has been an issue of concern for JFJ since 2001 but came to the fore in 2003 when citizens began to bring problems concerning children to the attention of the organisation. Since that time, JFJ has actively monitored the situation of wards of the state in children’s homes, places of safety, lock-up, remand and correctional facilities to gather data, provide reports and lobby vigorously for the protection of Jamaica’s most vulnerable citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaicansforjustice.org/whoweare/programme-areas/children-in-the-care-of-the-jamaican-state/ |title=Children in the Care of the Jamaican State |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506055632/http://jamaicansforjustice.org/whoweare/programme-areas/children-in-the-care-of-the-jamaican-state/ |archivedate=6 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
JFJ was co-founded and led for over a decade by prominent activist Dr. [[Carolyn Gomes]], who was awarded the 2008 [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]].In 2016, criminologist and civil society organizer Horace Levy was appointed as Executive Director. Levy retired in December, 2017 and was succeeded by present Executive Director, Rodjé Malcolm.

'''Juror misconduct''' is when the law of the [[court]] is violated by a member of the [[jury]] while a [[court case]] is in progression or after it has reached a [[verdict]].&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions"&gt;"USLegal Definitions"&lt;/ref&gt;

Misconduct can take several forms:
* Communication by the jury with those outside of the trial/court case. Those on the outside include “[[witnesses]], [[Lawyer|attorneys]], [[bailiff]]s, or [[judge]]s about the case”.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;
* When the jury member brings outside [[evidence]] that they may have found themselves into the trial which has not been allowed by the judges or lawyers and is used to create [[bias]] on the part of the juror. This new [[information]] may be used to [[Social influence|influence]] their final decision.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;
* “Conducting experiments regarding theories of the case outside the court’s presence”.&lt;ref name="USLegalDefinitions" /&gt;

==Bias==
"An [[inclination]] of [[temperament]] or outlook; especially: a personal and sometimes unreasoned [[judgement]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bias Merriam-Webster. An Encyclopædia Britannica Company (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example mentioned in Eltis's article "Courts, Litigants and the Digital Age. Law, Ethics and Practice" is a juror in Manchester who [[tweeted]] openly throughout a [[rape]] trial. She was found to be tweeting to her friends and asking them to poll whether they thought that the man being tried was guilty or not; whether he committed the rape or not.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts_a"&gt;Eltis, Karen. "Courts, Litigants and the Digital Age. Law, Ethics and Practice". University of Ottawa. Columbia Law School. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the case of Wardlaw v. State where a member of the jury, against the direct instructions by the judge to not use the Internet, looked up the definition of the illness that the individual on trial was stated to be suffering. This jury member also looked up symptoms and whether lying was an effect of suffering with this [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Eltis"&gt;Eltis, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The juror did learn that lying was in fact a "symptom"; however, she chose to gather this information during the discussion to find a verdict.&lt;ref name="Eltis" /&gt;

==Social media==
Whether it is on a phone or using a computer, the [[Internet]] has become society’s source for everything. Regarding the place of [[social media]] within trials, the Internet has frequently been used by jury members to gain access to additional information about a certain [[mental illness]], or a broader definition or they are outsourcing trial information.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts_a" /&gt; The legal system and both the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and both the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment&lt;/ref&gt; and 6th amendment &lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States are built around the fact that everyone is required to have a fair trial free from bias.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Information Institute(LII). "Fifth Amendment: An Overview". Cornell University Law School, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Information Institute(LII)."Sixth Amendment: Amendment VI. Cornell University Law School, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple instances where certain cases required retrials because of bias on the part of one or more of the jury members. The Internet, while it is the primary source to find additional information and details about another individual, does not necessarily mean that the information it provides is necessarily correct or accurate. According to Bell’s article, ''Juror Misconduct and the Internet'', the use of the Internet within trials is not a new occurrence. It has been found in many cases, jurors who have searched for words unfamiliar to them, done extensive research, “engaged in at-home experiments, visited accident scenes, and otherwise obtained specialized knowledge.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell"&gt;William Bell, Daniel. "Juror Misconduct and the Internet". American Journal of Criminal Law, 2010, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of Internet information==
===Traditional sources===

These sources seem to revolve around cases which include members of the jury searching for additional information about a certain term or illness that is significant in the case at hand. Usually the main outlets are encyclopedic definitions or Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell" /&gt; The use of the Internet has also given jurors the ability to easily and readily access information that they may want to find out about. As stated in Bell's article, many jurors do not have the time during breaks to go out to a library and locate hard copy sources of information needed, thus making the Internet the primary source because all it requires is the simple push of a button.&lt;ref name="WilliamBell"/&gt;

===Novel sources===
This type of information includes access to different sources of information such as (1) “information about parties and witnesses” referring to information about a defendant’s past, background information on a specific employer or business, both publicized information and private information such as driving records, and tickets. All this information is easily accessible over the Internet and all this information was shared among jury members in specific cases. The main outlets usually include [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and online encyclopedias and dictionaries. This would overthrow the entire trial thus causing an automatic [[mistrial]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, pp. 84 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt; 2 “Scientific and Technical Information”.&lt;ref name=Bell85&gt;Bell 2010, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of information refers to using the Internet to perform their own form of investigation on the side without actually having to go to the physical scene of the crime. This form of personal investigation may use [[Google Earth]] to acquire specific locations and specific fine points about a crime scene such as neighbourhoods, distances between certain homes and areas, etc.&lt;ref name=Bell85 /&gt;

Since the Internet is frequently used to taint certain verdicts, many judges have put bans and limitations on jury members and their use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=Bell86&gt;Bell 2010, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; When certain individuals are called to be on jury duty, they are told they are not allowed to communicate with other people who are not involved with the case, and they are told they are not allowed to use the Internet to research anything or to send out or receive any information that would compromise the integrity and fairness of the case at hand. This is definitely a challenge as the Internet is ever present in our society today.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Another major problem, aside from the fact that a large majority of people have access to the Internet, is that the information individuals find may not be the entire truth, or may not be 100% accurate. When outside information is brought into a trial, it causes difficulties in ensuring no [[bias]] and a fair trial. Having outside information that is also inaccurate adds more bias and more unfairness to a trial.&lt;ref name=Bell86 /&gt;

==Methods used to prevent bias==
===Separating jury members===

This method is rare as it normally only occurs during cases with a heavy [[media influence]] and because it involves the constant watch of the actions of jury members individually to ensure they do not use the Internet or ruin the verdict and trial in any manner. This method can become problematic because jury members are only watched during the time when they are ready to deliberate amongst each other to reach a decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questionnaire===
This method is slightly more effective because not only will it minimize the amount of jurors to stand during trial, therefore eliminating potential bias and use of outside sources, but it would be useful because it “would also systematically exclude younger jurors and those who otherwise have basic experience using computers and the Internet…”.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.87&amp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bell’s article, the main reason behind why outside research is often conducted is because of the desire to satisfy one's curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a jury member is discovered to have brought in outside information, and juror misconduct is clearly present, then the jury member in question may actually be fined by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2010, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a deterrent to try and prevent future juror misconduct mishaps. It has been found to not be a successful deterrent because it solely shrinks the pool of individuals who wish to participate.&lt;ref name=Bell94&gt;Bell 2010, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible way to prevent this misconduct from taking place is ensuring that the jury members, before the trial, understand completely “what constitutes research, their curiosity, and their perceived “moral duty” to render verdicts based on complete information”.&lt;ref name=Bell94 /&gt; Another successful deterrent is to show how using outside influence is negative, how the life of the individual on trial is in the hands of these chosen jury members (Bell, 94) and to take away their sources of internet, such as phones, before the actual trial commences.&lt;ref name=Bell97&gt;Bell 2010, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistrials and alternatives==
[[Mistrials]] are the common response in cases where juror misconduct has occurred. Mistrials can be costly and thus will be avoided if possible. When mistrials are seen as a solution, they are compared to wasted assets “when it could have easily been avoided”.&lt;ref name=Bell97 /&gt; If the possibility presents itself, according to Eltis’s article, simply dismissing the misconduct as unacceptable would be less destructive than a mistrial.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts"&gt;Eltis, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissing this misconduct will be destructive since it would not cause the trial to be fair. Overall, it is felt that a mistrial is quite a harsh decision, especially since Internet use by a juror is considered “impossible to control”.&lt;ref name="EltisKarenCourts" /&gt;

== Punishment ==
Under the common law, jurors could be charged with contempt of court if they were found to have carried out independent research into the case they were trying. Proving that a juror was guilty of a contempt required proof that she had acted contrary to a judicial order (e.g. to refrain from carrying out research online). This created uncertainty and possible inconsistency, as judicial directions to jurors could vary. The Law Commission of England &amp; Wales felt it would be better to create a separate criminal offence, as this would make the law clearer for jurors. The Law Commission also felt that the creation of a new offence would give jurors suspected of misconduct greater due process protections, as contempt was tried according to summary court procedure, whereas the proposed offence would be an indictable offence, and therefore subject to the due process protections of a full jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court (1): Juror Misconduct and Internet Publications|last=Law Commission|first=The|publisher=LAW COM No 340|year=2013|isbn=9780102987362|location=|pages=62–68|quote=|via=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274266/0860.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 brought these proposals into law. As Crosby explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act makes it an offence for jurors to ‘research the case during the trial period’, to ‘disclose [improper] information to another member of the jury during the trial period’, and to engage in ‘conduct from which it may reasonably be concluded that the [juror] intends to try the issue otherwise than on the basis of the evidence presented in the proceedings on the issue’. Those found guilty of one of the new offences will be liable to imprisonment for up to two years, and will be disqualified from further service for a decade. What distinguishes these new offences from the existing option of using contempt proceedings is the fact jurors would now be proceeded against on indictment: that they would be tried by their peers for alleged misconduct. This represents a significant change in juror management techniques, as it is probable that criminal trial jurors accused of misconduct have never been tried in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kevin|year=2015|title=Juror Punishment, Juror Guidance and the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=https://www.academia.edu/30572311/Juror_Punishment_Juror_Guidance_and_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Courts_Act_2015|journal=Criminal Law Review|volume=|pages=578–593|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Former jurors found guilty of one of the new offences will be disqualified from jury service for ten years, even if they have been fined rather than imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=s77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such disqualifications had previously required: a sentence of imprisonment; a community order; a community rehabilitation order; a community punishment order; a community punishment and rehabilitation order; a drug treatment and testing order; or a drug abstinence order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Juries Act 1974|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=Sch2, Pt2, para7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Act introduces for the first time the principle that a fine may also be sufficient for temporary juror disqualification.

'''Kama''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]; [[Devanagari]]: काम) means "desire, wish, longing" in Hindu and Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name=mmwse&gt;Monier Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0304.html काम, kāma] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, pp 271, see 3rd column&lt;/ref&gt; Kama often connotes sexual desire and longing in contemporary literature, but the concept more broadly refers to any desire, wish, passion, longing, pleasure of the [[senses]], the [[aesthetic]] enjoyment of life, affection, or love, with or without sexual connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macy |first1=Joanna |year=1975 |title=The Dialectics of Desire |journal=Numen |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |publisher=BRILL |jstor=3269765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lorinroche.com/Sanskrit-ar/glossary/love.html |title=Love-Kama |author=Lorin Roche |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kama is one of the four goals of human life in Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt; It is considered an essential and healthy goal of human life when pursued without sacrificing the other three goals: [[Dharma]] (virtuous, proper, moral life), [[Artha]] (material prosperity, income security, means of life) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, release, self-actualization).&lt;ref name=ksv&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/8/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ascb&gt;see:

==Definition and meaning==
Kama means "desire, wish or longing".&lt;ref name=mmwse/&gt; In contemporary literature, kama refers usually to sexual desire.&lt;ref name=jamesl&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 1, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 340&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term also refers to any sensory enjoyment, emotional attraction and aesthetic pleasure such as from arts, dance, music, painting, sculpture and nature.&lt;ref name=kmrvv&gt;See:
* Kate Morris (2011), The Illustrated Dictionary of History, {{ISBN|978-8189093372}}, pp 124;
* Robert E. Van Voorst, RELG: World, Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-1-111-72620-1}}, pp 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rp10/&gt;

The concept kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in the [[Veda]]s. For example, Book 10 of the [[Rig Veda]] describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn 129, it states:
{{Quote
|1=&lt;poem&gt;
कामस्तदग्रे समवर्तताधि मनसो रेतः परथमं यदासीत |
सतो बन्धुमसति निरविन्दन हर्दि परतीष्याकवयो मनीषा ||&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10129.htm Rig Veda Book 10 Hymn 129] Verse 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire the primal seed and germ of Spirit,
Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=[[Rigveda|Rig Veda]]|3=~ 15th Century BC&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffith (Translator, 1895), [https://archive.org/stream/hymnsrigveda00unkngoog#page/n580/mode/2up ''The Hymns of the Rig veda''], Book X, Hymn CXXIX, Verse 4, pp 575&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism, uses the term kama, also in a broader sense, to refer to any desire:
{{Quote
|1=&lt;poem&gt;
Man consists of desire (kama),
As his desire is, so is his determination,
As his determination is, so is his deed,
Whatever his deed is, that he attains.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|3=7th Century BC&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier]], ''A Survey of Hinduism'', 3rd Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, pp. 173-174&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indian literature such as the Epics, which followed the Upanishads, develop and explain the concept of kama together with Artha and Dharma. The [[Mahabharata]], for example, provides one of the expansive definitions of kama. The Epic claims kama to be any agreeable and desirable experience (pleasure) generated by the interaction of one or more of the five senses with anything congenial to that sense and while the mind is concurrently in harmony with the other goals of human life (dharma, artha and moksha).&lt;ref name=rp&gt;R. Prasad (2008), ''History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization'', Volume 12, Part 1, {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, Chapter 10, particularly pp 252-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Kama often implies the short form of the word kamana (desire, appetition or appetite). Kama, however, is more than kamana. Kama is an experience that includes the discovery of an object, learning about the object, emotional connection, the process of enjoyment and the resulting feeling of well-being before, during, and after the experience.&lt;ref name=rp10&gt;R. Prasad (2008), ''History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization'', Volume 12, Part 1, {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, pp 249-270&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vatsyayana]], the author of the [[Kamasutra]], describes kama as happiness that is a ''manasa vyapara'' (phenomenon of the mind). Just like the Mahabharata, Vatsyayana's ''Kamasutra'' defines kama as pleasure an individual experiences from the world, with one or more senses: ̨hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and feeling—in harmony with one's mind and soul.&lt;ref name="ksv"/&gt; Experiencing harmonious music is kama, as is being inspired by natural beauty, the aesthetic appreciation of a work of art, and admiring with joy something created by another human being. ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', in its discourse on kama, describes many forms of art, dance, and music, along with sex, as the means to pleasure and enjoyment.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt;

John Lochtefeld explains&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt; kama as desire, noting that it often refers to sexual desire in contemporary literature, but in ancient Indian literature kāma includes any kind of attraction and pleasure such as those deriving from the arts.

Karl Potter describes&lt;ref name=karlp&gt;Karl H. Potter (2002), ''Presuppositions of India's Philosophies'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807792}}, pp. 1-29&lt;/ref&gt; kama as an attitude and capacity. A little girl who hugs her teddy bear with a smile is experiencing kama, as are two lovers in embrace. During these experiences, the person connects and identifies the beloved as part of oneself and feels more complete, fulfilled, and whole by experiencing that connection and nearness. This, in the Indian perspective, is kāma.&lt;ref name=karlp/&gt;

Hindery notes the inconsistent and diverse expositions of kama in various ancient texts of India. Some texts, such as the Epic [[Ramayana]], paint kama through the desire of Rama for Sita &amp;mdash; a desire that transcends the physical and marital into a love that is spiritual, and something that gives Rama his meaning of life, his reason to live.&lt;ref name=rh&gt;Roderick Hindery, "Hindu Ethics in the Ramayana", ''The Journal of Religious Ethics'', Vol. 4, No. 2 (Fall, 1976), pp. 299&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sita]] and [[Rama]] both frequently express their unwillingness and inability to live without the other.&lt;ref&gt;See verses at 2.30, 4.1, 6.1, 6.83 for example; Abridged Verse 4.1: "Sita invades my entire being and my love is entirely centered on her; Without that lady of lovely eyelashes, beautiful looks, and gentle speech, I cannot survive, O Saumitri."; for peer reviewed source, see Hindery, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Fall, 1976), pp 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; This romantic and spiritual view of kama in the Ramayana by [[Valmiki]] is quite different, claim Hindery&lt;ref name=rh/&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Khan (1965), ''The concept of Dharma in Valmiki Ramayana'', Delhi, {{ISBN|978-8121501347}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the normative and dry description of kama in the law codes of smriti by [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] for example.

[[Gavin Flood]] explains&lt;ref name=gavinf&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in [[Julius Lipner]] (Editor), ''The Fruits of Our Desiring'', {{ISBN|978-1896209302}}, pp 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; kama as "love" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), artha (material prosperity) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation).

==In Hinduism==
[[File:'1' Sun Temple Konark Temple, Kama Love Orissa India February 2014.jpg|thumb|Kama is celebrated in many Hindu temples, such as [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] and the [[Konark]] Temple (above).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Donaldson (2005), Konark, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195675917}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[Hinduism]], kama is regarded as one of the four proper and necessary goals of human life ([[purusharthas]]), the others being [[Dharma]] (virtuous, proper, moral life), [[Artha]] (material prosperity, income security, means of life) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, release, self-actualization).&lt;ref name=ascb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative precedence between Kama, Artha, and Dharma===
Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma precedes and is essential. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama lead to social chaos.&lt;ref name=gavinf16&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1896209302}}, pp 16-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vatsyayana]] in ''Kama Sutra'' recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha precedes kama, while dharma precedes both kama and artha.&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt; Vatsyayana, in Chapter 2 of ''Kama Sutra'', presents a series of philosophical objections argued against kama and then offers his answers to refute those objections. For example, one objection to kama (pleasure, enjoyment), acknowledges Vatsyayana, is this concern that kāma is an obstacle to moral and ethical life, to religious pursuits, to hard work, and to productive pursuit of prosperity and wealth. The pursuit of pleasure, claim objectors, encourages individuals to commit unrighteous deeds, bring distress, carelessness, levity and suffering later in life.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/10/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; These objections were then answered by Vatsyayana, with the declaration that kama is as necessary to human beings as food, and kama is holistic with dharma and artha.

===Kama is necessary for existence===
Just like good food is necessary for the well being of the body, good pleasure is necessary for the healthy existence of a human being, suggests Vatsyayana.&lt;ref name=vch2&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/8/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, Chapter 2, pp 8-11; pp 172&lt;/ref&gt; A life devoid of pleasure and enjoyment—sexual, artistic, of nature—is hollow and empty. Just like no one should stop farming crops even though everyone knows herds of deer exist and will try to eat the crop as it grows up, in the same way claims Vatsyayana, one should not stop one's pursuit of kama because dangers exist. Kama should be followed with thought, care, caution and enthusiasm, just like farming or any other life pursuit.&lt;ref name=vch2/&gt;

Vatsyayana's book the ''Kama Sutra'', in parts of the world, is presumed or depicted as a synonym for creative sexual positions; in reality, only 20% of ''Kama Sutra'' is about sexual positions. The majority of the book, notes Jacob Levy,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Levy (2010), Kama sense marketing, iUniverse, {{ISBN|978-1440195563}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, how and when it is good or bad. ''Kama Sutra'' presents kama as an essential and joyful aspect of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou, The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text, {{ISBN|978-0892815258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kama is holistic===
{{Love sidebar}}
Vatsyayana claims kama is never in conflict with dharma or artha, rather all three coexist and kama results from the other two.&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt;

{{Quote|1=A man practicing Dharma, Artha and Kama enjoys happiness now and in future. Any action which conduces to the practice of Dharma, Artha and Kama together, or of any two, or even one of them should be performed. But an action which conduces to the practice of one of them at the expense of the remaining two should not be performed.|2=Vatsyayana|3=The Kama sutra, Chapter 2&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/10/mode/2up Answer 4, The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Hindu philosophy, pleasure in general, and sexual pleasure in particular, is neither shameful nor dirty. It is necessary for human life, essential for well being of every individual, and wholesome when pursued with due consideration of dharma and artha. Unlike the precepts of some religions, kama is celebrated in Hinduism, as a value in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough and Bullough (1994), Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0824079727}}, pp 516&lt;/ref&gt; Together with artha and dharma, it is an aspect of a holistic life.&lt;ref name=rp10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Kraftsow, Yoga for Transformation - ancient teachings and practices for healing body, mind and heart, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-019629-0}}, pp 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; All three ''purusharthas''—Dharma, Artha and Kama—are equally and simultaneously important.&lt;ref&gt;C. Ramanathan, Ethics in the Ramayana, in History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization (Editor: R. Prasad), Volume 12, Part 1, {{ISBN|978-8180695445}}, pp 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kama and stage of life===
Some&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmashastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kāma (artistic desires) take precedence; in youth kāma and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence.

===Kama as deity===
Kama is personified as deity [[Kamadeva]] and his consort [[Rati]]. Deity Kama is comparable to the Greek deity [[Eros]]—they both trigger human sexual attraction and sensual desire.&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Kama rides a parrot, and the deity is armed with bow and arrows to pierce hearts. The bow is made of sugarcane stalk, the bowstring is a line of bees, and the arrows are tipped with five flowers representing five emotions-driven love states.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter and Turner, Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities, Francis &amp; Taylor, {{ISBN|978-1135963903}}, pp 258-259&lt;/ref&gt; The five flowers on Kama arrows are lotus flower (infatuation), ashoka flower (intoxication with thoughts about the other person), mango flower (exhaustion and emptiness in absence of the other), jasmine flower (pining for the other) and blue lotus flower (paralysis with confusion and feelings). Kama is also known as ''Ananga'' (literally "one without body") because desire strikes formlessly, through feelings in unseen ways.&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt; The other names for deity Kama include Madan (he who intoxicates with love), Manmatha (he who agitates the mind), Pradyumna (he who conquers all) and Kushumesu (he whose arrows are flowers).&lt;ref&gt;William Joseph Wilkins (193), [https://archive.org/stream/hindumythologyve00inwilk#page/268/mode/2up Hindu mythology, Vedic and Puranic], Thacker &amp; Spink, Indiana University Archives, pp 268&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon]], the [[Gautama Buddha]] renounced ([[Pali]]: ''[[nekkhamma]]'') sensuality (''kama'') in route to his [[bodhi|Awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, ''Dvedhavitakka Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 19) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.019.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a).]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhist [[householder (Buddhism)|lay practitioner]]s recite daily the [[Five Precepts]], a commitment to abstain from "sexual misconduct" (''kāmesu micchacara'' กาเมสุ มิจฺฉาจารา).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html#precepts Khantipalo (1995).]&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of Pali Canon discourses, the [[Dhammika Sutta]] ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 2.14) includes a more explicit correlate to this precept when the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] enjoins a follower to "observe celibacy or at least do not have sex with another's wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.14.irel.html|title=Dhammika Sutta: Dhammika|work=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy: kama, kamarupa and kamaloka==
In the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Blavatsky]], Kama is the fourth principle of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|septenary]], associated with emotions and desires, attachment to existence, volition, and lust.&lt;ref&gt;Farthing 1978 p.210.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamaloka''' is a ''semi''-material plane, subjective and invisible to humans, where disembodied "personalities", the astral forms, called Kama-rupa remain until they fade out from it by the complete exhaustion of the effects of the mental impulses that created these [[Eidolon (astral double)|eidolons]] of human and animal passions and desires. It is associated with [[Hades]] of ancient Greeks and the [[Amenti]] of the Egyptians, the land of Silent Shadows; a division of the first group of the ''[[Trailokya]]''.

A '''league system''' is a [[hierarchy]] of [[sports league|leagues]] in a sport. They are often called '''pyramids''', due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries.

In [[association football]], [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], league systems are usually connected by the process of [[promotion and relegation]], in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs.

In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most [[professional sports]] are divided into [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league]]s. [[Baseball]] and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body ([[Minor League Baseball]], an organization under the authority of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], governs baseball leagues; the [[United States Soccer Federation]] designates the American soccer pyramid.) [[Ice hockey]]'s professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by [[collective bargaining agreement]]s and affiliation deals between the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and [[ECHL]].

[[Gridiron football]] does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by [[List of gridiron football rules|very different sets of rules]] in different seasons (the [[National Football League|NFL]] plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while [[arena football]] and the [[indoor American football|minor indoor leagues]] each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with 2017's [[The Spring League]]); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23176">'''Learned industriousness''' is a [[behavior]]ally rooted theory developed by [[Robert Eisenberger]] to explain the differences in general work effort among people of equivalent [[Aptitude|ability]].  According to Eisenberger, individuals who are [[reinforcement|reinforced]] for exerting high effort on a task are also [[Reinforcement|secondarily reinforced]] by the [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] of high effort. Individuals with a history of reinforcement for effort are predicted to generalize this effort to new behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R. (1992). Learned Industriousness. ''Psychological Review'', 99(2), 248-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operationalization of industriousness ==
An individual is considered industrious if he or she demonstrates [[Perseveration|perseverance]] and [[determination]] in performing a task. This term has also been used interchangeably with [[work ethic]],&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;Tucker-Ladd, C. E. (1996). ''Psychological self-help''. The Self-Help Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; which is generally regarded as the attitude that hard work and effort is virtuous. Learned industriousness theory asserts that industriousness is developed over time through a history of reinforcement.

== Possible relationship to learned helplessness ==
[[Learned helplessness]] is a term to explain a specific pattern of [[behavior]] that occurs in both animals and humans. When an animal or human is consistently exposed to an aversive condition (pain, unpleasant noise, etc.) and is unable to escape this condition, that animal or human will become helpless and stop attempting escape.  The animal or human may develop motivational deficits, as demonstrated in [[Learned helplessness#Foundation of research and theory|learned helplessness experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;Overmier, J. B., &amp; Seligman, M. E. P. (1967). Effects of inescapable shock upon subsequent escape and avoidance responding. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', 63, 28-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, learned industriousness theory attempts to explain why some individuals are more motivated than others. In an attempt to merge these two phenomena, Eisenberger, Park, &amp; Frank invoked learned industriousness in children by providing task-contingent verbal approval for a small group of behaviors, contrasting this with a group of children conditioned to exhibit learned helplessness, and a control group. On a subsequent approval-contingent task, children conditioned task-contingent verbal approval outperformed controls. However, the learned-helplessness group performed no differently from controls.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1976a"&gt;Eisenberger, R., Park, D. C., &amp; Frank, M. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/33/2/227/ Learned industriousness and social reinforcement.] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(2), 227-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antecedents of industriousness ==
=== Effort ===
[[Effortfulness|Effort]] is the subjective experience of fatigue felt by the body when it is in motion or meets resistance.&lt;ref&gt;English, H. B., &amp; English, A. C. (1968). ''A comprehensive dictionary of psychological and psychoanalytical terms''. New York: McKay.&lt;/ref&gt; This fatigue can refer to both physical and mental fatigue depending on the task at hand. Until the theory of learned industriousness, effort was generally considered an [[aversive]] sensation. Hull summed up this concept with the Law of Least Effort, which asserts that individuals will choose a solution that minimizes effort for any given problem. Learned industriousness theory is considered an addendum to the Law of Least Effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1943). ''Principles of behavior''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship between effort and goal-setting strategies ====
Individuals with high levels of industriousness have a history of applying great effort towards tasks. It has been demonstrated in many studies that different uses of goals result in more effort and task persistence. Thus, specific goal-setting strategies are antecedents to effort and subsequently increase the likelihood of an individual 'learning' industriousness. Below is an overview of the findings.

A [[goal]] is defined as the "object or aim of an action".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E. A. &amp; Latham, G. P. (2002). Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation. ''American Psychologist'', 57(9), 705-717.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[motivation]]al tools, goals have been shown to improve performance in a wide variety of settings. For example, one study looked at the effects of high goals versus low goals on performance. To investigate this effect, students were given goals for a [[brainstorming]] activity; those with higher goals were able to brainstorm more ideas than those with lower goals. Therefore, the investigator concluded that [[goal setting]] not only increases performance, but more ambitious goals evoke better performance than lower-set goals.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E. A. (1982). Relation of goal level to performance with a short work period and multiple goal levels. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 67(4), 512-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to improving performance, setting goals also increases task effort and persistence. In one study, participants were assigned to three groups: short-term goals, long-term goals, and a control group with no goals. The participants were then asked to attempt a complicated mirror maze as many times as they would like. Both groups with goals persisted on the maze task significantly longer than the control group, providing evidence that goals promote higher effort and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, R. N., Korienek, G., Jarvis, D., McColskey, D., &amp; Candeletti, G. (1981). Goal-setting and task persistence. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 53, 881-882.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another facet of goals that has been studied in relation to task persistence is whether the goal is a cooperative or competitive goal structure. A cooperative goal structure is one in which an individual must work alongside a group to reach a common goal, whereas a competitive goal structure is one in which an individual competes with others to reach a goal. The investigators tested whether participants' social values (cooperativeness, competitiveness, and individualism) moderate the relationship between goal structure and task persistence. In accordance with their hypotheses, individuals who were classified as "cooperators" persisted longer on the cooperative goal-structured task than the competitive goal-structured task. Similarly, individuals who were classified as "individualists" persisted longer on a competitive goal-structured task than a cooperative one. Therefore, the investigators conclude that the effect of "cooperative versus competitive goal structures on task persistence are influenced by individuals' social values and history of rewarded effort".&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1992a"&gt;Eisenberger, R., Kuhlman, D. M., &amp; Cotterell, N. (1992). Effects of social values, effort training, and goal structure on task persistence. ''Journal of Research in Psychology'', 26, 258-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The relationship between effort and task interest/difficulty ====
There are certain aspects of tasks that induce greater effort and persistence: a performer's interest in the task and the level of difficulty of the task. These factors are relevant in creating an environment where an individual is likely to exert more effort and, in turn, become more industrious. Therefore, task interest and task difficulty may both act as moderators in the relationship between effort and industriousness.

Task interest, or an individual's engagement in an activity, is claimed to be an antecedent to the exertion of effort on a task. In a study by Fisher &amp; Noble, the hypothesis that task interest is important for self-regulation during performance and task effort was empirically tested. The findings suggest that task interest positively predicted effort with a significant correlation.  While a significant correlation cannot prove causation, there is evidence that higher effort is linked to higher intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Fisher, C. D. &amp; Noble, C. S. (2004). A within-person examination of correlates of performance and emotions while working. ''Human Performance'', 17(2), 145-168.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported this finding as well.&lt;ref&gt;Izard, C. E., &amp; Ackerman, B. P. (2000). Motivational, organizational, and regulatory functions of discrete emotions. In M. Lewis &amp; J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.), ''Handbook of Emotions'' (pp. 253-264). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sansone, C., &amp; Smith, J. L. (2000). Interest and self-regulation: The relation between having to and wanting to. In C. Sansone &amp; J. M. Harackiewicz (Eds.), ''Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: The search for optimal motivation and performance'' (pp. 341-372). San Diego, CA: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Task difficulty is also suggested to precede high effort. The reasoning behind this claim is that high difficulty tasks evoke high effort exertion if the individual is motivated to succeed on the task. The study conducted by Fisher and Noble also supports this hypothesis, as a significant positive relationship between task difficulty and effort was found.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

=== Reinforcement ===
According to Daniels &amp; Daniels, [[reinforcement]] is any stimulus, event, or situation that fulfills the following two requirements:
:# Follows a behavior
:# Increases the frequency of that behavior&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;Daniels, A. C., &amp; Daniels, J. E. (2006). ''Performance Management: Changing Behavior that Drives Organizational Effectiveness''. Atlanta, GA: Performance Management Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], event, or situation is considered a reinforcer if it follows a targeted behavior and causes the increased occurrence of that behavior. Many confuse the terms "reward" and "reinforcer" because they often mean the same thing; a reward is given as a consequence of a desired behavior and often motivates an individual to perform that behavior again in order to receive another reward. However, individuals can receive rewards and not increase the behavior in question (e.g., receiving a prize for completing a marathon may not motivate an individual to run more marathons). In that case, the reward is not a reinforcer because it does not increase the frequency of the behavior. Positive reinforcement is any stimulus that is presented after a behavior and increases the frequency of that behavior. Negative reinforcement is the removal of an aversive stimulus after a behavior that increases the frequency of that behavior. Both positive and negative reinforcement are effective in the development of industriousness.

==== Reinforcing high effort ====
Learned industriousness theory asserts that reinforcing an individual for achieving a performance standard increases the likelihood of that individual's performing those behaviors again. If the individual exerted high levels of effort during the completion of the task, the effort takes on its own reinforcing value. This is because the individual enjoys the sensation of working hard because it is associated with reinforcement. Therefore, this individual is more likely to generalize this high level of effort to other tasks because it is less aversive and is associated with positive results. On the other hand, the theory also claims that if an individual has a history of being reinforced for completing tasks with very low levels of effort, that individual will eventually generalize this low level of effort to other tasks. This facet of the theory is termed "learned laziness."&lt;ref name="Text" /&gt; Evidence for these claims is provided below.

Eisenberger's theory claims an essentially dichotomous relationship between effort and reinforcement: the exertion of low effort on a simple tasked paired with high levels of reinforcement will result in low levels of effort on future tasks; on the other hand, the exertion of high effort on a difficult task paired with low levels of reinforcement (intermittent reinforcement) will result in high levels of effort on future tasks.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1992a" /&gt; A study conducted by Drucker et al. showed support for this claim. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to computer tasks that ranged in level of difficulty and then given either high or low levels of reinforcement for performance on the task. Participants then were given an anagram task on which their persistence time was measured. In accordance with Eisenberger's theory, individuals who were highly reinforced for performance on the low-difficulty computer task spent less time persisting on the subsequent anagram task, demonstrating that the low level of effort generalized to another activity. Additionally, individuals who were given low levels of reinforcement for performance on the moderately high-difficulty computer task spent more time persisting on the anagram task. This demonstrated that the effort exerted on the first task, paired with low levels of reinforcement, generalized to the following task. However, participants who were given the highest-difficulty computer tasks did not generalize this effort. According to the researchers, this version of the task was so difficult that the participants could not succeed and thus demonstrated a pattern of behaviors similar to learned helplessness.&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;Drucker, P. M., Litto, T., Drucker, D. B., &amp; Stevens, R. (1998). Relation of task difficulty to persistence. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 86, 787-794.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
=== Increased effort ===
In addition to being an antecedent to industriousness, effort is the foremost consequence of learned industriousness theory.  As predicted by the theory, multiple experimental studies have demonstrated increased effort when paired with reinforcement.

Pierce, Cameron, Banko, and So conducted two studies in directly testing Eisenberger's theory.  Mimicking Drucker's methodology, the authors placed participants in a task that was of either constant or progressively higher difficulty and then either rewarded for completing the task or not rewarded (a 2x2 experiment).  Afterwards the participants were presented with a difficult free-choice task.  Participants who were in the progressive difficulty-reward condition spent more time on the free-choice task, especially compared to the constant difficulty-reward condition (who spent the least amount of time).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, W. D., Cameron, J., Banko, K. M., &amp; So, S. (2003). Positive effects of rewards and performance standards on intrinsic motivation. ''The Psychological Record'', 53(4), 561-579.&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, Cameron, Pierce, and So repeated the experiment, this time with an easy/difficult task condition split instead of a constant/progressive difficulty condition split.  Not only did participants in the difficult-reward condition put forth more effort in the free-choice phase, the authors found that participants who were rewarded for completing the difficult task performed better on the free choice task than those who were not rewarded.  Additionally, participants who were rewarded for completing the easy task performed worse on the free choice task than those who were not rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, J., Pierce, W., &amp; So, S. (2004). Rewards, Task Difficulty, and Intrinsic Motivation: A Test of Learned Industriousness Theory. ''Alberta Journal of Educational Research'', 50(3), 317-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar study found that the secondary effort reinforcement, both positive and negative, is equally transferable to tasks other than the one originally used in the conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Gear, A. (2008). ''Learned industriousness and intrinsic motivation: Effects of rewards and task difficulty on students' free-choice performance and interest''. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Creativity ===
There have been many studies looking at the links between [[creativity]] and rewards.  Many argue that if students are rewarded for a task such as creativity, they will be less interested, perform worse, and enjoy the task less once the reward is removed.&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. L., Koestner, R., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1999). A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 125, 627-668.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1Kohn, A. (1993). ''Punished by rewards: The trouble with gold stars, incentive plans, A's, praise, and other bribes''. Boston, MA US: Houghton, Mifflin and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberger applied his learned industriousness theory to studies of creativity to show that extrinsic rewards do not always negatively affect intrinsic motivation or creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R., &amp; Shanock, L. (2003). Rewards, Intrinsic Motivation, and Creativity: A Case Study of Conceptual and Methodological Isolation. Creativity Research Journal, 15, 121-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a similar training, Eisenberger and Selbst performed a series of experiments looking at whether creativity and divergent thought could be conditioned in the same manner as effort.  Participants performed a task where they pulled letters out of a long word to create different words and were either given a performance standard (high difficulty condition) or no performance standard (low difficulty condition). After completing five rounds of words, the participants were instructed to make as many unique drawings from a circle as they could.  The pictures were judged for uniqueness and general creativity.&lt;ref name="Eisen"&gt;Eisenberger, R., &amp; Selbst, M. (1994). Does reward increase or decrease creativity?. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 66(6), 1116-1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors found similar results to previous learned industriousness studies: participants in the high difficulty-low reward condition showed more creativity in the circle drawing task than those without a reward while participants in the low difficulty-low reward showed even less creativity. Although most creativity research up until that point suggested that any reward for creative thoughts reduced generalized creativity,&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, K. O., &amp; McCullers, J. C. (1979). Evidence of a detrimental effect of extrinsic incentives on breaking a mental set. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 15(3), 285-294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (1982). Reinforcement-induced behavioral stereotypy: How not to teach people to discover rules. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'', 111(1), 23-59.&lt;/ref&gt; this study showed that increases or decreases in generalized creativity depend on whether or not high or low divergent thought is rewarded.&lt;ref name="Eisen" /&gt;

=== Smoking/drug habits ===
Currently the area of study that learned industriousness has been cited in the applied world is [[smoking]] and drug cessation research.  An example of such research is Quinn et al.'s correlational study which examined the levels of persistence of smokers vs. non-smokers using the Anagram Persistence Task (APT) and the Mirror-Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT). As predicted, non-smokers had higher levels of persistence than smokers.  The authors suggested that people who have been reinforced with high effort throughout their lives would be more persistent in their use of strategies for [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress than smokers and that people reinforced with low effort would be more likely to use low effort strategies when coping with stress (such as smoking). In addition, people with low persistence are less likely to produce the high effort behaviors required to quit smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, E. P., Brandon, T. H., &amp; Copeland, A. L. (1996). Is task persistence related to smoking and substance abuse? The application of learned industriousness theory to addictive behaviors. ''[[Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology]]'', 4(2), 186-190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding support to Brandon et al.'s hypotheses is a study by Brown, Lejuez, Kahler, &amp; Strong.  The authors found that smokers who have never been able to quit for more than a day had lower levels of persistence than those who were able to quit for at least 3 months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R. A., Lejuez, C. W., Kahler, C. W., &amp; Strong, D. R. (2002). Distress tolerance and duration of past smoking cessation attempts. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 111(1), 180-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by Brandon, Herzog, Juliano, Irvin, Lazev, &amp; Simmons continued the work of the previous two by using a longitudinal perspective.  After testing for persistence using the APT and the MTPT, the participants went through eleven days of [[smoking cessation]] therapy that included [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]], training on coping strategies, and [[nicotine replacement therapy]].  Participants were then contacted on a monthly basis for 6 months and then at 9 and 12 months for updates on their smoking habits.  In addition to supporting previous findings that smokers perform worse on persistence tasks, participants who scored higher on the persistence tasks were less likely to relapse during the 12-month period of the study.  Although the study was again limited because of its correlational design, the authors suggest that their results fit within the theoretical framework of learned industriousness.&lt;ref name="Brandon"&gt;Brandon, T. H., Herzog, T. A., Juliano, L. M., Irvin, J. E., Lazev, A. B., &amp; Simmons, V. (2003). Pretreatment task persistence predicts smoking cessation outcome. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 112(3), 448-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional study by Steinberg et al. looking at adolescents and smoking found much of the same results as Brandon et al.  Non-smoking adolescents scored higher on a self-reported persistence measure than smokers and smokers who planned on quitting scored higher than those who did not plan on quitting.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, M. B., Akincigil, A., Delnevo, C. D., Crystal, S., &amp; Carson, J. L. (2006). Gender and Age Disparities for Smoking-Cessation Treatment. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine'', 30(5), 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future research ==
There are several areas in which the literature on learned industriousness can be expanded. Due to the unclear results of Eisenberger's study of a Learned Industriousness-Learned Helplessness Continuum, further research should be done to provide evidence for or against its existence. This research could be useful for personnel selection purposes and understanding performance in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1976a"/&gt;  Also, the most current smoking-related learned industriousness research has been correlational; experimental studies could not only be powerful evidence for the theory but also generate important practical contributions for smoking cessation therapy.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Louis Marius Vialleton''' (December 22, 1859 - December 18, 1929) was a French [[zoologist]] and writer, best known for his advocation of [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|non-Darwinian evolution]].

==Career==

Vialleton was born in [[Vienne]]. He was the first professor of [[histology]] in the faculty of medicine at the [[University of Montpellier]].&lt;ref name="Lavabre-Bertrand"&gt;Lavabre-Bertrand T. (2015). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26043467 ''Louis Vialleton (1859-1929) was the first Professor of Histology in the Faculty of medicine of Montpellier'']. Rev Hist Pharm (Paris) 62 (385): 109-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Vialleton rejected any form of continuous evolution and favoured [[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. p. 396 {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vialleton attempted to refute gradual [[transformism]] from a morphological perspective in his work ''Morphologie générale Membres et ceintures des vertébrés tétrapodes: Critique morphotogique du transformisme'' (1924).&lt;ref name="Engels"&gt;Engels, Eve-Marie; Glick, Thomas F. (2008). ''The Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe, Volume 1''. Continuum. pp. 341-242. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5833-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoologist [[Étienne Rabaud]] responded with a critical article.&lt;ref name="Engels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabaud, Étienne. (1924) 'Transformisme et morphologie', Bulletin biologique de la France et de la Belgique 58: 321-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed the chapter ''Morphologie et transformisme'' to the book ''Le Transformisme'' (1927). Vialleton's views were often misrepresented by [[Creationism|creationists]] as anti-evolutionary. His writings were influential to creationists such as [[Douglas Dewar]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). ''[[The Creationists|The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 146. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not reject evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Abigail; Richards, Robert J.; Ruse, Michael. (2004). ''Darwinian Heresies''. Cambridge University Press. p. 85. {{ISBN|0-521-81516-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also incorrectly described as a critic of evolution by [[A. Morley Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Morley A. (1937). [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.175916/2015.175916.Evolution-And-Its-Modern-Critics#page/n1 ''Evolution And Its Modern Critics'']. London: Thomas Murby &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vialleton was a [[Vitalism|vitalist]].&lt;ref name="Lavabre-Bertrand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Normandin, Sebastian; Wolfe, Charles T. (2013). ''Vitalism and the Scientific Image in Post-Enlightenment Life Science, 1800-2010''. p. 247. Springer. {{ISBN|978-9400724440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucy Burns''' (July 28, 1879 – December 22, 1966) was an American [[suffragist]] and women's rights advocate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a passionate activist in the [[United States]] and in the [[United Kingdom]]. Burns was a close friend of [[Alice Paul]], and together they ultimately formed the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 8), Lunardini, 1986 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Burns was born in New York to an Irish Catholic family.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; She was described by fellow National Woman's Party member [[Inez Haynes Irwin]] as "blue-eyed and fresh-complexioned; dimpled; and her head is burdened, even as Alice Paul's, with an enormous weight of hair." She was extremely beautiful, and lewd men always treated her disrespectfully.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, 1921 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; She was a gifted student and first attended Packer Collegiate Institute, or what was originally known as the Brooklyn Female Academy, for second preparatory school in 1890.&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Packer Collegiate Institute prided itself on "teaching girls to be ladies", and they emphasized religious education while advocating more liberal ideals such as educating "the mind to habits of thinking with clearness and force."&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; Burns also met one of her lifelong role models, Laura Wylie, while attending [[Packer Collegiate Institute]]. Wylie was one of the first women to go to [[Yale University]] Graduate School.&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; Burns also attended [[Columbia University]], [[Vassar College]], and Yale University before becoming an English teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 6), Lunardini, 1986 (p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns taught at Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the educational field, she generally found the experience to be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 8, 14)&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at [[Oxford University]] to study English.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; Burns was fortunate enough to have a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

==Early activism==

Burns's first major experiences with activism were with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom from 1909 to 1912.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; While attending graduate school in Germany, Lucy Burns traveled briefly to England where she met [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p8-9), Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 456)&lt;/ref&gt; She was so inspired by their activism and charisma that she dropped her graduate studies to stay with them and work in the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], an organization dedicated to fighting for women's rights in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="autogenerated23"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was employed by the Women's Social and Political Union as a salaried organizer from 1910 to 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; While working with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom, Lucy Burns became increasingly passionate about activism and participated in numerous campaigns with the WSPU. One of her first major contributions was organizing a parade in [[Edinburgh]] as part of the campaign in Scotland in 1909.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; While Burns is not a widely known speaker from the woman's rights movement, she did make a variety of speeches in marketplaces and on street corners while in Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; Her activism resulted in numerous court appearances and reports of "disorderly conduct" in the newspapers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; In August 1909, she hid on the roof of the St Andrew's Hall in [[Glasgow]] She planned to break through the roof and disrupt a political speech by the Earl of Crewe in front of an all-male audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Glasgow Herald |date=21 Aug 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

While working with the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Both women had been arrested for demonstrating, and Alice Paul introduced herself when she noticed that Lucy Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, 1921 (p. 9); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Barker-Benfield and Clinton, 1991 (p. 457)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by [[Anna Howard Shaw]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt;

Suffrage historian [[Eleanor Clift]] compares the partnership of Paul and Burns to that of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that they "were opposites in appearance and temperament... [w]hereas Paul appeared fragile, Burns was tall and curvaceous, the picture of vigorous health...unlike Paul, who was uncompromising and hard to get along with, Burns was pliable and willing to negotiate. Paul was the militant; Burns, the diplomat."&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 97); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their stark differences, Paul and Burns worked together so effectively that followers would often describe them as having "one mind and spirit.".&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==National American Women Suffrage Association==
Upon returning to the United States, Paul and Burns joined the [[National American Women Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) as leaders of its Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; Both women felt it was critical to hold the political party in power responsible for a federal suffrage amendment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; By holding an entire party accountable, Paul and Burns believed that congressmen would be forced to take action or risk losing their seats.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; This militant tactic was presented by Paul and Burns at the 1912 NAWSA convention in Philadelphia to Anna Howard Shaw and other NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; NAWSA leaders rejected their proposal because they felt any action against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which had just won the presidential election, was premature at that point.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; Not willing to back down without a fight, Burns and Paul enlisted the help of [[Jane Addams]], a well-respected and more unorthodox NAWSA leader, to petition their cause to her fellow NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; While the women were forced to tone down their proposal, NAWSA leaders did authorize a [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|suffrage parade]] during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[First inauguration of Woodrow Wilson|inauguration]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt;  NAWSA's one stipulation was that Paul and Burns' Congressional Committee would receive no further funding from NAWSA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; While Burns and Paul readily agreed to this stipulation, this event marked the beginning of their divide with NAWSA.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

==Congressional Union==

Because of the arguments over tactics and funding, Burns and Paul felt it would be best if they added to NAWSA's Congressional Committee and formed a group still associated with NAWSA, but one with its own governing body. This new committee was called the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association.&lt;ref name="autogenerated25"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was elected unanimously as an executive member of the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1913, NAWSA decided they wanted to distance themselves from the more radical group and no longer allowed their name to be used in the title, so the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association was renamed just the [[Congressional Union]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt; Despite this, Burns and Paul still wanted the Congressional Union to be associated with NAWSA, so they applied for it to be considered a NAWSA auxiliary.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt; The Congressional Union was granted auxiliary membership, but the relationship remained tenuous.&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 44-49)&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the growing tensions between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted to give them an ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make sure you don't get reelected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 99)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns stated "Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility."&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his [[State of the Union address|address to Congress]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

NAWSA felt they could no longer tolerate the radical tactics employed and advocated by the Congressional Union, and they wanted to officially sever their ties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27 /&gt; Paul and Burns did not want to start a completely separate organization that could potentially rival NAWSA and hinder progress in the movement, so they tried on numerous occasions to initiate negotiations with NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their efforts, the Congressional Union officially split from NAWSA on February 12, 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Many predicted that this split would do irreparable harm to women's campaign for suffrage; the cynics did not discourage Paul and Burns, and they began planning their campaign against the Democrats in the summer of 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In addition to confronting the Democratic Party, Burns and Paul had to address displeased members within their own organization; some women were complaining that the Congressional Union was elitist, authoritarian, and undemocratic.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed centralized authority was critical to accomplishing their goals and operating effectively, so they did not make any drastic changes; to appease their members they solicited suggestions and stated "We would be most grateful for any constructive plan which you can lay before us."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

While trying to address both internal and external attacks, the Congressional Union worked to keep the Anthony amendment afloat in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 56)&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthony amendment, or Mondell Resolution, was a federal amendment for woman's suffrage and what would ultimately become the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|nineteenth amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 225)&lt;/ref&gt; Since their split from NAWSA, [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]] had become the chairwoman of NAWSA's Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Without consulting the NAWSA Board, she had endorsed the alternative Shafroth-Palmer amendment on their behalf.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; This posed a huge threat to the work of Burns and Paul because the Shafroth amendment, if passed, would make suffrage a states' rights only issue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  While Burns, Paul, and other women from both the Congressional Union and NAWSA met to address this issue, NAWSA ultimately remained in support of the Shafroth amendment, and the Congressional Union continued its campaign for federal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 55, 59)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was the first woman to speak before the Congressional delegates in 1914, when the Anthony amendment finally made it out of committee and into the House.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt; While her speech was primarily intended to set the stage for Alice Paul, she also outlined the accomplishments of the Congressional Union.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The fact that she was the first to speak at such a critical time for federal suffrage shows not only her courage in the face of opposition, but how well respected she was by her fellow leaders and suffragists. The speeches of Burns and Paul were incredibly important at that time in the movement because they showed politicians that women would unite as a voting bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the Congressional Union sent two organizers to each of the nine states where women had the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 63)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns went to [[San Francisco, California]] with suffragist Rose Winslow.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 63); Bland, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing women in these states was not an easy task, and raising adequate funds was found to be particularly troublesome; Burns is quoted as saying "If the women here, however, would only give me the money they are willing to spend on luncheons and dinners I will get along admirably."&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns spread the message about suffrage in theaters, on the streets, by going door-to-door, and by circulating cartoons and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; By election time in 1914 the Democratic Party had become an extremely vocal critic of the Congressional Union, and ultimately the Congressional Union claimed responsibility for five Democratic losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 the Congressional Union decided to put its efforts into organizing in every state that did not already have a branch.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of this plan was to continue what their 1914 state-by-state campaign had started and make suffrage a national issue with demand in every state.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 1915 Burns also became the editor of the Congressional Union's  newspaper ''The Suffragist''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time period, NAWSA was experiencing a lot of internal strife. After their convention in 1915, Anna Howard Shaw stepped down as president, and many believed this would be a time for potential reconciliation between the Congressional Union and NAWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 81-82)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns and Paul met with NAWSA officials and other women from the Congressional Union at the [[Willard Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. on December 17, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt; NAWSA wanted the Congressional Union to become an affiliate but they had numerous demands—the Congressional Union was to end its anti-Democratic Party campaign and never wage any political campaigns in the future.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 84)&lt;/ref&gt; These demands were viewed as completely unreasonable, and the meeting ended without any reconciliation or possibility of future attempts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==National Woman's Party==
After all of the turmoil of the past few years, Alice Paul announced a radical new plan for 1916—she wanted to organize a woman's political party.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns adamantly supported this plan and on June 5, 6 and 7, 1916 at the Blackstone Theater in Chicago, delegates and female voters met to organize the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP).&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 449); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Paul were committed to [[direct action]] in fighting for women's rights and particularly their right to vote.  They were opposed by more conservative suffragists who advocated less militant tactics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27 /&gt;  NAWSA leaders thought the tactics of the National Woman's Party were futile and would alienate Democrats that were sympathetic to suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership in the NWP was limited to only enfranchised women, and their sole goal was promoting a federal amendment for woman's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns played a large role in the National Woman's Party. She worked in virtually every aspect of the organization at one time or another.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, she was a chief organizer, lobby head, newspaper editor, suffrage educator, teacher, orator, architect of the banner campaign, rallying force, and symbol of the NWP.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;  In Burns 'suffrage schools', she taught women how to conduct automobile campaigns, lobby, and work with the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;  She was savvy with working with the media and supplied two hundred news correspondents with frequent news bulletins.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Woman's Party led dozens of women to picket the White House in Washington, D.C. as [[Silent Sentinels]] beginning in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 449)&lt;/ref&gt;  A bi-partisan organization, it directed its attacks at the office of the President of the United States, in this case, Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns also opposed World War I, seeing it as a war led by powerful men that resulted in young men being drafted and giving their lives with little free will.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/national-womans-party-nwp |title=National Woman's Party (NWP) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=September 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307182835/http://www.history.com/topics/national-womans-party-nwp |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her career with the National Woman's Party, Burns was known to have a bitter sense of injustice and become angry because of the actions of the President or apathetic Americans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

==Life in jail==
[[File:Lucy Burns in Occoquan Workhouse.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Lucy Burns in [[Occoquan Workhouse]], [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]

Burns was arrested while picketing the White House and was sent to [[Occoquan Workhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 138)&lt;/ref&gt;  In jail, Burns joined Alice Paul and many other women in hunger strikes to demonstrate their commitment to their cause, asserting that they were political prisoners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 142)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles.html |title=Visionaries: Lucy Burns (1879-1966) |author= |work=Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns was prepared for the hunger strikes since she had previously participated in them in Europe with the WSPU.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt;  Being imprisoned did not stop Burns' activism. From within the workhouse she organized protests with other prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

Burns also helped organize and circulate one of the first documents that defined the status of political prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  This document described the rights of political prisoners and listed their demands for an attorney, family visits, reading and writing materials, and food from outside the prison.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  It was circulated through holes in the walls until every suffrage prisoner had signed it.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1920; Clift, 2003 (p. 142)&lt;/ref&gt;  Once prison officials realized what Burns was doing, they had her transferred to a district jail and put in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

After Burns was released, she was quickly rearrested for continuing protests, picketing, and marching at the White House.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 150)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed to make an example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the "[[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt; To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit was not going to be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head and stood in the same position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, "I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman's Party organizer."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

After enduring the torture of the "Night of Terror," the women refused to eat for three days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt;  The guards tried to tempt the women with fried chicken, but this was only viewed as an insult; Burns told the other women "I think this riotous feast which has just passed our doors is the last effort of the institution to dislodge all of us who can be dislodged. They think there is nothing in our souls above fried chicken."&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing something urgent needed to be done or he would potentially have dead prisoners on his hands, the warden moved Burns to another jail and told the remaining women that the strike was over.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  He also ordered Burns to be force fed. Historian Eleanor Clift recounts that the force feeding of Lucy Burns required "five people to hold her down, and when she refused to open her mouth, they shoved the feeding tube up her [[nostril]]." This treatment was extremely painful and dangerous, causing Burns to have severe nosebleeds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  Of the well-known suffragists of the era, Burns spent the most time in jail.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt;

==Final push for suffrage==

Burns and other suffragists had been told by the chairman of the House Committee on Suffrage that the House would not pass a suffrage amendment before 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;  To their surprise, it was announced in late 1917 that the House would make a decision on January 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5); Clift, 2003 (p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment passed in the House by a vote of 274 to 136, and the women of the NWP, including Burns, began working on the 11 additional votes they would need for the amendment to pass in the Senate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately on June 27, 1918, the Senate narrowly failed to pass the amendment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;

Burns and Paul were enraged, but after coming so close there was no chance that they were going to give up now. They resumed their protests at the White House on August 6, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 162)&lt;/ref&gt; Once again the women were jailed, exposed to horrendous conditions, and released shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 164)&lt;/ref&gt; Their focus then was moved to helping pro-suffrage candidates get elected in November.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 167)&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the NWP did not give allegiance to one party over another; they supported anyone who was willing to support suffrage, and this cost the Democrats their majority in Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

As tensions grew between the suffragists and President Wilson, he realized something had to be done quickly to end the highly publicized protests and clashes between the police and suffragists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated26"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 178)&lt;/ref&gt;  He requested that Congress convene for a special session in May 1919.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;  On May 21 the House of Representatives passed the Susan B. Anthony amendment 304 to 89, and on June 4, the Senate passed it 66 to 30.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 178-179)&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly, the suffragists were very subdued at the announcement of this victory.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 180)&lt;/ref&gt;  The suffragists battle was not yet over; they still had to make sure a majority of the states ratified the amendment. Finally in August 1920, [[Tennessee]] became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the Anthony amendment, and Burns' quest for federal suffrage was finally over.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5); Clift, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point Burns was completely exhausted and quoted as saying "I don't want to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore."&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;  All of her time spent in jail and experiences as a suffragist had left her bitter towards married women and others who didn't take action during the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles.html |title=Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party |author= |work= |publisher=Library of congress |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She died on December 22, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sicherman|first=Barbara|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary, Volume 4|year=1993|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ.

==Legacy==

===''Iron Jawed Angels''===

In 2004, HBO Films broadcast ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'', chronicling the voting rights movement of Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, and other suffragists. Burns was portrayed by Australian actress [[Frances O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iron-jawed-angels.com/ |title=Iron Jawed Angels |author=[[Katja von Garnier]] |date=January 16, 2005 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=September 3, 2010}} {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Units of measurement]] used in [[Malaysia]] and neighbouring countries include the ''[[Catty|kati]]'', a unit of [[mass]], and the ''gantang'', a unit of [[volume]].

== Mass ==

In measuring amount by mass, the common unit is ''[[Catty|kati]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singlishdictionary.com/singlish_K.htm#kati "Kati" entry] at A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English.&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 1{{fraction|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;lb (604.79 g).&lt;ref name="my_law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weights and Measures Act 1972 |work=Laws of Malaysia |url=http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182503/http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A higher unit is ''[[Picul|pikul]]'' or ''picul'', which is 100 ''kati'' or {{convert|133.333|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Xinhua Zidian"&gt;新华字典 (''[[Xīnhuá Zìdiǎn]]''), Peking, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Volume ==
{{Other uses|Gantang (disambiguation)}}
In measuring amount by volume, the common unit is ''gantang'' (gallon), which is  equivalent to {{convert|1|impgal|lk=on}} or 8 pints. 
To make it clear,
Gantang equals a Gallon. A Gallon has sub measurements of 4 Quarts, or 8 Pints, or 16 Cups. A Gantang has sub measurements of 4 Churpak, or 8 Leng, or 16 Chentong. 
Churpak equals a Quart.
Leng equals a Pint.
Chentong equals a Cup.&lt;ref&gt;

''Chentong'' is also normally used only in certain areas, and so eight ''leng'' makes up a ''gantang''.

When used to measure unhusked rice, a ''gantang'' weights about {{convert|4|to|5|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8200">'''Masking''' is a process in which an individual changes or "masks" their natural personality to conform to social pressures, [[abuse]], and/or [[harassment]]. Some examples of masking are a single overly dominant [[temperament]], or [[The four humours|humor]], two incongruent temperaments, or displaying three of the four main temperaments within the same individual. Masking can be strongly influenced by environmental factors such as authoritarian parents, [[Social rejection|rejection]], and [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]], or [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse. An individual may not even know he or she is wearing a mask because it is a behavior that can take many forms.

[[File:P culture yellow.png|thumb|In theater, comedy and tragedy masks are used to help the actors portray their emotions similar to how people in society wear a mask to portray emotions that are acceptable]]

Masking should not be confused with masking behavior which is to mentally block feelings of suffering as a survival mechanism.

== History ==
The term masking was first used to describe the act of concealing disgust by 
[[Paul Ekman|Ekman]] (1972) and Friesen (1969).&lt;ref name=DeGere&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Gere|first=Dawn|title=The face of masking: Examining central tendencies and between-person variability in display management and display rule|journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought of as a learned behavior. Developmental studies have shown that this ability has begun as early as preschool and improves with age.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Pamela|title=Children's Spontaneous Control of Facial Expression|journal=Child Development|date=Dec 1986|volume=57|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00459.x|pages=1309–1321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent developmental studies, masking has evolved and is now defined as concealing one's emotion by portraying another emotion. It is mostly used to conceal a negative emotion (usually sadness, frustration, and anger) with a positive emotion.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

== Causes ==
Contextual factors including relationships with one's conversation partner, status differences, location, and social setting are all reasons as to why an individual would express, suppress, or mask an emotion.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt; Masking is a facade to behave in certain ways that would help one hide their emotions and represses emotions that are not approved by those around them. Because a person wants to receive acceptance from the public, masking helps disguise characteristics like [[anger]], [[jealousy]] or [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] - emotions that would not be considered socially acceptable.&lt;ref name=Malchiodi&gt;{{cite web|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy|title=The Healing Arts|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-healing-arts/201003/cool-art-therapy-intervention-8-mask-making|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

=== Situations ===
* [[Personal space]]: Varies with individuals could be masking emotions to those close to them or strangers.
* Setting

=== Gender differences ===
Masking negative emotions differ for each gender. Females tend to have an easier time hiding their negative emotions towards something they dislike than males do.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Teresa|title=Gender Differences in Masking Negative Emotions: Ability or Motivation?|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=31|issue=4|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.4.660|pages=660–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the disputable reasons as to why females are able to mask their negative emotions better is [[Peer pressure|society's pressure]] that a girl must act nice.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

=== Ethnicity ===
Masking also differs between cultures. Some studies state that certain cultures tend to moderate their expressions of emotion while others show a greater amount of positive emotions and expressions.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Each person masks their emotions differently. During one's childhood, an individual learns to behave a certain way when they receive approval from those around them and thus develops a mask. The individual is "not conscious of the role they've adopted and is projecting outwards to people they meet".&lt;ref name=Kundalini&gt;{{cite web|last=Kundalini|first=Betsy|title=Article: The Mask of the Personality|url=http://phoenixtools.org/articles/mask.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases where the individual is highly conscious, they may not know that they are wearing a mask. Wearing a mask takes away energy from our consciousness and, in the long run, wears out our energy.&lt;ref name = Kundalini /&gt; A person's mask is noticeable when he or she is sick or weak as the individual will no longer have the power to keep the mask on.

== Consequences ==
Little is known about the effects of masking one's negative emotions. In the workplace, masking leads to feelings of dissonance, insincerity, job dissatisfaction, emotional and physical exhaustion, and self-reported health problems.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Cynthia|author2=Neal Ashkanasy|title=The Emerging Role of Emotions in Work Life: An introduction|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|year=2000|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1379(200003)21:2&lt;123::aid-job33&gt;3.3.co;2-# |url=http://espace.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:139850/Fisher_Ashkanasy_2001.pdf|volume=21|pages=123–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also reported experiencing [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic symptoms]] and deleterious physiological and cognitive effects as a consequence.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

[[File:Madame Fortuna.png|thumb|A mask is usually used to conceal emotions]]

== Masked emotions ==
Emotions that are usually concealed:
* [[Anger]]
* [[Anxiety]]
* [[Disgust]]

{{about|the heraldic charge|the French commune|Maure, Pyrénées-Atlantiques}}
A '''Maure''', since the 11th century, is the [[symbol]] of a Moor's [[Human head|head]]. The term has [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Greek language|Greek]] origins; see [[Moors]].

== Flags, seals, and emblems ==
This symbol is used for political purposes.

=== The Maure ===
The Maure is the [[African Unification Front]]'s [[flag]] and [[emblem]].

=== Flag of Corsica ===
The main [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the coat of arms in [[Corsica]] is ''{{lang|co|U Moru}}'', [[Corsican language|Corsican]] for "The Moor", originally a female Moor blindfolded and wearing a necklace made of beads. An early version is attested in the 14th-century [[Gelre Armorial]], where an unblindfolded Moor's head represents Corsica as a state of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1736, it was used by both sides during the struggle for independence.

In 1760, General [[Pasquale Paoli]] ordered the necklace to be removed from the head and the blindfold raised.  His reason, reported by his biographers, was ''"{{lang|fr|Les Corses veulent y voir clair. La liberté doit marcher au flambeau de la philosophie. Ne dirait-on pas que nous craignons la lumière ?}}"'' ({{lang-en|"The Corsicans want to see clearly. Freedom must walk by the torch of philosophy. Won't they say that we fear the light?"}})  Later the blindfold was changed to a headband.

The current [[flag of Corsica]] is the ''{{lang|it|Bandera testa Mora}}'' ("{{lang|en|Flag with head of Maure}}"), is male rather than female, and has a regular knot at the back of the head.

=== Flag of Sardinia ===
The [[flag of Sardinia]] is informally known as ''the Four Moors'' ({{Lang-it|I quattro mori}}, {{Lang-src|Sos Bator Moros}}, {{Lang-sro|Is Cuatru Morus}}) and comprises four Moor heads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="725">A '''mining simulator''' is a system used to replicate elements of [[mining]] operations, for [[training]] or efficiency analysis. Mining simulation application can range from pure statistical analysis, to scale models, all the way to replica cabins of mining machinery mounted on [[pneumatic]] actuators surrounded by screens displaying [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] imagery. These simulators rely on [[physics engine]]s and [[geodata]] to accurately simulate the dynamics of the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4465">In [[quality control]], '''multi-vari''' charts are a visual way of presenting variability through a series of charts.  The content and format of the charts has evolved over time.

==Original concept==
Multi-vari charts were first described by Leonard Seder in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Seder
 | first = Leonard
 | year = 1950
 | title = Diagnosis with Diagrams—Part I
 | periodical = Industrial Quality Control
 | publication-place = [[New York, New York]]
 | publisher = [[American Society for Quality|American Society for Quality Control]]
 | volume = 7
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 11–19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Seder
 | first = Leonard
 | year = 1950
 | title = Diagnosis with Diagrams—Part II
 | periodical = Industrial Quality Control
 | publication-place = [[New York, New York]]
 | publisher = [[American Society for Quality|American Society for Quality Control]]
 | volume = 7
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 7–11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were developed independently by multiple sources.  They were inspired by the stock market [[candlestick chart]]s or [[open-high-low-close chart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Juran
 | first = Joseph M.
 | author-link = Joseph M. Juran
 | year = 1962
 | title = Quality Control Handbook
 | edition = 2
 | publication-place = [[New York, New York]]
 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]
 | pages = 11–30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally conceived, the multi-vari chart resembles a [[Shewhart individuals control chart]] with the following differences:
*The quality characteristic of interest is measured at two extremes (around its diameter, along its length, or across its surface) and these measurements are plotted as vertical lines connecting the minimum and maximum values over time.
*The quality characteristic of interest is plotted across three horizontal panels that represent:
:*Variability on a single piece
:*Piece-to-piece variability
:*Time-to-time variability
*The quality characteristic of interest is plotted against upper and lower [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] rather than [[control limits]].

The three panels are interpreted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Juran
 | first = Joseph M.
 | author-link = Joseph M. Juran
 | year = 1962
 | title = Quality Control Handbook
 | edition = 2
 | publication-place = [[New York, New York]]
 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]
 | pages = 11–30–11–31
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Panel !! Condition !! Corrective action
|-
| Variability on a single piece || Lengths of the vertical lines (i.e., the [[Range (statistics)|range]]) exceed one-half the specifications (or more) || Repair or realignment of tool
|-
| Piece-to-piece variability || Excessive scatter || Examine process inputs for excessive variability—lengths of the vertical lines are estimates of [[process capability]]
|-
| Time-to-time variability || Appearance of a [[Stationary process|non-stationary process]] || Examine process inputs or steps for evidence of shifts or drifts
|}

==Recent usage==

More recently, the term "multi-vari chart" has been used to describe a visual way to display [[analysis of variance]] data (typically be expressed in tabular format).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Tague
 | first = Nancy R.
 | year = 1995
 | title = The Quality Toolbox
 | edition = 2
 | publication-place = [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]
 | publisher = [[American Society for Quality|American Society for Quality Control]]
 | pages = 356–359
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of a series of panels which portray minimum, mean, and maximum responses for each treatment combination of interest rather than for periods of time.

Because it is a two-dimensional representation of multiple dimensions (one for each factor in the ANOVA), the multi-vari chart is only useful for comparing the variability among at most four factors.

The chart consists of the following:
*One horizontal panel for each level of the outermost factor
*One cluster of points representing the minimum, mean, and maximum responses for the particular treatment combination, connected by lines for each level of the innermost factor
*In the case of four factors, vertical panels for each level of the next-innermost factor
*As with [[control chart]]s, the vertical axis depicts the quality characteristic of interest (or experimental response)

The traditional '''Burmese units of measurement''' are still in everyday use in [[Myanmar]] (also known as Burma). According to the CIA Factbook, Myanmar is one of three countries that have not adopted the [[International System of Units]] (SI) [[metric system]] as their official system of weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook, Appendix G: Weights and Measures |year=2010 |work=Web Pages |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=10 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528121337/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-g.html |archivedate=28 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2011, the [[Government of Burma|Burmese government]]'s [[Ministry of Commerce (Burma)|Ministry of Commerce]] began discussing proposals to reform the measurement system in Burma and adopt the metric system used by most of its trading partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = &amp;#91;USMA:50911&amp;#93; RE: Ditch the viss, govt urges traders|date = 24 July 2011|publisher = The Mail Archive|work = The Myanmar Times|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807132552/http://www.mail-archive.com/usma@colostate.edu/msg40068.html|archive-date=7 August 2011 |access-date = 2015-09-19|via = The Internet Archive|url = https://www.mail-archive.com/usma@colostate.edu/msg40068.html|at = (At bottom of page)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2013, Dr. Pwint San, Deputy Minister for Commerce, announced that the country was preparing to adopt the metric system.&lt;ref name=convert&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3684:myanmar-to-adopt-metric-system&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384| title=Myanmar to adopt metric system| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324092305/http://elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3684:myanmar-to-adopt-metric-system&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384| archive-date=2015-03-24| dead-url=yes| website=www.elevenmyanmar.com |publisher=[[Eleven Media Group]] |access-date=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the nation uses Burmese units only, although Burmese government web pages in English use [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[Metric system|metric]] units inconsistently. For instance, the Ministry of Construction uses miles to describe the length of roads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.construction.gov.mm/PW/Activities.htm |title=Public Works, Fields Of Activities |year=2006 |work=Web Page |publisher=Ministry Of Construction |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and square feet for the size of houses,&lt;ref name="Housing Development"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.construction.gov.mm/DHSH/HousingD.htm |title=Housing Development |year= 2006 |work=web page |publisher=Ministry Of Construction |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but square kilometres for the total land area of new town developments in Yangon City.&lt;ref name="Housing Development"/&gt; The Ministry of Agriculture uses acres for land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moai.gov.mm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Ministry of Agriculture and Information |date=2009–2010 |work=Web Page |publisher=Myanmar Agriculture |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613032846/http://www.moai.gov.mm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses kilometres (with mile equivalents in parentheses) to describe the dimensions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mofa.gov.mm/aboutmyanmar/geography.html |title=About Myanmar : Geography |year=2009 |work=web page |publisher= The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Myanmar |accessdate=11 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805022516/http://www.mofa.gov.mm/aboutmyanmar/geography.html |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oncorhynchus masou formosanus''''',  the '''Formosan landlocked salmon'''&lt;ref&gt;Yan HY (2000) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q078143304260l20/fulltext.pdf Threatened fishes of the world: ''Oncorhynchus masou formosanus'' (Jordan &amp; Oshima, 1919) (Salmonidae)] ''Environmental Biology of Fishes'' 57:314.&lt;/ref&gt; or Taiwanese salmon, is a  freshwater [[salmonid]] fish [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Taiwan]].

The Formosan landlocked salmon is a subspecies of the more widespread West-Pacific [[cherry salmon]] (or masu salmon). This Taiwanese subspecies is [[critically endangered]], being at high risk for [[extinction]], and is protected in its native habitat. The Formosan land-locked salmon is one of the rarest fish in the world. Once a staple of the [[Taiwanese aborigine]] diet, there are now barely more than 400 of this type of salmon left. [[Overfishing]] has led to its decline. [[Conservationists]] are trying to save this subspecies which is threatened nowadays mainly by [[pollution]].

Formosan landlocked salmon are about a foot in length and inhabit cold, slow-flowing streams with gently sloping beds at elevations above {{convert|1500|m}}, such as the [[Chichiawan]] Stream and the [[Kaoshan Stream]] (formerly named [[Hsuehshan]] Stream/Wuling Stream) in the upper reaches of the [[Tachia River]].

The taxonomic rank of the endemic Taiwanese salmon is in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kottelat, M. 1996.  [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/15323/all Oncorhynchus formosanus].   [http://www.iucnredlist.org 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ]  Downloaded on 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors consider it not distinct from the nominate cherry salmon (''O. masou masou''), others as a regional subspecies ''O. masou formosanus'', and still others list is as a full species ''O. formosanus''.

At this time, these salmon represent the southernmost natural distribution of members of the family [[Salmonidae]] in Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">{{about|the pacifist organization||Peacemaker (disambiguation)}}
'''Peacemakers''' was an [[United States|American]] [[pacifist]] organization.  The name of the group was taken from a section of the Bible, the [[Beatitudes]] or Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”

The group was founded following a conference on “More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity” in [[Chicago]] in July 1948 to advocate [[nonviolent resistance]] in the service of peace, particularly [[conscription|draft]] resistance and [[tax resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won’t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 446-447&lt;/ref&gt;  The group’s members vowed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) to refuse to serve in the armed forces in either peace or war; (2) to refuse to make or transport weapons of war; (3) to refuse to be conscripted or to register; (4) to consider to refuse to pay taxes for war purposes — a position already adopted by some; (5) to spread the idea of peacemaking and to develop non-violent methods of opposing war through various forms of non-cooperation and to advocate unilateral disarmament and economic democracy.[http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeI_1948/I-32.pdf]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group was organized largely by [[Ernest Bromley|Ernest]] and [[Marion Bromley]] and [[Juanita Nelson|Juanita]] and [[Wally Nelson]].&lt;ref name="Cooney"&gt;Cooney, Robert and Michalowski, Helen ''The Power of the People: Active Nonviolence in the United States'' (1987) p. 115-8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the organization’s other founders were [[A.J. Muste]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Ralph T. Templin]], [[Roy Kepler]], [[Cecil Hinshaw]], [[Milton Mayer]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[George Houser]], and [[Horace Champney]]. &lt;!-- incomplete - anyone have the full list? --&gt; Many members came from the [[Committee for Nonviolent Revolution]], which had been formed two years before.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt; Some other participants of note included [[Benny Bargen]], [[Dorothy Day]], [[Ralph DiGia]], [[Fyke Farmer]], [[Walter Gormly]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Bradford Lyttle]], [[Maurice McCrackin]], [[Mary Stone McDowell]], [[Karl Meyer (activist)|Karl Meyer]], [[James Otsuka]], [[James Peck (pacifist)|Jim Peck]], [[Eroseanna Robinson]], [[Igal Roodenko]], [[Max Sandin]], [[George Willoughby (activist)|George Willoughby]], [[Lillian Willoughby]], and [[Edmund Wilson]].

The “Tax Refusal Committee” of Peacemakers is credited for founding the modern American war tax resistance movement.  Peacemakers published the first guide to war tax resistance in 1963. There had been examples of organized war tax resistance in America for centuries, largely in congregations of the [[historic peace churches]], but Peacemakers was the first non-sectarian organized war tax resistance group.

Peacemakers differed from other pacifist and nonviolent resistance organizations in its emphasis on small-scale, local, "cell"-based organization and [[intentional community|intentional communities]]. It had no national office, paid staff, or membership list. Some member groups organized funds to aid war resisters and people in the civil rights movement who had suffered reprisals.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoremediation is a cost-effective plant-based approach of remediation that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It refers to the natural ability of certain plants called [[hyperaccumulator]]s to bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for phytoremediation. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoremediation began to emerge in recent years together with biological and engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve phytoremediation. In addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for [[environmental cleanup]].&lt;ref name=Salt1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salt DE, Smith RD, Raskin I |title=PHYTOREMEDIATION |journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology |volume=49 |issue= |pages=643–668 |year=1998 |pmid=15012249 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.643 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Phytoremediation may be applied wherever the [[soil]] or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic [[pollution]]. Examples where phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air. Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives,&lt;ref name="scriptieprijs.be"&gt;[http://www.scriptieprijs.be/NL/index.php?page=44&amp;cat=4&amp;id=1363 Phytoremediation of soils using Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomas tolaasi, Burkholderia fungorum reported by Sofie Thijs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326121916/http://www.scriptieprijs.be/NL/index.php?page=44&amp;cat=4&amp;id=1363 |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide. Many plants such as [[mustard plant]]s, [[Thlaspi caerulescens|alpine pennycress]], [[hemp]], and [[pigweed]] have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at [[toxic waste]] sites.

Not all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due to differences the physiology of the plant.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even cultivars within the same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic.  While it has the advantage that environmental concerns may be treated in situ, one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term commitment, as the process is dependent on a plant's ability to grow and thrive in an environment that is not ideal for normal plant growth.

==Advantages and limitations==
*'''Advantages''':
** the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional processes both ''in situ'' and ''ex situ''
** the plants can be easily monitored
** the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by companies specializing in "phyto mining")
** it is potentially the least harmful method because it uses naturally occurring organisms and preserves the environment in a more natural state.
** it preserves the topsoil, maintaining the fertility of the soil&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Hazrat|last2=Khan|first2=Ezzat|last3=Sajad|first3=Muhammad Anwar|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metals—Concepts and applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075|journal=Chemosphere|volume=91|issue=7|pages=869–881|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** the use of plants also reduces erosion and metal leaching in the soil&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Limitations''':
** phytoremediation is limited to the surface area and depth occupied by the roots.
** slow growth and low [[biomass]] require a long-term commitment
** with plant-based systems of remediation, it is not possible to completely prevent the leaching of contaminants into the [[groundwater]] (without the complete removal of the contaminated ground, which in itself does not resolve the problem of contamination)
** the survival of the plants is affected by the toxicity of the contaminated land and the general condition of the soil.
** bio-accumulation of contaminants, especially metals, into the plants which then pass into the [[food chain]], from primary level consumers upwards or requires the safe disposal of the affected plant material.
** when taking up heavy metals, sometimes the metal is bound to the soil organic matter, which makes it unavailable for the plant to extract&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarma|first=Hemen|title=Metal Hyperaccumulation in Plants: A Review Focusing on Phytoremediation Technology|url=http://www.scialert.net/abstract/?doi=jest.2011.118.138|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Technology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=118–138|doi=10.3923/jest.2011.118.138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoremediation of efficiency of metal by ''Ficus microcarpa'' was evaluated through a real scale experiment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Jie|last2=Cai|first2=Limei|last3=Qi|first3=Shihua|last4=Wu|first4=Jian|last5=Gu|first5=Xiaowen Sophie|date=February 2018|title=Heavy metal remediation with  Ficus microcarpa  through transplantation and its environmental risks through field scale experiment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|journal=Chemosphere|volume=193|pages=244–250|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|issn=0045-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root biomass production of the species varied significantly from 3.68 to 5.43 g because of the spatial heterogeneity of different metals. According to the study it could take 4-93 years to purify excess Cd on the experimental site. Mercury was unable to be premeditated by ''F. microcarpa''. The species of plant was moved to unpolluted soil. When transplanted Cd and CU were transferred to the rhizosphere soil. Pb and Hg were not released.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Kaltag School oil seep (Alaska) ===
The [[Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. EPA|Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation]] (ADEC) has been monitoring fuel oil spills at the Kaltag School in [[Kaltag, Alaska|Kaltag]], [[Alaska]], since 1991. The community has been working with ADEC to use a phytoremediation plan drafted by scientists at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. The ADEC continues to keep the public informed of the progress on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dec.alaska.gov/Applications/SPAR/PublicMVC/CSP/SiteReport/289|title=Division of Spill Prevention and Response|last=Alaska|first=Division of Spill Prevention and Response, Department of Environmental Conservation, State of|website=dec.alaska.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==

A range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating environmental problems:
=== Phytoextraction ===
{{See also|Phytoextraction process}}
Phytoextraction (or ''phytoaccumulation'' or ''phytosequestration'') uses plants or algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass. The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate it above ground in the plant biomass&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Organisms that can uptake extremely high amounts of contaminants from the soil are called '''[[hyperaccumulators]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rascio|first=Nicoletta|last2=Navari-Izzo|first2=Flavia|title=Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: How and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168945210002402|journal=Plant Science|volume=180|issue=2|pages=169–181|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants (e.g.[[Populus]] and [[Salix]]) that take up lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil.&lt;ref&gt; Guidi Nissim W., Palm E., Mancuso S., Azzarello E. (2018) "Trace element phytoextraction from contaminated soil: a case study under Mediterranean climate". Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1197-x &lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or other inorganics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilon-Smits|first=Elizabeth|date=2005-04-29|title=Phytoremediation|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|volume=56|issue=1|pages=15–39|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation. Mining of these extracted metals through '''phytomining''', is also being experimented with as a way of recovering the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hyperaccumulators are plants that can naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted. In many cases these are [[metallophyte]] plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic metals. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning fluid containing a [[chelator]] or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doumett|first=S.|last2=Lamperi|first2=L.|last3=Checchini|first3=L.|last4=Azzarello|first4=E.|last5=Mugnai|first5=S.|last6=Mancuso|first6=S.|last7=Petruzzelli|first7=G.|last8=Bubba|first8=M.

Examples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:

*[[Cadmium]], using willow (''[[Salix viminalis]]''): In 1999, one research experiment performed by Maria Greger and Tommy Landberg suggested willow has a significant potential as a phytoextractor of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), as willow has some specific characteristics like high transport capacity of heavy metals from root to shoot and huge amount of biomass production; can be used also for production of bio energy in the biomass energy power plant.&lt;ref name="Greger"&gt;{{Citation |last=Greger |first=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Landberg |first2=T. |title=Using of Willow in Phytoextraction |journal=International Journal of Phytoremediation |year=1999 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=115–123 |doi=10.1080/15226519908500010  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cadmium]] and [[zinc]], using alpine pennycress (''[[Thlaspi caerulescens]]''), a hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be [[poison|toxic]] to many plants. On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its growth (see table for reference).
*[[Lead]], using Indian mustard (''[[Brassica juncea]]''), ragweed (''[[Ambrosia artemisiifolia]]''), hemp dogbane (''[[Apocynum cannabinum]]''), or [[poplar trees]], which sequester lead in their biomass.

=== Phytostabilization ===
Phytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of substances from the [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less available for plant or human uptake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An example application of phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain [[mine tailings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278–83 |title=Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments—An Emerging Remediation Technology |vauthors=Mendez MO, Maier RM |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid=18335091 |pmc=2265025 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024115430/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodegradation ===
Phytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released through transpiration.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.or.jp/Ietc/Publications/Freshwater/FMS2/2.asp|title=Phytoremediation Processes|website=www.unep.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process works best with organic contaminants like herbicides, [[trichloroethylene]], and [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Phytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant [[metabolism]], often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization). In the case of [[organic compounds|organic]] pollutants, such as [[pesticides]], [[explosives]], [[solvents]], industrial chemicals, and other [[xenobiotic]] substances, certain plants, such as [[Canna (plant)|Cannas]], render these substances non-toxic by their [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze&gt;{{Citation |author=Kvesitadze, G. |title=Biochemical Mechanisms of Detoxification in Higher Plants |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-28996-8 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, [[microorganism]]s living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term ''phytotransformation'' represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.
The term "Green Liver" is used to describe phytotransformation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=H. |last=Sanderman |title=Higher plant metabolism of xenobiotics: the "green liver" concept |journal=Pharmacogenetics |volume=4 |pages=225–241 |year=1994 |doi=10.1097/00008571-199410000-00001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as plants behave analogously to the human [[liver]] when dealing with these [[xenobiotic]] compounds (foreign compound/pollutant).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Burken, J.G. |chapter=2. Uptake and Metabolism of Organic Compounds: Green-Liver Model |editor1=McCutcheon, S.C. |editor2=Schnoor, J.L. |title=Phytoremediation: Transformation and Control of Contaminants |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/047127304X.ch2 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/summary/106569012/SUMMARY?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |series=A Wiley-Interscience Series of Texts and Monographs |isbn=0-471-39435-1 |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramel, F., Sulmon, C., Serra, A.A., Gouesbet, G., [http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1117-0043 Couée I.] (2012), “Xenobiotic sensing and signalling in higher plants”, Journal of Experimental Botany, 63(11):3999-4014, doi: 10.1093/jxb/ers102, {{PMID|22493519}}&lt;/ref&gt; After uptake of the xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).

This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds ([[drug metabolism]]). Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450]]s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases, esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze /&gt;

In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where [[glucuronidation]] (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes, e.g. [[UGT1A1]]) and [[glutathione]] addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.

Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.

In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics polymerize in a [[lignin]]-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.

Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation. [[Trinitrotoluene]] phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.&lt;ref name="Subra"&gt;{{Citation |first=Murali |last=Subramanian |first2=David J. |last2=Oliver |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=Jacqueline V. |last3=Shanks |title=TNT Phytotransformation Pathway Characteristics in Arabidopsis: Role of Aromatic Hydroxylamines |journal=Biotechnol.

=== Phytostimulation ===
Phytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of [[soil life|soil microbial]] activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process occurs within the [[rhizosphere]], which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plants release carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in the biodegradation of the organic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dzantor|first=E. Kudjo|date=2007-03-01|title=Phytoremediation: the state of rhizosphere ‘engineering’ for accelerated rhizodegradation of xenobiotic contaminants|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/jctb.1662|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology|language=en|volume=82|issue=3|pages=228–232|doi=10.1002/jctb.1662|issn=1097-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the microorganisms are able to digest and break down the toxic substances into harmless form.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Phytostimulation has been shown to be effective in degrading petroleum hydrocarbons, PCBs, and PAHs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Phytostimulation can also involve aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the stimulation of [[atrazine]] degradation by [[hornwort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rupassara|first=S. I.|title=Degradation of Atrazine by Hornwort in Aquatic Systems|year=2002|last2=Larson|last3=Sims|last4=Marley|first2=R. A.|first3=G. K.|first4=K.

=== Phytovolatilization ===
Phytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Limmer|first=Matt|last2=Burken|first2=Joel|date=2016-07-05|title=Phytovolatilization of Organic Contaminants|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=50|issue=13|pages=6632–6643|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through phytovolatilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rhizofiltration ===
[[Rhizofiltration]] is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess [[nutrients]]. The pollutants remain absorbed in or adsorbed to the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process is often used to clean up contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an off-site location.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In either case though, typically plants are first grown in a greenhouse under precise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2|title=Phytoremediation of Soils|last=Surriya|first=Orooj|last2=Saleem|first2=Sayeda Sarah|last3=Waqar|first3=Kinza|last4=Kazi|first4=Alvina Gul|pages=1–36|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological hydraulic containment ===
Biological [[hydraulic containment]] occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary|title=Phytotechnology and Photosynthesis|last=Evans|first=Gareth M.|last2=Furlong|first2=Judith C.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470975152|pages=145–174|doi=10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodesalination ===
Phytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract salt from the soil to improve its fertility&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Role of genetics ==
Breeding programs and [[genetic engineering]] are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants.  Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a [[micro-organism]] or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.&lt;ref name="Hannink"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hannink |first=N. |last2=Rosser |first2=S. J. |last3=French |first3=C. E. |last4=Basran |first4=A. |last5=Murray |first5=J. A. |last6=Nicklin |first6=S. |last7=Bruce |first7=N. C. |title=Phytodetoxification of TNT by transgenic plants expressing a bacterial nitroreductase |journal=Nature Biotechnology |year=2001 |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1168–72 |doi=10.1038/nbt1201-1168 |pmid=11731787 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous [[polyamine]]s, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.

== Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactions ==
A plant is said to be a [[hyperaccumulator]] if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example: more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of dry weight for [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[chromium]] or [[lead]]; or more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[zinc]] or [[manganese]]).&lt;ref name="BB89"&gt;{{Citation |first=A. J. M. |last=Baker |first2=R. R. |last2=Brooks |title=Terrestrial higher plants which hyperaccumulate metallic elements – A review of their distribution, ecology and phytochemistry |journal=Biorecovery |year=1989 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=81–126 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This capacity for accumulation is due to '''hypertolerance''', or ''phytotolerance'': the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including [[mycorrhiza]]e, [[pollen]] and seed dispersal), commensalism, and [[biofilm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">In [[ethics]], the '''plank of Carneades''' is a [[thought experiment]] first proposed by [[Carneades]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]; it explores the concept of [[self-defense]] in relation to [[murder]].

In the thought experiment, there are two shipwrecked sailors, A and B.  They both see a plank that can only support one of them and both of them swim towards it.  Sailor A gets to the plank first.  Sailor B, who is going to drown, pushes A off and away from the plank and, thus, proximately, causes A to drown.  Sailor B gets on the plank and is later saved by a rescue team. The thought experiment poses the question of whether Sailor B can be tried for murder because if B had to kill A in order to live, then it would arguably be in self-defense.

[[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]] by legal philosopher [[Lon Fuller]] is a similar exploration of morality and legality ''in extremis''.

Although the term '''''pseudo-photograph''''' can be applied regardless of what it depicts, in law its meaning is especially relevant regarding [[child pornography]].

In the UK, the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] amended the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] so as to define the concept of an "indecent pseudo-photograph of a child".

The '''Shouwang Church''' (守望教会) is a [[Protestant]] [[house church (China)|house church]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and almost the biggest of about 3,000 of such  congregations in the city. The word ''shouwang'' means "to keep watch" in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref name=Gauthier&gt;{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Ursula|title=Why Do Christian Groups in China Put Authorities on Red Alert?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2075386,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and membership==
The church was founded in 1993 by Jin Tianming, a chemical engineering graduate of [[Tsinghua University]] of [[Koreans in China|Korean]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name="duihua.org"&gt;''Dui Hua'', issue 46, Winter 2012: ''[http://duihua.org/wp/?p=5313 Uncovering China’s Korean Christians]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of its members has increased from 10 to 1,000 as of June 2011.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

The services are conducted at members' homes or in rented conference rooms; its other activities include 40 [[biblical]] reading groups, [[choir]] practice and [[catechism]]. Shouwang members typically belong to the middle and upper classes, and include professors, doctors, lawyers, students and [[Communist Party of China|Party]] members.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

==Persecution==
Like other house churches, the Shouwang Church is subject to [[harassment]] by the Chinese authorities, who disapprove of religious groups that are not subject to state control.&lt;ref name = Gauthier /&gt; The church was forced to change headquarters more than 20 times, and was prevented from buying or renting a [[church (building)|church]] building.&lt;ref name = Gauthier /&gt;

Persecution intensified in the context of the general [[2011 crackdown on dissidents in the People's Republic of China|2011 crackdown on dissidents]], following an announcement by church leaders that they would begin holding [[Sunday]] service meetings in public, if they were not allowed to acquire premises.&lt;ref name = "Köckritz"&gt;{{cite news | last = Köckritz| first = Angela| title = Hier stehen wir!

A '''shrunken head''' is a severed and specially prepared [[human head]] that is used for trophy, ritual, or trade purposes.

[[Headhunting]] has occurred in many regions of the world, but the practice of headshrinking has only been documented in the northwestern region of the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/national-geographic-channel/specials-1/exploration-adventure/ngc-preview-amazon-headshrinkers.html|title=National Geographic: Images of Animals, Nature, and Cultures|work=nationalgeographic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230151722/http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/national-geographic-channel/specials-1/exploration-adventure/ngc-preview-amazon-headshrinkers.html|archivedate=2011-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only tribes known to have shrunken human heads are of the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaroan tribes]]. These include the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], [[Achuar people|Achuar]], [[Huambisa people|Huambisa]] and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]] tribes, found in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Shuar call a shrunken head a ''tsantsa'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Rubenstein]] (2006) Circulation, Accumulation, and the Power of Shuar Shrunken Heads. ''Cultural Anthropology'' vol 22 issue 3 pp. 357-399&lt;/ref&gt; also [[transliterated]] ''tzantza''. Many tribe leaders would show off their heads to scare enemies.

== Process ==
[[File:Shrunken head amazon pitt rivers.JPG|thumb|Shrunken head from the [[Shuar people]], on display in the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], [[Oxford]]]]

The process of creating a shrunken head begins with removing the skull from the neck.  An incision is made on the back of the ear and all the skin and flesh is removed from the cranium. Red seeds are placed underneath the nostrils and the lips are sewn shut. The mouth is held together with three palm pins. [[Fat]] from the flesh of the head is removed. Then a wooden ball is placed under the flesh in order to keep the form. The flesh is then boiled in water that has been saturated with a number of herbs containing [[tannin]]s. The head is then dried with hot rocks and sand, while molding it to retain its human features. The skin is then rubbed down with charcoal ash. Decorative beads may be added to the head.&lt;ref name=Nolan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolan, M.D.|first1=Edward J.|title=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|date=1915|isbn=|page=204|edition=Volume 66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-TwAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the head shrinking tradition, it is believed that coating the skin in ash keeps the ''muisak'', or avenging soul, from seeping out.

Shrunken heads are known for their [[prognathism|mandibular prognathism]], facial distortion and shrinkage of the lateral sides of the forehead; these are artifacts of the shrinking process.

Among the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] and [[Achuar people|Achuar]], the reduction of the heads was followed by a series of feasts centered on important rituals.

== Significance ==
[[File:Shrunken Head - Lightner Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Shrunken head exhibited at the [[Lightner Museum]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].]]
The practice of preparing shrunken heads originally had religious significance; shrinking the head of an enemy was believed to harness the spirit of that enemy and compel him to serve the shrinker. It was said to prevent the soul from avenging his death.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;Duncan 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuar believed in the existence of three fundamental spirits:
*'''Wakani''' – innate to humans thus surviving their death.
*'''Arutam''' – literally "vision" or "power", protects humans from a violent death.
*'''Muisak''' – [[vengeful spirit]], which surfaces when a person carrying an arutam spirit is murdered.

To block a Muisak from using its powers, they severed their enemies' heads and shrank them. The process also served as a way of warning their enemies. Despite these precautions, the owner of the trophy did not keep it for long.  Many heads were later used in religious ceremonies and feasts that celebrated the victories of the tribe. Accounts vary as to whether the heads would be discarded or stored.

== Trade ==
When Westerners created an economic demand for shrunken heads there was a sharp increase in the rate of killings in an effort to supply tourists and collectors of ethnographic items.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Ross, Jane. 1984 "Effects of Contact on Revenge Hostilities Among the Achuara Jívaro," in Warfare Culture, and Environment, ed. R.B. Ferguson, Orlando: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Daniel 1999 "Trade Goods and Jívaro Warfare: The Shuar 1850–1956, and the Achuar, 1940-1978," in Ethnohistory 46(4): 745-776.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms [[headhunting]] and headhunting parties come from this practice.

Guns were usually what the Shuar acquired in exchange for their shrunken heads, the rate being one gun per head. But weapons were not the only items [[barter|exchanged]]. Around 1910, shrunken heads were being sold by a curio shop in [[Lima]] for one [[Peruvian libra|Peruvian gold pound]], equal in value to a [[Sovereign (British coin)|British gold sovereign]].&lt;ref name="Eastaugh"&gt;C. J. Eastaugh, ‘Shrunken Head For Sale,’ ''The Times'' (London, 17 July 1952), p. 7. ‘Sales By Auction,’ ''The Times'' (London, 4 Sept. 1951), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the price in Panama's curio shop for shrunken heads had risen to £5.&lt;ref name="Eastaugh" /&gt; By the 1930s, when heads were freely exchanged, a person could buy a shrunken head for about twenty-five U.S. dollars. A stop was put to this when the Peruvian and Ecuadorian governments worked together to outlaw the traffic in heads.

Also encouraged by this trade, people in [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] unconnected to the Jívaros began to make counterfeit ''tsantsas''. They used corpses from morgues, or the heads of [[monkey]]s or [[sloth]]s. Some even used goatskin. Kate Duncan wrote in 2001 that "It has been estimated that about 80 percent of the tsantsas in private and museum hands are fraudulent," including almost all that are female or which include an entire torso rather than just a head.&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt;

[[Thor Heyerdahl]] recounts in ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'' (1947) the various problems of getting into the Jívaro (Shuar) area in Ecuador to get [[balsa wood]] for his expedition raft. Local people would not guide his team into the jungle for fear of being killed and having their heads shrunk. In 1951 and 1952 sales of such items in [[London]] were being advertised in ''[[The Times]]'', one example being priced at $250, a hundredfold appreciation since the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Eastaugh" /&gt;

In 1999, the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] repatriated the authentic shrunken heads in its collection to Ecuador.&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt; Most other countries have also banned the trade. Currently, replica shrunken heads are manufactured as curios for the [[tourism|tourist]] trade. These are made from [[leather]] and animal hides formed to resemble the originals.

[[Kenneth Arrow]]'s [[monograph]]  '''''Social Choice and Individual Values''''' (1951, 2nd ed., 1963) and a theorem within it created modern [[social choice theory]], a rigorous melding of social [[ethics]] and [[voting theory]] with an [[economics|economic]] flavor.  Somewhat formally, the "social choice" in the title refers to Arrow's representation of how ''social values'' from the ''set of individual orderings'' would be implemented under the ''constitution''.  Less formally, each social choice corresponds to the feasible set of laws passed by a "vote" (the set of orderings) under the constitution even if not every individual voted in favor of all the laws.

The work culminated in what Arrow called the "General Possibility Theorem," better known thereafter as [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's (impossibility) theorem]]. The theorem states that, absent restrictions on either individual preferences or neutrality of the constitution to feasible alternatives, there exists no social choice rule that satisfies a set of plausible requirements. The result generalizes the [[voting paradox]], which shows that majority voting may fail to yield a stable outcome.

== Introduction ==
The Introduction contrasts voting and markets with dictatorship and social convention (such as those in a religious code).  Both exemplify social decisions.   Voting and markets facilitate ''social'' choice in a sense, whereas dictatorship and convention limit it.  The former amalgamate possibly differing tastes to make a social choice.  The concern is with formal aspects of generalizing such choices.  In this respect it is comparable to analysis of the [[voting paradox]] from use of [[majority rule]] as a value.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|In the simplest case of the voting paradox, there are 3 candidates, A, B, and C, and 3 voters with preferences listed in decreasing order as follows. 
:Voter 1:   A B C
:Voter 2:   B C A
:Voter 3:   C A B
By majority rule for 2-candidate votes, A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A.  Majority rule works for an individual selecting consistently among the 3 candidates but not necessarily for the "social choice" in any general sense. 
|}
Arrow asks whether other methods of taste aggregation (whether by voting or markets), using other values, remedy the problem or are satisfactory in other ways.  Here logical consistency is one check on acceptability of all the values.  To answer the  questions, Arrow proposes removing the distinction between voting and markets in favor of a more general category of collective social choice.

The analysis uses [[ordinal utility|ordinal rankings]] of individual choice to represent  behavioral patterns.   [[cardinal utility|Cardinal measures]] of individual  [[utility]] and, ''a fortiori'', interpersonal comparisons of utility are avoided on grounds that such measures are unnecessary to represent behavior and depend on mutually incompatible value judgments (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Following [[Abram Bergson]], whose formulation of a [[social welfare function]] launched ordinalist [[welfare economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Abram Bergson, 1938. "A Reformulation of Certain Aspects of Welfare Economics," 1938. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 52(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1881737 p. 310]-334 ([http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:uoJ0KiOk-UwJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 [HTML.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow avoids locating a social good as independent of individual values.  Rather, social values inhere in actions from social-decision rules (hypostatized as ''constitutional conditions'') using individual values as input.  Then 'social values' means "nothing more than social choices" (p.&amp;nbsp;106).

Topics implicated along the way include [[game theory]],  the [[compensation principle]] in [[welfare economics]], [[extended sympathy]], Leibniz's principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]], [[logrolling]], and similarity of social judgments through [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|single-peaked preferences]], Kant’s [[categorical imperative]], or the [[decision making|decision process]].

== Terminology ==
The book defines a few terms and logical symbols used thereafter and their applied empirical interpretation (pp.&amp;nbsp;11–19, 23).   Key among these is the "vote" ('set of orderings') of the society (more generally "collectivity") composed of  individuals (“voters” here) in the following form:  
*'''Voters''', a finite set with at least two members, indexed as ''i'' = ''1'', ''2'', ... ''n''.
*'''Commodities''', the objects of choice (things that voters might want, goods and services), both private and public (municipal services, statecraft, etc.).
*A '''social state''' is a specification (formally, an element of a [[vector space|vector]]) of a distribution among voters of commodities, labor, and resources used in their productions. 
*The '''set of social states''',  the set of all 'social states', indexed as ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', . ., with at least three members.
*A (weak) '''ordering''', a ranking by a voter of all 'social states' from more to less preferred, including possible ties.
*The '''set of 'orderings'''', the set of all ''n'' orderings, one ordering per voter.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Example: Three voters {''1,2,3''} and three states {''x,y,z''}. Given the three states, there are 13 logically possible orderings (allowing for ties).''*''  Since each of the individuals may hold any of the orderings, there are 13*13*13  = 2197 possible "votes" (sets of orderings).  A well-defined social-decision rule selects the social state (or states, in case of tie) corresponding to each of these "votes."

''*'' Namely, from highest to lowest ranked for each triplet and with 'T's indexing ties:
:x y z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (x z T y is the same ranking as x y T z, so is omitted, etc.)
:y x z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y T x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z
:z x y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x T y
:x z y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y
:y z x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z T x
:z y x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y T x
|}The ordering of each voter ranks social states, including the ''distribution'' of commodities (possibly based on equity, by whatever metric, or any other consideration), not merely direct consumption by that voter.  So, the ordering is an "individual value," not merely, as in earlier analysis, a purely private "taste."  Arrow notes that the distinction is not sharp.  [[Resource allocation]] is specified in the production of each social state in the ordering.

The comprehensive nature of  ''commodities'', the ''set'' of ''social states'', and the ''set'' of ''orderings'' was noted by early reviewers.

The two properties that define any ordering of the set of ''objects'' in question (all ''social states'' here) are:

* '''connectedness''' ('''completeness'''): ''All'' the objects in the set are included in the ranking (no "undecideds" nor "abstentions") and
* '''transitivity''':  If, for any objects ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in the set, ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''y'' and ''y'' is ranked at least as high as ''z'', then ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''z''.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|A standard [[indifference curve|indifference-curve map]] for an individual has these properties and so is an ordering.  Each [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] from the origin ranks (conceivable) commodity bundles from least preferred on up (no ties in the ranking).  Each indifference curve ranks commodity bundles as equally preferred (all ties in the ranking).  
|}
 
The earlier definition of an '''ordering''' implies that any given ordering entails one of three responses on the "ballot" as between any pair of social states (''x'', ''y''):  ''better than'', ''as good as'',  or ''worse than'' (in preference ranking).  (Here "as good as" is an "equally-ranked," not a "don't know," relation.)  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|The denotations of these three "ballot" options are respectively:

* '''x P y''' (voter prefers ''x'' to ''y'')
* '''x I y''' (voter indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'')
* '''y P x''' (voter prefers ''y'' to ''x'').

It is convenient for deriving implications to compact the first two of these options on the ballot to one, an "''at least'' as good as" relation, denoted ''R'':

* '''x R y''': voter either prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'' but not both.

The above two properties of an ordering are then axiomatized as:

'''connectedness''': For all (the objects of choice in the set) ''x'' and ''y'', either ''x R y'' or ''y R x''.

'''transitivity''':  For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', ''x R y'' and ''y R z'' imply ''x R z''.

Thus, alternation ('or')  and conjunction ('and') of ''R'' relations represent both the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.

The ''I'' and ''P'' relations are then defined as:

'''x I y''':  ''x R y'' and ''y R x'' (''x'' as good as ''y'' means  ''x'' at least as good as ''y'' and vice versa).

'''x P y''':  not ''y R x'' (''y R x'' includes one of two options. Negating that option leaves only ''x P y'', the third of the original three options, on the ballot.)

From this, conjunction ('and') and negation ('not') of mere pairwise ''R'' relations can (also) represent all the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.  Hence, the following shorthand.   
|}
An [[Total order|ordering]] of a voter is denoted by '''R'''.  That ordering of voter ''i'' is denoted with a subscript as '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'''.

If voter ''i'' changes orderings, primes distinguish the first and second, say '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;''' compared to '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' '''.  The same notation can apply  for two different hypothetical orderings of the same voter.

The interest of the book is in amalgamating sets of orderings. This is accomplished through a 'constitution'.  
  
*A '''constitution''' (or '''social welfare function''') is a ''voting rule'' mapping each (of at least one) set of orderings onto a '''social ordering''', a corresponding ordering of the set of social states that applies to each voter.

A social ordering of a constitution is denoted '''R'''. (Context or a subscript distinguishes a voter ordering ''R'' from the same symbol for a social ordering.)

For any two social states ''x'' and ''y'' of a given social ordering ''R'':

'''x P y''' is "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' (''x'' is selected over ''y'' by the rule).

'''x I y''' is "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (both are ranked the same by the rule).

'''x R y''' is either "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' or "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (''x'' is ranked least as good as ''y'' by the rule).

A social ordering applies to each ordering  in the set of orderings (hence the "social" part and the associated amalgamation).  This is so regardless of (dis)similarity between the social ordering and any or all the orderings in the set.  But Arrow places the constitution in the context of ordinalist [[welfare economics]], which attempts to aggregate different tastes in a coherent, plausible way.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| The social ordering for a given set of orderings as to the set of social states is analogous to an [[Consumer theory|indifference-curve map]]  for an individual as to the set of commodity bundles.  There is no necessary interpretation from this that "society" is just a big voter. Still, the relation of a set of voter orderings to the outcome of the voting rule, whether a social ordering or not, is a focus of the book.
|}

Arrow (pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 26–28) shows how to go from the social ordering ''R'' for a given set of orderings to a particular 'social choice' by specifying:

* the '''environment''', '''S''':  the ''subset'' of social states that is (hypothetically) ''available'' ([[Production possibilities frontier|feasible]] as to [[Factors of production|resource]] quantity and productivity), not merely conceivable.

The social ordering ''R'' then selects the top-ranked social state(s) from the subset as the ''social choice'' set.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| This is a generalization from [[consumer theory|consumer demand theory]] with [[perfect competition]] on the buyer's side.  ''S'' corresponds to the set of commodity bundles on or inside the budget constraint for an individual. The consumer's top choice is at the highest indifference curve on the budget constraint.  
|} 
Less informally,  the '''social choice function''' is the function mapping each environment ''S'' of available social states (at least two) for any ''given'' set of orderings (and corresponding social ordering ''R'') to the '''social choice''' set, the set of social states each [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of which is top-ranked (by ''R'') for that environment and that set of orderings.

The social choice function is denoted '''C(S)'''.  Consider an environment that has just two social states, ''x'' and ''y'':  ''C(S)'' = ''C([x, y])''.  Suppose ''x'' is the only top-ranked social state.  Then C([''x'', ''y''])   = {''x''}, the ''social choice'' set.  If ''x'' and ''y'' are instead tied, ''C([x, y])'' = {''x'', ''y''}.  Formally (p.&amp;nbsp;15), ''C(S)'' is the set of all ''x'' in ''S'' such that, for all ''y'' in ''S'', ''x R y'' ("''x'' is at least as good as ''y''").

The next section invokes the following.  Let ''R'' and ''R' '' stand for social orderings of the constitution corresponding to any 2 sets of orderings.  If ''R'' and ''R' '' for the same environment ''S'' map to the same social choice(s), the relation of the identical social choices for ''R'' and ''R' ''is represented as: C(''S'') = C'(''S'').

== Conditions and theorem ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] --&gt;
A constitution might seem to be a promising alternative  to dictatorship and  vote-immune social convention or external control.  Arrow describes the ''connectedness'' of a social ordering as requiring only that ''some'' social choice be made from any environment of available social states.  Since some social state will prevail, this is hard to deny (especially with no place on the ballot for abstention).  The  ''transitivity'' of a social ordering has an advantage over requiring unanimity (or much less) to change between social states if there is a maladapted ''status quo'' (that is, one subject to "[[path dependence|democratic paralysis]]"). Absent deadlock, transitivity crowds out any reference to the ''status quo'' as a privileged default blocking the path to a social choice (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

Arrow proposes the following "apparently reasonable" '''conditions''' to constrain the social ordering(s) of the constitution (pp.&amp;nbsp;25, 96-97).&lt;ref&gt;The [[mnemonic]] labels`for the conditions are those of Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 41, with the following correspondence.&lt;br&gt;
Arrow  Sen&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''1' '''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''U'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''3'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   '''I'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''5'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''D'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1.  '''Universal (Unrestricted) Domain U''' (subsequently so called):  Every logically possible set of orderings maps to its own social ordering.

Each voter is permitted by the constitution to rank the set of social states in any order, though with only one ordering per voter for a given set of orderings.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Arrow refers to a constitution satisfying this condition as '''collective rationality'''.  It can be compared to  the '''rationality''' of a voter ordering.  But the ''[[Universal prescriptivism|prescription]]'' of collective rationality, which Arrow proposes, is distinct from the descriptive use of a voter ordering, which he deploys. Hence, his denial at the end of the book that collective rationality is "merely an illegitimate transfer from the individual to society." (p.&amp;nbsp;120)
|}
*  2.  '''[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#IIA in social choice theory|Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives]] I''': Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be a ''subset'' of hypothetically ''available'' (not merely ''conceivable'') social states, say ''x'' and ''y'', from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'', let the ranking of ''x'' and ''y'' be the same for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'' and  for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' ''. (Different voters could still have different rankings of the 2 social states.) Then the social orderings for the 2 respective sets of orderings select the same state(s) from the subset as the social choice.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition I''':  Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; '' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be ''any'' subset of hypothetically available social states from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'' and for each pair of ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', let ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;  y'' if and only if ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' y''. Then the social choice functions for the 2 respective sets of orderings map to an identical social choice set:   ''C(S)'' = ''C'(S)''.
|}
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|This identical mapping happens even with differences in rankings of any voter between the two sets of orderings ''outside that subset'' of social states.  Consider a hypothetical “run-off vote” between say only 2 available social states. The social choice is associated with the sets of rankings ''for that subset'',  not with rankings of unavailable social states ''beyond the subset''.  Thus, that social choice for the subset is unaffected by say a change in orderings only ''beyond'' the subset.    
|}Arrow describes this condition as an extension of [[ordinal utility|ordinalism]] with its emphasis on prospectively observable behavior (for the subset in question).  He ascribes practical advantage to the condition from "every known electoral system" satisfying it (p.&amp;nbsp;110).

*  3.  The (weak) '''Pareto Principle P''':   For any ''x'' and ''y''  in the set of social states, if all prefer ''x'' over ''y'',  then ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.'''#'''
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition P''': For any ''x'' and ''y'' in the set of social states, if, for every voter ''i'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'', then ''x P y''.  
|}
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|As Sen suggests,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', ch. 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto unanimity (with universal domain) overrides ''any'' social convention selecting some social state.     
|}
The conditions, particularly the second and third, may seem minimal, but jointly they are harsh, as may be represented in either of two ways.

*  '''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow’s Theorem]] [1]''':  The 3 conditions of the constitution imply a '''dictator''' who prevails as to the social choice whatever that individual's preference and those of all else.

An alternate statement of the theorem adds the following condition to the above:

*4.  '''Nondictatorship D''':  No voter in the society is a dictator.  That is, there is no voter ''i'' in the society such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of distinct social states ''x'' and ''y'', if voter ''i'' strictly prefers ''x'' over ''y'',  ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution" is included here, though not Arrow's statement of '''D''', to remove an ambiguity suggesting that absolute indifference of a voter, negating the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], would constitute dictatorship. On this, see Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition D''':  There is no voter ''i'' in {''1'', ..., ''n''} such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of social states ''x'' and ''y'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'' implies ''x P y''.
|}
*'''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's Theorem]] [2]''':  The constitution is '''impossible''', that is, the 4 conditions of a constitution imply a contradiction.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Each voter has an ordering (by attribution). Yet a set of orderings used as an argument of the voting rule does not carry over to a social ordering, with a corresponding loss of social adaptivity and constitutional generality, whether descriptive or prescriptive.
|}   
'''#''' Pareto is stronger than necessary in the proof of the theorem that follows above.  But it is invoked in Arrow (1963, ch. VIII) for a simpler proof than in Arrow (1951). In the latter, Arrow uses 2 other conditions, that with (2) above imply Pareto (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;97; 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;127):  
* 3a. '''[[Monotonicity]] M''' ('''Positive Association of Individual and Social Values'''), as in Arrow (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;125):  For a given set of orderings with social ordering ''R'', such that state ''x'' is socially preferred  to  state ''y'', if the preference for ''x'' rises in some individual ordering(s) and falls in none, ''x'' is also socially preferred to ''y'' in the social ordering for the new set of orderings.
Arrow (1951, p.&amp;nbsp;26) describes social welfare here as at least not negatively related to individual preferences.  
* 3b.  As defined by Arrow (1951, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29), an '''Imposed Constitution''' is a constitution such that for some alternative social states ''x'' and ''y'' and for any set of orderings  ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' in the domain and corresponding social ordering ''R'', the social ranking is ''x R y''.
:'''Non-imposition N'''  ('''Citizens' Sovereignty'''): A constitution is not to be imposed.

Under imposition, for every set of orderings in the domain, the social ranking for at least one ''x'' and ''y'' is only ''x R y''.  The vote makes no difference to the outcome.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|For the special case of all preferring ''y'' over ''x'', the vote  still makes no difference.  If the invariant social ranking applies to only one pair of distinct social states, the constitution would violate '''N'''.  In this respect, as a representation of excluding convention, '''N''' is thorough.   
|}

==Proof==
The proof is in two parts (Arrow, 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–100).  The first part considers the hypothetical case of some one voter's  ordering that ''prevails'' ('is decisive') as to the social choice for ''some'' pair of social states no matter what that voter's preference for the pair, despite all other voters opposing.   It is shown that, for a constitution satisfying '''Unrestricted Domain''', '''Pareto''' and '''Independence''',  that voter's ordering would prevail for ''every'' pair of social states, no matter what the orderings of others.   So, the voter would be a '''Dictator'''. Thus, '''Nondictatorship''' requires postulating that no one would so prevail for even one pair of social states.

The second part considers more generally a set of voters that would prevail for some pair of social states, despite all other voters (if any) preferring otherwise.  '''Pareto'''  and '''Unrestricted Domain''' for a constitution imply that such a set would at least include the entire set of voters.  By '''Nondictatorship''', the set must have at least 2 voters.  Among all such sets, postulate a set such that no other set is smaller.   Such a set can be constructed with '''Unrestricted Domain''' and an adaptation of the [[voting paradox]] to imply a still smaller set. This contradicts the postulate and so proves the theorem.

== Summary, interpretation, and aftereffects ==
The book proposes some apparently reasonable conditions for a "voting" rule, in particular, a 'constitution', to make consistent,  feasible social choices in a [[welfarism|welfarist]] context. But then any constitution that allows dictatorship requires it, and any constitution that requires nondictatorship contradicts one of the other conditions.  Hence, the ''paradox of social choice''.

The set of ''conditions'' across ''different'' possible votes refined [[welfare economics]] and differentiated Arrow's constitution from the ''pre-Arrow [[social welfare function]]''.  In so doing, it also ruled out any one consistent social ordering to which an [[agent (economics)|agent]] or official might appeal in trying to implement social welfare through the votes of other''s'' under the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abram Bergson]], 1954. "On the Concept of Social Welfare," ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 68(2), p. 242 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1884448 &amp;#91;pp. 233&amp;#93;-252] — an interpretation, which Arrow (1963, pp. 106-7) notes as in agreement with his own view of the constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result generalizes and deepens the [[voting paradox]] to any voting rule satisfying the conditions, however complex or comprehensive.

The 1963 edition includes an additional chapter with a simpler proof of [[Arrow's Theorem]] and corrects an earlier point noted by Blau.&lt;ref&gt;Julian H. Blau, 1957. "The Existence of Social Welfare Functions,"  ''Econometrica'', 25(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1910256 p. 302]-313.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also elaborates on advantages of the conditions and cites studies of [[William H. Riker|Riker]]&lt;ref&gt;William H. Riker, 1958.  “The Paradox of Voting and Congressional Rules for Voting on Amendments.” ''American Political Science Review'', 52, p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1952321 p. 349]-366.&lt;/ref&gt;   and [[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Dahl, 1956. ''A Preface to Democratic Theory'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95Zpl8C0-wYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22A+Preface+to+Democratic+Theory%22+39&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDvIKL8_Pv&amp;sig=zgye9PpbHZDDy25kKESWqXLxUPg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pqHhS_qGI8OBlAeOyfyLAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 39-41.]&lt;/ref&gt; that as an empirical matter [[intransitivity]] of the voting mechanism may produce unsatisfactory inaction or majority opposition.  These support Arrow's characterization of a constitution across possible votes (that is, collective rationality) as "an important attribute of a genuinely democratic system capable of full adaptation to varying environments" (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

The theorem might seem to have unravelled a skein of behavior-based social-ethical theory from [[invisible hand|Adam Smith]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] on.  But Arrow himself expresses hope at the end of his Nobel prize lecture that, though the philosophical and distributive implications of the paradox of social choice were "still not clear,"  others would "take this paradox as a challenge rather than as a discouraging barrier."

The large subsequent literature has included reformulation to extend, weaken, or replace the conditions and derive implications.  In this respect Arrow's framework has been an instrument for generalizing [[voting theory]] and critically  evaluating and  broadening [[economic policy]] and [[social choice theory]].

'''Social network analysis''' ('''SNA''') is the process of investigating social structures  through the use of [[Network theory|networks]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jis.sagepub.com/content/28/6/441.short|title = Social network analysis: a powerful strategy, also for the information sciences|last = Otte|first = Evelien|date = 2002|journal = Journal of Information Science|doi = 10.1177/016555150202800601|pmid = |access-date = 2015-03-23|last2 = Rousseau|first2 = Ronald|volume=28|issue = 6|pages=441–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; It characterizes networked structures in terms of ''nodes'' (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ''ties'', ''edges'', or ''links'' (relationships or interactions) that connect them.

==History==
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], who wrote about the importance of studying patterns of relationships that connect social actors. Social scientists have used the concept of "[[social networks]]" since early in the 20th century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In the 1930s [[Jacob Moreno]] and [[Helen Hall Jennings|Helen Jennings]] introduced basic analytical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freeman, L. C. |year=2004 |title= The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |publicationplace=Vancouver, B. C. |publisher=Empirical Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, [[John Arundel Barnes]] started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded [[Group (sociology)|groups]] (e.g., tribes, families) and social [[Categorization|categories]] (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as [[Ronald Burt]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[David Krackhardt]], [[Edward Laumann]], [[Anatol Rapoport#Social network analysis|Anatol Rapoport]], [[Barry Wellman]], [[Douglas R. White]], and [[Harrison White]] expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; Even in the study of literature, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H.K. | last2 = Gerhards | first2 = J. | last3 = Romo | first3 = F.P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wouter De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = 2003 | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = 5–6| pages = 305–27 | doi=10.1016/s0304-422x(03)00035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burgert Senekal.&lt;ref&gt;Senekal, B. A. 2012.

==Metrics==
[[File:Graph betweenness.svg|right|thumb|Hue (from red=0 to blue=max) indicates each node's [[betweenness centrality]].]]

===Connections===
[[Homophily]]: The extent to which actors form ties with similar versus dissimilar others. Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values or any other salient characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McPherson, N.|author2=Smith-Lovin, L.|author3=Cook, J.M. |year=2001 |title=Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=27 |pages=415–444 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homophily is also referred to as [[assortativity]].

Multiplexity: The number of content-forms contained in a tie.&lt;ref name = "Podo97"/&gt; For example, two people who are friends and also work together would have a multiplexity of 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kilduff, M.|author2=Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplexity has been associated with relationship strength.

Mutuality/Reciprocity: The extent to which two actors reciprocate each other's friendship or other interaction.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

[[Triadic closure|Network Closure]]: A measure of the completeness of relational triads. An individual's assumption of network closure (i.e. that their friends are also friends) is called transitivity. Transitivity is an outcome of the individual or situational trait of [[Closure (psychology)|Need for Cognitive Closure]].&lt;ref name="Flyn10"/&gt;

[[Propinquity]]: The tendency for actors to have more ties with geographically close others.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt;

===Distributions===
[[Bridge (graph theory)|Bridge]]: An individual whose weak ties fill a [[Structural holes|structural hole]], providing the only link between two individuals or clusters. It also includes the shortest route when a longer one is unfeasible due to a high risk of message distortion or delivery failure.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"&gt;{{cite book | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centrality]]: Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the "importance" or "influence" (in a variety of senses) of a particular node (or group) within a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hansen, Derek|title=Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2010|isbn=978-0-12-382229-1|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbxPm93PRY8C&amp;pg=PA32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liu, Bing|title=Web Data Mining: Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-19459-7|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnCi0Cq1YVkC&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=364–367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tsvetovat, Maksim |author2=Kouznetsov, Alexander|lastauthoramp=y|title=Social Network Analysis for Startups: Finding Connections on the Social Web|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4493-1762-1|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVOxjkoLSiEC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of common methods of measuring "centrality" include [[betweenness centrality]],&lt;ref name="comprehensive"/&gt; [[closeness centrality]], [[eigenvector centrality]], [[alpha centrality]], and [[degree centrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Opsahl | first1 = Tore | last2 = Agneessens | first2 = Filip | last3 = Skvoretz | first3 = John | title = Node centrality in weighted networks: Generalizing degree and shortest paths | doi = 10.1016/j.socnet.2010.03.006 | year = 2010 | pages = 245–251 | volume = 32 | journal = Social Networks | url=http://toreopsahl.com/2010/04/21/article-node-centrality-in-weighted-networks-generalizing-degree-and-shortest-paths/ | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dense graph|Density]]: The proportion of direct ties in a network relative to the total number possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Social Network Analysis|title=Field Manual 3-24: Counterinsurgency|publisher=Headquarters, [[Department of the Army]]|pages=B–11 – B–12|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xu, Guandong |title=Web Mining and Social Networking: Techniques and Applications|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7734-2|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXo9zKeYa6cC&amp;pg=PA25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance: The minimum number of ties required to connect two particular actors, as popularized by [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[small world experiment]] and the idea of 'six degrees of separation'.

Structural holes: The absence of ties between two parts of a network.  Finding and exploiting a structural hole can give an [[entrepreneur]] a competitive advantage.  This concept was developed by sociologist [[Ronald Stuart Burt|Ronald Burt]], and is sometimes referred to as an alternate conception of social capital.

Tie Strength: Defined by the linear combination of time, emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocity (i.e. mutuality).&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. 1973 1360–1380"/&gt; Strong ties are associated with homophily, propinquity and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridges.

===Segmentation===
Groups are identified as '[[clique]]s' if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, '[[social circle]]s' if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as [[Structural cohesion|structurally cohesive]] blocks if precision is wanted.&lt;ref name="uci"/&gt;

[[Clustering coefficient]]: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater 'cliquishness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanneman, Robert A.|author2=Riddle, Mark|lastauthoramp=y|chapter=Concepts and Measures for Basic Network Analysis|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|pages=346–347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by [[Social cohesion|cohesive bonds]]. [[Structural cohesion]] refers to the minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.&lt;ref name="asanet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pattillo, Jeffrey|chapter=Clique relaxation models in social network analysis|editor1=Thai, My T.|editor2=Pardalos, Panos M.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Handbook of Optimization in Complex Networks: Communication and Social Networks|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4614-0856-7|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdRdcHxQQLQC&amp;pg=PA149|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modelling and visualization of networks==
Visual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html|author=Linton C. Freeman|title=Visualizing Social Networks|journal=Journal of Social Structure|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous methods of visualization for data produced by social network analysis have been presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamdaqa|first=Mohammad |author2=Tahvildari, Ladan |author3=LaChapelle, Neil |author4=Campbell, Brian|title=Cultural Scene Detection Using Reverse Louvain Optimization|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=2014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642314000124|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2014.01.006|volume=95|pages=44–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Bacher, R.|year=1995|title=Graphical Interaction and Visualization for the Analysis and Interpretation of Contingency Analysis Result|conference=Proceedings of the 1995 Power Industry Computer Applications|pages=128–134|location=Salt Lake City, USA|publisher=IEEE Power Engineering Society|doi=10.1109/PICA.1995.515175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caschera | first1 = M.

Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Visual representations of networks may be a powerful method for conveying complex information, but care should be taken in interpreting node and graph properties from visual displays alone, as they may misrepresent structural properties better captured through quantitative analyses.&lt;ref name="interpreting"/&gt;

[[Signed graph]]s can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of "balanced" and "unbalanced" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] where the product of all the signs are positive. According to [[balance theory]], balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balanced and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed [[social network graph]]s can be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cartwright, D. |author2=[[Frank Harary]]|year=1956|url=http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cartwright56balance.pdf|title=Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=63|issue=5|pages=277–293|doi=10.1037/h0046049}} Link from [[Stanford University]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change, different approaches of participatory network mapping have proven useful. Here participants / interviewers provide network data by actually mapping out the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. An example of a pen-and-paper network mapping approach, which also includes the collection of some actor attributes (perceived influence and goals of actors) is the * [[Net-map toolbox]]. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.&lt;ref name="visualizing"/&gt;

===Social networking potential===
{{Cleanup|section|reason=More careful cleanup after merge required|date=December 2015}}
Social networking potential (SNP) is a numeric [[coefficient]], derived through [[algorithm]]s&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Anger, I., &amp; Kittl, C. (2011, September). Measuring influence on Twitter. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies (p. 31). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riquelme, F., &amp; González-Cantergiani, P. (2016). Measuring user influence on Twitter: A survey. Information Processing &amp; Management. 52, p. 949-975.&lt;/ref&gt; to represent both the size of an individual's [[social network]] and their ability to influence that network. A close synonym is the [[Social marketing intelligence#Alpha users|Alpha User]], a person with a high SNP.

SNP coefficients have two primary functions:
#the [[categorization|classification]] of individuals based on their social networking potential, and
#the weighting of [[wikt:respondent|respondents]] in quantitative [[marketing research]] studies.

By calculating the SNP of respondents and by [[Behavioral targeting|targeting]] High SNP respondents, the [[Persuasion|strength]] and [[relevance]] of quantitative marketing research used to drive [[viral marketing]] strategies is enhanced.

[[Variable (research)|Variables]] used to calculate an individual's SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym "SNP" and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual's social networking potential were described in the white paper "Advertising Research is Changing" (Gerstley, 2003) See [[Viral Marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(Hrsg.)|first1=Sara Rosengren|title=The Changing Roles of Advertising|date=2013|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658023645|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783658023645|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book&lt;ref&gt;Ahonen, T. T., Kasper, T., &amp; Melkko, S. (2005). 3G marketing: communities and strategic partnerships. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of [[social marketing intelligence]] was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen &amp; Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco ([[University College London|UCL]]) presents at [[TEDx]] the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the [[potential energy]] that users generate and companies should use, stating that "SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMilano-Nicola-Greco-on-math;search%3Atag%3A"technology"|title=Watch "TEDxMilano - Nicola Greco - on math and social network" Video at TEDxTalks|work=TEDxTalks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
{{see also|Social network analysis (criminology)}}
Social network analysis is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines.  Some common network analysis applications include data aggregation and [[data mining|mining]], network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, [[social sharing]] and filtering, [[recommender system]]s development, and [[link prediction]] and entity resolution.&lt;ref name="Golbeck" /&gt; In the private sector, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, [[information system]] development analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aram|first1=Michael|last2=Neumann|first2=Gustaf|title=Multilayered analysis of co-development of business information systems|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015-07-01|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0030-8|url=http://www.jisajournal.com/content/pdf/s13174-015-0030-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing, and [[business intelligence]] needs (see [[social media analytics]]).  Some public sector uses include development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and [[media use]], and [[Collaborative problem-solving group|community-based problem solving]].

=== Security applications ===
Social network analysis is also used in intelligence, [[counter-intelligence]] and [[law enforcement]] activities. This technique allows the analysts to map a clandestine or covert organization such as a [[espionage]] ring, an organized crime family or a street gang. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) uses its [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[mass surveillance|mass]] [[computer surveillance|electronic surveillance]] programs to generate the data needed to perform this type of analysis on terrorist cells and other networks deemed relevant to national security. The NSA looks up to three nodes deep during this network analysis.&lt;ref name="nsa_degrees"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/nsa-surveillance-house-hearing|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA warned to rein in surveillance as agency reveals even greater scope}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial mapping of the social network is complete, analysis is performed to determine the structure of the network and determine, for example, the leaders within the network.&lt;ref name="nsa_how"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltonto.com/2013/how-the-nsa-uses-social-network-analysis-to-map-terrorist-networks/|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=19 Jul 2013|title=How The NSA Uses Social Network Analysis To Map Terrorist Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows military or law enforcement assets to launch capture-or-kill [[decapitation attack]]s on the [[high-value targets]] in leadership positions to disrupt the functioning of the network.
The NSA has been performing social network analysis on [[call detail record]]s (CDRs), also known as [[metadata]], since shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="NSA_SNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/05/70888|title=NSA Using Social Network Analysis|date=12 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa_usa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_the_nsa_does_social_network_analysis.html|date=11 May 2006|accessdate=19 July 2013|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textual analysis applications ===
Large textual corpora can be turned into networks and then analysed with the method of social network analysis. In these networks, the nodes are Social Actors, and the links are Actions. The extraction of these networks can be automated, by using parsers. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sudhahar S, De Fazio G, Franzosi R, Cristianini N|year=2013|title=Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora|journal=Natural Language Engineering|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–32|doi=10.1017/S1351324913000247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Internet applications ===
Social network analysis has also been applied to understanding online behavior by individuals, organizations, and between websites. [[Hyperlink]] analysis can be used to analyze the connections between [[website]]s or [[Web page|webpages]] to examine how information flows as individuals navigate the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OSTERBUR|first=MEGAN|last2=KIEL|first2=CHRISTINA|date=2016-05-02|title=A hegemon fighting for equal rights: the dominant role of COC Nederland in the LGBT transnational advocacy network|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/glob.12126|journal=Global Networks|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=234–254|doi=10.1111/glob.12126|issn=1470-2266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between organizations has been analyzed via hyperlink analysis to examine which organizations within an issue community.&lt;ref&gt;Osterbur, Megan E. and Christina Kiel.

==== Social Media Internet Applications ====
Social network analysis has been applied to social media as a tool to understand behavior between individuals or organizations through their linkages on social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Haewoon|last2=Lee|first2=Changhyun|last3=Park|first3=Hosung|last4=Moon|first4=Sue|date=2010-04-26|title=What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772690.1772751|publisher=ACM|pages=591–600|doi=10.1145/1772690.1772751|isbn=9781605587998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer-supported collaborative learning===
One of the most current methods of the application of SNA is to the study of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL). When applied to CSCL, SNA is used to help understand how learners collaborate in terms of amount, frequency, and length, as well as the quality, topic, and strategies of communication.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laat|first=Maarten de|last2=Lally|first2=Vic|last3=Lipponen|first3=Lasse|last4=Simons|first4=Robert-Jan|date=2007-03-08|title=Investigating patterns of interaction in networked learning and computer-supported collaborative learning: A role for Social Network Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4|journal=International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=87–103|doi=10.1007/s11412-007-9006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, SNA can focus on specific aspects of the network connection, or the entire network as a whole. It uses graphical representations, written representations, and data representations to help examine the connections within a CSCL network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When applying SNA to a CSCL environment the interactions of the participants are treated as a social network. The focus of the analysis is on the "connections" made among the participants – how they interact and communicate – as opposed to how each participant behaved on his or her own.

====Key terms====
There are several key terms associated with social network analysis research in computer-supported collaborative learning such as: '''density''', '''centrality''', '''indegree''', '''outdegree''', and '''sociogram'''.

* '''Density''' refers to the "connections" between participants.  Density is defined as the number of connections a participant has, divided by the total possible connections a participant could have.  For example, if there are 20 people participating, each person could potentially connect to 19 other people. A density of 100% (19/19) is the greatest density in the system.  A density of 5% indicates there is only 1 of 19 possible connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centrality''' focuses on the behavior of individual participants within a network.  It measures the extent to which an individual interacts with other individuals in the network.  The more an individual connects to others in a network, the greater their centrality in the network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In-degree and out-degree variables are related to centrality.

* '''In-degree''' centrality concentrates on a specific individual as the point of focus; centrality of all other individuals is based on their relation to the focal point of the "in-degree" individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Out-degree''' is a measure of centrality that still focuses on a single individual, but the analytic is concerned with the out-going interactions of the individual; the measure of out-degree centrality is how many times the focus point individual interacts with others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A '''sociogram''' is a visualization with defined boundaries of connections in the network. For example, a sociogram which shows out-degree centrality points for Participant A would illustrate all outgoing connections Participant A made in the studied network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Unique capabilities====
Researchers employ social network analysis in the study of computer-supported collaborative learning in part due to the unique capabilities it offers. This particular method allows the study of interaction patterns within a [[Networked learning|networked learning community]] and can help illustrate the extent of the participants' interactions with the other members of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The graphics created using SNA tools provide visualizations of the connections among participants and the strategies used to communicate within the group. Some authors also suggest that SNA provides a method of easily analyzing changes in participatory patterns of members over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Palonen, T.|author2= Hakkarainen, K. B.|lastauthoramp=y|editor1=Fishman|editor2=S. O'Connor-Divelbiss|title=Patterns of Interaction in Computer-Supported Learning: A Social Network Analysis|conference=Fourth International Conference of the Learning Sciences|location=Mahwah, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum|pp=334–339|url=http://www.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Palonen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of research studies have applied SNA to CSCL across a variety of contexts. The findings include the correlation between a network's density and the teacher's presence,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a greater regard for the recommendations of "central" participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martı́nez|first=A.|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Y.|last3=Rubia|first3=B.|last4=Gómez|first4=E.|last5=de la Fuente|first5=P.|date=2003-12-01|title=Combining qualitative evaluation and social network analysis for the study of classroom social interactions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131503000824|journal=Computers &amp; Education|series=Documenting Collaborative Interactions: Issues and Approaches|volume=41|issue=4|pages=353–368|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2003.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; infrequency of cross-gender interaction in a network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Cho, H.|author2=Stefanone, M.|author3=Gay, G|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Social information sharing in a CSCL community|conference=Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|pages=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relatively small role played by an instructor in an [[asynchronous learning]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aviv, R.|author2=Erlich, Z.|author3=Ravid, G.|author4=Geva, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=Network analysis of knowledge construction in asynchronous learning networks|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=7|issue=3|pp=1–23|citeseerx=10.1.1.2.9044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other methods used alongside SNA====
Although many studies have demonstrated the value of social network analysis within the computer-supported collaborative learning field,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; researchers have suggested that SNA by itself is not enough for achieving a full understanding of CSCL. The complexity of the interaction processes and the myriad sources of data make it difficult for SNA to provide an in-depth analysis of CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|title=Groupware: Design, Implementation, and Use|last=Daradoumis|first=Thanasis|last2=Martínez-Monés|first2=Alejandra|last3=Xhafa|first3=Fatos|date=2004-09-05|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540230168|editor-last=Vreede|editor-first=Gert-Jan de|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=289–304|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-30112-7_25|editor-last2=Guerrero|editor-first2=Luis A.|editor-last3=Raventós|editor-first3=Gabriela Marín}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers indicate that SNA needs to be complemented with other methods of analysis to form a more accurate picture of collaborative learning experiences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

A number of research studies have combined other types of analysis with SNA in the study of CSCL. This can be referred to as a multi-method approach or data [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulation]], which will lead to an increase of evaluation [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] in CSCL studies.

* Qualitative method – The principles of qualitative case study research constitute a solid framework for the integration of SNA methods in the study of CSCL experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Karen E.|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Art of Case Study Research|jstor=329758|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=556–557|doi=10.2307/329758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|US constitutional law doctrine}}
{{more citations needed|date=August 2009}}

In [[United States]] [[law]], a '''state actor''' is a person who is acting on behalf of a governmental body, and is therefore subject to regulation under the [[United States Bill of Rights]], including the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]], which prohibit the federal and state governments from violating certain rights and freedoms.

Though the term would seem to include only persons who are directly employed by the state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has interpreted these amendments and [[law]]s passed pursuant to them to cover many persons who have only an indirect relationship with the government. Controversies have arisen, for example, over whether private companies that run towns (the "company-town") and prisons (traditionally a state function) can be held liable as state actors when they violate fundamental civil rights. This question remains unresolved, but the Supreme Court has held private citizens to be liable as state actors when they conspire with government officials to deprive people of their rights.

Conversely, in ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith]]'', the Supreme Court has found that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] is not a state actor for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1983 because it was national, rather than acting on behalf of one state actor. For the purposes of a [[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]
action, however, it might still be a state actor.[http://chronicle.com/blogs/players/files/2012/02/Potuto1.pdf]

The 1989 case of ''[[DeShaney v. Winnebago County]]'' was decided on the basis of the ''state action doctrine''. Social workers separated a young son Joshua from his abusive father Randy, but concluded there was not enough evidence for a permanent separation, and later reunited son with father; later, the father beat his son into a persistent vegetative state. The [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] ruled that despite involvement by state social workers, the state of Wisconsin was not a ''state actor'' and was therefore not responsible. Accordingly, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment protections]] did not apply, according to constitutional scholar John E. Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18&gt;{{cite news

Unlike state actors, private actors are generally not required to afford individuals the constitutional rights mentioned above.  In nearly all U.S. states, private [[shopping center]] owners can eject [[protest]]ers from their land for [[trespassing]], and private associations can eject members or deny admission to applicants, with no warning and for no reason. But in a handful of states, notably [[California]], state constitutional protections and certain common law rights have been extended to limit private actors. California allows the peaceful exercise of free speech in private shopping centers (see ''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]'' (1980)) and requires certain types of private actors to afford current or potential members a rudimentary version of procedural [[due process]] called [[fair procedure]].

==Jurisprudence==
There are a number of situations where the United States Supreme Court has recognized the conduct of individuals or private organizations to be "state action," and therefore subject to provisions of the Constitution such as Equal Protection, Due Process, or the First Amendment.  The Supreme Court has held the following:

# Merely opening up a business to the public is not state action, but the performance of a "public function" (a function that has been traditionally and exclusively performed by the state) is state action ([[Marsh v. Alabama]], 326 U.S. 501 (1946));
# If an individual or organization merely enters into a contract or asserts a contractual right outside of court it is not state action, but if an individual or organization sues to judicially enforce a contractual right it is state action ([[Shelley v. Kraemer]], 334 U.S. 1 (1948));
# If the government merely acquiesces in the performance of an act by a private individual or organization it is not state action, but if the government coerces, influences, or encourages the performance of the act, it is state action (Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982));
# If the government merely enters into a contract with an individual or organization for the goods or services, the actions of the private party are not state action, but if the government and the private party enter into a "joint enterprise" or a "symbiotic relationship" with each other it is state action (''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]'', 365 U.S. 715 (1961));
# If government agencies are simply members of a private organization, the actions of the organization are not state action, but if the government is "pervasively entwined" with the leadership of the private organization, the acts of the organization are state action ([[Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass'n|Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association]], 535 U.S. 971 (2002)).

==Scholarly commentary==
According to constitutional law scholar [[Gillian E. Metzger]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1367| last = Metzger| first = Gillian| title = Privatization as Delegation| journal = Colum. L. Rev.| url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/144/ |date = 2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The underlying presumption is that cases where private actors wield public power are rare and occur mainly when the government tries to hide behind private surrogates whom it controls. Current doctrine pays little attention to whether the government is, in fact, delegating power to private entities to act on its behalf. To the extent private delegations are considered, it is under the rubric of private delegation doctrine, which assesses whether the Constitution's separation of powers and due process requirements prohibit the government from delegating certain types of powers to private hands. But constitutional law makes no attempt to link the constitutionality of a private delegation to the risk that it will place government power outside of constitutional controls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Strangling''' is compression of the neck that may lead to [[unconsciousness]] or [[death]] by causing an increasingly [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] state in the brain.&lt;ref name=ernoehazy&gt;Ernoehazy, William; Ernoehazy, WS. [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm Hanging Injuries and Strangulation]. ''www.emedicine.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that [[hanging]] causes death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).

Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in [[erotic asphyxia]], in the [[choking game]], and is an important technique in many [[combat sport]]s and [[self-defence]] systems. 
Strangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:&lt;ref name=strack&gt;Strack, Gael; McClane, George.

==General==
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|left|200 px|The neck contains several vulnerable targets for compression including the [[carotid arteries]].]]
Strangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of [[oxygen]] into the brain:&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Richard. [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm Asphyxia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226102952/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm |date=2006-02-26 }}, [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm Strangulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430224427/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm |date=2006-04-30 }}.

*Compression of the [[laryngopharynx]], [[larynx]], or [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]—causing [[asphyxia]].
*Stimulation of the [[carotid sinus reflex]]—causing [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], or both.
Depending on the particular method of strangulation, one or several of these typically occur in combination; [[cerebral ischemia|vascular obstruction]] is usually the main mechanism.&lt;ref name=ferris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathology.ubc.ca/path425/Others/MedicolegalInvestigationOfDeathAndForensic/AsphixiaDrJAJFerris.doc |title=Asphyxia |website=pathology.ubc.ca |author=J.

[http://judoinfo.com/chokes5.htm How Safe is Choking in Judo?]. ''judoinfo.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but during strangulation there is still unimpeded blood flow in the [[vertebral arteries]].&lt;ref name=reay&gt;Reay, Donald; Eisele, John.

''www.aikiweb.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in all cases of strangulation, the rapidity of death can be affected by the susceptibility to [[carotid sinus stimulation]].&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt;  [[carotid sinus#Carotid sinus reflex death|Carotid sinus reflex death]] is sometimes considered a mechanism of death in cases of strangulation, but it remains highly disputed.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Passig, K.

''judoinfo.com'' URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; to one minute in other cases, with death occurring minutes after unconsciousness.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

==Manual strangulation==
'''Manual strangulation''' (also known as "throttling") is strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities and sometimes also with blunt objects, such as [[Club (weapon)|batons]]. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the [[airway]], interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the [[larynx]],&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; and fracture the [[hyoid]] or other bones in the neck.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of [[air hunger]] and may induce violent struggling.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

More technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as [[chokehold]]s, and are extensively practised and used in various [[martial arts]], [[combat sport]]s, [[self-defense]] systems, and in military [[hand-to-hand combat]] application. In some martial arts like [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]], strangles or chokes that constrict blood flow are regarded as a safe{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} way to render the opponent unconscious as opposed to other attacks, e.g., strikes to the head.
During the 18th century, a sentence of "Death by Throttling" would be passed upon the verdict of a [[Court Martial]] for the crime of desertion from the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Culloden''. BBC Drama Documentary, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ligature strangulation==
{{Main|Garrote}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Operation: Mindcrime]] --&gt;
'''Ligature strangulation''' (also known as "garroting") is strangling with some form of cord such as rope, wire, or shoe laces, either partially or fully circumferencing the neck.&lt;ref name=turvey&gt;Turvey, Brent (1996). [http://www.corpus-delicti.com/ligature.html A guide to the physical analysis of ligature patterns in homicide investigations]. Knowledge Solutions Library, Electronic Publication. ''www.corpus-delicti.com''. URL last accessed March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from [[hanging]] by the strangling force being something other than the person's own bodyweight.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; Incomplete occlusion of the [[carotid arteries]] is expected and, in cases of [[homicide]], the victim may struggle for a period of time,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds.&lt;ref name=turvey/&gt; Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; but accidents and suicides occur as well.&lt;ref name=dundee&gt;University of Dundee, Forensic Medicine. [http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/llb/deaths.htm#Stages Asphyxial Deaths]. ''www.dundee.ac.uk''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to hanging, the ligature mark will most likely be located lower on the neck of the victim.

During the [[Spanish Inquisition]], victims who admitted their alleged sins and recanted were killed via ligature strangulation (i.e. the [[garrote]]) before their bodies were burnt during the ''[[auto-da-fé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James Jr. ''Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors.'' Doubleday, 2005. {{ISBN|0-385-50848-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries, the [[American Mafia]] used ligature strangulation as a means of murdering their victims.  Confessed American [[serial killer]] [[Altemio Sanchez]] used ligature strangulation in the rapes and/or murders of his victims, as did [[Gary Ridgway]], the Green River Killer.

A '''struggle session''' was a form of [[public humiliation]] and [[torture]] that was used by the [[Communist Party of China]] in the [[Mao era]], particularly during the [[Cultural Revolution]], to shape public opinion and humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed [[Class enemy|class enemies]].&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"/&gt;

In general, the victim of a struggle session was forced to admit various crimes before a crowd of people who would verbally and physically abuse the victim until he or she confessed.  Struggle sessions were often held at the workplace of the accused, but they were sometimes conducted in sports stadiums where large crowds would gather if the target was well-known.&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==

According to [[Lin Yutang]], the expression comes from "批判" ({{zh|p=pīpàn|l=to judge}}) and "鬥爭" ({{zh|p=dòuzhēng|l=to fight}}), so the whole expression conveys the message of ''inciting the spirit of judgment and fighting''. Instead of saying the full phrase "批判鬥爭" ({{zh|p=pīpàn dòuzhēng}}), it was shortened to "批鬥" ({{zh|p=pīdòu}}).

==Origins and purpose==

Struggle sessions developed from similar ideas of criticism and [[Self-criticism#Communist states|self-criticism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] from the 1920s. The term refers to [[class struggle]];  the session is held to "benefit" the target, by eliminating all traces of counterrevolutionary, reactionary thinking. Chinese communists resisted this at first, because struggle sessions conflicted with the Chinese concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]], but struggle sessions became commonplace at [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] meetings during the 1930s due to public popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Flag: A History of Communism|first=David|last=Priestland|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8021-1924-7|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'…the [[Cultural Revolution]] began and I was transferred to another labor camp…  Two years after I had been in this new camp, I received a parcel from my family. Immediately, an inmate accused me of giving something out of it to another prisoner. I was dragged to the office. Without any investigation, the officer assembled the entire camp to start a struggle session against me. In the session the officer suddenly asked me whether I had committed my alleged original crime leading to my 8-year sentence. I was stunned. It then dawned on me that this session was in fact prearranged. The parcel was only a pretense. Their real motive was once again to force me to admit all my alleged crimes. "I did not commit any crimes," I asserted firmly. Immediately two people jumped on me and cut off half of my hair. The officer screamed again: "are you guilty?" I replied firmly again, "no." Two people then used a rope to tie my hands back tightly. It was connected to a loop around my shoulder and underneath my armpits. It was knotted in such a way that a slight movement of my hands would cause intense pain. This struggle session lasted for two hours. Afterwards, they untied me and handcuffed me instead. The handcuffs became a part of me for the next one hundred days and nights...'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |title=A Catholic Voice Out of Communist China - November 1998 Mindszenty Report |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2011-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313115857/http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |archivedate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne F. Thurston, in ''Enemies of the People'', gave a description of an infamous struggle session for the professor You Xiaoli:

{{quote|'You Xiaoli was standing, precariously balanced, on a stool. Her body was bent over from the waist into a right angle, and her arms, elbows stiff and straight, were behind her back, one hand grasping the other at the wrist. It was the position known as "doing the airplane." Around her neck was a heavy chain, and attached to the chain was a blackboard, a real blackboard, one that had been removed from a classroom at the university where You Xiaoli, for more than ten years, had served as a full professor. On both sides of the blackboard were chalked her name and the myriad crimes she was alleged to have committed...'

The scene was taking place at the university, too, in a sports field at one of China's most prestigious institutions of higher learning. In the audience were You Xiaoli's students and colleagues and former friends. Workers from local factories and peasants from nearby communes had been bussed in for the spectacle. From the audience came repeated, rhythmic chants ... "down with You Xiaoli! Down with You Xiaoli!"

"I had many feelings at that struggle session," recalls You Xiaoli. "I thought there were some bad people in the audience. But I also thought there were many ignorant people, people who did not understand what was happening, so I pitied that kind of person. They brought workers and peasants into the meetings, and they could not understand what was happening. But I was also angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldandischool.com/public/1987/june/school-resource12592.asp |title= Enemies of the People |publisher= World and ischool |date= June 1987 |accessdate= 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lately, the term "struggle session" has come to be applied to any scene where victims are publicly badgered to confess imaginary crimes under the pretext of self-criticism and rehabilitation{{Citation needed |date= April 2010}}.

==Disuse after 1978==

Struggle sessions were disowned in China after 1978, when the reformers led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power. Deng Xiaoping prohibited struggle sessions and other kinds of Mao-era violent political campaigns.

In September 2013, [[Xi Jinping]] has taken his "criticism and self-criticism" campaign on the road, attending a series of meetings where Hebei provincial cadres were made to admit shortcomings and offer ideas for correcting their behaviour. Xi has instructed regional officials to "promote self-criticism and criticism" to implement his "mass line" campaign, which he said is necessary to eliminate formality, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance among rank-and-file cadres.&lt;ref name="hsu-shang-li"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130927000096|title= Xi Jinping promotes criticism, self-criticism campaign|author= Hsu Shang-li|date= 27 September 2013|website= Want China Times|access-date= 23 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thomism}}

This article contains a selection of '''thoughts of [[Thomas Aquinas]]''' on various topics. It is not intended as a complete account of Aquinas's thought. Within Aquinas' thought is included the philosophical school of [[Thomism]].

==Social justice==
Aquinas defines distributive justice as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n distributive justice something is given to a private individual, in so far as what belongs to the whole is due to the part, and in a quantity that is proportionate to the importance of the position of that part in respect of the whole. Consequently in distributive justice a person receives all the more of the common goods, according as he holds a more prominent position in the community. This prominence in an aristocratic community is gauged according to virtue, in an oligarchy according to wealth, in a democracy according to liberty, and in various ways according to various forms of community. Hence in distributive justice the mean is observed, not according to equality between thing and thing, but according to proportion between things and persons: in such a way that even as one person surpasses another, so that which is given to one person surpasses that which is allotted to another.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aquinas asserts that Christians have a duty to distribute with provision to the poorest of society.  (See: Gilson, Etienne, "The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas", University of Notre Dame Press, 1994)

==Death penalty==
The following is a summary of [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/scg3111.html#27017 Book 3, Chapter 146], which was written by Aquinas prior to writing the [[Summa Theologica]].  St. Thomas was a vocal supporter of the death penalty.  This was based on the theory (found in [[Natural Moral Law|natural moral law]]), that the state has not only the right, but the duty to protect its citizens from enemies, both from within, and without.

For those who have been appropriately appointed, there is no sin in administering punishment. For those who refuse to obey God's laws, it is correct for society to rebuke them with civil and criminal sanctions. No one sins working for justice and within the law. Actions that are necessary to preserve the good of society are not inherently evil. The common good of the whole society is greater and better than the good of any particular person. ''"The life of certain pestiferous men is an impediment to the common good which is the concord of human society. Therefore, certain men must be removed by death from the society of men."''  This is likened to the physician who must amputate a diseased limb, or a cancer, for the good of the whole person. He based this on [[I Corinthians]] 5, 6:  "You know that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump of dough?"  and [[I Corinthians]] 5, 13:  "Put away the evil one from among yourselves";  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 13,4: "[it is said of earthly power that] he bears not the sword in vain: for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil";  [[I Peter]] 2, 13-14: "Be subjected therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether to be on the king as excelling, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of good."  He believed these passages superseded the text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20,13: "Thou shall not kill."  This is mentioned again in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5,21. Also, it is argued that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13, 30: "Suffer both the weeds and the wheat to grow until the harvest." The harvest was interpreted as meaning the end of the world. This is explained by Matthew 13,38-40.

Aquinas acknowledged these passages could also be interpreted as meaning there should be no use of the death penalty if there was a chance of injuring the innocent. The prohibition "Thou shall not kill", was superseded by [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22,18: "Wrongdoers you shall not suffer to live."  The argument that evildoers should be allowed to live in the hope that they might be redeemed was rejected by Aquinas as frivolous. If they would not repent in the face of death, it was unreasonable to assume they would ever repent.  ''"How many people are we to allow to be murdered while waiting for the repentance of the wrongdoer?"'', he asked, rhetorically. Using the death penalty for revenge, or retribution is a violation of natural moral law.

Many believe the correct interpretation of the commandment to be "Thou shalt not murder." This interpretation allows for Aquinas' belief that the death penalty is an acceptable practice as delivered by those in authority over such things, such as government, which is divinely appointed as to God's will.

Under [[Pope John Paul II]], the Catholic Church came, according to one of two interpretations of ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/994aLong.htm|accessdate=2011-03-20|year=1999|title=''Evangelium Vitae'', St. Thomas Aquinas, and the Death Penalty|author=Steven A. Long|journal=[http://www.thomist.org/journal/explore.htm The Thomist]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031102034854/http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/994along.htm|archivedate=2003-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to advocate incarceration in lieu of the death penalty.

==Heretics==

Aquinas advocated the death penalty for obstinate heretics, writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith which quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but "after the first and second admonition," as the Apostle directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death. For Jerome commenting on Galatians 5:9, "A little leaven," says: "Cut off the decayed flesh, expel the mangy sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, the whole paste, the whole body, the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die. Arius was but one spark in Alexandria, but as that spark was not at once put out, the whole earth was laid waste by its flame." ([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 ST II:II 11:3 ''corpus''])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This position of Aquinas was congruous with the political and religious teaching of the day. The penalty of death for obdurate heretics had been the standard for generations prior to the time of Aquinas. It had been formalized in [[Canon Law]] during the Lateran Councils of 1179 and 1215. It was also the standard part of most criminal and civil laws prior to the time of Aquinas. Cathars were executed in Oxford in 1166. Another was burned at the stake in London in 1210. Of course, these, and many others pre-dated Aquinas. Since it was the Church's responsibility to attend to the eternal salvation of souls, heresy could not be tolerated. Heretics were given two chances to recant their views. This is a position which, by modern standards would be considered exceptionally harsh, and has changed and softened since the 13th century. The Church was inexorably intermixed with the secular political structure. This was before the modern concept of separation of church and state had developed. It was also a product of [[Scholasticism]] which did not seek to find an [[equivocal]] position, but rather to reach a decisive [[univocal]] conclusion on matters of religion and philosophy.

As can be seen by reading the article of Michael Novak{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, Aquinas' view in this matter is one of the more difficult parts of dealing with [[Thomism]] Needless to say, the attitudes of Aquinas were prevalent in his time. This view must be taken in context with the attitude shown by Aquinas in eschewing the forced baptism of the children of heretics, which was recommended by, among others, [[John Duns Scotus]]. The heretics Aquinas was referring to were those baptized Catholics who held positions of authority within the Church, and nonetheless persisted in teaching heretical views. It remains one of those passages which must be taken in context of the total message of Thomism. The growth of various heretical positions, leading to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], made execution of heretics impractical and counterproductive. Excommunication remained the penalty for such Church leaders who taught heresy. Aquinas' view is steeped in the traditions of [[Roman Law]]. A review of the legal history prior to the time of Aquinas reveals the nature of recommending execution of heretics. The issue came to a head with the Manichean (Cathari) heresy.  [[Justinian]]'s code confirmed that Manicheanism was a capital crime. It was concluded that other heretics were to be deemed no better. The opinion prevailed in legal circles that human law and divine command demanded the death of the obdurate heretic. It was routinely enforced by both Church and State. In severe cases of religious pestilence, there was a need for a holy war. These prevailing feelings were legislated by the Church in the [[Lateran Council]]s of 1179 and 1215.

The impenitent heretic when convicted by the ecclesiastical court for execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Often, there was a plea for the life of the heretic, so as to avoid the appearance of "irregularity" and blood guilt.  [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], (1194–1250) incorporated the execution of heretics into his civil and criminal code of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Usury==
Firstly, economics in the Middle Ages worked very differently from how they operate in the modern age. The [[Fifth Lateran Council]] defined [[usury]] as "from its use, a thing which produces nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any work, any expense or any risk",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scripturecatholic.com/usury.html&lt;/ref&gt; and that the modern idea of what the usury is cannot be applied to Thomasian thought.

St. Thomas asserted that usury was a violation of [[Natural Moral Law|natural moral law]]. All things are created for their natural end ([[Aristotle]]).   Money is not an end but a means of buying goods and services. Putting money out for the generation of more money is an evil unto itself.   The formal value of money is the face value. Yet usury allows this face value to fluctuate, and hence the value of money can be diminished, thereby robbing the person who has purchased the money for use. Money stands alone as a non-vendible substance which is degraded from its natural end by selling.

Another argument used by Aquinas was that of the Roman distinction between consumable goods and non-consumable goods. Food and clothes are consumable in that once they are used, they are gone. A piece of land is non-consumable since it can produce crops for years, yet never lose its value. Money as defined by Aquinas is a consumable. To put it out for profit betrays its purpose in natural law. This is the view that prevailed for the next three centuries following St. Thomas' death.

Yet it was the one Realistic Scholastic interpretation of natural law that was completely disconnected from the economic reality of the day. The time of Aquinas was one where land feudalism was ceding prominence to money capitalism. Over the next several centuries it became clear that capitalism would provide a greater amount of goods and services than any other system.

Even in the time of Aquinas (and before), kings and popes engaged in usury. Some of the effects of [[Protestantism]] were a clarification of the views and acceptance of the practice of usury. Profit from lending became an acceptable goal. The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) adopted Aquinas' view of usury, calling it a sin of equal gravity to that of [[homicide]]. This included putting money out for any return, no matter how minimal. It can be argued that this rigid stance may have encouraged the [[Protestant]] movement in larger money and trading centers.

Our views concerning [[capitalism]], [[unfair labor practice]], [[living wage]], [[price gouging]], [[monopolies]], fair trade practices, and [[predatory pricing]], inter alia, are remnants of the inculcation of Aquinas' interpretation of natural moral law.  (See Colish p.&amp;nbsp;333–334).

The issue was never as clear as the stance Aquinas took would indicate. From [[Pope Gregory IX]]  (written about 1241, when Aquinas was 16 years old):  "He who loans a sum of money to one sailing or going to market, since he has assumed upon himself a risk, is not to be considered a usurer who will receive something beyond his lot. He also who gives ten solidi (a monetary unit), so that at another time just as many measures of grain, wine and oil may be paid back to him, and although these are worth more at the present time, it is probably doubtful whether at the time of payment, they will be worth more or less, for this reason, should not be considered a usurer. By reason of this doubt he is also excused, who sells clothing, grain, wine, oil, or other wares so that as a set time he receives for them more than they are worth at that time, if however, he had not intended so to sell them at the time of the contract."  (See Denzinger, p.&amp;nbsp;178). In other words, if the lender of the money  "assumed the risk" ("[[assumpsit]]" in Latin), along with the borrower, it was not usury.

A century earlier, in the Second Lateran Council, ([[Second Council of the Lateran]]), under the aegis of [[Pope Innocent II]] (1139) called the practice of loaning money "detestable and shameful... insatiable rapacity of money lenders, forbidden both by divine and human laws throughout the Old and New Testament, we condemn, and separate from the ecclesiastical consolation..."  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;148–149).

The [[Council of Vienne]] (1311–1312) under [[Pope Clement V]] declared:  "If anyone shall fall into that error, so that he obstinately presumes to declare that it is not a sin to exercise usury, we decree that he must be punished as a heretic."  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;189). The distinction between usury and putting money out while "assuming the risk" was not mentioned. However, it could be argued that any time one assumed the risk, it was not considered usury.

There was always some confusion, and variance, in this teaching during the Middle Ages. The [[Fifth Lateran Council]], (1515) decreed that a "reasonable degree of return" was allowable.  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;238). The social evil that was associated with usury was the fact that poor tenant farmers and city dwellers were often thrown into prison, or even killed if they could not repay the money they borrowed, and the interest charged. In these cases, the lenders of the money had assumed no risk. The [[Franciscan]] [[St. Anthony of Padua]] (1195–1231 AD) preached against this evil.

These events were occurring at a time when the [[Ecclesiastical Courts]] had great judicial power. There were several philosophical cross currents at play. On the one hand, the Canon Lawyers looked favorably on the products of labor, wages and profit, while holding suspect speculation, banking and finance. The Church discountenanced the fluctuations of wages and prices caused by the law of [[supply and demand]]. There was an attempt to maintain fixed standards of value. At the same time, there was a liberal and equitable view toward the old Roman idea of "[[contract]]". The Church Courts invented and refined the idea of "consideration" ; the [[quid pro quo]] in modern contract. This was something that was lacking in Roman contract.  [[Insurance]], [[assignability]] and [[negotiability]] were developments in the Church Courts. These areas were largely ignored by the [[Common Law]], or secular law of the day, especially in England (Plucknett p.&amp;nbsp;302,304).

The Catholic Church's teaching on social doctrine has grown significantly more complicated since that time. It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into modern teaching. A summary can be found in the new Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 2419–2463.

==Forced baptism of children of Jews and heretics==
The question frequently arose whether the children of Jews and other heretics and non-believers should be baptized against the will of their parents. Two schools of thought were generally followed:
# The First School: That since all persons who were not baptized would be damned to hell, all children should be baptized. This was the position of [[John Duns Scotus]]. It could be argued that this approach reduced the sacrament of baptism to nothing but a "magical" rite. 
# The Second School: That it violated [[natural law]] to disrupt the order of the family by interfering.

Therefore, even if children were being reared in error, the Church had no authority to intervene. This was the position taken by Aquinas. From [[Summa Theologica]] II-II Q. 10 Art. 12:
:Injustice should be done to no man. Now it would be an injustice to Jews if their children were to be baptized against their will, since they would lose the rights of parental authority over their children as soon as these were Christians. Therefore these should not be baptized against their parent's will. The custom of the Church has been given very great authority and ought to be jealously observed in all things, since the very doctrine of Catholic Doctors derives its authority from the Church. Hence we ought to abide by the authority of the Church rather than that of an [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] or a [[Jerome]] or any doctor whatever. Now it was never the custom of the Church to baptize the children of Jews against the will of their parents. There are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger to faith. For children baptized before coming into the use of reason, might easily be persuaded by their parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this would be detrimental to the faith. The other reason is that it is against natural justice. For a child is by nature part of its father: at first, it is not distinct from its parents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within the mother's womb and later on after birth, and before it has the use of [[free will]], it is enfolded in the care of its parents, like a spiritual womb. So long as a man does not have the use of reason, he is no different from an irrational animal. Hence, it would be contrary to natural justice, if a child, before coming to the use of reason, were to be taken away from its parent's custody, or anything done against its parent's wish.

The question was again addressed by Aquinas in [[Summa Theologica]] III Q. 68 Art. 10:
:It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xiv), quoting the [[Council of Toledo]]: In regard to the Jews the holy synod commands that henceforth none of them be forced to believe; for such are not to be saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness may be without flaw. Children of non-believers either have the use of reason or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control their own actions, in things that are of Divine or natural law. And therefore, of their own accord, and against the will of their parents, they can receive Baptism, just as they can contract in marriage. Consequently such can be lawfully advised and persuaded to be baptized. If, however, they have not yet the use of free-will, according to the natural law they are under the care of their parents as long as they cannot look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the children of the ancients were saved through the faith of their parents.

The issue was discussed in a papal bull by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (1747) where both schools were addressed. The pope noted that the position of Aquinas had been more widely held among theologians and canon lawyers, than that of John Duns Scotus (See Denzinger).

==Existentialism==
A primary goal of all philosophy is the proof of existence: the existence of God, the universe, and the self (see Colish, Macdonald-Cornford, Russell, Nahm, Pieper, Gilson). Although St. Thomas "five proofs" are the most referenced, they are targeted toward a Catholic audience.  In Summa Contra Gentiles, Thomas provides a much lengthier and detailed proof that does not rely on divine revelation.  God's existence is established based on the proposition that man's reason is capable of apprehending a cause from its effects.  After analyzing motion, it becomes apparent that the first mover must be unmoved, without cause, and uncreated.  From this, it then follows that the unmoved mover must be without change, and, therefore, must be eternal.  The understanding that goodness and being are interchangeable leads to the realization that God is goodness.  God is also found to be intelligent because he is not composed of matter nor is the form of any body.  Since God is the first cause, His effects can be observed by the diversity found in creation, and the study of this is the study of Divine Providence.  After building a foundation of proofs based upon natural reasoning, Aquinas then demonstrates that the Catholic Faith cannot be disproved and goes on to defend various positions against the Incarnation, the sacraments, and the Resurrection.  This line of thought is also followed in the Summa Theologica and the Compendium of Theology.

A basic question of Greek Philosophy: Can an organized hierarchy (as is seen in nature) exist in the absence of an intelligence?  In the atheistic view, the answer is "yes". If one answers "no", then there is a necessity of an intelligent God. The Greeks called this ultimate intelligence the "gnos" or "nous" (Nahm pp.&amp;nbsp;1–28). However, the intimate nature of this intelligence cannot be delineated by human contemplation. Many philosophers concluded that the [[Universe]] itself, was the God (Gilson). It was basically indifferent the needs of the human. This is very different from the Judeo-Christian concept of an intimate and loving God, aware of all.

Some Greek philosophers such as [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Chrysippus]], [[Plotinus]], [[Thales of Miletus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] came to the conclusion that there had to be a God. Their conclusions were based on various physical observations: there could be no infinity of actions, therefore, there must be an unmoving mover, which moves without moving. This is the prime mover. There has to be a beginning and an end, otherwise, everything would have happened long ago and not now. This is also seen in Jewish philosophy (which may be based on Greek philosophy). There must be an ultimate smallness, of which there can be nothing smaller: the atomus ([[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]]). This was in response to the [[Paradoxes of Zeno]]: there could be no motion, since every moving body would have to pass through half the distance, then one-quarter the distance, etc. A body could not pass through an infinite number of points. This led to the conclusion that all nature was united: the doctrine of the "One". Therefore, the human mind could reasonably conclude that there was a single God, and that this God existed (For an overview see Gilson p.&amp;nbsp;29-83; Russell pp.&amp;nbsp;453–463). This God had to be intelligent.

When Moses wished to know the name of God in order to reveal it to the Jewish people, he asked God directly.  [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3, 13-14:  "'Lo!  I go to the children of Israel, and I shall say to them: the God of your fathers sent me to you. If they ask me His name what shall I say to them?'  God replied: 'I Am Who Am.'  Then He added, 'Thus will you reply to the children of Israel: He Who Is sends me to you.'"  Therefore, the proper name of God is "I Am" or "Who Is". This was a remarkable exposition on several levels. First, the idea that the great, unapproachable God of the Hebrews would provide His name was exceptional. Recall that in these ancient cultures, to know the name of a person was to possess them, or a part of them, in some way. Also, the name is unusual. What did this mean? (Gilson) The only means available to the early Christians for evaluating philosophy was provided by the Greeks. Largely, this was within the Stoic school, which had been re-invigorated by the Persians whom Alexander the Great had brought back to Greece. These in turn, influenced the Roman Stoic Schools which affected both pagan and Christian thought (Colish pp.&amp;nbsp;9, 12,21, 179-180, 300-301; Russell pp.&amp;nbsp;252–270). Christianity has been described as a religion without a need for a philosophic basis. The Stoics gave it one (Gilson, p.&amp;nbsp;84).

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] was convinced that the God of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was Plato's being. He speculated that [[Plato]] must have known of Exodus.  "But what makes me almost subscribe to the idea that Plato was not completely ignorant of the [[Old Testament]] is that when the Angel conveys the words of God to the holy man [[Moses]], who asks the name of the one who is sending him to proceed to the deliverance of the Hebrew people, the reply is:  'I Am Who Am', and you are to say to the children of Israel: 'it is He Who is Who has sent me to you.'  It was as if, in comparison with him who truly is because he is immovable, he who has been made movable did not exist. Now Plato was intensely convinced of this and he took great care to say so."  (Augustine De Civ. Dei 8:11, PL 41,236). The Being in Exodus was the same immovable entity of Plato, according to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. he called the immovable being of Plato, "The first and highest being is that which is entirely immovable, and which can say by full right: 'I Am Who Am'; and you will tell them, 'He Who Is has sent me to you.'" (St. Augustine, De doctrina christiana, I, 32,5; PL 34, 32).

St. Augustine had a very deep sense of the difficulty of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question "I Am" what?  From [[Gospel of John|John]] 8, 24: "If you do not believe that I Am, you will die in your sins."  But Augustine asked, "si non credideritis quia ego sum?"  (I Am What?)  There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing.  "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing."  Augustine: "If you do not believe that I Am the Christ; if you do not believe that I Am the Son of God; if you do not believe that I Am the Word of the Father; if you do not believe that I Am the author of the world; if you do not believe that I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you do not believe that I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if [[Moses]] could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it?  In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of [[Abraham]], and the God of [[Isaac]], and the God of [[Jacob]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3, 13-15)([[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] on the Gospel of St. John)  (Gilson, p.&amp;nbsp;85)

This is the source of the doctrine of divine essentialitas, or [[essential theology]] of Augustine which would influence [[Richard of St. Victor]], [[Alexander of Hales]] and [[St. Bonaventure]]. By this method, the essence of God is defined by what God is, and also by describing what God is not ([[negative theology]]). St. Thomas took the text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] beyond the explanation of essential theology. He bridged the gap of understanding between the [[being of essence]] and the [[being of existence]]. In [[Summa Theologica]], the way is prepared with the proofs for the existence of God. All that remained was to recognize the God of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] as having the nature of "Him Who is the supreme act of being". God is simple, there is no composition in God. In this regard, Aquinas relied on [[Boethius]] who in turn followed the path of [[Platonism]], something Aquinas usually avoided. The conclusion was that the meaning of "I Am Who Am" is not an enigma to be answered, but the statement of the essence of God. This is the discovery of Aquinas: the essence of God is not described by negative analogy, but the "essence of God is to exist". This is the basis of "[[existential theology]]" and leads to what Gilson calls the first and only existential philosophy. In Latin, this is called "Haec Sublimis Veritas", "the sublime truth". The revealed essence of God is to exist, or in the words of Aquinas, I am the pure Act of Being. This has been described as the key to understanding [[Thomism]]. Thomism has been described (in terms of a philosophic movement), as either the emptiest, or the fullest of philosophies. (For a full discussion, see Gilson, pp.&amp;nbsp;84–95)

The division of [[human rights]] into '''three generations''' was initially proposed in 1979 by the [[Czech people|Czech]] jurist [[Karel Vasak]] at the [[International Institute of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]]. He used the term at least as early as November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasak's theories have primarily taken root in European law.

His divisions follow the three watchwords of the [[French Revolution]]: ''[[Liberté, egalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''. The three generations are reflected in some of the rubrics of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] includes rights that are thought of as second generation as well as first generation ones, but it does not make the distinction in itself (the rights listed are not in specific order).

== First-generation human rights ==
First-generation human rights, sometimes called "blue" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally [[civil and political rights|civil and political]] in nature: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, the [[right to life]], [[equality before the law]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered by the [[United States]] [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

== Second-generation human rights ==
Second-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized by governments after [[World War II]]. They are fundamentally [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural]] in nature. They guarantee different members of the citizenry equal conditions and treatment. Secondary rights would include a [[right to work|right to be employed]] in [[decent work|just and favorable condition]], rights to [[right to food|food]], [[public housing|housing]] and [[universal health care|health care]], as well as [[social security]] and [[unemployment benefit]]s. Like first-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and further embodied in Articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration, and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]].

In the United States of America, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a [[Second Bill of Rights]], covering much the same grounds, during his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944. Today, many nations, states, or groups of nations have developed legally binding declarations guaranteeing comprehensive sets of human rights, e.g. the [[European Social Charter]].

Some states have enacted some of these economic rights, e.g. the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has enshrined the [[Campaign for Fiscal Equity#Campaign for Fiscal Equity.2C Inc. v. State|right to a free education]],&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART. XI, § 1, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA11S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=14425895+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[constitutional law]].

These rights are sometimes referred to as "[[Red#Use by political movements|red]]" rights. They impose upon the government the duty to respect and promote and fulfill them, but this depends on the availability of resources. The duty is imposed on the state because it controls its own resources. No one has the direct [[right to housing]] and [[right to education]]. (In [[South Africa]], for instance, the right is not, ''per se'', to housing, but rather "to have access to adequate housing",&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]], [[1996 in South Africa|1996]], s 26(1).&lt;/ref&gt; realised on a progressive basis.&lt;ref&gt;s s 26(2).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The duty of government is in the realization of these positive rights.

== Third-generation human rights ==
Third-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and social, as expressed in many progressive documents of [[international law]], including the 1972 [[Stockholm Declaration]] of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], the 1992 [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, and other pieces of generally aspirational "[[soft law]]". Because of the present-day tilting toward national [[sovereignty]] and the preponderance of would-be offender nations, these rights have been hard to enact in legally binding documents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The term "third-generation human rights" remains largely unofficial, just as the also-used moniker of "[[Green politics|green]]" rights, and thus houses an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including:

* [[Group rights|Group]] and [[collective rights]]
* Right to [[self-determination]]
* [[right to development|Right to economic and social development]]
* Right to a [[healthy environment]]
* Right to [[natural resources]]
* Right to [[communication|communicate]] and [[Communication Rights|communication rights]]
* Right to participation in [[cultural heritage]]
* Rights to [[intergenerational equity]] and [[sustainability]]

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] ensures many of those: right to self-determination, right to development, right to natural resources and right to satisfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], Article 20, 21, 22 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries also have constitutional mechanisms for safeguarding third-generation rights. For example, the Hungarian [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pieandcoffee.org/2010/02/26/sandor-fulop/ Notes: Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eduskunta|Parliament of Finland]]'s [[Committee for the Future]], and the erstwhile [[Commission for Future Generations]] in the Knesset in Israel.

Some international organizations have offices for safeguarding such rights. An example is the [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)|Directorate-General for the Environment]] of the European Commission has as its mission "protecting, preserving and improving the environment for present and future generations, and promoting sustainable development".

A few jurisdictions have enacted provisions for [[environmental protection]], e.g. New York's "forever wild" constitutional article,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Const. ART XIV, § 1.  Found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=**CNSA14S1+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=08222978+&amp;TARGET=VIEW New York State Assembly website].

== Commentary ==
[[Maurice Cranston]] argued that [[scarcity]] means that supposed second-generation and third-generation rights are not really rights at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, Maurice. "Human Rights: Real and Supposed," in ''Political Theory and the Rights of Man'', edited by D. D. Raphael (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967), pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; If one person has a right, others have a duty to respect that right, but governments lack the resources necessary to fulfill the duties implied by citizens' supposed second- and third-generation rights.

Charles Kesler, a professor of government at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and senior fellow of the [[Claremont Institute]], has argued that second- and third-generation human rights serve as an attempt to cloak political goals, which the majority may well agree are good things in and of themselves, in the language of rights, and thus grant those political goals inappropriate connotations. In his opinion, calling socio-economic goods "rights" inherently creates a related concept of "[[duties]]", so that other citizens have to be coerced by the government to give things to other people in order to fulfill these new rights. He also has stated that, in the US, the new rights create a "nationalization" of political decision-making at the federal level in violation of federalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |title=Charles Kesler on the Grand Liberal Project |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715094108/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/47825927.html |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift'', Paul Rahe, the Charles O. Lee and Louise K. Lee Chair in Western Heritage at [[Hillsdale College]], wrote that focusing on equality-based rights leads to a subordination to the initial civil rights to an ever-expanding government, which would be too incompetent to provide for its citizens correctly and would merely seek to subordinate more rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |title=Soft Despotism with Paul Rahe |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |publisher=''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104072827/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/72025472.html |archivedate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century philosopher [[Frederic Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these [[negative and positive rights]] by saying:

{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary". It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Economist [[F. A. Hayek]] has argued that the second generation concept of "[[social justice]]" cannot have any practical political meaning:

{{quote|No state of affairs as such is just or unjust: it is only when we assume that somebody is responsible for having brought it about ... In the same sense, a [[free market|spontaneously working market]], where prices act as guides to action, cannot take account of what people in any sense need or deserve, because it creates a distribution which nobody has designed, and something which has not been designed, a mere state of affairs as such, cannot be just or unjust. And the idea that things ought to be designed in a "just" manner means, in effect, that we must abandon the market and turn to a [[planned economy]] in which somebody decides how much each ought to have, and that means, of course, that we can only have it at the price of the complete abolition of personal liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/1992/07/01/the-road-from-serfdom/4|publisher=''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''|accessdate=January 4, 2010|title=The Road from Serfdom: Forseeing the Fall|first=Thomas W.|last=Hazlett|date=July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[New York University School of Law]] professor of law [[Jeremy Waldron]] has written in response to critics of the second-generation rights:

{{quote|In any case, the argument from first-generation to second-generation rights was never supposed to be a matter of conceptual analysis. It was rather this: if one is really concerned to secure civil or political liberty for a person, that commitment should be accompanied by a further concern about the conditions of the person's life that make it possible for him to enjoy and exercise that liberty. Why on earth would it be worth fighting for this person's liberty (say, his liberty to choose between A and B) if he were left in a situation in which the choice between A and B meant nothing to him, or in which his choosing one rather than the other would have no impact on his life?"&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, 1993. Liberal Rights: Collected Papers, page 7, 1981–91. {{ISBN|0-521-43617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[socialist]] and [[political economist]] [[Karl Polanyi]] made the antithetical argument to Hayek in the book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]''. Polanyi wrote that an uncontrolled free market would lead to repressive economic concentration and then to a co-opting of democratic governance that degrades civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|year=2001|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Conference on Human Rights]] opposed the distinction between [[civil and political rights]] (negative rights) and [[economic, social and cultural rights]] (positive rights) that resulted in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] proclaiming that "all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual analytics''' is an outgrowth of the fields of [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]] that focuses on analytical [[reasoning]] facilitated by interactive [[User interface|visual interface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pak Chung Wong and J. Thomas (2004). "Visual Analytics". in: ''IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'', Volume 24, Issue 5, Sept.-Oct. 2004 Page(s): 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Visual analytics is "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces."&lt;ref name="JJT05"&gt;[[Jim Thomas (visualization)|James J. Thomas]] and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://vis.pnnl.gov ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] National Visualization and Analytics Center.&lt;/ref&gt; It can attack certain problems whose size, complexity, and need for closely coupled human and machine analysis may make them otherwise intractable.&lt;ref name="RK 07"&gt;Robert Kosara (2007). [http://www.viscenter.uncc.edu/courses/visanalytics.html ''Visual Analytics'']. ITCS 4122/5122, Fall 2007. Retrieved 28 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Visual analytics advances science and technology developments in analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations and representations for computation and visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition.&lt;ref&gt;Kielman, J. and Thomas, J. (Guest Eds.) (2009). "Special Issue: Foundations and Frontiers of Visual Analytics". in: ''[[Information Visualization (journal)|Information Visualization]]'', Volume 8, Number 4, Winter 2009 Page(s): 239-314.&lt;/ref&gt; As a research agenda, visual analytics brings together several scientific and technical communities from computer science, information visualization, cognitive and perceptual sciences, interactive design, graphic design, and social sciences.

Visual analytics integrates new computational and theory-based tools with innovative interactive techniques and [[Representation (psychology)|visual representation]]s to enable human-information discourse. The design of the tools and techniques is based on [[cognitive science|cognitive]], [[design]], and [[visual perception|perceptual]] principles. This science of analytical reasoning provides the reasoning framework upon which one can build both strategic and tactical visual analytics technologies for threat analysis, prevention, and response. Analytical reasoning is central to the analyst’s task of applying human judgments to reach conclusions from a combination of evidence and assumptions.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

Visual analytics has some overlapping goals and techniques with [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]]. There is currently no clear consensus on the boundaries between these fields, but broadly speaking the three areas can be distinguished as follows:

* Scientific visualization deals with data that has a natural geometric structure (e.g., MRI data, wind flows).
* Information visualization handles abstract data structures such as trees or graphs.
* Visual analytics is especially concerned with coupling interactive visual representations with underlying analytical processes (e.g., statistical procedures, [[data mining]] techniques) such that high-level, complex activities can be effectively performed (e.g., sense making, reasoning, decision making).

Visual analytics seeks to marry techniques from information visualization with techniques from computational transformation and analysis of data. Information visualization forms part of the direct interface between user and machine, amplifying human cognitive capabilities in six basic ways:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Card, J.D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman (1999). "Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think". Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

# by increasing cognitive resources, such as by using a visual resource to expand human working memory,
# by reducing search, such as by representing a large amount of data in a small space,
# by enhancing the recognition of patterns, such as when information is organized in space by its time relationships,
# by supporting the easy perceptual inference of relationships that are otherwise more difficult to induce,

These capabilities of information visualization, combined with computational data analysis, can be applied to analytic reasoning to support the sense-making process.

== Topics ==

=== Scope ===

Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the following focus areas:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Analytical reasoning techniques that enable users to obtain deep insights that directly support assessment, planning, and decision making
* Data representations and transformations that convert all types of conflicting and dynamic data in ways that support visualization and analysis
* Techniques to support production, presentation, and dissemination of the results of an analysis to communicate information in the appropriate context to a variety of audiences.
* Visual representations and [[interaction technique]]s&lt;ref name="KS12"&gt;A. Kerren and F. Schreiber. Toward the Role of Interaction in Visual Analytics. In Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '12), pages 420:1-420:13, Berlin, Germany, 2012. IEEE Computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once.

=== Analytical reasoning techniques ===

Analytical reasoning techniques are the method by which users obtain deep insights that directly support situation assessment, planning, and decision making. Visual analytics must facilitate high-quality human judgment with a limited investment of the analysts’ time. Visual analytics tools must enable diverse analytical tasks such as:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Understanding past and present situations quickly, as well as the trends and events that have produced current conditions
* Identifying possible alternative futures and their warning signs
* Monitoring current events for emergence of warning signs as well as unexpected events
* Determining indicators of the intent of an action or an individual
* Supporting the decision maker in times of crisis.

These tasks will be conducted through a combination of individual and collaborative analysis, often under extreme time pressure. Visual analytics must enable hypothesis-based and scenario-based analytical techniques, providing support for the analyst to reason based on the available evidence.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Data representations ===

Data representations are structured forms suitable for computer-based transformations. These structures must exist in the original data or be derivable from the data themselves. They must retain the information and knowledge content and the related context within the original data to the greatest degree possible. The structures of underlying data representations are generally neither accessible nor intuitive to the user of the visual analytics tool. They are frequently more complex in nature than the original data and are not necessarily smaller in size than the original data. The structures of the data representations may contain hundreds or thousands of dimensions and be unintelligible to a person, but they must be transformable into lower-dimensional representations for visualization and analysis.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Theories of visualization ===
Theories of visualization include:&lt;ref name="RK 07" /&gt;
* [[Jacques Bertin]]'s ''[[Semiology of Graphics]]'' (1967)
* [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''Languages of Art'' (1977)
* [[Jock D. Mackinlay]]'s ''Automated design of optimal visualization'' (APT) (1986)
* [[Leland Wilkinson]]'s ''Grammar of Graphics'' (1998)

=== Visual representations ===

Visual representations translate data into a visible form that highlights important features, including commonalities and anomalies. These visual representations make it easy for users to perceive salient aspects of their data quickly. Augmenting the cognitive reasoning process with perceptual reasoning through visual representations permits the analytical reasoning process to become faster and more focused.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2016/11/23/making-wikipedia-knowledge-visible/|title=Making Wikipedia Knowledge Visible—Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

The input for the data sets used in the visual analytics process are [[heterogeneous]] data sources (i.e., the internet, newspapers, books, scientific experiments, expert systems). From these rich sources, the data sets ''S = S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are chosen, whereas each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , i ∈ (1, ..., m)'' consists of [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] A&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;. The goal or output of the process is insight ''I''. Insight is either directly obtained from the set of created visualizations ''V'' or through confirmation of [[hypotheses]] ''H'' as the results of automated analysis methods. This formalization of the visual analytics process is illustrated in the following figure. Arrows represent the transitions from one set to another one.

More formally the visual analytics process is a [[Data transformation|transformation]] ''F: S → I'', whereas ''F'' is a concatenation of functions ''f ∈ {D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}'' defined as follows:

''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;'' describes the basic data [[pre-processing]] functionality with ''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; : S → S and W ∈ {T, C, SL, I}'' including data transformation functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', data cleaning functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', data selection functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;'' and data integration functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are needed to make analysis functions applicable to the data set.

''V&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, W ∈ {S, H}'' symbolizes the visualization functions, which are either functions visualizing data ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V'' or functions visualizing hypotheses ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → V''.

''H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, Y ∈ {S, V}'' represents the hypotheses generation process. We distinguish between functions that generate hyphotheses from data ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → H'' and functions that generate hypotheses from visualizations ''H&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → H''.

Moreover, user interactions ''U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;, Z ∈ {V, H, CV, CH}'' are an integral part of the visual analytics process. User interactions can either effect only visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → V'' (i.e., selecting or zooming), or can effect only hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → H'' by generating a new hypotheses from given ones. Furthermore, insight can be concluded from visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt; : V → I'' or from hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; : H → I''.

The typical data pre-processing applying data cleaning, data integration and data transformation functions is defined as ''D&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)))''. After the pre-processing step either automated analysis methods ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;s1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;sq&lt;/sub&gt;}'' (i.e., statistics, data mining, etc.) or visualization methods ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V, V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;vs&lt;/sub&gt;}'' are applied to the data, in order to reveal patterns as shown in the figure above.&lt;ref name="VASC08"&gt;Daniel A. Keim, Florian Mansmann, Jörn Schneidewind, Jim Thomas, and Hartmut Ziegler (2008). "Visual Analytics: Scope and Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the following paradigm is used to process the data:

''Analyse First – Show the Important – Zoom, Filter and Analyse Further – Details on Demand''&lt;ref&gt;Keim D. A, Mansmann F, Schneidewind J, Thomas J, Ziegler H: ''Visual analytics: Scope and challenges''. ''Visual Data Mining:'' 2008, S. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
