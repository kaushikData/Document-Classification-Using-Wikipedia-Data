'''The American Deserters Committee''' (ADC) of [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada was a group of [[United States Army|American Armed Forces]] members who deserted their posts and went to [[Canada]] to avoid the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=0MnNYvkmBnoC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=American+Deserters+Committee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YNwU3q9rdu&amp;sig=eciyejNw0Pu0wF65ia989pGMfbU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd8dyp0P3SAhWl6YMKHT87BVgQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Deserters%20Committee&amp;f=false|title=All American Boys: Draft Dodgers in Canada from the Vietnam War|last=Kusch|first=Frank|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275972684|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deserters were aided in their efforts by groups such as [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panthers]], the [[Revolutionary Union]], The Resistance, [[American Friends Service Committee]], [[War Resisters League]] and the [[Committee for Peace and Freedom]].

ADC was formed by a group of politically active deserters, including [[Jerry Borstein]] and [[Bill Hertzog]] in December 1968, modeled on existing Deserters' Committees in [[Paris]] and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wWjGZt3U9n0C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%22American+Deserters+Committee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO0Ob80P3SAhXk6YMKHY-JBK8Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=second%20front&amp;f=false|title=Refugees from Militarism: Draft-Age Americans in Canada|last=Kasinsky|first=Renée G.|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=|isbn=9781412832847|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADC members included both deserters and their spouses and girlfriends, and welcomed other expatriate Americans who shared their views.  Though ADC retained almost total ideological independence, it received the bulk of its funds from the [[Montreal Council to Aid War Resisters]] (MCAWR), which, in turn, received most of its funds from the [[Canadian Council of Churches]].

ADC operated a hostel for newly arrived deserters (sometimes housing up to 20 men at a time), and published a newsletter called ADC Times. By the early summer of 1970, friction within ADC began to emerge over the group's inner circle of founders and colleagues, who had begun calling themselves the "Central Committee." The Committee was seen by many as increasingly autocratic and undemocratic, adopting a radical, [[Marxism|Marxist]] agenda, and discouraging dissent. In addition, it had allied itself with Quebec's separatist [[Front de Liberation Populaire]] (FLP), a nonviolent and implicitly Marxist organization, which campaigned for an independent and ideologically progressive Quebec. Though most ADC members were at least sympathetic to the FLP agenda, many feared that allying ADC (which had a few dozen members) with FLP (which had thousands of active supporters) benefitted neither group, while tarnishing the images of both.

In 1971, the ADC merged with the MCAWR, forming the [[American Refugee Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tYBSAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=%22American+Deserters+Committee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO0Ob80P3SAhXk6YMKHY-JBK8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20Deserters%20Committee%22&amp;f=false|title=Building Sanctuary: The Movement to Support Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, 1965-73|last=Squires|first=Jessica|date=2013-09-20|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774825276|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barnards inn.jpg|thumb|Frontage of Barnard's Inn Buildings, the remains of the Inn lie down the entrance at the right]]

'''Barnard's Inn''' is a former [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] in [[Holborn]], London. It is now the home of [[Gresham College]], an institution of higher learning established in 1597 that hosts public lectures. 

==History==
[[File:Barnard's Inn 20130413 058.JPG|thumb|left|Barnard's Inn entrance]]

Barnard's Inn dates back at least to the mid-thirteenth century – it was recorded as part of the estate of Sir [[Adam de Basing]] (Adam de Baysing), one time [[Lord Mayor of London]]. It passed on to [[John Mackworth]], the [[Dean of Lincoln]], who in turn passed it on to the [[Dean and Chapter of Lincoln]] on his death in 1451. Three years later, it was established as an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] – these were schools for law students before they passed on to an [[Inn of Court]]. Barnard's Inn was one of two Inns of Chancery linked to [[Gray's Inn]], the other being [[Staple Inn]]. Members of Gray's Inn were appointed readers to the Barnard or Staple Inn. For example, in the meeting of the Pension of Gray's Inn, 19 November 1617, it was stated: "Mr. William Denny chosen Reader of Barnard's Inn."&lt;ref&gt;See Pension Book of Gray's Inn, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Barnard or Staple's Inn had to pay four pounds for being admitted to Gray's Inn. Hence, at the meeting of the Pension 15 May 1626 it was said that gentlemen coming from Barnard or Staple's Inn "and crave the benefit of the fine of 43 pounds and 4 shillings upon their admittance shall be admitted of the third table and paye but 43 pounds and 4 shillings in that respect, otherwise to paye foure poundes as others do notwithstanding they be of Barnards Inne or Staple Inne."&lt;ref&gt;Pension Book of Gray's Inn, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard's Inn was badly damaged during the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780. An adjacent distillery, owned by a [[Roman Catholic]], Mr Langdale (who escaped), was set alight by rioters. The Hall and other buildings were damaged and one of the officers of the Inn witnessed a "sturdy fellow" pumping up [[gin]] from the cellar which he proceeded to sell at a [[penny]] a mug to the thirsty onlookers of the fire. The Inn received £3,200 in compensation for the damage.

By the 17th century, qualified [[Lawyer|attorneys]] were allowed to practise from Inns of Chancery as well as Inns of Court. By 1830, it had effectively become a set of residential chambers. In 1888, the link to the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was broken and soon it was purchased by the [[Mercers' Company]], serving as premises for the [[Mercers' School]] until 1959. It has been used as a venue for lectures by [[Gresham College]] since 1991.

==Buildings==
[[File:Barnards Inn Hall - back of hall.jpg|thumb|Barnard's Inn Hall, as viewed from outside of the entrance to the [[Gresham College]] offices]]

The buildings consist of a Hall, with 18th-century chambers and reception room. The Hall has three wooden bays, and dates from the 15th Century with 16th-century [[linen fold]] wood panelling. The roof timbers include the only surviving [[crown post]]s in Greater London. Some chalk-and-tile walling in the seminar room below dates back to [[Roman London]].

The Hall suffered from poor repair and two inadequate restorations in the 19th century. The [[Mercers' Company]] organised substantial repairs in 1932. The roof was removed, renovated and replaced and two fireplaces of [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor design]] were installed. The windows were reglazed, releaded and reframed. The windows contain the armorial bearings of Principals of Barnard's Inn:

* William Harvey (1545)
* Gilbert Hide (1558)
* Thomas Wilcox (1574)
* George Copuldike (1594)
* John Wicksteed (1594)
* Pieter van de Putte (1666)
* Silvester Petyt (1701)
* William Betts (1704)
* William Manlove (1710)
* Matthew Lancaster (1716)
* [[Dingley Askham]] (1722)
* Wiseman Claycett (1728)

The hall was renovated again in 1990, adding facilities for meetings and functions, ready to become the home of [[Gresham College]].

==Literary reference==
The hero of [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'', Pip, lodged in Barnard's Inn with Herbert Pocket for a number of years following his arrival in [[London]], which would have been circa 1820.

'''Basell Polyolefins''' was a joint venture between [[BASF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. [[Leonard Blavatnik]]'s [[Access Industries]] acquired it from the venturers for $5.7 billion in August 2005. In 2007, Basell merged with the privately owned US company [[Lyondell Chemical Company]] to form [[LyondellBasell]], which went bankrupt in the US in January 2009 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010.

Basell was the world's largest producer of [[polypropylene]] and advanced [[polyolefins]] products, the world's largest producer of [[polyethylene]], and a global leader in the development and licensing of polypropylene and polyethylene processes, and  a leader{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} in catalysts.

==Company history==

Basell's heritage comes from many companies, including [[BASF]], Hercules, Himont, [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini]], [[Montedison]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. However Basell, and then later [[LyondellBasell]], had its origin in a joint venture between [[BASF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. Spurred on by the work of Nobel Prize-winning scientists [[Karl Ziegler]] and [[Giulio Natta]], these Basell predecessor companies were among the leaders of the polyolefin revolution that began in the late 1930s and 1950s. This transformation is still driving the petrochemicals industry today.  In 2007, driven on by its then owners Access Industries and against the advice of Basell senior management, Basell acquired the privately owned US company [[Lyondell Chemical Company]] to form [[LyondellBasell]], paying far above the market rate for the shares. The main winner was Access, who also held significant shares in Lyondell and was able to realise a massive profit by forcing Basell to overpay. This drove the new company rapidly to file for chapter 11 in the US in January 2009, from which it emerged in May 2010.&lt;br&gt;

Every year from 1858, volumes of short summaries of grants of [[probate]] and of [[letters of administration]] were created, in alphabetical order by surname. For each grant of probate, these include the name, address, and occupation (or other description) of the deceased, the place and date of the death, the date on which probate was granted and the value of the estate, and the names and addresses of any executors. 

For 1858 to 1877, there is also a consolidated index.&lt;ref name=ancestry/&gt;

The office is similar to that of [[Notary public|Notaries Public]]; thus, commissioners of deeds generally authenticate their acts with some type of official seal.

==In the United States==
The office of Commissioner of Deeds is one unique to the United States. During the 19th century, deeds concerning property located in a particular state could only be acknowledged before a Notary Public in that state; if the deeds was acknowledged outside the state where the subject property was located, the grantor would have to find a judge of a court of record to take the acknowledgment. Because of the difficulty in finding a judge, most states created the office of Commissioner of Deeds to allow state officials to be present in other states to assist with the acknowledgment of instruments intended to be used in the state by which the commissioner was appointed. Over time, states began to accept the notarial acts of notaries in other states and the need for commissioners became eradicated. As a result, most of the states abolished the office during the 20th century. Although at one time at least half of all states appointed such commissioners, currently the only states whose statutes authorize such appointment are the states of [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]]. Usually the appointment and commission is granted by the state governor or secretary of state. However, even in the states which have laws allowing the appointment of commissioners, the majority of these states no longer grant appointments. Currently, only Florida, New Hampshire, New York and West Virginia still allow the appointment of commissioners.

In the state of Florida, Commissioners of Deeds are officers appointed by the Governor to take acknowledgments and administer oaths on documents executed outside Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for Florida|publisher=East Coast Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but to be used or recorded in connection with a timeshare property located in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0721/SEC96.HTM&amp;Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0721-%3ESection%2096#0721.96 Florida Statutes 721.96]&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioners are appointed to serve in a particular country and may only act in the country to which they are appointed, but they are not required to actually reside in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0721/SEC97.HTM&amp;Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0721-%3ESection%2097#0721.97 Florida Statutes 721.97]&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Commissioners of Deeds in the state of [[Florida]] was first created on January 28, 1831, and at that time such commissioners could authenticate any document to be used in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, James F. (1881) ''A Digest of the Laws of the State of Florida, from the year 1822 to the 11th day of March, 1881, inclusive'', p. 185-186. Floridian Book and Job Office: Tallahassee.&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner was appointed to one particular U.S. state or a foreign country, and was required to actually live in that state/country. However, the Governor at that time requested that the office be abolished, because he claimed that the office had "been used to facilitate fraudulent acts on some occasions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/data/session/1998/House/bills/analysis/pdf/HB0957S1A.BDIT.pdf Florida House Bill 957]&lt;/ref&gt; The office in its then-current form was abolished and replaced by the new form of "Timeshare Commissioner of Deeds" on April 30, 1998.

===In New Hampshire===

In the state of [[New Hampshire]], Commissioners of Deeds are officers appointed by the Governor to a term of five years, who are authorized to administer oaths, take depositions and affidavits, take acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments of writing, for documents intended to be used or recorded in the state of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-XLII-455.htm New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated 455:12-14]&lt;/ref&gt; Such commissioners may not be residents of New Hampshire; however, they are authorized to act both within and without the state.

===In New York===
In the state of New York, a Commissioner of Deeds is an official with duties similar to that of a [[Notary public|Notary Public]].  It is not a paid office. He or she must file an application and pass an examination; however, the application is filed with and appointment is made by a local city government rather than the state, as is the case with notaries public. Commissioners of deeds are normally appointed ''en masse'' in periodic acts of the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for New York|date=2011|publisher=East Coast Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powers and rules and regulations are practically identical to those of a Notary Public, except that the Commissioner of Deeds' authority exists only within the limits of the city for which he or she is appointed, and does not extend to the area of the whole state.  Despite the name, their powers are not restricted to certifying signatures on property transfers.  A large number of [[political party]] officials and activists apply to become commissioners of deeds to certify signatures on nominating petitions in New York's notoriously complex [[elections]] process, as the application is cheaper and the registration process slightly less cumbersome than for a notary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityclerk.nyc.gov/html/services/commissioner_of_deeds.shtml New York City Clerk's Office - Commissioner of Deeds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html New York Notary Public License Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011040617/http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York law also authorizes the appointment of commissioners to act in foreign jurisdictions, who are required to use a seal, bearing their name as commissioned, the words "Commissioner of Deeds for the state of New York", and the name of the city, county, country, or other political subdivision in which they have been appointed to act, to authenticate their official acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/new-york/ny-laws/ny_executive_law_141 New York Executive Law 141]&lt;/ref&gt; Such commissioners are appointed to act in a particular city or county (within the United States), or in a particular foreign country, and they may only act within the region to which they are appointed. They are authorized to take acknowledgments to be used or read into evidence within the State of New York; to administer oaths (the law does not specify that the administration of such oaths is restricted to documents to be used in New York); and, if appointed to act in a foreign country outside the United States, to certify copies of any records or patents, such certified copies to be read into evidence or used within the State of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/new-york/ny-laws/ny_executive_law_142 New York Executive Law 142]&lt;/ref&gt; The executive powers in New York are currently not appointing any out-of-state commissioners.

===In Pennsylvania===
Prior to July 1, 2003, the executive powers of the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] required that notaries public be residents of the state. Non-residents were appointed as Commissioners of Deeds, an essentially identical position. The law currently allows for any person maintaining a regular office located in Pennsylvania to be appointed as a Notary Public. Thus, the executive powers of the state are no longer accepting applications for commissioner appointments.

===In West Virginia===
The Governor of West Virginia has the power to appoint any person, residing in West Virginia or in any other U.S. state or territory, to take acknowledgments of deeds or other writings intended to be used or recorded in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2012%20%20.htm West Virginia Code 29-4-12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819225226/http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2012%20%20.htm |date=2012-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These commissioners may also take affidavits and depositions to be used in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2013%20%20.htm West Virginia Code 29-4-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819225229/http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2013%20%20.htm |date=2012-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner's term of office is ten years, unless sooner removed by the Governor. Such commissioners are required to enter into a bond in the penalty sum of $1,000, and must pay an application fee of $100. Every commissioner must provide an official stamp or embossing seal containing his or her name, residence, and the words "Commissioner for West Virginia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2015%20%20.htm West Virginia Code 29-4-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819225234/http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/29/code/WVC%2029%20%20-%20%204%20%20-%20%2015%20%20.htm |date=2012-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Texas===
The governor may biennially appoint and commission one or more individuals in other states, territories, or foreign countries or in the District of Columbia to serve as commissioner of deeds.
An appointment may be made only on the recommendation of the executive authority of the state, territory, or foreign country or of the District of Columbia. The term of office of a commissioner of deeds is two years.[http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.406.htm &lt;ref&gt;Texas Code: SUBCHAPTER B. COMMISSIONER OF DEEDS&lt;/ref&gt;]

Before performing the duties of office, a commissioner of deeds shall take and subscribe an oath to well and faithfully perform the duties of office under the laws of this state.  The oath shall be:
(1)  taken before the clerk of a court of record in the city, county, or country in which the commissioner resides;
(2)  certified to by the clerk under the clerk's hand and seal of office;  and
(3)  filed in the office of the secretary of state of this state.

A commissioner of deeds shall provide a seal with a star of five points in the center and the words "Commissioner of the State of Texas" engraved on the seal.  The seal shall be used to certify all official acts of the commissioner of deeds.  An instrument that does not have the impression of the seal, or an act of the commissioner of deeds that is not certified by the impression of the seal, is not valid in this state. A commissioner of deeds has the same authority as a notary public to take acknowledgments and proofs of written instruments, to administer oaths, and to take depositions to be used or recorded in this state.

{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}
{{History of the People's Republic of China}}

The '''Constitutional history of the People's Republic of China''' describes the evolution of its Constitutional system. The first [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] was promulgated in 1954. After two intervening versions enacted in 1975 and 1978, the current Constitution was promulgated in 1982. There were significant differences between each of these versions, and the 1982 Constitution has subsequently been amended several times. In addition, changing [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|Constitutional conventions]] have led to significant changes in the structure of the Chinese government in the absence of changes in the text of the Constitution.

== Background and precedents ==
[[Dynastic China]] adopted a constitutional system oscillating between a feudal distribution of power and a centralistic autocracy. The idea of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and a written [[constitution]], became influential towards the end of the 19th century, inspired immediately in large parts by the precedent of the [[Meiji Constitution]] in [[Japan]]. The first attempt towards constitutionalism was during the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (1898), but a [[coup d'état|coup]] by conservative monarchists loyal to [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] ended this effort. The same faction, however, eventually adopted a policy of transitioning towards constitutionalism. However, the first constitutional document was only published in 1908, and the first constitutional document with legal force (the "Nineteen Covenants") was not implemented until 1911, after the eruption of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which led to the demise of the Qing empire the next year.

The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] established in 1912 was governed by a series of constitutional documents. Most of these, especially those authored by the [[Kuomintang]], purported to reflect [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]] and Western norms.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|title=China's Changing Constitution|first=Jerome Alan|last=Cohen|journal=The China Quarterly|number=76|date=December 1978|pages=794–841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was enacted in 1946, when the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled government hastily declared an end to the "political tutelage" stage of Sun Yat-sen's three-stage theory of constitutional government amidst internal and external pressures. The Republic of China government progressively lost control of [[mainland China]] in the late 1940s to early 1950s, but the Constitution of the Republic of China, with amendments, is still the organic law of the government in Taiwan.

==Common Program (1949)==
In 1949, the [[Chinese Civil War]] was turning decisively in favour of the [[Communist Party of China]]. In June, the Communist Party organised a "[[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]" (CPPCC) to prepare for the establishment of a "[[New Democracy]]" regime to replace the [[Kuomintang]]-dominated [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government.

The first meeting of the CPPCC opened on 21 September 1949, and was attended by the Communist Party along with eight [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|aligned parties]]. The first CPPCC served in effect as a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]]. The meeting approved the [http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1949/1949e.pdf Common Program], which was effectively an interim Constitution, specifying the structure of the new government, and determining the name and symbols of the new state. It also elected leaders of the new central government, including [[Mao Zedong]] as Chairman of the Central People's Government. After the end of the conference, the [[People's Republic of China]] was proclaimed on 1 October 1949.

The People's Republic of China government functioned for the next five years under the Common Program, with a degree of democracy and inclusion that was not seen again in Chinese government to the present day. Among the provisions of the Common Program were those guaranteeing protection of [[private property]] (Article 3), "uniting" the [[bourgeoisie]] (Article 13), and assisting [[private enterprise]] (Article 30). The first People's Government, elected in 1949, included a significant number of representatives from parties other than the Communist Party.

==1954 Constitution==
{{Main|1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China}}

In accordance with the Common Program, preparations soon began for convening the first [[National People's Congress]] and the drafting of the first permanent Constitution of the People's Republic of China. On 24 December 1952, a resolution was moved by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] on behalf of the [[Communist Party of China]] at the 43rd meeting of the first CPPCC Standing Committee to draft the new, permanent, Constitution. The resolution was passed, and on 13 January 1953, the Central People's Government appointed a thirty-person drafting committee led by [[Mao Zedong]].

The drafting process was dominated by the Communist Party, and was almost exclusively restricted to the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]]. In March 1954, the draft Constitution was passed to the CPPCC and discussed in a national education campaign in the spring and summer of 1954. On 20 September 1954, exactly five years after the passage of the Common Program, the first meeting of the first [[National People's Congress]] unanimously approved the new Constitution. This version has subsequently been called the "1954 Constitution".

The 1954 Constitution included a preamble and 108 articles organised into four chapters. It specified a government structure remarkably similar to the current system. Chapter Two of the 1954 Constitution set up a system of government composed of six structural parts. The highest organ of government was the legislature, the [[National People's Congress]].&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; The executive was composed of the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Sub-national government was to be composed of people's congresses and people's committees of various levels. Autonomous ethnic areas would decide on their forms of government according to the wishes of the "majority of the people" in these areas. Finally, a hierarchy of courts headed by the [[Supreme People's Court]] and the [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (which would investigate crimes by the government) formed the judicial system.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

Chapter Three, Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, guaranteed a relatively comprehensive set of human rights, but also imposed the duty to pay taxes, undertake [[national service]], and to obey the law.

Like the subsequent versions of the Constitution, the 1954 Constitution was not [[Constitution#Entrenchment|entrenched]]. It could be amended by the National People's Congress (Article 27(1)) by a special two-thirds majority (Article 29) without recourse to a referendum or other such mechanism.

The 1954 Constitution was intended to be a transitional constitution, to be revised after China developed into a [[socialist economy]].&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

==1975 Constitution==
{{Main|1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China}}

However, the Chinese government functioned more or less as envisaged for only a short time. In 1957, the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] marked the beginning of a series of political movements and purges during which the Constitution's protections against Party interference in the judiciary largely failed to be respected.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; These culminated in the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976), a period in which the normal operation of government virtually ceased. In 1966, President [[Liu Shaoqi]] was political denounced, and from 1967 was placed under house arrest. After suffering two years of persecution, Liu died, unreported, in 1969, and the position of President was left unfilled. During this period, most government bodies around the country ceased operation; various levels of people's governments were replaced by Revolutionary Committees. Instead of (formally) by election, power passed via public denunciations and, in many cases, violent clashes.

In 1975, [[Mao Zedong]] and his supporters sought to formalise their power through the promulgation of a new Constitution. Under the 1975 Constitution, the office of the President (officially translated as "Chairman" during this period) was abolished, leaving Mao, as the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman of the Communist Party]], as the sole power centre. Formal duties of the President as Head of State were to be performed by the Chairman of the National People's Congress (who was, at the time, [[Zhu De]]). The replacement of local government by Revolutionary Committees was also formalised. The Constitution was shorted to 30 articles, and the Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens was greatly shortened. Guarantees removed included the rights to property and privacy, freedom from political discrimination, freedom of movement, speech, and artistic freedom, among other human rights. Concurrently, the duty to pay taxes was also removed. The 1975 Constitution also saw a significant shift in tone compared to the 1954 Constitution, and saw the insertion of a significant number of ideological sloganeering provisions, including the claim that the nation was guided by "Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought".&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

==1978 Constitution==
{{Main|1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China}}

Mao died in 1976, and the [[Gang of Four]] who had dominated Chinese politics were driven out of power by October 1976. The 1978 Constitution was promulgated in March 1978 under the chairmanship of [[Hua Guofeng]]. It contained 60 sections organised into four Chapters. In many ways, the 1978 Constitution was a compromise between the interim leadership's desire to consolidate power using Mao's [[moral authority]], while responding to the popular desire to reverse the Leftists extremes of the previous period. On the one hand, the new Constitution in many places maintained the ideological tone of the 1975 Constitution, such as in Article 16 ("State officials must diligently study Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, serve the people whole-heartedly ...") and Article 19 ("The fundamental role of the Armed Forces is: [...] defending against destabilisation and invasion from Socio-Imperialism, Imperialism, and their running dogs"). At the same time, the need for "Socialist democracy" was emphasised (Article 3), and the 1954 system of government was largely restored, including its significant checks on [[executive power]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

== 1982 Constitution ==
{{Main|Constitution of the People's Republic of China}}

The 1978 Constitution was again short-lived. In December 1978, the third plenary meeting of the 11th Communist Party Central Committee began a series of reviews and reforms that confirmed [[Deng Xiaoping]] as the new paramount leader of China, with reform-minded leaders supported by Deng filling the top echelon of government. As part of the Deng faction's political reform agenda, a fourth Constitution was promulgated on 4 December 1982. The [[1982 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 Constitution]] was born in a political environment where the past, including Mao's "errors" and almost all of the Communist Party's policies from 1949, were relatively objectively re-examined, and the country's future, including the pursuit of [[market economy|market economic]] reforms, was being openly debated. As a result, the 1982 Constitution returned the government structure to broadly that set up in 1954, with the Presidency restored. The Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens were greatly expanded, and elevated to Chapter Two, ahead of the provisions for the structure of the government. The 1982 Constitution was subsequently amended in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004 and 2018, generally modifying the Constitution in accordance with economic and political reforms over that period. The current compilation dates from 11 March 2018.

The system of government set up under the 1982 Constitution has undergone some changes, largely due to the evolution of Constitutional conventions rather than textual amendments. The most significant of these occurred in 1989-1993. As drafted, the 1982 Constitution contemplated that the power of the state would be distributed amongst the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], the [[Premier of the State Council]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]. The [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], as nominal head of state, would be a symbolic role with little substantive power. Such was the arrangement until 1989. During the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]], the President, [[Yang Shangkun]], also the Vice chairman of Central Military Commission, used his formal powers under the Constitution to deploy troops to Beijing in support of the state of emergency declared by the Premier [[Li Peng]], and colluded in the subsequent violent crackdown in [[Beijing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title = 国务院关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的命令 |wslanguage = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt; against the wishes of [[Zhao Ziyang]], the General Secretary of the Party. In a reaction against the conflict between the independent power centres, at the expiration of Deng's term, the new General Secretary, [[Jiang Zemin]], also became [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and later took on the position of the President as well. In this way, the centres of power were unified. This convention has continued to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">'''Course of employment''' is a legal consideration of all circumstances which may occur in the performance of a person's job, especially during a period of time where specific objectives are given by the employer to the employee. Black's Law Dictionary (2nd Pocket ed. 2001) pg. 154.

Key examples of this consideration under US law can include [[tort]] [[legal liability|liability]] or [[ownership]] of [[intellectual property]].  If an employee is driving a motor vehicle during working hours and harms the person or property of another, a court would consider course of employment to determine if the employer had [[vicarious liability]] for the harm.  Extreme examples would likely find the employer is liable for a truck driver on his assigned route but not for a secretary picking up her child from day care.

Similarly the employer would likely own the [[copyright]] rights to a song written by an employee who was hired as a composer, but not if the employee was hired as an accountant.

'''Court costs''' (also called '''law-costs''') are the costs of handling a case, which, depending on legal rules, may or may not include the costs of the various parties in a [[lawsuit]] in addition to the costs of the [[court (law)|court]] itself.  In the United States, "court costs" (such as filing fees, copying and postage) are differentiated from attorney's fees, which are the hourly rates paid to attorneys for their work in a case.  Court costs can reach very high amounts, often far beyond the actual monetary worth of a case. Cases are known in which one party won the case, but lost more than the monetary worth in court costs. Court costs may be awarded to one or both parties in a lawsuit, or they may be waived.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], the losing side is usually ordered to pay the winning side's costs. This acts as a significant disincentive to bringing forward court cases. Usually, the winning party is not able to recover from the losing party the full amount of his or her own solicitor's (attorney's) costs, and has to pay the shortfall out of his or her own pocket. The loser pays principle does not apply to the [[United States]] legal system, although a separate system does operate there. In cases in the federal court system, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1920 Title 28, section 1920] of the [[United States Code]], provides:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following:
(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;
(2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case;
(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;

{{Other uses|Depletion (disambiguation)}}

'''Depletion''' is an [[accounting]] and [[tax]] concept used most often in [[mining]], [[timber]], [[petroleum]], or other similar industries. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of a product's reserves. Depletion is similar to [[depreciation]] in that it is a cost recovery system for accounting and tax reporting. 

Depletion, for both accounting purposes and [[Internal Revenue Service|United States tax purposes]], is a method of recording the gradual expense or use of [[natural resource]]s over time.  Depletion is the using up of natural resources by [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[Boring (earth)|drilling]], or [[logging|felling]].

According to the [[IRS]] Newswire,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=120930,00.html IRS Issues Guidance on Recoverable Reserves]&lt;/ref&gt; over 50 percent of oil and gas extraction businesses use cost depletion to figure their depletion deduction. Mineral property includes oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits). For that purpose, property is each separate interest businesses own in each [[mineral deposit]] in each separate tract or parcel of land. Businesses can treat two or more separate interests as one property or as separate properties.

==Types of depletion==
For tax purposes, the two types of depletion are percentage depletion and cost depletion.
 
For mineral property, one generally must use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, one must use cost depletion.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch09.html Publication 535 (2007), Business Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percentage depletion===
To figure percentage depletion, one multiplies a certain percentage, specified for each mineral, by gross income from the property during the tax year. The rates to be used and other conditions and qualifications for oil and gas wells are discussed below under ''Independent Producers and Royalty Owners'' and under ''Natural Gas Wells''. Rates and other rules for percentage depletion of other specific minerals are found later in ''Mines and Geothermal Deposits''.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"/&gt;

===Cost depletion===
Cost depletion is an accounting method by which costs of natural resources are allocated to depletion over the period that make up the life of the asset. Cost depletion is computed by estimating the total quantity of mineral or other resources acquired and assigning a proportionate amount of the total resource cost to the quantity extracted in the period. For example, if Big Texas Oil, Co. discovers a large reserve of oil, the company has estimated the oil well will produce 200,000 barrels of oil. The company invests $100,000 to extract the oil and extracts 10,000 barrels the first year. Therefore, the depletion deduction is $5,000 ($100,000 X 10,000/200,000).

Cost depletion for tax purposes may be completely different from cost depletion for accounting purposes:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = S/(R+S) \times AB = AB/(R+S) \times S &lt;/math&gt;
:CD = Cost Depletion.
:S =  Units sold in the current year
:R =  Reserves on hand at the end of the current year
:AB = Adjusted basis of the property at the end of the current year

==Accounting==
Adjusted basis is the basis at end of year adjusted for prior years depletion in cost or percentage. It automatically allows for adjustments to the basis during the taxable year.

By using the units remaining at the end of the year, the adjustment automatically allows for revised estimates of the reserves.

Depletion is based upon sales and not production. Units are considered sold in the year the proceeds are taxable under the taxpayer's accounting method.

==Reserves==
Reserves generally include proven developed reserves and "probable" or "prospective" reserves if there is reasonable evidence to have believed that such quantities existed at that time.

==Example==
If producer X has capitalized costs on property A of $40,000, originally consisting of the lease bonus, capitalized exploration costs, and some capitalized carrying costs, and the lease has been producing for several years and during this time, X has claimed $10,000 of allowable depletion. In 2009, X's share of production sold was 40,000 barrels and an engineer's report indicated that 160,000 barrels could be recovered after December 31, 2009.

The calculation of cost depletion for this lease would be as follows:

:Cost depletion = S/(R+S) × AB or AB/(R+S) × S
:CD = 40,000/(40,000 + 160,000) × ($40,000 − $10,000)   
:   = 40,000/200,000          × $30,000    
:   = $6,000

The '''Dimitrov Constitution''' was the second [[Constitution of Bulgaria]], in effect from 1947 to 1971.&lt;ref name=Rigas&gt;Konstantinov, Emil. [http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/REPORTS/r1/Bu_R1_konstantinov.htm Constitutional Foundation of Bulgaria (Historical Parallels)]. Rigas Network, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It formed the legal basis for [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist rule]] in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Bulgaria/The-early-communist-era Bulgaria: The early Communist era] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgi Dimitrov]], after whom the document is named, guided the framing of the 1947 constitution on the model of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]].&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{csref|country=bulgaria|section=The Dimitrov Constitution|author=Glenn E. Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dimitrov Constitution guaranteed citizens equality before the law; freedom from discrimination; a universal welfare system; freedom of speech, the press, and assembly; and inviolability of person, domicile, and correspondence.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; But those rights were qualified by a clause prohibiting activity that would jeopardize the attainments of "the national revolution of 9 September 1944."&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Citizens were guaranteed employment but required to work in a socially useful capacity.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; The constitution also prescribed a planned national economy.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Private property was allowed, if its possession was not "to the detriment of the public good."&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of ESPN}}
ESPN Inc. was founded in 1979 by [[Bill Rasmussen]] attempting to broadcast Connecticut sports over an "Entertainment and Sports Programming Network" cable channel. [[Getty Oil]], [[Anheuser-Busch]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] all got involved with the new cable channel. In 1984, American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] purchased a stake in the company. ABC merged with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]]. The combined company was purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996. In 2018, ESPN launched a new streaming service called ESPN+.

Shortly after being terminated as [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] communications director, Rasmussen conceived in May 1978 of a plan to product Connecticut sports events for Connecticut cable systems.&lt;ref name="sbj"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ourand|first1=John|title=Champions: Bill Rasmussen, ESPN creator|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/04/04/People-and-Pop-Culture/Rasmussen.aspx|accessdate=March 27, 2018|work=Sports Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=April 4, 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his son, Scott, they had move beyond that considering a national sports channel doable.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; [[RCA]] had an underused satellite thus pushing for customers. Finding it cheaper to rent a satellite transponder full-time instead of 5 hours a day, they changed their plans to a national channel.&lt;ref name="idch"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 56|date=2004|publisher=St. James Press|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/espn-inc-history/|accessdate=March 27, 2018|language=en|chapter=History of ESPN, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Rasmussen got the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] on February 7, 1979 in principal to grant ESPN broadcast rights for its sports. The next day at the Texas Cable Show, he was able to get cable companies on board. An advertising contract with Anheuser-Busch was in talk at that time. [[Getty Oil]] came on board as its major source of capital. In 1979, Rasummen purchased the first acre for ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Conn.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; With a reasonable payment program in July 1979, Rasmussen leased RCA's Satcom 1 transponder using his credit card. Anheuser-Busch became a major sponsor signing a $1.4 million ad contract, a record at the time. Getty Oil invested $10 million into ESPN getting a controlling stake in 1979.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

On September 7, 1979, [[ESPN]] cable channel went on the air&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; with 24-hours of programming on the weekends and limited hours during the week. 625 cable system affiliates were signed up at launch and they had 1 million household subscribed total (out of 20 million households with cable). The channel's first game featured the Milwaukee Schlitzes and the Kentucky Bourbons [[Men's professional softball in the United States|slow-pitch world series softball]].&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

In 1980, the company was named in a Texas divorce filing. Ground breaking for its headquarters took place.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt; Full-time broadcasting began in September 1980. Additional programming at the time included weekly boxing matches.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

NBC Sports President Chet Simmons was hired to help run the cable channel. Simmons and Rasmussen were at odds with Getty Oil executives siding with Simmons. At the end of 1980, Rasmussen was removed as company president by Getty Oil executive for ESPN, Stuart Evey, relegating him to a ceremonial role. Rasmussen left in 1981 and sold his remaining stock in 1984.&lt;ref name="sbj"/&gt;

Investing another $15 million into the company and no profits expected any time soon, Getty used management consultant McKinsey &amp; Co. to assess ESPN's future. McKinsey's lead consultant was Roger Werner, who figured with another $120 million and five years ESPN would become a profit maker. Werner soon was hired by ESPN as vice-president of finance, administration, and planning and developed a new business plan. Werner developed a new revenue source beyond advertising by initiating revolutionary affiliate fees paid by the cable operators by number of subscribers starting at 6 cents. Between CBS Cable folding in October 1982 and the new CEO, Bill Grimes, they convince most of the reluctant cable providers to pay. By 1985, the fee was 10 cents.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

ESPN was the largest cable channel by the end of 1983 with 28.5 million households. Also in 1983, the company began distributing programming outside the US. ABC, Inc. purchased in January 1984 a 14% holding in the company followed by a June purchased of a controlling interest. Capital Cities Communications, Inc. bought ABC in early 1986 to form Capital Cities/ABC Inc. In 1988, Werner became ESPN's president and CEO.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

===Multichannel===

ESPN started out expanding into other nations and additional channels. The ESPN International unit was formed in 1988 to start channels in other nations beginning with ESPN Latin America in 1989. In 1992, ESPN Asia was launched. ESPN partnered with [[TF1]] and [[Canal+]] for a made over [[Eurosport]] to enter Europe.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

[[RJR Nabisco]] sold its 20 percent stake in ESPN to the [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Corporation]]. Werner resigned as CEO and president in October 1990 for another sports CEO job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Werner to Leave ESPN, Join Daniels' Firm |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-30/business/fi-542_1_bill-daniels |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 30, 1990 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Bornstein]] replaced him in the CEO post moving up from the second position of executive vice-president in charge of programming and production.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

With [[ABC Radio Network]], the company started [[ESPN Radio]] Network in 1991 with programming 16 hours per week. Ohlmeyer Communications' sports programming division was purchased in March 1993.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt; ESPN launched [[ESPN2]] on October 1, 1993 at 7:30 PM. The channel at the time was targeting those age 18-34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Frager|first1=Ray |title=Whether you get it or not, ESPN2 has no tie to the tried and true |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-01/sports/1993274121_1_sportsnight-sportscenter-olbermann|accessdate=March 28, 2018|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 1, 1993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ESPN acquired Creative Sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.espnfrontrow.com/2018/04/espn-remembers-dan-shoemaker/|title=ESPN remembers Dan Shoemaker - ESPN Front Row|date=2018-04-06|work=ESPN Front Row|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from Dow Jones an 80 percent stake in SportsTicker.&lt;ref name="idch" /&gt;

ESPN purchased for $175 million [[ESPN Classic|Classic Sports Network]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Whitford |title=The king of the sports deal |date=May 25, 2010 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/10/news/companies/greenberg_sports_deal_king.fortune/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522034442/http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/10/news/companies/greenberg_sports_deal_king.fortune/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ESPN acquired the North American Sports Network (NASN), later re-branded as [[ESPN America]] on February 1, 2009, Super Bowl Sunday.&lt;ref name="Times658043"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hancock | first = Ciaran | title = Ireland: TV3 grabs Setanta stake | work = [[The Times]] | date = 3 December 2006 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article658043.ece | accessdate = 2007-08-07  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN America"&gt;{{cite news |last=Welsh|first=James|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a131634/nasn-to-become-espn-america.html|title=NASN to become ESPN America|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=2 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Disney purchased a 1/3 stake in [[BAMTech]] for $1 billion from [[MLB Advanced Media]] with the option to purchase a majority share, which it later exercised now owning 75% . Disney purchased the stake to first develop an ESPN subscription streaming service, later named [[ESPN+]]. The service would not include any current ESPN channel or its content, but tap BAMTech licensed rights and ESPN college rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Daniel|title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html|access-date=August 17, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]'s rules regarding foreign broadcasters, ESPN has been prohibited from acquiring majority ownership of any channel operating in Canada. Instead, ESPN partnered with several Canadian firms to form a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications in 1995, which then acquired the sports networks [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]]. These Canadian partners then sold their shares in 2001 to CTV Inc. (now [[Bell Media]]). ESPN continues to own 20 percent of what is now [[List of assets owned by Bell Media#CTV Specialty Television|CTV Specialty Television]] while Bell Media owns the remaining 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CTV can acquire TSN if it unloads Sportsnet | publisher=Globeandmail.com |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/ctv-can-acquire-tsn-if-it-unloads-sportsnet/article1038075/ |accessdate=March 20, 2017 |location=Toronto | date=March 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sports channels owned by the CTV Specialty Television subsidiary:
*[[The Sports Network|TSN]] – five feeds
*[[Réseau des sports|RDS]]

Through CTV Specialty Television, ESPN also has an indirect interest in several channels operated in partnership with [[Discovery Communications]], but ESPN is not believed to be directly involved with these operations.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|ESPN in the United Kingdom}}
In 2006, ESPN acquired the North American Sports Network (NASN), later re-branded as [[ESPN America]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Times658043"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN America"/&gt; ESPN launched a [[BT Sport ESPN|domestic channel]] in the United Kingdom after acquiring a portion of the local rights package to the [[Premier League]] alongside [[Sky Sports]], replacing the collapsing [[Setanta Sports]]. The contract lasted from the 2009-10 season to the 2012-13 season.&lt;ref name="bbc-espnepl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8109954.stm|title=Setanta loses Premier TV rights|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN snaps up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/656557/espn-snaps-up-premier-league-tv-packages|title=ESPN snaps up Premier League TV packages|work=[[ESPNsoccernet]]|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2012, the network had begun to lose many of its key sports rights, including the Premier League, to [[BT Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18430036|title=Premier League rights sold to BT and BSkyB for £3bn|work=BBC News|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a405472/bt-poaches-premiership-rugby-rights-from-espn-sky.html|title=BT poaches Premiership Rugby rights from ESPN, Sky|work=Digital Spy|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a436090/bt-deals-further-blow-to-espn-with-new-rights-deals.html|title=BT deals further blow to ESPN with new rights deals|work=Digital Spy|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2013, ESPN reached a deal to sell its television business in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including ESPN America's programming rights, to BT Group. The ESPN channel in the United Kingdom was placed under the control of [[BT Sport]], while [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]] and ESPN America were shut down. ESPN continues to operate digital properties targeting the United Kingdom, including its ESPN.co.uk, [[ESPN FC]], [[ESPNcricinfo]], and [[ESPNscrum]] websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/25/espn-bt-vision|title=BT buys ESPN'S UK and Ireland TV channels|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ESPN reached a long-term deal with BT Sport for British rights to ESPN original programming and international event rights.&lt;ref name="bt-espndeal"&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Sport and ESPN deepen relationship with long-term collaboration|url=http://www.btplc.com/news/articles/showarticle.cfm?articleid=%7B60a32774-3b2c-4b26-90de-44a829925ea7%7D|publisher=BT plc|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">In [[elections in the United Kingdom]], as well as in certain other similar political systems such as [[India]]'s, an '''election agent''' is the person legally responsible for the conduct of a candidate's [[political campaign]] and to whom election material is sent to by those running the election. In elections in the United Kingdom a [[candidate]] may be his or her own election agent. The [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] provides periodic guidance for candidates and agents of which the latest is for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 British general election]].&lt;ref name ="EComm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/173016/UKPGE-Overview.pdf|title=Electoral Commission - UK Parliamentary general election: Guidance for candidates and agents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]] and most of Canada's provinces, an election agent is legally referred to as an '''official agent'''.

Election agents are responsible for sanctioning all expenditure on the candidate's campaign, for maintaining the accuracy of and submitting to the [[returning officer]] the candidate's expenses and other documents, as well as deciding whether to contest the result of a [[count (electoral)|count]]. Agents are also permitted to oversee the [[voting|polling]] and [[Vote counting system|counting]] of votes to ensure the accuracy and impartiality of the election, and may appoint [[polling agent|polling]] and [[counting agent]]s to assist them in these tasks. The number of polling and counting agents that can be appointed is determined by the returning officer of the election and they must be appointed by a set date laid out in the timetable of the election.

Agents must usually have reached the [[age of majority]] and not be acting as a [[polling clerk|clerk]] or officer to the returning officer in the given election. Where a candidate does not nominate an agent, they are their own agent.

The larger parties typically pay their election agents, and the role is gradually becoming a professional one as the similar (but not equivalent) role of [[campaign manager]]s is in the [[United States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13015">A '''flow-through entity''' ('''FTE''') is a [[Legal personality|legal entity]] where income "flows through" to investors or owners; that is, the income of the entity is treated as the income of the investors or owners. Flow-through entities are also known as '''pass-through entities''' or '''fiscally-transparent entities'''. Depending on the local tax regulations, this structure can avoid [[dividend tax]] and [[double taxation]] because only owners or investors are taxed on the revenue. Technically, for tax purposes, flow-through entities are considered "non-entities" because they are not taxed; rather, taxation "flows-through" to another tax return.

Common types of FTEs are [[general partnerships]], [[limited partnership]]s and [[limited liability partnerships]]. In the United States, additional types of FTE include [[S corporation]]s, [[income trust]]s and [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]].

Most countries require an FTE (or its owners) to file an annual return reporting the shares of income allocated to owners, and to provide each owner with a statement of allocated income to enable owners to report their shares of income on their own tax returns. In the United States, the statement of allocated income is known as form '''K-1''' (or '''Schedule K-1''').

==Definitions==
According to [[International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation]] (IBFD) a pass-through entity or flow-through entity (FTE) is a "non-taxable entity, such as a partnership, under which the income or expense is generally regarded as income or expense of the participants under the transparency principle."&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=IBFD International Tax Glossary |isbn=9789087220570 |agency=International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD) |year=2009 |first=Julie |last=Rogers-Glabush |edition=7 |pages=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313}} FTEs are based on [[conduit theory]] or [[pipeline theory]] which is defined as a "method of integrating the taxation at the entity and participator level under which income or deductions flow through from the entity to its participators. The entity is in effect regarded as an extension of the participators. A partnership is generally taxed according to the conduit system. The conduit system may be contrasted with the classical system."&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

==Types of FTEs==
In the United States, pass-through entities include "sole proprietorships, partnerships and [[S corporation]]s that ... pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners"&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/03/us/politics/five-changes-for-families-in-the-republican-tax-bill.html |title=The Five Biggest Changes for Families in the Republican Tax Bill |first=Alicia |last=Parlapiano |date=November 2, 2017  |access-date=December 3, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[income trust]]s and [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]].

According to ''CNN Money'', in the United States, most "businesses are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations"&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/02/pf/taxes/senate-tax-bill-passed/index.html |title=Here's what's in the Senate tax bill - and how it differs from the House's bill |first=Jeanne |last=Sahadi |newspaper=CNN Money |date=December 2, 2017 |access-date=December 3, 2017 |quote="The House bill dropped the top income tax rate to 25% from 39.6%, while prohibiting anyone providing professional services (e.g., lawyers and accountants) from taking advantage of the lower rate. It also phases in a lower rate of 9% for businesses that earn less than $75,000. The Senate bill lowers taxes on filers in pass-throughs by letting them deduct 23% of their income, up from 17.4% originally. The 23% deduction would be prohibited for anyone in a service business -- except those with taxable incomes under $500,000 if married ($250,000 if single). Prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates. But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the Senate bill would automatically limit the deduction to half of the W-2 wages of the pass-through entity or its share to the individual taxpayer. The W-2 rule would not apply, however, if the filer's taxable income is under $500,000 if married, $250,000 if single."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "means their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them on their personal returns under ordinary income tax rates."&lt;ref name="vox_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/2/16724738/senate-tax-vote-house-bill-differences |title=Republicans still have a lot of differences between the House and Senate tax bills to hash out: The House and Senate now have to pass the same tax bill. Here’s where the two diverge|authors=Dylan Scott and Tara Golshan  |date=December 2, 2017 |access-date=December 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words pass-through businesses are not "taxed like corporations and instead pay taxes on business income as if it were personal income."&lt;ref name="vox_2017"/&gt;

===Sole proprietorships===

A sole proprietor is "someone who owns an unincorporated business by himself or herself." However, if you are the sole member of a domestic limited liability company (LLC), you are not a sole proprietor if you elect to treat the LLC as a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sole proprietors "must report all business income or losses on [their] personal income tax return; the business itself is not taxed separately. The IRS refers to this as "pass-through" taxation, because business profits pass through the business to be taxed on your personal tax return.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses&lt;/ref&gt;

===S corporation===
{{main|S corporation}}
While an S corporation shareholders are subject to tax on their "pro rata shares of income" based on their shareholdings in the S corporation which is not itself taxed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_S.html 26 USC 1361-1368.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bond and bond option sales strategy (BOSS)===

FTEs included in the 2009 ''IBFD International Tax Glossary'' included the ''Bond and Bond Option Sales Strategy'' (BOSS) transaction] referring to an "investment strategy developed in the United States to generate tax losses without a corresponding economic loss. The transaction involves the use of a partnership or other flow-through entity that makes an investment in a foreign corporation that is capitalized for the purpose of carrying out the transaction. Variants of Boss Transactions are referred to as Son of Boss Transactions.&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

==Chronology==
According to a report published by Brookings in May 2017, in the early 1980s almost all business income in the United States was generated by [[C corporations]]. In terms of [[Income tax in the United States]] C corporations are taxed separately from their owners.&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"/&gt;

In December 2004 the ''Financial Asset Securitization Investment'' (FASIT) which was a flow-through entity formed in the United States, was repealed. FASIT was an investment instrument in "non-mortgage receivable pools such as credit card receivables, automobile loans, construction loans, and finance leases." FASITS in existence on October 24, 2004 were exempted from the repeal.&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|179}}

By 2005 the US Internal Revenue Service viewed Son of Boss as "an abusive transaction aggressively marketed in the late 1990s and 2000 primarily to wealthy individuals." The IRS began a "settlement initiative" which "required taxpayers to concede 100 percent of the claimed tax losses and pay a penalty of either 10 percent or 20 percent unless they previously disclosed the transactions to the IRS."&lt;ref name="IRS_2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-collects-32-billion-from-son-of-boss-final-figure-should-top-35-billion |title=IRS Collects $3.2 Billion from Son of Boss; Final Figure Should Top $3.5 Billion |date=March 24, 2005 |access-date=December 3, 2017 |agency=U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, "only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations."&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"/&gt;

Starting in 2013, [[Kansas]] Governor [[Sam Brownback]] undertook what was described by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in a June 2017 article as the United States' "most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy".&lt;ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/kansass-conservative-tax-experiment-is-dead/529551/ |title=The Death of Kansas's Conservative Experiment |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=June 7, 2017 |quote=Republicans in the state legislature on Tuesday voted to reverse Governor Sam Brownback’s signature tax cuts, dealing a blow to the kind of fiscal policy the Trump administration wants to enact nationally.|first=Russell |last=Berman}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses as pass-through income entities, benefited from the complete tax exemption. [T]ens of thousands of Kansans were able to "claim their wages and salaries as income from a business rather than from employment."&lt;ref name="WP_2017_revolt"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/22/republicans-real-live-experiment-with-kansass-economy-survives-a-revolt-from-their-own-party/ |title=Republicans' ‘real-live experiment' with Kansas's economy survives a revolt from their own party |newspaper=The Washington Post|author=Max Ehrenfreund|date=February 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownback's tax overhaul created pass-through income tax exemptions as well as trimming income tax, eliminating some corporate taxes.&lt;ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"/&gt; From 2013 to 2017, Kansas experienced budget shortfalls culminating in a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017, which "threatened the viability of [the state's] schools and infrastructure".&lt;ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"/&gt;  In response, in June 2017, the extreme tax cuts were rolled back to 2013 levels.&lt;ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"/&gt;

By 2017, pass-through businesses earned the "majority of business income" in the United States and "owners of S-corporations and partnerships now earn about half of all income from businesses."&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"&gt;{{cite report |title=9 facts about pass-through businesses |first1=Aaron |last1=Krupkin |first2=Adam |last2=Looney|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses/#fact4 |agency=Brookings |date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a September 2017 article in the ''New York Times'', about "95 percent of companies in the United States are structured as pass-through entities, generating the bulk of the government’s tax revenues."&lt;ref name="NYT_Gelles_taxplan_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/trump-tax-businesses.html |title=In Trump Tax Plan, a Windfall for Businesses Large and Small |first=David |last=Gelles |date=September 28, 2017  |access-date=December 3, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2017 the U.S. Senate passed a tax overhaul bill as part of the proposed [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] that reduced taxes on pass-through business income by allowing them to "deduct 23% of their income".&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"/&gt; The Senate added features to the bill to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"/&gt; In a November article, the ''New York Times'' reported that the tax bill would "[r]educe the pass-through tax rate to 25% regardless of income level. Since 95% of businesses are incorporated as pass-through entities.&lt;ref name="NYT_Gelles_taxplan_2017"/&gt; Examples include "sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners."&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"/&gt; whose owners pay taxes as if it were personal income at a much lower rate. This represents a large tax cut for owners that is capital as opposed to labor. Approximately the largest 2% of pass-through businesses represent 40% of pass-through income and today are taxed at 39.6%, the top individual rate."&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"/&gt;

'''Graphisoft EcoDesigner''' is an energy evaluation tool for architects – an add-on software for [[ArchiCAD]], [[Graphisoft]]'s [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] application – which aims to provide information about a building's energy performance at the early design phases giving fast feedback for architects on the energy efficiency and sustainability of certain design alternatives.

==Features==

With EcoDesigner, architects can get results about the energy consumption, [[Carbon footprint]] and the monthly energy balance in three steps:

* Data input: specifying physical properties of the already modeled building envelope using the default values set for different type of building parts or entering custom data, setting up location, weather data, building type and HVAC systems for the project.
* Evaluation: EcoDesigner passes the data to [[StruSoft]]'s [[VIP-Energy]] calculation engine, which performs a dynamic analysis.
* Results: report sheets available also in PDF format shows the results of the evaluation of the building shell, the energy consumption and cost values, the carbon footprint and the monthly energy balance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25170">The '''Ontario Green Energy Act''' (GEA), formally the '''Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009''', introduced in the [[Ontario legislature]] on February 23, 2009, is intended to expand [[renewable energy]] production, encourage [[energy conservation]] and create [[green job]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/lifestyle/ecoholic.cfm?content=171668|title=Taking T.O. off the grid |author=[[Adria Vasil]] |date= 6 October 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]] |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many clauses, the GEA is best known for creating a number of [[feed-in tariff]] rates for different types of energy sources. Notable among these is the '''microFIT''' program for small non-commercial systems under 10 [[kilowatt]]s, and '''FIT''', the larger commercial version which covers a number of project types with sizes into the [[megawatt]]s.

The GEA has been highly controversial within Ontario for the high initial tariff, up to 80.2 cents/kWh for small systems under microFIT. It has also been controversial outside Ontario due to its "made in Ontario" clauses which demand a certain amount of Ontario labour and manufacturing input in order to receive the tariff rates. Changes to the program and rates, some of them applied retroactively, had added confusion and complaints about the way the program is managed. The GEA was a major issue during the [[Ontario general election, 2011|2011 provincial elections]], with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|PC party]] threatening to cancel it outright if elected, while the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]] supporting it as a primary plank of their re-election platform.

==History==

===Previous efforts===
Prior to the introduction of the GEA, Ontario had enacted a number of different programs to introduce renewable energy or promote conservation. These included the Energy Conservation Leadership Act, the Energy Efficiency Act and of particular note, November 2006's Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program. The Standard Offer, also known as SOP or RESOP for short, introduced a number of fixed 20-year [[feed-in tariff]]s for [[hydropower|hydro]], [[wind power|wind]], [[solar photovoltaics|solar]] (PV) and [[biomass]] projects. RESOP tariffs were relatively low, 42 cents/kWh for PV and 11 cents/kWh for other forms of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontario-sea.org/Page.asp?PageID=1226&amp;SiteNodeID=284 |title=OSEA: Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program (RESOP) |publisher=Ontario-sea.org |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, RESOP was named North America's first true feed-in tariff program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-bits.com/PHOTON/likes/Ontario |title=North Star |publisher=D-bits.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, it was found that the RESOP program had significant administrative overhead that eroded the value of the program. In order to connect a generation project, the provider had to not only meet expected requirements for the equipment, but also had to apply to various agencies and levels of government for permission to connect to the grid. This process was not streamlined, and often required hundreds of pages of documentation to be submitted to each organization, in the proper sequence. Certain areas of the Ontario distribution grid were also placed off-limits for development, due to load considerations. Even then, there were stakeholders at the municipal level that could block development at any time as part of local building codes.

Due to the presence of fixed costs, including the administrative overhead, RESOP favoured large projects which could distribute these costs. It proved particularly successful for wind power developments, with almost 64% of the RESOP developments being wind, 28% biomass, and the rest a mix of hydro and a tiny amount of solar.&lt;ref&gt;Jim MacDougall, [http://www.3rdintegrationconference.com/pres/16_MacDougall.pdf "Ontario's Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program"], Ontario Power Authority, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towards the GEA===
RESOP included a built-in two-year review process that started in 2008. During this period, the worldwide industry was also exploring a number of different ways to implement incentive programs. The main contenders were the feed-in tariff system, like RESOP, and emissions-trading systems like the UK's Renewable Obligation or New Jersey's [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate]]. In 2008, [[Ernst &amp; Young]] published ''Renewable energy country attractiveness indices for the first quarter of 2008'', which demonstrated that Germany's FIT program was far more successful, delivering more power at lower costs. An earlier report from [[UC Berkeley]] demonstrated that job creation with renewables was far higher than fossil fuels, another argument in favour of the German-style program, which was then considered a great success.&lt;ref name=rec/&gt;

With the success of FIT programs, and in response to RESOP issues, a number of stakeholders suggested an expansion of the program with higher rates and various changes to the connection process to simplify the workload. In particular, a number of proposals suggested adding additional classes for very small systems that would have minimal impact on the grid that could be given an express application process and pre-authorized access to connect. These systems would also be given much higher tariffs, in order to offset basic implementation details, like metering, that are often a fixed cost no matter the project size.&lt;ref name=rec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/29/2140_Final_RESOP_Addendum_recommendaions_Dec-15-08.pdf |title=Recommendations for Procuring Sustainable Energy|publisher=Ontario-sea.org|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
The GEA effort was led by [[George Smitherman]], the [[Ministry of Energy (Ontario)|Minister of Energy and Infrastructure]]. It was claimed that the bill will help the government ensure the province’s future by: 
* Supporting and expanding economic investment, thus building a stronger, greener economy with an estimated 50,000+ direct and indirect jobs over the next three years
* Expanding Ontario’s use of clean and renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar, biomass and biogas
* Better protecting the environment, combating climate change and creating a healthier future for generations to come.

==Features==
Among the key features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca |title=Home &amp;#124; Ontario Power Authority - Feed-in Tariff Program |publisher=Fit.powerauthority.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Act are the following:
* Different levels of tariff&lt;ref&gt;[http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/99/10863_FIT_Pricing_Schedule_for_website.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215035449/http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/99/10863_FIT_Pricing_Schedule_for_website.pdf |date=February 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are set for electricity from various renewable sources (solar photovoltaic, biogas, [[biomass]], [[landfill gas]], on-shore and off-shore wind and water power) that is "fed in" to the electrical grid; these are known as "[[Feed-in tariff|Feed in Tariffs]]", and are based on similar tariffs implemented in Europe
* In order to qualify for the program, minimum levels of Ontario content are required in materials and labour&lt;ref&gt;[http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/97/10759_FIT-Program-Overview_v1.1.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430003359/http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/97/10759_FIT-Program-Overview_v1.1.pdf |date=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local electrical distribution companies (LDCs) were obligated to accept small generators into their systems, and given a set of standard regulations for systems under 10&amp;nbsp;kW (microFIT systems), and a variety of other sizes, depending on the technology involved
* Smaller systems, and in particular microFIT systems, were guaranteed a simpler application procedure and faster turn-around time.
* The contract for payment of tariffs is for 20 years (40 years in the case of hydro generators), and is with the Ontario Power Authority, providing small generators with protection against changes in government policies

Several non-profit organizations have been active in supporting the implementation of the Green Energy Act with customized wikis to assist consumers and service providers, including SWITCH and OurPower (see Further Reading).

==MicroFIT==
{{For|the econometrics software package|Microfit}}
'''MicroFIT'''&lt;ref name="microfit"&gt;{{cite web|last=OPA|first=Canada|title=Welcome to microFIT|url=http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/|publisher=Ontario Power Authority|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[renewable energy]] [[microgeneration]] program (less than 10 [[kilowatt|kW]]) in the [[Province of Ontario]], launched in October 2009 following the Green Energy Act 2009, alongside [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) to provide incentives for landowners to generate [[wind power in Canada|wind]], [[solar power in Canada|solar]], [[hydroelectricity in Canada|hydroelectric]] or other clean energy to sell to the [[electrical grid]]. Most applications for microFIT generation have been for solar energy.

By December 16, 2009, microFIT issued its first 700 contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ENS|first=Toronto|title=Solar industry warns against two price system|url=http://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2681299-solar-industry-warns-against-two-price-system-/|accessdate=22 September 2013|newspaper=Environment News Service|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Many [[solar photovoltaic]] companies have become involved in microFIT installations; the solar panels are also suitable for schools and places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoE|first=Ontario|title=FIT and microFIT Program|url=http://www.energy.gov.on.ca/en/fit-and-microfit-program/|work=[[Ontario Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure]]|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects benefit home, farm or business owners by revenue generation, reduce [[Canada and the Kyoto Protocol|greenhouse gas emissions]], and approved applicants are guaranteed to receive revenue for twenty years.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Shelley|title=Is this solar-power program a money-saver?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/is-this-solar-power-program-a-money-saver/article2253375/|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Green Energy Act aims to create 50,000 new [[green-collar worker|green-collar]] jobs by 2012.

According to the [[Ontario Power Authority]], homeowners generating electricity receive a following share of contract price per [[kilowatt-hour]]:&lt;ref name="microfit"/&gt;

===Problems and challenges===
Installation costs often exceed $50,000 [[Canadian Dollar|CAN]], and only about 9,000&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; projects have connected to the grid by late 2011 out of over 42,000 applicants. Concerns over [[islanding]], lack of capacity and other problems have resulted in delays for many homeowners in installation, as connection points in some places have not been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Don|title=Hydro grid unfit for microFIT|url=http://www.betterfarming.com/online-news/hydro-grid-unfit-microfit-3814|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=Better Farming|date=February 11, 2011|agency=AgMedia Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuts to pay rates generated further controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Rob|title=Solar issue flares on eve of protest meeting|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/838660--solar-issue-flares-on-eve-of-protest-meeting|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Flanagan|first=Rob|title=Solar industry warns against two price system|url=http://www.guelphmercury.com/News/article/318276|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=Guelph Mercury|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on electricity price==
The signing of the GEA has corresponded with a dramatic increase in the Provincial Adjustment (now called the Global Adjustment). This is the cost added to the market price of electricity in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieso.com/imoweb/siteShared/electricity_bill.asp?sid=bi |title=IESO Global Adjustment |publisher=Ieso.com |date=2013-08-29 |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220082332/http://ieso.com/imoweb/siteShared/electricity_bill.asp?sid=bi |archivedate=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Adjustment is made up of several different cost buckets, but the biggest one is guaranteed energy rates for generators. This is the difference between the rates that were guaranteed to generators by the provincial government, and the wholesale electricity rate which they are paid each month. In recent years, the wholesale rate has ranged between 1 and 3 cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.en-powered.com/blog/what-is-the-global-adjustment | title=What is the Global Adjustment?|publisher=EnPowered | accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a June 2012 report by Bridgepoint Group Ltd. claimed most of this cost increase has been coincidental, rather than attributable to the fixed price for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgepointgroupltd.com/database/rte/files/Renewable%20Energy%20Facts.pdf |title=Renewable energy Facts |publisher=Bridgepointgroupltd.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Ontario Energy Board]] claimed in April 2012 that the highest generator of the increased cost of electricity is guaranteed payments to nuclear generators, followed, by gas, coal, and hydro generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/OEB/_Documents/MSP/MSP_Report_20120427.pdf |title=Market Surveillance Panel |publisher=Ontarioenergyboard.ca |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, the Ontario Government claimed that the combined cost of new renewable and conservation measures had been shown to account for only about 3% of total electricity cost in Ontario, although it was acknowledged that amount will rise as more green energy comes on line in future years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco.on.ca/blog/2011/03/22/the-true-cost-of-renewable-energy-and-conservation/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130407140859/http://www.eco.on.ca/blog/2011/03/22/the-true-cost-of-renewable-energy-and-conservation/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-07 |title=The True Cost of Renewable Energy and Conservation - Environmental Commissioner of OntarioEnvironmental Commissioner of Ontario |publisher=Eco.on.ca |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although the Green Energy Act promised to create 50,000 jobs, the Liberals admitted in 2013 that the act had only created 31,000 jobs. Critics charge that even confirming this number is problematic because the large majority are "indirect" as opposed to "direct" employment. However, a 2011 report by Jim McCarter, Ontario's Auditor General, found that a large majority of these jobs were in construction and would only exist for no more than three years. In addition, McCarter's report also cited [[Gabriel Calzada Alvarez|controversial reports]] from other countries which indicate "that for each job created through renewable energy programs, about two to four jobs are often lost in other sectors of the economy because of higher electricity prices" which has led critics to charge that the Green Energy Act has actually resulted in a net-loss of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/06/26/green-energy-job-claims-are-a-farce |title=Green energy job claims are a farce &amp;#124; Columnists &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by the conservative Fraser Institute stated that "wind power tends to be produced at times when it is least needed", and stated that:

{{cquote|Eighty percent of Ontario’s generation of electricity from wind power occurs at times and seasons so far out of phase with demand that the entire output is surplus and is exported at a substantial loss&amp;nbsp;... The Auditor-General of Ontario estimates that the province has already lost close to $2-billion on such exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/04/11/ontario-green-energy-act/ |title=Ontario paying a high price for Green Energy Act &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Fullcomment.nationalpost.com |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The price of exports is determined by allowing electricity producers to bid on export offers at the price at which they are willing to produce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ccanizar/papers/HamidOntario.pdf |title=The Operation of Ontario's Competitive Electricity Market: Overview, Experiences, and Lessons |last1=Zareipour |first1=Hamidreza |last2=Canizares |first2=Claudio A. |last3=Bhattacharya |first3=Kankar |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Systems |date=1 November 2007 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=1782–1793 |doi=10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the "green" manufacturing jobs created in Ontario has also been questioned. Writing in the ''[[National Post]]'', [[John Ivison]] noted in 2011 that Eclipsall Energy Corp, a newly created company in Scarborough, Ontario, that was touted by Premier Dalton McGuinty, only pays its workers 20% above minimum wage and that its manufacturing facility simply "assemble[s] glass and solar cells imported from Asia" (which allows it to qualify for the local content rules).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/09/16/john-ivison-mcguintys-clean-energy-poster-child-starving-for-work/ John Ivison: McGuinty’s clean energy poster child starving for work] by [[John Ivison]], ''[[National Post]]'' September 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/john-laforet/ontario-green-jobs_b_972088.html An Inconvenient Truth About Green Energy Jobs] by John Laforet, ''[[National Post]]'', September 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In May 2013, Ontario Energy Minister [[Bob Chiarelli]] announced that the made-in-Ontario content requirements for wind and solar projects would be scrapped, after the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) ruled that they were a violation of WTO regulations.&lt;ref&gt;As an interim measure, the local content rules were immediately reduced from 50-60% to 19%-28%.{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/05/30/ontario-green-energy-rules-to-give-municipalities-greater-control/ |title=Ontario green energy rules to give municipalities greater control &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/05/06/canada_loses_wto_appeal_in_renewable_energy_case_eu_says.html |title=Ontario Green Energy Act job incentives shot down by WTO &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Chiarelli announced that the province's future Feed-in-Tariff contacts will now be limited to smaller projects (less than 500&amp;nbsp;kW) and that a cap of 900 MW of additional capacity will be set for deployment by 2018. For larger projects, a competitive bidding system will be created, although projects that have already been contracted will not be affected by these changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/07/22/ontarios_backward_step_on_renewable_energy.html Ontario's backward step on renewable energy] by Leah Stokes, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/06/two-steps-forward-one-back-ontario-cancels-feed-in-tariffs-for-large-projects Two Steps Forward, One Back: Ontario Cancels Feed-in Tariffs for Large Projects] by Paul Gipe, ''Renewable Energy World'', June 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/245550/Renewables/Ontarios+Minister+Of+Energy+Announces+Changes+To+FeedIn+Tariff+Program Canada: Ontario's Minister Of Energy Announces Changes To Feed-In Tariff Program] by Thomas J. Timmins and Leslie Blumer (Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP), (published on Mondaq.com), June 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Chiarelli announced that the remaining local content requirements which had already been reduced, would be removed entirely some time in 2014 in order to comply with the WTO decision. As a result, concerns have been expressed that this will lead to the loss of "green" manufacturing jobs in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/4276197-keeping-green-energy-local-and-public/ Keeping green energy local and public] by Scott Sinclair and Stuart Trew, ''[[The Hamilton Spectator]]'', December 18, 20134.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Jeff Garrah, CEO of Kingston’s Economic Development Commission (KEDCO), cited the removal of the local content requirements  as the reason for the bankruptcy of Centennial Global Technology Inc., which in November 2013 had been described as Canada's "leading national solar panel distributor". It was reported that the removal of the local content rules had effectively "pull[ed] the plug on local production". Describing the Green Energy Act as "an ongoing soap opera", Garrah stated that municipalities across Ontario have become dismayed with how its solar and wind power provisions have been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhig.com/2014/02/11/lights-out-for-solar-panel-maker Lights out for solar panel maker] by Paul Schliesmann, ''[[Kingston Whig-Standard]]'', February 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ckwstv.com/2014/02/13/solar-panel-manufacturer-gone-bankrupt/ Solar Panel Manufacturer Gone Bankrupt] by Jamie Patterson, CKWS TV (Kingston), February 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907''' are a series of international [[treaty|treaties]] and declarations negotiated at two international peace conferences at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Along with the [[Geneva Conventions]], the Hague Conventions were among the first formal statements of the [[laws of war]] and [[war crime]]s in the body of secular [[international law]]. A third conference was planned for 1914 and later rescheduled for 1915, but it did not take place due to the start of [[World War I]].

==History==
The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 were the first [[Multilateralism|multilateral treaties]] that addressed the conduct of warfare and were largely based on the [[Lieber Code]], which was signed and issued by [[U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Forces of the United States on 24 April 1863, during the [[American Civil War]]. The Lieber Code was the first official comprehensive codified law that set out regulations for behavior in times of [[martial law]]; protection of [[civilian]]s and civilian property and punishment of [[Crime|transgression]]; [[deserters]], [[prisoners of war]], [[hostage]]s, and [[pillaging]]; [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s; [[Espionage|spies]]; [[truce]]s and [[prisoner exchange]]; parole of former [[Confederate States of America|rebel]] troops; the conditions of any [[armistice]], and respect for human life; [[assassination]] and murder of soldiers or citizens in hostile territory; and the status of individuals engaged in a state of civil war against the government. As such, the code was widely regarded as the best summary of the first [[Customary international law|customary]] [[laws and customs of war]] in the 19th century and was welcomed and adopted by military establishments of other nations. The 1874 Brussels Declaration (which was never adopted by all major nations) listed 56 articles that drew inspiration from the Lieber Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wggray/Teaching/His300/Handouts/Brussels-1874.html|title=Brussels Declaration 1874|publisher=purdue.edu|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Necessity, Proportionality and the Use of Force by States |author=Judith Gardam |date=21 July 2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-5211-7349-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the regulations in the Hague Conventions were borrowed heavily from the Lieber Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Genocide [2 volumes] |author=Paul R.

==Subject matter==
Both conferences included negotiations concerning [[disarmament]], the [[laws of war]] and [[war crime]]s. A major effort in both conferences was the creation of a binding international court for compulsory arbitration to settle international disputes, which was considered necessary to replace the institution of war. This effort, however, failed at both conferences; instead a voluntary forum for arbitration, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], was established. Most of the countries present, including the [[History of the United States (1865–1918)|United States]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Russia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Qing dynasty|China]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], favored a process for binding international arbitration, but the provision was vetoed by a few countries, led by [[German Empire|Germany]].

The '''First Hague Conference''' came from a proposal on 24 August 1898 by [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hag99-01.asp|title=The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907; a series of lectures delivered before the Johns Hopkins University in the year 1908|author=|date=|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas and Count [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov]], his [[foreign minister]], were instrumental in initiating the conference. The conference opened on 18 May 1899, the Tsar's birthday. The treaties, declarations, and final act of the conference were signed on 29 July of that year, and they [[entered into force]] on 4 September 1900. What is referred to as the Hague Convention of 1899 consisted of three main treaties and three additional declarations:

The '''Second Hague Conference''', in 1907, resulted in conventions containing only few major advancements from the 1899 Convention. However, the meeting of major powers did prefigure later 20th-century attempts at international cooperation.

The second conference was called at the suggestion of U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1904, but it was postponed because of the [[Russo-Japanese War|war between Russia and Japan]]. The Second Peace Conference was held from 15 June to 18 October 1907. The intent of the conference was to expand upon the 1899 Hague Convention by modifying some parts and adding new topics; in particular, the 1907 conference had an increased focus on [[naval warfare]]. The British attempted to secure limitation of armaments, but these efforts were defeated by the other powers, led by Germany, which feared a British attempt to stop the growth of the German fleet. Germany also rejected proposals for compulsory arbitration. However, the conference did enlarge the machinery for voluntary arbitration and established conventions regulating the collection of debts, rules of war, and the rights and obligations of neutrals.

The treaties, declarations, and final act of the Second Conference were signed on 18 October 1907; they entered into force on 26 January 1910. The 1907 Convention consists of thirteen treaties—of which twelve were ratified and entered into force—and one declaration:

===Participants===
The Brazilian delegation was led by [[Ruy Barbosa]], whose contributions are seen today by some analysts as essential for the defense of the principle of legal equality of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Robert A. (1974), Sovereign Equality Among States: The History of an Idea, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The British delegation included Sir [[Edward Fry]], Sir [[Ernest Satow]], the [[Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay|11th Lord Reay (Donald James Mackay)]] and Sir [[Henry Howard (diplomat)|Henry Howard]] as delegates, and [[Eyre Crowe]] as a technical delegate.&lt;ref&gt;The Proceedings of the Hague Peace Conferences, Oxford University Press, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian delegation was led by [[Friedrich Martens]]. The [[Uruguay]]an delegation was led by [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], a defender of the idea of compulsory arbitration.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}With [[Louis Renault (jurist)|Louis Renault]] and [[Léon Bourgeois]],  [[Paul-Henri-Benjamin d'Estournelles de Constant|Paul Henri d'Estournelles de Constant]] was a member of the French delegation for both the 1899 and 1907 delegations.  He later won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1909 for his efforts.

==Geneva Protocol to Hague Conventions==
{{main|Geneva Protocol}}
Though not negotiated in The Hague, the [[Geneva Protocol]] to the Hague Conventions is considered an addition to the Conventions. Signed on 17 June 1925 and entering into force on 8 February 1928, its single article permanently bans the use of all forms of [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]]. The protocol grew out of the increasing public outcry against chemical warfare following the use of [[mustard gas]] and similar agents in [[World War I]], and fears that chemical and biological warfare could lead to horrific consequences in any future war. The protocol has since been augmented by the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (1972) and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (1993).

==Legacy==
Many of the rules laid down at the Hague Conventions were violated in World War I. The [[Western Front (World War I)#1914—German invasion of France and Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]], for instance, was a violation of Convention (III) of 1907, which states that hostilities must not commence without explicit warning.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, James J., ''ABA Journal'' '''46(9)''', p. 978.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chemical warfare|Poison gas]] was introduced and used by all major belligerents throughout the war, in violation of the Declaration (IV, 2) of 1899 and Convention (IV) of 1907, which explicitly forbade the use of "poison or poisoned weapons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEH7KcpN-OcC&amp;pg=PT34 |title=The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir |author=Telford Taylor |date=1 November 1993 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=0-3168-3400-9 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1918, the German international law scholar and [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Walther Schücking]] called the assemblies the "international union of Hague conferences". Schücking saw the Hague conferences as a nucleus of a future international federation that was to meet at regular intervals to administer justice and develop international law procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, asserting that "a definite political union of the states of the world has been created with the First and Second Conferences".&lt;ref&gt;Walther Schücking, ''The international union of the Hague conferences'', Clarendon Press, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the judges of the military tribunal of the Trial of German Major War Criminals at [[Nuremberg Trials]] found that by 1939, the rules laid down in the 1907 Hague Convention were recognised by all civilised nations and were regarded as declaratory of the laws and customs of war. Under this post-war decision, a country did not have to have ratified the 1907 Hague Convention in order to be bound by them.&lt;ref name="Nurenberg-crimes"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgement: The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity], available from the [[Avalon Project]] at the [[Yale Law School]], Retrieved on 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their contents have largely been superseded by other treaties,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 continue to stand as symbols of the need for restrictions on war and the desirability of avoiding it altogether. Since 2000, Convention (I) of 1907 on the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes has been ratified by 20 additional states.&lt;ref name = 1907Iratifications/&gt;

In relation to the [[European Union]], '''harmonisation of law''' (or simply '''harmonisation''') is the process of creating common standards across the internal market.

Though each EU member State has the primary responsibility for the regulation of most matters within their jurisdiction and consequently each has its own laws. Harmonisation aims to:
* create consistency of laws, regulations, standards and practices, so that the same rules will apply to businesses that operate in more than one member State, and so that the businesses of one State do not obtain an economic advantage over those in another as a result of different rules.
* reduced compliance and regulatory burdens for businesses operating nationally or trans-nationally.

An objective of the European Union to achieve uniformity in laws of member states is to facilitate [[free trade]] and protect citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Peter E Nygh, Peter Butt (ed). (1997). ‘’Butterworth Australian LEGAL Dictionary’’. page 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmonisation is a process of ascertaining the admitted limits of international unification but does not necessarily amount to a vision of total uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;Menski, W. (2005). ‘’Comparative Law in a Global Context’’. London: Cambridge University Press. page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of harmonisation==
Harmonisation is usually not comprehensive but is relatively partial. That is, harmonisation of law doesn’t seek to create a sole authority of law on a particular subject. This is because measures to harmonise law cannot go further than that which is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‘’The Harmonization of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice’’. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmonisation is unsystematic. The [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] of the European Union do not focus on or contain comprehensive regulation of the entire law. The directives regulate some very specific issues and they regulate them only for particular situations or circumstances and only for particular types of parties. This is most prevalent in European Union contract law.&lt;ref name="Hesselink, M 2006 Page 50"&gt;Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‘’The Harmonization of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice’’. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmonisation generally takes place on two levels of governance, the overarching body and each of the members individually. Taking the European Union, the two levels are the European level and national level. Although both European and national legislators share the legislative responsibilities, neither of these bodies has final responsibility for the whole. Also, there is no superior political authority which has the final say on who is responsible for what, i.e. no overarching authority over the European and national legislators.  The European Court of Justice may however determine the extent of harmonization when determining cases.&lt;ref name="Hesselink, M 2006 Page 50"/&gt;

Harmonisation is dynamic and this is its most appealing feature.{{According to whom|date=June 2012}} The instruments of harmonization aim at change, in particular improving and establishing consistent conditions for the operation of legal principles.&lt;ref name="Hesselink, M 2006 Page 50"/&gt;

==Harmonisation versus unification==
The unification and harmonisation of laws are similar in the sense that both constitute the process of approximating several legal systems and both are also oriented towards some level of integration after transitioning from a condition characterized by diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clive M. Schmitthoff's Select Essays on International Trade Law|last=Cheng|first=Chia-Jui|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers/Graham &amp; Trotman|year=1988|isbn=9024737028|location=Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the two concepts are not same and this is best demonstrated in their differing characteristics. Fundamentally, unification and harmonisation have different aims. The former focuses on the goal of complete unity in substance and detail whereas the latter avoids complete uniformity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory and Practice of Harmonisation|last=Andenas|first=Mads|last2=Andersen|first2=Camilla|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781849800013|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is primarily concerned with the approximation of the fundamental principles of national laws.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In unification, for example, a new law completely replaces the national laws that have existed before. A harmonisation law on the European level does not exceed mere approximation&lt;ref&gt;Andenas &amp; Andersen, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; and leaves the national differences in place as long as they are not expressly regulated by the harmonising law.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, national laws merely become closer but not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Effectiveness of the Annulment of an Arbitral Award|last=Gharavi|first=Hamid|last2=Liebscher|first2=Christoph|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2002|isbn=9041117172|location=The Hague|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unification also focuses on substituting or combining two or more legal systems and replacing them with a single system. Harmonisation on the other hand seeks to co-ordinate different legal systems by “eliminating major differences and creating minimum requirements or standards”&lt;blockquote&gt;“Unlike unification which contemplates the substitution of two or more legal systems with one single system, harmonisation of law arises exclusively in comparative law literature, and especially in conjunction with interjurisdictional, private transactions. Harmonisation seeks to ‘effect an approximation or co-ordination of different legal provision or systems by eliminating major differences and creating minimum requirements or standards’&lt;ref&gt;Kamba (1974) 23 ICLQ 485, 501&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref&gt;de Cruz, P. (1999). ‘’Comparative Law in a Changing World’’. London: Cavendish Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harmonisation can be seen as a step towards unification and, in a way, harmonization aims or strives towards unification.

==Efforts to achieve harmonisation==
 harmonization is not a new concept. However, the problem is that no harmonisation project has ever reached completion. That is due to the nature of harmonisation, it is designed to incorporate different legal systems under a basic framework.

This is the appeal of harmonisation, it takes into account the local factors yet applies general principles to make a consistent framework of law. It generally incorporates local factors under a relatively unified framework.&lt;ref&gt;Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‘’The Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice’’. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 48&lt;/ref&gt; An example of harmonisation can be drawn from the European Union and the use of Directives.

Directives require transposition into the domestic legal system of the Member State in order to become effective. If a Member State fails to transpose the Directive in a timely manner or fails to do it at all, the Directive will take ‘direct effect’, that is, individuals are able to derive rights from that Directive directly despite not being transposed into domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Francovich and Others’’ [1991] ECR I-5357&lt;/ref&gt; A Directive could be transposed through enactment under legislation from the national parliament or through agreement by reference.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, T and Cooter RD. “Leximetrics: Why the Same Laws are Longer in Some Countries than Others”  (http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=alea), ‘’[[American Law and Economics Association]] Annual Meetings 2004, Paper 64’’. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The Directives are flexible to the extent that the national authorities of the Member States have the choice of the form and method of the implementation of the Directive. This takes into account the fact that Member States have differing legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Craig P and de Búrca, G. (3rd edn). ‘’EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials’’. Oxford University Press. Page 203. in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‘’The Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice’’. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 115&lt;/ref&gt; Hence this allows the establishment of a harmonised framework of laws whilst preserving the established national laws of each member. This is the major appeal of harmonisation over unification.

Harmonisation can be achieved in two ways, actively or passively. The most common is the active pursuit of harmonisation usually through the enactment of legislation which incorporates the harmonised principles into the local law. Passive harmonisation may occur through non-legislative agreements or a convergence of case law. So far, passive harmonisation is the least successful since the non-legislative agreements tend to be voluntary. The convergence of case law is more promising since:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“All that matters is that the courts of different European States achieve similar results in the same cases, regardless of which norms, doctrines or procedures they apply in order to reach this end.”&lt;ref&gt;Colombi Ciacchi, A. “Non-Legislative Harmonisation of Private Law under the European Constitution: The Case of Unfair Suretyships”, (2005). 13 ‘’European Review of Private Law’’ page 285 in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‘’The Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice’’. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 198&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Harmonisation and convergence of law==
Harmonisation is synonymous with convergence of the law however harmonisation is usually associated via active pursuit through enacting legislation whereas convergence is generally associated with a passive approach such as a natural convergence of law through custom and frequent use of harmonised principles.

The most prominent example of harmonisation in international law is [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law).

'''Holidays with Pay (Agriculture) Convention, 1952''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 1952, with the preamble stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to holidays with pay in agriculture,...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Revision ==
The principles contained in the convention were subsequently revised and included in the ILO Convention C132, [[Holidays with Pay Convention (Revised), 1970]].

== Ratifications==
As of 2013, the convention had been ratified by 46 states. Of the ratifying states, 12 had denounced the treaty by an automatic process which denounces the 1952 convention when the state ratifies a superseding treaty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">The '''Indian Claims Limitations Act of 1982''' (ICLA) is a [[United States]] federal [[statute of limitations]] that governs some types of claims by [[Native American tribes]] and claims by the federal government on behalf of tribes.

==Previous statutes==
Previous statutes of limitations had only applied to suits by non-Indian landowners against the federal government.&lt;ref name="covelo"&gt;''Covelo Indian Community v. Watt'', 551 F. Supp. 366, 369 (D.D.C. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress enacted the first statute of limitations applicable to Native American land claims in 1966.&lt;ref name="a1966"&gt;Act of July 18, 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-505, 80 Stat. 304 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415); see also S. Rep. No. 1328, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  The limitation was six years for contract and trespass claims, and three years for tort claims.&lt;ref name="a1966"/&gt;  There was no limitation for land title claims.&lt;ref name="a1966"/&gt;  Pre-1966 claims were deemed to have [[accrue]]d on July 18, 1966, the date of passage.&lt;ref name="a1966"/&gt;

Under the 1966 act, pre-1966 trespass claims would have become barred on July 18, 1972.  That day, Congress extended the limitations period for pre-1966 claims an additional five years, to July 18, 1977.&lt;ref name="a1972"&gt;Act of July 18, 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-353, 86 Stat. 499 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415); see also Act of October 16, 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-385, 86 Stat. 803 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1972 acts also broadened the scope of the applicability of the limitation, to all civil actions brought by Indian tribes or individuals based upon contract, tort, or trespass theories.&lt;ref name="a1972"/&gt;

Under the 1972 acts, pre-1966 trespass claims would have become barred in 1977.  That year, Congress extended the limitations period again, until April 1, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Act of August 15, 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-103, 91 Stat. 842 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1977 act, pre-1966 trespass claims would have become parred on April 1, 1980.  Four days before that deadline, Congress again extended the limitations period, until December 31, 1982.&lt;ref name="a1980"&gt;Act of March 27, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-217, 94 Stat. 126 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415); see also S. Rep. No. 96-569, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  That act required the Interior Secretary to determine which claims should not be litigated, and submit proposals to resolve those claims legislatively by June 30, 1981.&lt;ref name="a1980"/&gt;  The Secretary submitted zero proposals by this deadline, but did identify 17,000 pre-1962 claims by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;LeFave, 1984, at 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==

In 1982, for the first time, the Interior and Justice Departments failed to endorse an extension.&lt;ref&gt;LeFave, 1984, at 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Native American Rights Fund]] (NARF) initiated a [[class action]] suit on behalf of all Indians and tribes with pre-1966 claims.&lt;ref name="covello"&gt;''Covelo Indian Community v. Watt'', 551 F. Supp. 366 (D.D.C. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 17, 1982, NARF obtained an order requiring the government to either submit a legislative proposal within 30 days or to initiate the 17,000 lawsuits itself before the statute expired.&lt;ref name="covello"/&gt;  The [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]'s decision loomed large in the Congressional debates.&lt;ref&gt;128 Cong. Rec. H9595-99 (1982) (remarks of Reps. Udall, Bereuter, and Daschle); H.R. Rep. No. 97-954, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 4&amp;ndash;6 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the pre-1966 claims would have become barred, Congress extended the limitations period a final time.&lt;ref name="a1982"&gt;Act of December 30, 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-394, 96 Stat. 1966 (codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2415) ["Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982"].&lt;/ref&gt;  This eliminated the statute of limitations entirely for some types of claims.&lt;ref&gt;LeFave, 1984, at 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions and interpretation==

The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 required the Interior Secretary to publish in the ''[[Federal Register]]'', within 90 days, identify all pre-1966 claims, identify which pre-1966 claims were potentially meritorious, and identify which claims were suitable for litigation or legislation; further, Indian tribes and individuals were given 180 days thereafter to comment on the Secretary's findings.&lt;ref name="a1982"/&gt;  The Secretary did so,&lt;ref name="list1"&gt;44 Fed. Reg. 13,698&amp;ndash;13,919 (March 31, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and modified the list in response to comments.&lt;ref&gt;44 Fed. Reg. 51,204 (Nov. 7, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;  The limitations status of pre-1966 claims depends in part upon those lists:
*Claims excluded from both lists expired on January 6, 1984;&lt;ref name="l76"&gt;LeFave, 1984, at 76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Claims on either list but not deemed suitable for litigation or legislation expired on November 7, 1984;&lt;ref name="l76"/&gt;
*Claims on either list and identified as suitable for legislation expired three years after the submission of legislation or a legislative report;&lt;ref name="l77"&gt;LeFave, 1984, at 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Claims on either list and deemed suitable for litigation are exempt from any statute of limitations, unless de-listed by the Secretary, in which case they are barred one year from the publication of the removal;&lt;ref name="l77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oneidaII"/&gt;

The status of other claims does not depend upon these lists:
*[[Quiet title]] claims are unaffected by the Act.&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C. § 2415(c) ("Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the time for bringing an action to establish the title to, or right of possession of, real or personal property.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court has held that the separate, 12-year statute of limitations contained in the [[Quiet Title Act]] applies to actions by [[Dawes Act|allottees]] under that Act.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Mottaz'', 476 U.S. 834, 848 n.10 (1986); see also ''Nichols v. Rysavy'', 809 F.2d 1317 (8th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Claims against the federal government are unaffected by the Act.&lt;ref name="l77"/&gt;
*Post-1966 claims are unaffected by the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''Washoe Tribe of Nevada v. Southwest Gas Corp.'', 2000 WL 665605 (D. Nev. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State]]'' (1985) ["''Oneida II''"], the 1982 Act "for the first time imposed a statute of limitations on certain tort and contract claims for damages brought by individual Indians and Indian tribes."&lt;ref name="oneidaII"&gt;''[[Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State]]'', 470 U.S. 226, 242&amp;ndash;44 &amp; n.15 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Oneida II'', considering the Act, observed:  "[T]he statutory framework adopted in 1982 presumes the existence of an Indian right of action not otherwise subject to any statute of limitations. It would be a violation of Congress' will were we to hold that a state statute of limitations period should be borrowed in these circumstances."&lt;ref name="oneidaII"/&gt;  The claims involved in ''Oneida II'' was included on the first list, although it need not have been because the Oneida's suit was filed in 1970, before the law.&lt;ref name="oneidaII"/&gt;

In ''[[Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Pataki]]'' (2005), where the Second Circuit held that [[laches (equity)|laches]] bars all aboriginal title claims sounding in ejectment or trespass, the Cayuga's claim was on the supplemental list.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y. v. Pataki]]'', 413 F.3d 266, 280&amp;ndash;81 (2d Cir. 2005) (Hall, District Judge, dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Interior Department's list==
The Interior Department's initial list was 222 pages long.&lt;ref name="list1"/&gt;

The initial list contained more than 17,000 claims by allottees relating to the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]] in [[Minnesota]], totaling more than 100,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;''Manypenny v. United States'', 948 F.2d 1057 (8th Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress responded with the White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act (1986).&lt;ref&gt;White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 99-264, 100 Stat. 61 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet governance''' is the development and application of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the [[Internet]]. This article describes how the Internet was and is currently governed, some of the controversies that occurred along the way, and the ongoing debates about how the Internet should or should not be governed in the future.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=There May Soon Be Three Internets. America’s Won’t Necessarily Be the Best. - A breakup of the web grants privacy, security and freedom to some, and not so much to others. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html |date=15 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet governance should not be confused with [[e-governance]], which refers to governments' use of technology to carry out their governing duties.

==Background==
{{main |Internet}}

No one person, company, organization or government runs the Internet. It is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder]] network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.

[[File:Who-Runs-the-Internet-graphic.png|thumb|Who-Runs-the-Internet-graphic]]

However, to help ensure interoperability, several key technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and the principal [[namespace]]s are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), which is headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]]. ICANN oversees the assignment of globally unique identifiers on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, [[Internet protocol address]]es, application [[Port (computer networking)|port]] numbers in the [[transport protocol]]s, and many other parameters. This seeks to create a globally unified namespace to ensure the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet's technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. However, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], continues to have final approval over changes to the [[DNS root zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Hans. (2004). [http://www.ip3.gatech.edu/research/KLEIN_ICANN%2BSovereignty.doc "ICANN and Non-Territorial Sovereignty: Government Without the Nation State."] Internet and Public Policy Project. Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Packard |first= Ashley |title= Digital Media Law |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-1-4051-8169-3 |pages= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This authority over the root zone file makes ICANN one of a few bodies with global, centralized influence over the otherwise distributed Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mueller |first= Milton L. |title= Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-0-262-01459-5 |pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 30 September 2009 Affirmation of Commitments by the Department of Commerce and ICANN, the Department of Commerce finally affirmed that a "private coordinating process…is best able to flexibly meet the changing needs of the Internet and of Internet users" (para. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affirmation of Commitments by the United States Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|url=http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements/aoc/affirmation-of-commitments-30sep09-en.htm|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ICANN itself interpreted this as a declaration of its independence, scholars still point out that this is not yet the case. Considering that the U.S. Department of Commerce can unilaterally terminate the Affirmation of Commitments with ICANN, the authority of DNS administration is likewise seen as revocable and derived from a single State, namely the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woltag|first=Johann-Christoph|title=Internet|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law|isbn=978-0-19-965791-9|editor=Rüdiger Wolfrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical underpinning and standardization of the Internet's core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS), held in [[Tunis]], established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to open an ongoing, non-binding conversation among multiple stakeholders about the future of Internet governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mueller |first= Milton L. |title= Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance |publisher=MIT Press |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-0-262-01459-5 |pages= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since WSIS, the term "Internet governance" has been broadened beyond narrow technical concerns to include a wider range of Internet-related policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mueller |first= Milton L. |title=''Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance'' |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-0-262-01459-5 |pages= 79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeNardis, Laura, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1678343 The Emerging Field of Internet Governance] (17 September 2010). Yale Information Society Project Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of Internet governance has been contested by differing groups across political and ideological lines.&lt;ref&gt;Malte Ziewitz/Christian Pentzold, [http://nms.sagepub.com/content/16/2/306 "In search of internet governance: Performing order in digitally networked environments"], New Media &amp; Society 16 (2014): pp. 306-322.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main debates concerns the authority and participation of certain actors, such as national governments, corporate entities and civil society, to play a role in the Internet's governance.

A working group established after a UN-initiated [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) proposed the following definition of Internet governance as part of its June 2005 report:
:''Internet governance is the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgig.org/docs/WGIGREPORT.pdf "Report of the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG)"], June 2005, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor [[Yochai Benkler]] developed a conceptualization of Internet governance by the idea of three "layers" of governance:&lt;ref&gt;Yochai Benkler, [http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v52/no3/benkler1.pdf "From Consumers to Users: Shifting the Deeper Structures of Regulation Towards Sustainable Commons and User Access"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309124909/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v52/no3/benkler1.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}, 52 ''Fed. Comm. L.J.'' 561, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical infrastructure layer (through which information travels)
* Code or logical layer (controls the infrastructure)
* Content layer (contains the information signaled through the network)

Professors Jovan Kurbalija and Laura DeNardis also offer comprehensive definitions to "Internet Governance". According to Kurbalija, the broad approach to Internet Governance goes "beyond Internet infrastructural aspects and address other legal, economic, developmental, and sociocultural issues";&lt;ref&gt;Jovan Kurbalija, [http://archive1.diplomacy.edu/poolbin.asp?IDPool=1484 "An Introduction to Internet Governance"], 5 ed, DiploFoundation (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; along similar lines, DeNardis argues that "Internet Governance generally refers to policy and technical coordination issues related to the exchange of information over the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;Laura DeNardis, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678343 "The Emerging Field of Internet Governance"] (17 September 2010), Yale Information Society Project Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more policy-relevant questions today is exactly whether the regulatory responses are appropriate to police the content delivered through the Internet: it includes important rules for the improvement of Internet safety and for dealing with threats such as cyber-bullying, copyright infringement, data protection and other illegal or disruptive activities.&lt;ref&gt;On this, see e.g. Nicola Lucchi, [http://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Lucchi_Final.pdf "Internet Content Governace &amp; Human Rights"] 16 Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment and Technology Law Vol. 16, n. 4 (2014) 809-856.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main |History of the Internet}}

To understand how the Internet is managed today, it is necessary to know a little of its history. The original [[ARPANET]] is one of the components which eventually evolved to become the Internet. As its name suggests the ARPANET was sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] within the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA115440|title=A History of the ARPANET: The First Decade |publisher=[[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman Inc.]] |location=Arlington, VA |date=1 April 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of ARPANET, a numbered series of [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) memos documented technical decisions and methods of working as they evolved. The standards of today's Internet are still documented by RFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ia_rfc.htm |title=RFC's, Internet Request For Comments |publisher=Livinginternet.com |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1984 and 1986 the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) created the [[NSFNET]] backbone, using [[TCP/IP]], to connect their supercomputing facilities. NSFNET became a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the supercomputing centers to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 19877-1995''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181738/http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf |date=10 February 2015 }}, Karen D. Frazer, Merit Network, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The combined networks became generally known as the Internet. By the end of 1989, Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK were connected to the Internet, which had grown to contain more than 160,000 hosts.

In 1990, the ARPANET was formally terminated. In 1991 the NSF began to relax its restrictions on commercial use on NSFNET and commercial network providers began to interconnect. The final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic ended on 30 April 1995, when the NSF ended its sponsorship of the NSFNET Backbone Service and the service ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=1 January 2016 }}, Susan R. Harris, Ph.D., and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Internet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today almost all Internet infrastructure in the United States, and large portion in other countries, is provided and owned by the private sector. Traffic is exchanged between these networks, at major interconnection points, in accordance with established Internet standards and commercial agreements.

==Governors==

During 1979 the Internet Configuration Control Board was founded by [[DARPA]] to oversee the network's development. During 1984 it was renamed the Internet Advisory Board ([[Internet Architecture Board|IAB]]), and during 1986 it became the Internet Activities Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iab.org/about/history.html|title=History page from the IAB website|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2850}}: Charter of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) was formed during 1986 by the U.S. government to develop and promote Internet standards. It consisted  initially of researchers, but by the end of the year participation was available to anyone, and its business was performed largely by email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/internet-governance/internet-technical-community/ietf |title=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) |date=10 Aug 2012 |publisher=RIPE NCC |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1208.txt |title=A Glossary of Networking Terms |author= O. Jacobsen, D. Lynch, Interop, Inc. |date=March 1991 |publisher=IETF |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early days of the network until his death during 1998, [[Jon Postel]] oversaw address allocation and other Internet protocol numbering and assignments in his capacity as Director of the Computer Networks Division at the [[Information Sciences Institute]] of the [[University of Southern California]], under a contract from the Department of Defense. This function eventually became known as the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and as it expanded to include management of the global Domain Name System ([[Domain name system|DNS]]) root servers, a small organization grew. Postel also served as [[Request for Comments|RFC]] Editor.

Allocation of IP addresses was delegated to five [[Regional Internet Registry|Regional Internet Registries]] (RIRs):
*[[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for North America
*[[RIPE|Réseaux IP Européens - Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE NCC) for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia
*[[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC) for Asia and the Pacific region
*[[Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]] (LACNIC) for Latin America and the Caribbean region
* [[African network information center|African Network Information Center]] (AfriNIC) was created in 2004 to manage allocations for Africa
After Jon Postel's death in 1998, IANA became part of ICANN, a California [[Not-for-profit corporation|nonprofit]] established in September 1998 by the U.S. government and awarded a contract by the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]]. Initially two board members were elected by the Internet community at large, though this was changed by the rest of the board in 2002 in a poorly attended public meeting in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/437235/article-1G1-106850793/net-governance-chief-step-down-next-year "Net governance chief will step down next year"], David McGuire, Washingtonpost.com, 28 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the [[Internet Society]] (ISOC) was founded, with a mission to "assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/isochistory.shtml |title=Internet Society (ISOC) All About The Internet: History of the Internet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127114016/http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/isochistory.shtml |archive-date=27 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as corporations, organizations, governments, and universities. The IAB was renamed the [[Internet Architecture Board|Internet ''Architecture'' Board]], and became part of ISOC. The Internet Engineering Task Force also became part of the ISOC. The IETF is overseen currently by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), and longer-term research is carried on by the [[Internet Research Task Force]] and overseen by the [[Internet Research Steering Group]].

At the first [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[Geneva]] in 2003, the topic of Internet governance was discussed. ICANN's status as a private corporation under contract to the U.S. government created controversy among other governments, especially Brazil, China, South Africa, and some Arab states. Since no general agreement existed even on the definition of what comprised Internet governance, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] initiated a [[Working Group on Internet Governance]] ([[Working Group on Internet Governance|WGIG]]) to clarify the issues and report before the second part of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Tunis]] 2005. After much controversial debate, during which the U.S. delegation refused to consider surrendering the U.S. control of the Root Zone file, participants agreed on a compromise to allow for wider international debate on the policy principles. They agreed to establish an [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF), to be convened by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] before the end of the second quarter of 2006. The [[Greece|Greek]] government volunteered to host the first such meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200511210250.html "Internet governance: U.S., Developing countries strike deal"], Innocent Gore, Africa News Service, 21 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual global IGFs have been held since 2006, with the Forum renewed for five years by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan045268.pdf|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 65/141.

== Media Freedom ==

Media, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of information]] have been long recognized as principles of internet governance, included in the 2003 Geneva Declaration and 2005 Tunis Commitment of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS). Given the crossborder, decentralized nature of the internet, an enabling environment for media freedom in the [[Information Age|digital age]] requires global [[Multi-stakeholder governance|multi-stakeholder cooperation]] and shared respect for [[human rights]]. In broad terms, two different visions have been seen to shape global internet governance debates in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, William J., Vinton G. Cerf, and Wolfgang Kleinwachter. 2016.

On the one hand, some national governments, particularly in the Central and Eastern [[European Union|European]] and [[Asia-Pacific]] regions, have emphasized state [[sovereignty]] as an organizing premise of national and global internet governance. In some regions, data localization laws—requiring that data be stored, processed and circulated within a given jurisdiction—have been introduced to keep citizens’ personal data in the country, both to retain regulatory authority over such data and to strengthen the case for greater jurisdiction. Countries in the Central and Eastern European, Asia-Pacific, and [[Africa]]n regions all have legislation requiring some localization.&lt;ref&gt;Daskal, Jennifer C. 2015. The Un-Territoriality of Data. The Yale Law Journal,125. Available at &lt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers. cfm?abstract_id=2578229&gt;. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Data localization requirements increase the likelihood of multiple standards and the fragmentation of the internet, limiting the free flow of information, and in some cases increasing the potential for surveillance, which in turn impacts on freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B0BC365_3_169&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the dominant practice has been towards a unified, universal internet with broadly shared norms and principles. The [[NetMundial Initiative|NETmundial]] meeting, held in [[Brazil]] in 2014, produced a [[Multi-stakeholder governance|multistakeholder]] statement the ‘internet should continue to be a globally coherent, interconnected, stable, unfragmented, scalable and accessible network-of-networks.’&lt;ref&gt;NETmundial. 2014. NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement. NETmundial. Available at &lt;http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundialMultistakeholder-Document.pdf&gt;. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, UNESCO’s General Conference endorsed the concept of [[Internet Universality]] and the ‘ROAM Principles’, which state that the internet should be ‘(i) Human Rights-based (ii) Open, (iii) Accessible to all, and (iv) Nurtured by [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Multistakeholder participation]]’. The ROAM Principles combine standards for process (multi-stakeholderism to avoid potential capture of the internet by a single power center with corresponding risks), with recommendations about substance (what those principles should be). The fundamental position is for a global internet where ROAM principles frame regional, national and local diversities. In this context, significant objectives are media freedom, network interoperability, [[net neutrality]] and the free flow of information (minimal barriers to the rights to receive and impart information across borders, and any limitations to accord with international standards).&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016b. Internet Universality R.O.A.M Principles advocated at the 2nd General Assembly of the MAPPING Project | United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

In a study of 30 key initiatives aimed at establishing a bill of rights online during the period between 1999 and 2015, researchers at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center found that the right to freedom of expression online was protected in more documents (26) than any other right.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Lex, Dennis Redeker, and Urs Gasser. 2015. Towards Digital Constitutionalism? Mapping Attempts to Craft an Internet Bill of Rights. Berkman Center Research Publication (2015–15): 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN General Assembly committed itself to multistakeholderism in December 2015 through a resolution extending the WSIS process and IGF mandate for an additional decade.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2015a.

Available at &lt;http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/&lt;/ref&gt;  It further underlined the importance of human rights and media-related issues such as the [[safety of journalists]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Growing support for the multistakeholder model was also observed in the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) stewardship transition, in which oversight of the internet’s addressing system shifted from a contract with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to a new private sector entity with new multi-stakeholder accountability mechanisms. Another support of the multistakeholder approach has been the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Michael N., ed. 2017. Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the updated and considerably expanded second edition of the 2013 [[Tallinn Manual]] on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Michael N., ed. 2013.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual conferences linked to the [[Convention on Cybercrime|Budapest Convention on Cybercrime]] and meetings of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, mandated by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], have deliberated on norms such as protection of critical infrastructure and the application of international law to cyberspace.

==Globalization and governance controversy==

===Role of ICANN and the U.S. Department of Commerce===
The position of the [[US Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] as the controller of some aspects of the Internet gradually attracted criticism from those who felt that control should be more international. A hands-off philosophy by the Department of Commerce helped limit this criticism, but this was undermined in 2005 when the Bush administration intervened to help kill the [[.xxx]] top-level domain proposal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-5833764.html "Bush administration objects to .xxx domains"], Declan McCullagh, ''CNet News'', 15 August 205. Retrieved 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and, much more severely, following the [[2013 global surveillance disclosures|2013 disclosures of mass surveillance]] by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=IGF2013-Summary&gt;[http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/Chair%27s%20Summary%20IGF%202013%20Final.Nov1v1.pdf "Chair's Summary"], Eighth Meeting of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), Bali, Indonesia, 22–25 October 2013. Retrieved 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the IANA functions were handed over to ICANN, a new U.S. nonprofit, controversy increased. ICANN's decision-making process was criticised by some observers as being secretive and unaccountable. When the directors' posts which had previously been elected by the "at-large" community of Internet users were abolished, some feared that ICANN would become illegitimate and its qualifications questionable, due to the fact that it was now losing the aspect of being a neutral governing body. ICANN stated that it was merely streamlining decision-making, and developing a structure suitable for the modern Internet. On 1 October 2015, following a community-led process spanning months, the stewardship of the IANA functions were transitioned to the global Internet community.&lt;ref name="IANA Functions transition"&gt;[https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-10-01-en "Stewardship of IANA Functions Transitions to Global Internet Community as Contract with U.S. Government Ends"], ICANN, 1 October 2016. Retrieved 26 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other topics of controversy included the creation and control of [[generic top-level domains]] (.com, .org, and possible new ones, such as .biz or .xxx), the control of [[Country code domain|country-code domain]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, recent proposals for a large increase in ICANN's budget and responsibilities, and a proposed "domain tax" to pay for the increase.

There were also suggestions that individual governments should have more control, or that the [[International Telecommunication Union]] or the [[United Nations]] should have a function in Internet governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsmith/Wu|first=Jack/Tim|title=Who Controls the Internet?

===IBSA proposal (2011)===
One controversial proposal to this effect, resulting from a September 2011 summit between India, Brazil, and South Africa (IBSA), would seek to move internet governance into a "UN Committee on Internet-Related Policy" (UN-CIRP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muzzlers of the Free Internet|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2220692/How-India-helped-bunch-bureaucrats-custodians-Internet.html|publisher=Mail Today (New Delhi, India)|accessdate=15 March 2013|location=London|first=Sandeep|last=Bamzai|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBSA-2011&gt;[http://www.culturalivre.org.br/artigos/IBSA_recommendations_Internet_Governance.pdf "Recommendations from the IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa) Multistakeholder meeting on Global Internet Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063245/http://www.culturalivre.org.br/artigos/IBSA_recommendations_Internet_Governance.pdf |date=5 October 2011 }}, 1–2 September 2011, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&lt;/ref&gt; The move was a reaction to a perception that the principles of the 2005 Tunis Agenda for the Information Society have not been met.&lt;ref name=IBSA-2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html "Tunis Agenda for the Information Society"], World Summit on the Information Society, 18 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for the subordination of independent technical organizations such as ICANN and the ITU to a political organization operating under the auspices of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=IBSA-2011/&gt; After outrage from India’s civil society and media, the Indian government backed away from the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaul|first=Mahima|title=India changes its internet governance position — backs away from UN proposal|url=http://uncut.indexoncensorship.org/2012/10/india-internet-governance/|publisher=UNCUT|accessdate=15 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094900/http://uncut.indexoncensorship.org/2012/10/india-internet-governance/|archive-date=3 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (2013)===
On 7 October 2013 the [[Montevideo Statement|Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation]] was released by the leaders of a number of organizations involved in coordinating the Internet's global technical infrastructure, loosely known as the "I*" (or "I-star") group. Among other things, the statement "expressed strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance" and "called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing". This desire to move away from a United States centric approach is seen as a reaction to the ongoing [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA surveillance scandal]]. The statement was signed by the heads of the [[ICANN|Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], the [[Internet Architecture Board]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], the [[Internet Society]], and the five [[Regional Internet Registries|regional Internet address registries]] ([[African Network Information Center]], [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]], [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]], [[Latin America and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]], and [[Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation], ICANN, 7 October 2013.

===Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NetMundial) (2013)===
In October 2013, Fadi Chehadé, former President and CEO of ICANN, met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia. Upon Chehadé's invitation, the two announced that Brazil would host an international summit on Internet governance in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJmFAMJNx94 "Entrevista com Fadi Chehadé: Brasil sediará encontro mundial de governança da internet em 2014"], Palácio do Planalto, 9 October 2013.

The "[[Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance]] (NETMundial)" will include representatives of government, industry, civil society, and academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/brazil-internet-summit-fight-nsa-006/ "Brazil to host global internet summit in ongoing fight against NSA surveillance"], RT News, 10 October 2013.

NetMundial managed to convene a large number of global actors to produce a consensus statement on internet governance principles and a roadmap for the future evolution of the internet governance ecosystem. NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement – the outcome of the Meeting – was elaborated in an open and participatory manner, by means of successive consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf|title=NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement|last=|first=|date=2014-04-24|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus should be qualified in that even though the statement was adopted by consensus, some participants, specifically the Russian Federation, India, Cuba, and ARTICLE 19, representing some participants from civil society expressed some dissent with its contents and the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETMundial-23April2014-Closing-Session-en.pdf|title="NETmundial–Closing Session" (p 21-24)|last=|first=|date=2014-09-06|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel–Jordan peace treaty''' or in full '''"Treaty of Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"''' ({{lang-he|הסכם השלום בין ישראל לירדן}}; [[Hebrew transliteration|transliterated]]: ''Heskem Ha-Shalom beyn Yisra'el Le-Yarden''; {{lang-ar|معاهدة السلام الأردنية الإسرائيلية}}; [[Arabic transliteration]]: ''Mu'ahadat as-Salaam al-'Urdunniyah al-Isra'yliyah''), sometimes referred to as ''Wadi Araba Treaty'', was signed in 1994. The signing ceremony took place at the southern border crossing of [[Arabah]] on 26 October 1994. [[Jordan]] was the second [[Arab world|Arab]] country, after [[Egypt]], to sign a peace accord with [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1026.html | title=Israel and Jordan Sign a Peace Accord | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | author=[[Clyde Haberman]] | date=27 October 1994 | accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty settled [[Israel–Jordan relations|relations between the two countries]], adjusted land and water disputes, and provided for broad cooperation in tourism and trade. It included a pledge that neither [[Jordan]] nor [[Israel]] would allow its territory to become a staging ground for military strikes by a third country.

==History==
{{History of Jordan}}

In 1987 Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister [[Shimon Peres]] and King Hussein tried secretly to arrange a peace agreement in which Israel would concede the West Bank to Jordan. The two signed an [[Peres-Hussein London Agreement|agreement]] defining a framework for a Middle Eastern peace conference. The proposal was not consummated due to Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]]'s objection. The following year [[Jordan]] abandoned its claim to the West Bank in favor of a peaceful resolution between Israel and the PLO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_periods9.html ''Disengagement from the West Bank'']. www.kinghussein.gov.jo. Retrieved December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/world/hussein-surrenders-claims-west-bank-plo-us-peace-plan-jeopardy-internal-tensions.html ''Hussein surrenders claims on West Bank to the P.L.O.; U.S. peace plan in jeopardy; Internal Tensions'']. John Kifner, New York Times, 1 August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions began in 1994. [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] informed King Hussein that after the [[Oslo Accords]] with the PLO, Jordan might be "left out of the big game". Hussein consulted with [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] and [[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]]. Mubarak encouraged him, but Assad told him only to "talk" and not sign any accord. [[United States|U.S.]] President [[Bill Clinton]] pressured Hussein to start peace negotiations and to sign a peace treaty with Israel and promised him that Jordan's debts would be forgiven. The efforts succeeded and Jordan signed a nonbelligerency agreement with Israel. Rabin, Hussein and Clinton signed the Washington Declaration in [[Washington, DC]], on 25 July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pal06.asp ''The Washington Declaration :Israel – Jordan – The United States; July 25th, 1994'']. On the Avalon project&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration says that Israel and Jordan ended the official state of enmity and would start negotiations in order to achieve an "end to bloodshed and sorrow" and a just and lasting peace.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Signing ==
On 26 October 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the [[peace treaty]]&lt;ref name=Israel-Jordan_peace&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/peace-jordan_eng.htm ''Treaty of Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'']. 26 October 1994. On the Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; in a ceremony held in the Arava valley of Israel, north of [[Eilat]] and near the Jordanian border. Prime Minister Rabin and Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the treaty and the [[President of Israel]] [[Ezer Weizman]] shook hands with [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]]. Clinton observed, accompanied by US Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]]. Thousands of colorful [[balloons]] released into the sky ended the event.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Egypt]] welcomed the agreement while [[Syria]] ignored it. The Lebanese militia group [[Hezbollah]] resisted the treaty and 20 minutes prior to the ceremony launched [[Mortar (artillery)|mortar]] and rocket attacks against northern [[Galilee]] towns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1026.html THE JORDAN-ISRAEL ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW; ISRAEL AND JORDAN SIGN A PEACE ACCORD], New York Times, 26 October 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli residents, who were forced to evacuate the towns for the safety of shelters, took with them transistor [[radio]]s and mobile TVs in order not to miss the historical moment of signing a second peace treaty with an [[Arab]] state.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Content ==

The Peace treaty consists of a preamble, 30 articles, 5 annexes, and agreed minutes. It settles issues about territory, security, water, and co-operation on a range of subjects.&lt;ref name=Israel-Jordan_peace/&gt;

'''Annex I''' concerns borders and sovereignty. Section ''Annex I (a)'' establishes an "administrative boundary" between Jordan and the West Bank, occupied by Israel in 1967, without prejudice to the status of that territory. Israel recognises Jordan's sovereignty over the [[Naharayim|Naharayim/Baqura area]] (including [[Island of Peace|Peace Island]]) and the [[Tzofar|Zofar/Al-Ghamr area]].&lt;ref name=peacetreaty_annex_1&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/annex1.html ''Annex I''].jewishvirtuallibrary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Annex II''' concerns water and related matters. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty, Jordan and Israel agreed to establish a ''"Joint Water Committee"'' (Article VII).&lt;ref name=peacetreaty_annex_2&gt;[http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Peace/Guide/Pages/Israel-Jordan%20Peace%20Treaty%20Annex%20II.aspx ''Annex II—Water and Related Matters'']. IMFA, 25 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Annex III''' concerns crime and drugs.&lt;ref name=peacetreaty_annex_3&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/annex3.html ''Annex III—Combatting Crime and Drugs''].jewishvirtuallibrary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The '''''Agreed Minutes''''' of the treaty give some details about the implementation of the peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/agmins.html|title=Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty--Agreed Minutes|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main principles ===

#'''Borders''': The international boundary between Israel and Jordan follows the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers, the Dead Sea, the Emek Ha'Arava/Wadi Araba, and the Gulf of Aqaba.&lt;ref name=peacetreaty_annex_1 /&gt; The section of the line that separated Jordan from the West Bank was stipulated as "without prejudice to the status of [that] territory."&lt;ref name=peacetreaty_annex_1 /&gt;
#'''Diplomatic relations and co-operation''': The Parties agreed to establish full [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] and consular relations and to exchange resident [[embassy|embassies]], grant tourists [[Visa (document)|visas]], open air travel and seaports, establish a [[free trade]] zone and an [[industrial park]] in the Arava. The agreement prohibits hostile [[propaganda]].
#'''Security and defense''': Each country promised respect for the sovereignty and territory of each side, to not enter the other's territory without permission, and to cooperate against [[terrorism]]. This included thwarting border attacks, smuggling, preventing any hostile attack against the other and not cooperating with any terrorist organization against the other.
# '''Jerusalem''': Article 9 links the Peace Treaty to the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. Israel recognized the [[Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites|special role of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem]] and committed itself to give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines in negotiations on the permanent status.
# '''Water''': Israel agreed to give Jordan {{convert|50,000,000|m3}} of water each year and for Jordan to own 75% of the water from the [[Yarmouk River]]. Both countries could develop other water resources and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] and agreed to help each other survive droughts. Israel also agreed to help Jordan use desalination technology in order to find additional water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Lawrence|author2=Shafiqul Islam|title=Water Diplomacy: Creating Value and Building Trust in Transboundary Water Negotiations|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|year=2012|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2012/water-diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Palestinian refugees''': Israel and Jordan agreed to cooperate to help the refugees, including a four-way committee (Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians) to try to work towards solutions.

== Follow-up ==

Following the agreements, Israel and Jordan opened their borders. Several border-crossings were erected, allowing tourists, businessmen and workers to travel between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv8R-o_b0acC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=israel+jordan+peace+treaty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hb0rfd1sdr&amp;sig=tNk5NH8Sh6frt48Xc8IbhYiKX4o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NEe8UvrLNIaK0AWS-4HoDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=israel+jordan+peace+treaty&amp;f=true|title=Israel, Jordan, and the Peace Process|first=Yehuda|last=Lukacs|date=12 November 1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|accessdate=12 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli tourists started to visit Jordan, many to see the ''sela ha'adom'' ("Red Rock") of [[Petra]] – a stone-carved [[Nabatean]] city which had fascinated Israelis during the 1950s and 1960s, often luring adventurers to visit it secretly.

In 1996 the two nations signed a trade treaty. As part of the agreement, Israel assisted in establishing a modern medical center in [[Amman]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In December 2013, Israel and Jordan signed an agreement to build a desalination plant on the Red Sea, near the Jordanian port of Aqaba, as part of the [[Red Sea–Dead Sea Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2013/12/09/can-an-unlikely-middle-east-pact-give-life-to-the-dead-sea/#ixzz2ob2SfF6U|title=Can an Unlikely Middle East Pact Give Life to the Dead Sea?|first=Karl|last=Vick|publisher=|accessdate=12 November 2017|via=world.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Jordan notified Israel of its intention not to renew lands leased under Annex I of the agreement. The annex granted Jordan the right not to renew the lease of [[Naharayim]] (Baqoura) and Tzofar (Ghumar) after 25 years, given that a notice is given a year prior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5376250,00.html Jordan to nix parts of peace treaty with Israel, reclaim territories], YNET, 21 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[British Armed Services]], '''jankers''' or '''Restrictions of Privileges''' is an official punishment for a minor breach of discipline, as opposed to the more severe punishment of "detention" which would be given for a man committing a more serious or criminal offence. To be "on jankers" meant the serviceman or woman had been put on a charge by a non-commissioned officer (NCO) or occasionally a commissioned officer (referred to in service slang as "being put on a fizzer"), and so having his alleged offence entered on a Charge Report (Army or RAF Form No. 252). After appearing before an officer, the punishment might be ordered by the officer only after he has heard the evidence and had considered any mitigating factors.

==Terminology==
''Jankers'' is a much used vernacular term. The official Army terminology for jankers was "'''CB'''" which means "'''Confined to Barracks'''" or in the RAF "'''CC'''" "'''Confined to Camp'''" but later during the epoch of [[National Service in the United Kingdom|National Service]] the term was changed to "'''ROP'''" or "'''Restrictions of Privileges'''" in both Services.

The term ''jankers'' is today very occasionally used jokingly in civilian life, such as in journalism to mean the punishment of minor infringements by the imposition of tedious duties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Ordering of jankers==
As an alternative to ordering jankers, the officer may alternatively decide to "''dismiss the charge''", if he considered the man had no case to answer. Or the officer may simply "''admonish''" him or her if he decided the alleged breach of discipline had occurred but was just not serious enough to warrant jankers. For some offences, like drunkenness, the officer might alternatively impose a fine instead of jankers.

When jankers is "awarded" by the officer taking the charge, the officer will also specify the number of days the jankers would last for up to a maximum of 14 days.

The officer's decision, in this regard, is dependent upon his judgement of the seriousness, or otherwise, of the offence(s) committed and also whether it is a first offence or there were previous similar breaches of discipline already recorded on the man's or woman's conduct sheet e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schoolboy to Soldier 1935&amp;ndash;1960|author=Clement Hoyle|pages=31|year=2006|publisher=SERENDIPITY|isbn=1843941783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/bill-cheall/cheall01.htm |title=Bill Cheall's Story |work=The Green Howards Regimental History |publisher=Edward McKillop Nichol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117092511/http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/bill-cheall/cheall01.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jankers|work=WW2 &amp;mdash; People's War|date=2006-01-24|author=searcherjohnedwards|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/32/a8794632.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A surprise for my brother|author=BBC GMR Bus|work=WW2 &amp;mdash; People's War|date=2003-11-12|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/49/a2026649.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jankers" is a familiar part of life during Regular and National Service in both the British Army and the Royal Air Force.

The kinds of offences which, most typically, resulted in a man being put on jankers, have always been fairly minor breaches of discipline, most commonly being [[Absence without official leave|AWOL]], e.g. returning to base slightly late after leave on a weekend pass. Other common offences, often resulting in a spell of jankers, were being caught still in bed after reveille, being drunk, being deemed "scruffy" when in uniform such as boots or brasses not gleaming satisfactorily, performing some minor duty lazily or carelessly, failing to comply correctly with some order or regulation, failing to salute an officer correctly or some other similar mistake, being late for some duty, being untidy or lazy in his barrack room, such as not sweeping his bed space properly or having dust on his locker, making a sloppy bedpack, or else not being up to the required standard of smartness on parade or on a kit inspection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In many such cases, another officer might have ordered an NCO to "'''put that man on a Charge'''" when the breach of discipline or mistake was originally observed, and the form 252 would then be signed by the NCO. The more severe punishment of "''detention''" was given for offences which might be considered as criminal in a civil court, such as theft or violence against another person, or insubordination. Detention could only be given to a soldier or airman by the Commanding Officer, usually somebody of the Army rank of Colonel or RAF rank of Group Captain or by a convened Court Martial Board. Jankers could be given by a less senior officer, most typically a Captain or Flight Lieutenant.

Although what being on jankers involved has varied between different bases, different Services and over time, typically, whilst on jankers, the soldier or airmen was subjected to several punishment parades and inspections each day in different forms of dress, starting with working clothes [[Boilersuit|fatigues]] half an hour after reveille, where he paraded outside the guardhouse for inspection by the Orderly Officer. After inspection, the offender is sent to perform a variety of tasks, often menial, before breakfast. After lunch, the man has to report again to the guardroom for inspection, and is then assigned unpleasant work, known as "fatigues",  until shortly before he must attend the afternoon's muster parade. After tea, he parades again at the guardhouse, this time in battledress and in battle order, where he is rigorously inspected. Any criticism of his turnout or equipment can result in another 'charge' or 'fizzer.' The final parade of the day was at 22.00 hours, and in best [[Battle Dress]], best boots, sharply and cleanly turned out, and with every piece of equipment provided by the Army. After inspection, the soldier could then return to barracks, prepare his kit for tomorrow's parades, and then get to bed for some rest.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The theory was that the whole punishment made the offender's daily life unpleasant, having to get up extremely early, then rushing about miserable, often having the mickey taken out of him by his mates and perhaps feeling humiliated. So he was thereby motivated never to repeat in future, the mistake or slackness that got him put on the charge in the first place. Being put on jankers was never considered an indication of bad character in the Services, but particularly in the days of conscription, rather more as normal Armed Forces discipline likely to be experienced by the majority of ratings at some time or other while in the Forces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

British TV classic comedies, such as ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'' and ''[[Get Some In!]]'' and full length cinema films of that epoch like ''[[Privates Progress]]'' and ''[[Carry on Sergeant]]'' habitually made fun of jankers, as have memoirs of life in the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Oh, what a lovely war' |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=1988-01-24 |author=Patridge, Frances |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_199801/ai_n8786091 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All's well that ends well |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=2003-10-18 |author=Baxter, Keith |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200310/ai_n9331290/pg_2 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in the first episode of ''It Ain't Half Hot Mum'' Gunner Graham was put on "jankers" (painting stones) by the Sergeant Major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Ain't Half Hot Mum will have you rolling on the floor laughing! |work=Epinions |publisher=Shopping.com, Inc. |date=2001-09-01 |author=cripper |url=http://www.epinions.com/content_39122931332 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508202659/http://www.epinions.com/content_39122931332 |archivedate=2008-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Last of the Summer Wine, Smiler once described that working for Nora Batty was like being in the Army again, and always on Jankers.

'''''Law's Empire''''' is a 1986 text in legal philosophy by the late Oxford scholar [[Ronald Dworkin]] which continues his criticism of the philosophy of [[legal positivism]] as promoted by [[H.L.A. Hart]] during the middle to late 20th century. The book notably introduces Dworkin's Judge Hercules as an idealized version of a jurist with extraordinary legal skills who is able to challenge various predominating schools of legal interpretation and legal hermeneutics prominent throughout the 20th century. Judge Hercules is eventually challenged by Judge Hermes, another idealized version of a jurist who is affected by an affinity to respecting historical legal meaning arguments which do not affect Judge Hercules in the same manner. Judge Hermes' theory of legal interpretation is found by Dworkin in the end to be inferior to the approach of Judge Hercules.

==Background==
Much of the twentieth century in legal philosophy has been characterized by the confrontation of legal positivism with natural law theory as being among the most prominent legal theories seen in the century. One major proponent of the Anglo-American version of legal positivism was H.L.A. Hart, a professor at Oxford University, who was a teacher of Dworkin's and whom eventually Dworkin would come to strongly disagree with. To challenge the prevailing schools of legal interpretation and legal philosophy in the late twentieth century, Dworkin invented the personage of Judge Hercules to represent a version of legal philosophy which he saw as effectively answering many of the shortcoming he had come to identify with Hart and other legal schools prominent in his time.

Dworkin's approach in the book is to present his argument in ten chapters with one summary chapter added at the end of the book titled, "Law Beyond Law". The book is original in its format compared to conventional approaches to academic studies in the law by introducing the personage of Judge Hercules early in the text to answer many of the legal theories which Dworkin wishes to discuss as to their being insufficient to meet the requirements of late 20th century jurisprudence. In Dworkin's perspective, the prevailing climate of legal theory at the end of the 20th century was understood by him as being represented by the deficiencies of many competing and contradictory legal theories being presented by the legal academy. The ten chapters of the book build their logical argument sequentially and in growing complexity of exposition where each chapter is dependent upon the logical demonstrations made in previous chapters in order to establish the rationale and comprehension at work in the mind of the legal personage represented by Judge Hercules.

==Summary==
The Preface of the book is used by Dworkin to state his primary concern in this volume concerning his approach to the philosophy of law. Dworkin states concisely: "We are subjects of law's empire, liegemen to its methods and ideals, bound in spirit while we debate what we must therefore do." The "empire" of the law is expansive for Dworkin and includes not only the domain of jurisprudence but extends fully into the domain of politics and sociology, including the philosophical domain of morals, ethics and even aesthetics as these affect the lives of all individuals of society.

===Chapter One: What is Law?===
In this chapter, Dworkin tells his readers that there are three types of law with which he is primarily concerned. These three areas of law are outlined as (a) Conventionalism, (b) Pragmatism (semantic theory), and (c) Law as integrity. Dworkin shall make a primary point of defending Law as integrity throughout the subsequent chapters of his text.

===Chapter Two: Interpretive Concepts===
Dworkin introduced his principle of the 'semantic sting' of the semantic philosophy of law. He develops and distinguishes between two forms of skepticism to present his arguments differentiating between "internal skepticism" and "external skepticism", for use in subsequent chapters.

===Chapter Three: Jurisprudence Revisited===
Dworkin informs his readers that the concept of law is the theory of what forms the ground of law. The ground of law is the basis upon which the suppositions for the working and application of law are based and form an unavoidable basis for subsequent discussion of differing concepts of law. The phrase 'concept of law' was used by Hart as the title for an approach to law strongly oriented to Anglo-American reading of positive law to which Dworkin would take exception as to its insufficiency for dealing with issues of jurisprudence encountered throughout the 20th century.

===Chapter Four: Conventionalism===
In this chapter, Dworkin begins his three part, 3-tier assessment of law with his criticism of Conventionalism. He differentiated Conventionalism as falling into two different kinds, which are insufficient, in the end, to the needs of contemporary jurisprudence at the end of the 20th century leading to the start of the 21st century. Dworkin ends the chapter asserting the failure of Conventionalism.

===Chapter Five: Pragmatism and Personification===
Dworkin rejects pragmatism here as insufficient to the requirement of adjudication requirements and legislative principles which he sees as prevailing at the end of the twentieth century. Dworkin begins to stress that contemporary jurisprudence in his view needs to hold in high esteem the values of justice as integrity, fairness and due process.

===Chapter Six: Integrity===
For Dworkin, "Justice is a matter of outcomes: a political decision causes injustice, however fair its procedures that produced it, when it denies people some resource, liberty, or opportunity that the best theories of justice entitle them to have." For Dworkin, the answerability of jurisprudence to political theory and political obligations is central. Poliltical ideals are presented as operating from a base of moral concerns which do influence what is legislated as law.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Law's Empire''. Harvard University Press. 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''legality of the [[Vietnam War]]''' refers to the lawfulness of the 1965-1975 U.S. military activity that occurred in Vietnam.

==Legality under national and international law==

===U.S. law===
The [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], passed in 1964, authorized U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to use military force in Southeast Asia. The Resolution was repealed in 1971, however, and President [[Richard M. Nixon]] cited his power as [[commander-in-chief]] of U.S. forces under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Command of military.3B Opinions of cabinet secretaries.3B Pardons|Article Two of the United States Constitution]] as legal authority for operations in Vietnam. No formal [[declaration of war]] was ever made, a violation of the [[US Constitution]] according to many.

===International law===
[[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] prohibits war that is not to maintain or restore international peace (Article 42) or undertaken in self-defense (Article 51). According to [[Richard Falk]], "If the US Government had abided by international law, the dreadful experience of the Vietnam War would not have occurred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2005/09/21_falk_abandonment-international-law.htm The Abandonment of International Law After 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215225843/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2005/09/21_falk_abandonment-international-law.htm |date=2007-12-15 }}, Richard Falk, Sept. 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Benjamin B. Ferencz]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benferencz.org/arts/8.html War Crimes Law And The Vietnam War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063049/http://www.benferencz.org/arts/8.html |date=2008-05-09 }}, Benjamin B. Ferencz, The American University Law Review, Volume 17, Number 3, June 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{quote|The legal right of any lawful government to defend itself against violent overthrow can hardly be questioned. The right of any government to join in the defense of its allies or friends to protect their or its own vital interests is an ancient and well established practice. It is, however, also part of the American heritage that the people, feeling themselves aggrieved by a foreign power or a tyrannical regime, have the legal right and "it is their duty to throw off such government." The United States has the legal right to assist in the defense of the government of South Vietnam.}}

==Legal action==
In [[United States v. Sisson]], a federal judge dismissed a challenge to the Vietnam War's constitutionality because it involved "just the sort of evidence, policy considerations, and constitutional principles which elude the normal processes of the judiciary and which are far more suitable for determination by coordinate branches of the government."

In [[Sarnoff v. Shultz]], the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court ruled on, and the U.S. Supreme was petitioned to reconsider, the constitutionality of then Treasury Secretary, George Schultz, allocating funds to the Vietnam War in spite of the fact that an official Declaration of War had never been made.  The Supreme Court voted 6-3 to not reconsider the lower court's ruling, thus upholding Ninth Circuit's ruling that George Shultz had been tacitly authorized by the U.S. Congress to allocate funds to the Vietnam War by virtue of Congress's approval of the federal budgets which included these war funds.

'''MOBILedit Forensic''' is a [[digital forensics]] product by Compelson Labs that searches, examines and report on data from GSM/CDMA/PCS cell phone devices. MOBILedit connects to cell phone devices via an Infrared (IR) port, a [[Bluetooth]] link, Wi-Fi, or a cable interface. After connectivity has been established, the phone model is identified by its manufacturer, model number, and serial number ([[IMEI]]) and with a corresponding picture of the phone.

Data acquired from cell phone devices are stored in the .med file format. After a successful logical acquisition, the following fields are populated with data: subscriber information, device specifics, Phonebook, SIM Phonebook, Missed Calls, Last Numbers Dialed, Received Calls, Inbox, Sent Items, Drafts, Files folder. Items present in the Files folder, ranging from Graphics files to Camera Photos and Tones, depend on the phone’s capabilities. Additional features include the myPhoneSafe.com service, which provides access to the IMEI database to register and check for stolen phones.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Ayers - Wayne Jansen - Ludovic Moenner - Aurelien Delaitre,[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/nistir-7387.pdf ''Cell Phone Forensic Tools: An Overview and Analysis Update''], (2007), National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MOBILedit''' is a platform that works with a variety of phones and [[smartphones]] (a complete list of supported handsets is available on the manufacturer’s website) and explores contents of the phone through a MS Outlook-like folder structure. This allows backup of the information stored on the phone, storing it on a PC or copy data to another phone via Phone Copier feature.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Cassavoy, [http://www.pcworld.com/article/159035/sync_your_smart_phone_and_your_pc_with_mobiledit_lite.html ''Sync Your Smart Phone and Your PC With Mobiledit Lite''], (2009), PC World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mass shooting''' is an incident involving multiple participants of firearms-related violence. The United States' [[Congressional Research Service]] acknowledges that there is not a broadly accepted definition, and defines a "public mass shooting"&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerome P.|last=Bjelopera|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43004.pdf |title=Public Mass Shootings in the United States: Selected Implications for Federal Public Health and Safety Policy|publisher=CRS Report for Congress|agency=Congressional Research Service|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2015}} "There is no broadly agreed-to, specific conceptualization of this issue, so this report uses its own definition for public mass shootings."&lt;/ref&gt; as one in which four or more people select someone indiscriminately, and kill them, echoing the FBI definition&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite web|last1=Follman|first1=Mark|title=What Exactly Is A Mass Shooting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/what-is-a-mass-shooting|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Robert J.|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder/serial-murder-1|title=Serial Murder|publisher=FBI Updates, Reports and Publications|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the term "[[mass murder]]".

A mass shooting may be committed by individuals or organizations in public or non-public places. [[Terrorist groups]] in recent times have used the tactic of mass shootings to fulfill their political aims. Individuals who commit mass shootings may fall into any of a number of categories, including [[Familicide|killers of family]], of [[Workplace violence|coworkers]], of [[School shooting|students]], and of random strangers. Individuals' motives for shooting vary.

Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the context: number of casualties, the country, political climate, and other factors. The [[News media|media]] cover mass shootings extensively and often sensationally, and the effect of that coverage has been examined. Countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have changed their gun laws in the wake of mass shootings. In contrast, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|United States' constitution]] prohibits laws which disallow firearm ownership outright and owns about half of the world's guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html|title=What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

In Australia, a 2006 paper defined a mass shooting as "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators".&lt;ref name=PMC&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=S.|title=Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings|pmc=2704353|pmid=17170183|doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714|volume=12|date=December 2006|pages=365–72|journal=Injury Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime violence research group [[Gun Violence Archive]], whose research is used by all major American media outlets defines Mass Shooting as "FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location not including the shooter" differentiating between Mass Shooting and Mass Murder [Killing] and not counting shooters as victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology|title=General Methodology - Gun Violence Archive|website=www.gunviolencearchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]] report explicitly excluded from its definition of public mass shootings those in which the violence is a means to an end, for example where the gunmen "pursue criminal profit or kill in the name of terrorist ideologies".&lt;ref name="CRS"/&gt;

====South Korea====
South Korea has suffered multiple mass shootings in the [[South Korean Army]], mainly due to soldier's stress and conflicts from its violence and detention from society.

====Japan====
Japan has as few as two gun-related homicides per year. These numbers include all homicides in the country, not just mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/|title=A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths|work=The Atlantic|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Max|last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when adjusting for different population sizes, analysing data between 2009 and 2015 (therefore excluding shootings like the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting), the US falls to 12th in a comparison between the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe |title= UPDATED: Comparing Death Rates from Mass Public Shootings and Mass Public Violence in the US and Europe |agency= Crime Prevention Research Center |first=John |last=Lott |date= January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==
Mass shootings can be motivated by [[misanthropy]]&lt;ref&gt;De Freitas, Julian, and Mina Cikara. "Deep down my enemy is good: Thinking about the true self reduces intergroup bias." (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[terrorism]] and caused by [[mental illness]], [[inceldom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/other-hand/2018/02/high-school-students-demand-action-gun-control-following-parkland|title=High school students demand action on gun control following Parkland shooting - rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Brunt, Brian, and W.

"Exploring school rampage shootings: Research, theory, and policy." The Social Science Journal 49.3 (2012): 304-313.&lt;/ref&gt; among other reasons.&lt;ref name=frum/&gt; Forensic psychologist [[Stephen Ross (psychologist)|Stephen Ross]] says that extreme anger and the thought shooters are working for a cause, rather than mental illness, is most often the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Holly|title=Inside the mind of a mass murderer|url=http://wane.com/2015/12/02/inside-the-mind-of-a-mass-murderer/|publisher=WANE.com|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Vanderbilt University]] researchers found that "fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Amy|title=Mental Illness is the wrong scapegoat after mass shootings|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/12/mental-illness-wrong-scapegoat-shootings/|publisher=Vanderbilt University|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Roman]] of the [[Urban Institute]] argues that, while better access to mental health care, restricting high powered weapons, and creating a defensive infrastructure to combat terrorism are constructive, they don't address the greater issue, which is "we have a lot of really angry young men in our country and in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-roman-phd/angry-young-men-and-mass_b_10503106.html Angry young Men and Mass Killings]. ''The Huffington Post.'' June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Dave Cullen]] described killer Eric Harris as an "injustice collector" in his 2009 book ''[[Columbine (book)|Columbine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Finally understand why.

Likewise, mass shooting expert and former FBI profiler Mary O'Toole also uses the phrase "injustice collector" in characterizing motives of some mass shooting perpetrators.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekiempis|first1=Victoria|title=Meet Mass-Shooting Expert Mary Ellen O'Toole|url=http://www.newsweek.com/serial-killer-mass-shooter-school-shootings-federal-bureau-investigation-367374|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation, criminologist [[James Alan Fox]] contends that mass murderers are "enabled by social isolation" and typically experience "years of disappointment and failure that produce a mix of profound hopelessness and deep-seated resentment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James Alan |last=Fox |date=January 16, 2011 |url= http://www.boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2011/01/the_real_causes_of_mass_murder.html |title= The real causes of mass murder |work= Boston.com |accessdate= November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/12/03/james-alan-fox-san-bernardino-focus-murderous-partnership/76725342/|title=James Alan Fox: In San Bernardino, focus on the murderous partnership|work=USA Today|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jillian Peterson]], an assistant professor of criminology at [[Hamline University]] who is participating in the construction of a database on mass shooters, noted that two phenomena surface repeatedly in the statistics: hopelessness and a need for notoriety in life or in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wanamaker |first=John |date=October 8, 2017|title='This shooter is a little different': Hamline professor studies mass shootings|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/10/08/this-shooter-is-a-little-different-hamline-professor-studies-mass-shootings|work= [[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]] News |location= |access-date=October 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notoriety was first suggested as a possible motive and researched by Justin Nutt.  Nutt stated in a 2013 article, "those who feel nameless and as though no one will care or remember them when they are gone may feel doing something such as a school shooting will make sure they are remembered and listed in the history books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticesolutions.org/2013/12/14/school-shootings-possible-causes/|title=School Shootings and Possible Causes|date=14 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the frequency of mass shootings in the United States, criminologist Peter Squires says that the individualistic culture in the United States puts the country at greater risk for mass shootings than other countries, noting that "many other countries where gun ownership is high, such as Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Israel . . . tend to have more tight-knit societies where a strong social bond supports people through crises, and mass killings are fewer." He is an advocate of gun control, but contends there is more to mass shootings than the prevalence of guns.&lt;ref name=europe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorell|first1=Oren|title=In Europe, fewer mass killings due to culture not guns|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/17/guns-mass-killings-worldwide/1776191/|publisher=USA Today|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science and family structure==

According to Michael Cook and Carolyn Moynihan of Mercatornet,&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"&gt;https://www.mercatornet.com/features/articles/21046/&lt;/ref&gt; an angle that is missed by mainstream media is the findings of important social scientists such as eminent Harvard sociologist [[Robert J. Sampson]] who wrote: “Family structure is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, predictor of variations in urban violence across cities in the United States. The close empirical connection between family breakdown and crime suggests that increased spending on crime-fighting, imprisonment, and criminal justice in the United States over the last 40 years is largely the direct or indirect consequence of marital breakdown.” His views are echoed by the eminent criminologists [[Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]], who have written that “such family measures as the percentage of the population divorced, the percentage of households headed by women, and the percentage of unattached individuals in the community are among the most powerful predictors of crime rates.”&lt;ref name="aei.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/sons-of-divorce-school-shooters/|title=Sons of divorce, school shooters|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the research of another social scientist who was himself raised by a single mother, Bradford Wilcox, "boys living in single mother homes are almost twice as likely to end up delinquent compared to boys who enjoy good relationships with their father."&lt;ref name="aei.org"/&gt;

Moynihan said that "almost all school shooters come from families where the parents are either divorced or alienated",&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"/&gt; and Cook argued that "perhaps they wouldn’t need more gun control if they had better divorce control.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/an-act-of-pure-evil/20506|title=MercatorNet: ‘An act of pure evil’|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Media===
{{sect-stub|date=November 2017}}
Some people have considered whether media attention revolving around the perpetrators of mass shootings is a factor in sparking further incidents.&lt;ref name=birch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Jenna|title=Does Media Coverage After a Mass Shooting Do More Harm Than Good?|url=https://www.yahoo.com/health/does-media-coverage-after-a-mass-shooting-do-more-125177743017.html|publisher=Yahoo! News|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, some in law enforcement have decided against naming mass shooting suspects in media-related events to avoid giving them notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elinson|first1=Zusha|last2=Lazo|first2=Alejandro|title=More Police Decide Against Naming Mass-Shooting Suspects|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-police-decide-against-naming-mass-shooting-suspects-1443985970|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=October 4, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of messages used in the coverage of mass shootings has been studied. Researchers studied the role the coverage plays in shaping attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness and public support for [[gun control]] policies.&lt;ref name=emma&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McGinty|first1=Emma|title=Effects of News Media Messages About Mass Shootings on Attitudes Toward Persons With Serious Mental Illness and Public Support for Gun Control Policies|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=5|pages=494–501|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=11 August 2015|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|pmid=23511486|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a paper written by a physicist and statistician, [[Sherry Towers]], along with four colleagues was published, which proved that there is indeed mass shooting contagion using [[mathematical modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Towers|first1=Sherry|last2=Gomez-Lievano|first2=Andres|last3=Khan|first3=Maryam|last4=Mubayi|first4=Anuj|last5=Castillo-Chavez|first5=Carlos|date=2 July 2015|editor-last=Yukich|editor-first=Joshua|editor-link=Joshua Yukich|title=Contagion in Mass Killings and School Shootings|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|access-date=17 June 2018|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|publisher=[[Public Library of Science]]|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|layurl=https://www.livescience.com/51429-mass-shootings-are-contagious.html|laysource=Live Science|laydate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2017 Towers said in an interview that she prefers [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] to [[censorship]] to address this issue, just like years ago major news outlets successfully prevent [[copycat suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Towers |first=Sherry |interviewer= John Hook|title= Newsmaker Sunday: Sherry Towers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sQKZcpolAY |publisher=[[Fox 10 Phoenix]] |location=Phoenix, Arizona, United States |date=6 December 2017|work=Newsmaker Sunday |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[American Psychological Association]] published a [[press release]], claiming that mass shooting contagion does exist and news media and social media enthusiasts should withhold the name(s) and face(s) of the victimizer(s) when reporting a mass shooting to deny the fame the shooter(s) want to curb contagion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= Johnston|first= Jennifer|authorlink=Jennifer Johnston|date= 4 August 2016|title= "Media Contagion" Is Factor in Mass Shootings, Study Says|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/08/media-contagion.aspx |location= |publisher= American Psychological Association |access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some news media have weighed in on the gun control debate. After the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], the ''[[New York Daily News]]''{{'}} front-page headline, "God isn't fixing this", was accompanied by "images of tweets from leading Republicans who shared their [[thoughts and prayers|'thoughts' and 'prayers']] for the shooting victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/daily-news-cover-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=Hard-hitting Daily News cover blasts Republicans for offering only 'prayers' after latest shooting|author=Colin Campbell|publisher=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marina|last=Fang|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-daily-news-cover_565fa492e4b08e945fee15ce|title=New York Daily News Skewers Politicians Refusing to Act on Gun Violence: 'God Isn't Fixing This'|work=Huffington Post|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], satirical news website ''[[The Onion]]'' has republished the story "'No Way To Prevent This', Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" with minor edits after major mass shootings, to satirise the popular consensus that there is a lack of political power in the United States to prevent mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/03/why-this-onion-article-goes-viral-after-every-mass-shooting/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun law reform===
{{See also|Overview of gun laws by nation}}
Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the country and political climate.

====Australia====
After the 1996 [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in [[Australia]], the government changed [[Gun laws in Australia#The Port Arthur massacre and its consequences|gun laws in Australia]]. As in the United States, figures vary according to the definition of "mass shooting"; a 2006 paper used a definition "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators",&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; compared to the usual U.S. definition of an indiscriminate rampage in public places resulting in four or more victims killed. Between 1981 and the passing of the law in 1996 there were 13 mass shootings with five or more deaths; in the following decade, while the new law was in place, there were no such mass shootings.&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; Overall gun deaths have continued to decline for two decades since the law was passed,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewan|first1=Angela|last2=Tarabay|first2=Jamie|title=What the UK and Australia did differently after mass shootings|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/world/gun-control-uk-australia/index.html|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=CNN|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however there have been several shootings with three or more deaths since 1996 where the victims were related to the shooter.

There were five significant shootings, though not meeting the "mass shooting" definition of the 2006 paper, between 1996 {{As of|2016|6|alt=and June 2018}}:
* the [[Monash University shooting]] in 2002 in which Huan Yun Xiang shot and killed two and injured five
* the [[2011 Hectorville siege|Hectorville Siege]] in 2011 where 39-year-old man Donato Anthony Corbo shot four people on a neighbouring property (three of whom died), and also wounded two police officers, before being arrested by Special Operations police after an eight-hour siege
* the Logan family shooting in 2014 of a neighbour family (Greg Holmes, 48, his mother Mary Lockhart, 75, and her husband Peter Lockhart, 78) by Ian Francis Jamieson
* the Hunt family murders, in October 2014 when Geoff Hunt murdered four relatives before killing himself
* The Osmington shooting in May 2018, involving the death of 7 when a grandfather shot and killed his four grandchildren, his daughter, his wife and then himself.

====United Kingdom====
As a result of the 1987 [[Hungerford massacre]] and 1996 [[Dunblane school massacre]] mass shootings, the [[United Kingdom]] enacted tough gun laws and a buyback program to remove guns from private ownership.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartmann|first1=Margaret|title=How Australia and Britain Tackled Gun Violence|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/how-australia-and-britain-tackled-gun-violence.html#|publisher=Daily Intelligencer|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two mass shootings since the laws were restricted, the [[Cumbria shootings]] in 2010 which killed 13 people&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the [[Moss Side mass shooting]] in 2018, in which no-one was killed.

====United States====
{{See also|Gun law in the United States|Gun laws in the United States by state|Gun politics in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], support for gun law reform [[gun politics in the United States|varies considerably by political party]], with Democrats generally more supportive and Republicans generally more opposed. Some in the U.S. believe that tightening gun laws would prevent future mass shootings.&lt;ref name=progress&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Sam|title=One Change To Our Gun Laws That Could Have Prevented The Last Mass Shooting|url=http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/28/3685169/gun-laws-mental-health-lafayette/|publisher=Think Progress|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some politicians in the U.S. introduced legislation to reform the background check system for purchasing a gun.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Ali|title=These 6 Stalled Bills Aimed at Mass Shootings Like Umpqua Flounder in Congress|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stalled-bills-aimed-mass-shootings-umpqua-flounder-congress/story?id=34208798|publisher=ABC News|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast majority of Americans support tighter background checks. "According to a poll [Made by CNN] by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, 93 percent of registered voters said they would support universal background checks for all gun buyers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/10/americans-support-universal-background-checks|title=An Overwhelming Majority of Americans Still Support Universal Background Checks|work=Mother Jones|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Becca|last=Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that mass shootings should not be the main focus in the gun law reform debate because these shootings account for less than one percent of the U.S. homicide rate and believe that these shootings are hard to stop. They often argue that civilians with concealed guns will be able to stop shootings.&lt;ref name=volokh&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|title=Do civilians with guns ever stop mass shootings?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/03/do-civilians-with-guns-ever-stop-mass-shootings/|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 3, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun control policies may cause a lot of controversy due to divided opinions on who should be able to carry a weapon.  An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those suffering with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also proved that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those suffering from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L. Barry, 2013)

===Leaders===
As of June 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] had spoken in the aftermath of fourteen mass shootings during his nearly eight-year presidency, repeatedly calling for more gun safety laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=korte&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/02/11-mass-shootings-11-speeches-how-obama-has-responded/73177526/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Charleston church shooting]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said, "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency."&lt;ref name=benen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benen|first1=Steve|title=Comparing U.S. mass shootings to the rest of the world|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/comparing-us-mass-shootings-the-rest-the-world|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the December [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], Obama renewed his call for reforming gun-safety laws and also said that the frequency of mass shootings in the United States has "no parallel in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=OBAMA: 'We have a pattern now of mass shootings ... that has no parallel'|work=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Maxwell|last=Tani}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the February 2018 attack at Florida's [[Parkland school shooting]] at [[Stoneman Douglas High School]], the school's student survivors, teachers, and parents became strong leaders in the effort to ban [[assault weapon]] sales and easy accessibility to [[military weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witt|first1=Emily|title=How the Survivors of Parkland Began the Never Again Movement|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-survivors-of-parkland-began-the-never-again-movement?CNDID=30462369&amp;spMailingID=12971483&amp;spUserID=MTMzMTgzMTA1MjA0S0&amp;spJobID=1341843325&amp;spReportId=MTM0MTg0MzMyNQS2|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=20 February 2018|language=en|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Justice''' ({{lang-pt|Ministério da Justiça}}) is the [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[ministry (government)|government ministry]] responsible for the administration of the [[Judiciary of Portugal|judiciary system]]. It is headed by the Minister of Justice.

The Ministry of Justice should not be confused with the [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]]. This last one is not a Government ministry - despite the name - but the independent body of magistrates of the Judiciary charged with the public prosecution and the legal representation of the State before the courts.

Unlike usual in other countries, the Portuguese Minister of Justice does not have any kind of hierarchic authority over the public prosecutors.

==Roles==
The roles of the Ministry of Justice include:
* to conceive, to conduct, to execute and to assess the policy of Justice defined by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] and by the Government;
* to assure the relationship of the Government with the courts, the Public Ministry, the Higher Council of Magistrates and the Higher Council of the Administrative and Tax Courts.

==History==
The present Ministry of Justice was created in 1821 as the '''Secretariat of State of the Ecclesiastical and Justice Affairs''' (also referred as the '''Ministry of Ecclesiastical and Justice Affairs'''). In 1910, it became the '''Ministry of Justice and Cults''' and in 1940, it became the '''Ministry of Justice'''.

==Organization==
The Ministry of Justice is headed by the minister, assisted by the Secretary of State of Justice.

The following agencies are part of the Ministry of Justice:
* Directorate-General of the Policy of Justice
* Inspectorate-General of the Services of Justice
* Secretariat-General of the Ministry of Justice
* Judiciary Police
* Directorate-General of the Administration of Justice
* Directorate-General of the Probation and Prison Services
* Institute of Justice Equipment and Facilities Management
* Institute of Registers and Notary
* National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences
* Center of Judiciary Studies
* Crime Victims Protection Commission
* Insolvency Administrators Activity Control and Appreciation Commission

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="614">'''Mitigating evidence''' is [[evidence]] that is provided (usually by the defendant in a criminal trial) in order to try to establish the presence of [[mitigating circumstances]].  The presence of mitigating circumstances can reduce the punishment imposed for the offense.  The case of the ''[[Oregon v. Guzek]]'' dealt with the issue of whether [[alibi]] evidence not introduced at trial could be introduced in the sentencing phase of a death penalty trial as mitigating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/04-928&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">The '''National Association for Court Management''' (NACM) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacmnet.org/ The National Association for Court Management]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-profit organization]] in the United States that promotes professional management education for court administrators and judges.

In the United States and most other countries in the [[common law]] tradition, supervising judges continue their traditional role as the presiding authorities in the bureaucracy of court systems. However, the latter half of the twentieth century saw the increasing [[professionalization]] of non-judicial court administrators and staff. In many court systems today, responsibility for court operations is delegated almost entirely to professional court managers, freeing judges and their legal clerks to devote their time to the work of interpreting and applying the law.

The mission of NACM is to provide a national forum for court professionals and, more importantly, to promote the fair and impartial administration of justice.  Through NACM, court administrators increase the publics’ understanding of the judicial system and provide for equal access to justice for all.  The association offers court management an ethical code of conduct to promote professionalism and competence throughout the system. The association improves the profession through education, the exchange of information and ideas, and the application of best practices in management.  NACM supports research to shape and develop the court management field.  Court administrators are guardians of the independence of the judiciary as the 3rd and independent branch of government and they safeguard the impartiality of administration of the courts.

NACM collaborates in training programs with [[Michigan State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judicialadministration.msu.edu/ Judicial Administration Program at Michigan State University]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Center for State Courts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsconline.org National Center for State Courts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625094626/http://www.ncsconline.org/ |date=2006-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute for Court Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsconline.org/D_ICM/icmindex.html Institute for Court Management]&lt;/ref&gt; NACM is well known for its creation of the Core Competencies in the late 1990s, which were revised as the Core®,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacmcore.org The NACM Core]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014. NACM has also drafted a Model Code of Conduct for Court Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacmnet.org/codeofconduct.html Model Code of Conduct for Court Professionals]&lt;/ref&gt;

NACM was founded in 1985 through the combination of two pre-existing associations: the National Association of Trial Court Administrators (founded in 1965) and the National Association for Court Administration (founded in 1968). It claims to be the largest organization of court management professionals in the world, with more than 1,800 members from the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.

The current president of NACM is Paul DeLosh, currently working as the Director of Judicial Services for the Virginia Supreme Court[[http://www.courts.state.va.us/courtadmin/aoc/djs/home.html]] . NACM is headquartered in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

{{Family law}}
In the [[Country|nations]] of the [[European Union]] and in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility|title=Parental rights and responsibilities: Who has parental responsibility - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''parental responsibility''' refers to the rights and privileges which underpin the relationship between the children and the children's [[parent]]s and those adults who are granted parental responsibility by either signing a 'parental responsibility agreement' with the mother or getting a 'parental responsibility order' from a court. The terminology for this area of [[law]] now includes matters dealt with as [[contact (law)|contact (visitation in the United States)]] and residence (see [[Family law|Residence in English law]]) in some states.

==In European states==
===Scotland===
In [[Scots law]], issues relative to parental responsibilities are dealt with under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/36/section/1|title=Children (Scotland) Act 1995|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which provides for the making of 'residence' (custody), 'contact' (access), and 'specific issue' orders. These may be applied for by anyone with an interest in a child, not merely parents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/36/section/5|title=Children (Scotland) Act 1995|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under section 1 of the 1995 Act, parental responsibilities are, where practicable and in the best interests of the child, to:  
*safeguard and promote the child’s health, development and welfare;
*provide the child with appropriate direction and guidance;
*maintain personal relations and direct contact with the child;
*act as the child’s legal representative.
These responsibilities last until the child is aged 16, with the exception of the responsibility to  provide the child with appropriate guidance, which lasts until the child is aged 18.  
Under section 2 of the 1995 Act those with parental responsibilities are given correlative rights to allow them to fulfill those responsibilities. These rights are:
*to have the child living with him or her or otherwise to regulate the child’s residence;
*to appropriately control, direct or guide the child’s upbringing;
*if the child is not living with him or her, to maintain personal relations and contact with the  child on a regular basis;
*to act as the child’s legal representative.
Having PRRs entitles a parent to take key decisions relating to the child, such as where they will live and go to school, and what medical treatment they should receive. In addition, parents have an obligation to provide financial support for their children under the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 (c 37) and the Child Support Act 1991 (c 38). In certain circumstances, this obligation continues when the child in question is beyond the age at which the parents have parental responsibilities under section 1 of the 1995 Act. The child’s mother (irrespective of whether she is married to the child’s father (s3(1)(a))) and the child’s father, if he is “married to the mother at the time of the child’s conception or subsequently” (s 3(1)(b)), have automatic rights. In line with Scottish Law Commission proposals in 1992, the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 has brought Scots law in line with English law to the extent that an unmarried father will obtain parental rights and responsibilities if he is registered as the father on the birth register. A married father’s PRRs continue after divorce, unless they are specifically removed by a court.  If unmarried fathers or stepparents do not have PRRs, they must either make a Section 4 Agreement, or apply to the court under section 11 for rights.
===United Kingdom===

According to the [[Children Act 1989]], Section 3, parental responsibility means "all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/I|title=Children Act 1989|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 states that if the mother and father are married to each other at the time of birth, both acquire parental responsibility, otherwise, the mother automatically acquires it and the father has 3 ways of acquiring it: a) he becomes registered as the child’s father according to specific paragraphs or sub-paragraphs in the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965, or the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 (b)he and the child’s mother make a parental responsibility agreement in which he acquires parental responsibility for the child or (c)the court orders that he shall have parental responsibility for the child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This act also states the process for second female parents and step-parents, to acquire parental responsibility as well as the appointment of guardians. A court can only appoint a guardian to a child who has no parent with parental responsibility for him/her or if the individual with whom a child was to live according to an applicable child arrangement order has died.  

Parental responsibility cannot be transferred or surrendered, completely or in part. Individuals may delegate the responsibility to someone else but this doesn't mean that they aren't responsible anymore. In other words, they would still be liable for the child&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/2|title=Children Act 1989|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Payne v Cave''''' (1789) 3 TR 148 is an old [[English contract law]] case, which stands for the proposition that an auctioneer's request for bids is not an offer but an [[invitation to treat]]. The bidders make the offers which can be accepted by the auctioneer.

==Facts==
Mr Cave was made the highest bid for a good in an auction. But then, Mr Cave changed his mind and he withdrew his bid before the auctioneer brought down his hammer. 

It was held that Mr. Cave, the defendant, was not bound to purchase the goods. His bid amounted to an offer which he was entitled to withdraw at any time before the auctioneer signified acceptance by knocking down the hammer. Note: The common law
rule laid down in this case has now been codified in many countries in variations of the Sale of Goods Act, e.g. UK 1979 s57(2).

==Judgment==
The court held that Mr Cave was entitled to withdraw his offer at any time before the auctioneer accepted it. The auctioneer's request for bids was an invitation to treat, and each bid constituted an offer which could be withdrawn at any time until it's accepted, and finally, the fall of the auctioneer's hammer constituted acceptance of the highest bid.

==Significance==
''[[Barry v Davies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; qualified ''Payne'' by ruling that if the auction is advertised as being "without a reserve price", then the auctioneer is bound to sell to the highest ''bona fide'' bidder (and not the seller himself, as attempted in ''[[Warlow v Harrison]]''). Also, the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], s 57 states that if an auction is held without any reserve, then the auctioneer must accept the highest bid (this was subsequently applied in Barry v Davies).

In opening a contract class at [[Harvard]] in the autumn of 1870, Professor [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]], instead of the traditional didactic approach of lecturing a hall of students, pointed to a student and asked, “Mr Fox, will you state the facts of ''Payne v Cave''?”, then, “Mr Rawle will you give the plaintiff’s argument?” He replied to answers, in Socratic style, with “could you suggest a reason?”. This became known as the case method of legal study, that is followed around most of the common law world today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}The '''Personal Data Protection Bill''' is a Pakistani law that attempts to protect personal data from misuse by corporations and governments.

'''Potiphar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|t|ᵻ|f|ər}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew Name 2 |hebrew1=פּוֹטִיפַר |hebrew2=פּוֹטִיפָר |stan1=Potifar |tiber1=Pôṭîp̄ar |tiber2=Pôṭîp̄ār}}; [[Arabic]]: بوتيفار ; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] origin: ''p-di-p-rʿ'' "he whom [[Ra]] gave"&lt;/ref&gt; is a person known only from the [[Book of Genesis]]' account of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. Potiphar is said to be the [[Captain of the Guard|captain]] of the [[Royal Guard|palace guard]]. In the [[Quran]] he is referred to by his title, Aziz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1954|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=9004060561|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA233|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], sold into slavery by his brothers, is taken to Egypt where he is sold to Potiphar as a household slave. Potiphar makes Joseph the head of his household, but '''Potiphar's wife''', who is [[List of names for the biblical nameless|not named in the Bible]] or in Christian tradition, is furious at Joseph for resisting her attempts to seduce him, and falsely accuses him of attempted rape.   Potiphar casts Joseph into prison, from where he later comes to the notice of [[Pharaoh]] through his ability to [[Dream interpretation|interpret the dreams]] of other prisoners. (Genesis 39-40)

After Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams and his subsequent appointment as overlord of Egypt, Joseph (renamed [[Zaphnath-Paaneah]]) married [[Asenath]], the daughter of [[Poti-Pherah]] priest of On. Poti-Pherah may have been the same person as Potiphar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12316-potiphar|title=POTIPHAR - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case Joseph would likely have been married to the daughter of the woman responsible for his false imprisonment.

The medieval [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer HaYashar]], a commentary on the [[Torah]], gives Potiphar's wife's name as [[Zuleika (legendary)|Zuleikha]], as do many Islamic traditions and thus the Persian poem called [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] from [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' ("Seven thrones"). Because of the Egyptian location wherein the scene is staged, it is not impossible to detect in this biblical writing also a more recent echo of the very old Egyptian [[Tale of Two Brothers|fable of the two brothers Bata and Anpu]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Joseph (biblical figure)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/anpu_and_bata.htm|title=Anpu and Bata|website=www.reshafim.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2017}}

The story became very common in Western art in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] periods, usually showing the moment when Joseph tears himself away from the bed containing a more or less naked figure of Potiphar's wife. [[Persian miniature]]s often illustrate [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] in [[Jami]]'s ''[[Haft Awrang]]'' ("Seven thrones").

==Etymology==
Potiphar ({{Lang-he|פוטיפר}}) is the shortened form of פוטיפרע "Potiphera" from [[Late Egyptian]] "he whom [[Ra]] has given."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkuCG_BG6q4C&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;ots=tv9xfH7Udt&amp;dq=p3%20dj%20p3%20r%60%20potiphar&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q=p3%20dj%20p3%20r%60%20potiphar&amp;f=false|title=Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash|last=Ulmer|first=Rivka|date=2009-12-15|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110223934|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to the name "[[Theodore (name)|Theodore]]"="God's gift" in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Guide to the Bible - Old Testament|year=1967|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious References==
It is difficult to place Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or time period. On the [[Jewish calendar]], Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]] or very beginning of the [[New Kingdom]]. The [[Torah]] in which the story appears (see also the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]) was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the [[Yahwist]] source, and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh's dreams stand in the [[Elohist]] text.

According to Dr. G.J. Wenham ([[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]] New Bible Commentary) execution was normal for rape cases, and thus the story implies that Potiphar may have had doubts about his wife's account.

The [[Book of Abraham]], included in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], one of the [[standard works]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and by churches of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], refers to a "Potiphar`s Hill" in Egypt (Abraham 1:10, 20).

{{Formation of Malaysia}}
The '''Proclamation of [[Malaysia]]''' ({{lang-ms|Permasyhuran Malaysia}}), was a statement, written in [[English language|English]] and the [[Jawi script]] of [[Malay language|Malay]], that declared the merger of the [[Federation of Malaya]] with the British [[crown colonies]] of North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore into the new [[Federation of Malaysia]], following the enactment of the [[Malaysia Agreement]] and the [[Malaysia Act 1963]] that July. The merger came into effect on 16 September 1963, and the proclamation was delivered on that date by [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] in the [[Stadium Merdeka]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkib.gov.my/web/guest/pemasyhuran-malaysia?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_Oj0d&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-inner-3&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6257">The '''Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty''', also known as the '''Antarctic-Environmental Protocol''', or the Madrid Protocol, is part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].  It provides for comprehensive protection of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] environment and dependent and associated ecosystems. 
[[image:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|300px|The dumping of waste at [[Bellingshausen Station|Bellingshausen]], a Russian Base on [[King George Island (South Shetland Islands)|King George Island]], demonstrated the need for environmental regulation in Antarctica]]
It was concluded in [[Madrid]] and opened for signature on October 4, 1991 and [[coming into force|entered into force]] on January 14, 1998. The treaty will be open for review in 2048.

==Key Articles of the Treaty==
* Article 3 states that protection of the Antarctic environment as a wilderness with aesthetic and scientific value shall be a "fundamental consideration" of activities in the area.
* Article 7 states that "Any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited." This provision contrasts with the rejected [[Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities]], which would have allowed mining under the control and taxation of an international managing body similar to the [[International Seabed Authority]].
* Article 8 requires environmental assessment for all activities, including tourism.
* Article 11 creates a [[Committee for Environmental Protection (Antarctica)|Committee for Environmental Protection]] for the continent.
* Article 15 calls for member states to be prepared for emergency response actions in the area.
* Articles 18-20 arrange for arbitration of international disputes regarding Antarctica.
* Article 25(5) states that the Article 7 ban on mining may not be repealed unless a future treaty establishes a binding regulatory framework for such activity.

==State parties==
As of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 34 parties &amp;mdash; [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="ratifications"&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/devAS/info_measures_approval.aspx?id=193&amp;title=Adopted%20by%20SATCM%20XI-4%20(Madrid,%201991)&amp;fecharec=10/04/1991&amp;fa=0&amp;lang=e Adopted by SATCM XI-4 (Madrid, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A further 11 states &amp;mdash; [[Austria]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Denmark]], [[Guatemala]], [[Hungary]], [[North Korea]], [[Papua New Guinea]],  [[Slovakia]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Turkey]] &amp;mdash; have signed but not yet ratified it.

==Campaign==
The treaty followed a lengthy campaign by [[Greenpeace]], including the construction of an [[World Park Base|Antarctic base]] from 1987 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donald|first=Rothwell|title=The Antarctic Treaty  System:  Resource  Development,  Environmental Protection or Disintegration?|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic43-3-284.pdf|work=1990|publisher=The Arctic Journal|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fogg|first=Gordon|title=A history of Antarctic science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQoK4XdQn2cC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=greenpeace|work=Studies in Polar Research 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenpeace claims the protocol as a victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1991 - International Treaty saves the Antarctic from deadly threat|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/Victories-timeline/Antarctic-Treaty/|work=2011|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6697">'''Quasi-criminal''' means a [[lawsuit]] or [[Equity (law)|equity]] [[proceeding]] that has some, but not all, of the qualities of a criminal [[prosecution]].  It may appear in either a [[Common law]] or a [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] [[jurisdiction]].  It refers to "a court's right to punish for actions or omissions as if they were criminal".&lt;ref name=free&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/quasi-criminal The Free Dictionary]. Accessed June 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Etymology|origins]] of the phrase comes from the [[Latin language]] word, ''quasi'', meaning somewhat, sort-of, alike or akin, to [[criminal law]], as in [[Quasi-contract]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Quasimodo]].&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Quasi'' is used "to indicate that one subject resembles another, with which it is compared, in certain characteristics, but there are intrinsic and material differences between them".&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Jur. 2d, Words and Phrases, ''Quasi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a civil or equity trial, a court may act as if it were a criminal case to punish a person for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name=free /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalexplanations.com legalexplanations.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165120/http://www.legalexplanations.com/ |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, a court may impose [[asset forfeiture]] or another [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a court has the right to punish actions or omissions of a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[child support]] case as if they were a criminal, penalizing the parent with a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] of [[jail]] time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.com/default2.asp?selected=1689&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law Dictionary]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
''Quasi-criminal proceedings'' include a wide variety of matters, including prosecution for a violation of law or [[Local ordinance|ordinance]], [[psychiatric]] matters, [[motor vehicle]] law, [[status offense]]s, [[family court]] actions, and [[Equity (law)|equity]] proceedings such as a [[Writ]].  What these various legal matters have in common are these factors:

'''''R v Walker''''' was an [[England|English]] [[Crown Court]] case that was a test of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]]. It was the first such prosecution involving written material in nearly two decades and set a precedent for using the act to prosecute [[web fiction]].&lt;ref name="Ozimek2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ozimek |first=John |title=The Obscene Publications Act rides again |publisher=The Register |date=6 October 2008 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/06/obscene_publication_girls_aloud/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the defendant, English [[Civil Servant]] Darryn Walker was charged with publishing an obscene story on the Internet contrary to Section 2(1) of the Act. Media controversy was generated because the story in question was a [[real person fiction]] text horror story describing the imagined murder of the members of British pop group [[Girls Aloud]].&lt;ref name="daily star"&gt;{{Cite news | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Sicko plots to torture, rape &amp; kill Girls Aloud | newspaper = [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] | pages =  | year =  | date = 26 July 2007 | url = http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/13297/Sicko-plots-to-torture-rape-kill-GIrls-Aloud/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was abruptly abandoned on its first day and the defendant was cleared of all charges.&lt;ref name="Hughes2009"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hughes | first = Mark | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Blogger who wrote about killing Girls Aloud cleared | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | pages = | year = | date = 30 June 2009 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/blogger-who-wrote-about-killing-girls-aloud-cleared-1724457.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 26 July 2007, UK tabloid newspaper ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]'' reported that it had discovered an online text story about British pop group [[Girls Aloud]] that it described as "a chilling story detailing each singer's gory death in scenes that could be straight out of a horror movie", characterizing its author as "a vile internet psycho" and "a cyber-sicko". The news story said that ''The Daily Star'' had reported the content of the hosting website, "Kristen Archives" (a subsite of the [[ASSTR]] archive), to the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], and that the IWF had traced the site to the US. It also claimed that [[Interpol]] had been notified to help track down the site's operators and the writer of the story. An IWF spokesperson was reported as saying that since the site was hosted in the US, it fell outside the organization's remit, but that they were aware of the site. The spokesperson added that the site also contained "child abuse fantasy stories" and that they had passed on details of it to the British police.&lt;ref name="daily star"/&gt;

==Decision to prosecute==
The story, entitled "Girls (Scream) Aloud",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sinclair |first=Blake |title=Girls (Scream)Aloud |work=Kristen's Putrid Story Archive |publisher=[[alt.sex.stories|Alt Sex Stories]] Text Repository |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173423/http://www.asstr.org/~Kristen/putrid/girlsscream.htm |archivedate=16 July 2007|url=http://www.asstr.org/~Kristen/putrid/girlsscream.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; had been posted from within the [[jurisdiction]] of the UK on a website hosted in the US. Although submitted under a pseudonym, the posting included a traceable email address. Officers from [[Scotland Yard]]’s [[Metropolitan Police Clubs &amp; Vice Unit#Role|Obscene Publications Unit]] decided to take action over the story after consulting the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS), and on 25 September 2008 it was announced that the author, Darryn Walker, was to be prosecuted for the online publication of material that the police and the CPS believed was obscene. It was the first such prosecution for written material since the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959#Notable prosecutions under the Act|landmark obscenity cases of the '60s and '70s]], and was expected to have a significant impact on the future regulation of the Internet in the UK.&lt;ref name="Ozimek2008"/&gt;

==Trial==
Walker appeared in court on 22 October 2008 to face charges of "publishing an obscene article contrary to Section 2(1) of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]]". He was granted unconditional bail, and his case was initially set for trial on 16 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fae |first=Jane |title=Date set for internet 'obscene' publications trial |publisher=The Register |date=22 October 2008 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/22/obscene_publications_trial/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at a directions hearing in January, the defendant made it known that given the seriousness of the case he would be represented by a QC ([[Queen's Counsel]]), following which the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] gave notice of its intention to similarly employ a QC, and the trial was postponed to 29 June 2009.

==Outcome==
Walker appeared at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] Crown Court on 29 June 2009 but the case was abandoned on what was supposed to be the first day of the trial, following the introduction of evidence from an [[Information technology|IT]] expert. The CPS said that it had originally charged Walker as it believed that the story in question could be "easily accessed" by young fans of Girls Aloud. This was because of the definition of obscenity used in the act, which requires prosecutors to prove that those exposed to the material were previously unaware of its obscene nature. Those who actively seek out such material are deemed unlikely to be corrupted by it.&lt;ref name=Guardian_OPA&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Beaumont and Nichi Hodgson|title=Obscenity law in doubt after jury acquits distributor of gay pornography|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/07/obscene-publications-act-future-doubt|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IT expert showed that the article could only be located by those specifically searching for such material. A spokesperson for the CPS said that the prosecution was unable to provide sufficient evidence to contradict this new evidence and therefore took the decision that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. Judge Esmond Faulks, presiding, returned a formal verdict of not guilty to the charge of "publishing an obscene article".&lt;ref name="Hughes2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man cleared over Girls Aloud blog|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/8124059.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regulatory reform''' concerns improvements to the quality of government [[regulation]].

At the international level, the "[[OECD]] Regulatory Reform Programme is aimed at helping governments improve regulatory quality - that is, reforming regulations that raise unnecessary obstacles to [[competition]], [[innovation]] and [[Economic growth|growth]], while ensuring that regulations efficiently serve important social objectives".&lt;ref&gt;OECD, [http://www.oecd.org/topic/0,2686,en_2649_37421_1_1_1_1_37421,00.html OECD Regulatory Reform Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Indonesia===
The OECD produced a report in September 2012 reviewing [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesia]]'s regulatory reform programme, focusing on Indonesia's administrative and institutional arrangements for ensuring that regulations are effective and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/indonesia.htm Reviews of Regulatory Reform: Indonesia - Strengthening Co-ordination and Connecting Markets], launched 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 aimed in part to "make provision for the reduction of legislative burdens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/24/pdfs/ukpga_20130024_en.pdf Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Part 5, "Reduction of legislative burdens", made provision for "[[sunset provision|sunset and review provisions]]" in [[secondary legislation]], i.e.
*a power to review the effectiveness of the legislation within a specified period or at the end of a specified period
*provision for the legislation to cease to have effect at the end of a specified day or a specified period
*a power to consider whether the objectives which it was the purpose of the legislation to achieve remain appropriate and, if so, whether they could be achieved in another way.&lt;ref&gt;Section 14A of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], inserted by section 59 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]] sought to improve the regulation of businesses requiring certain environmental permits within Scotland whilst strengthening existing [[environmental protection]].

The '''Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)'''&lt;ref&gt;Budge, (1989). ''The Rosetta Stone.'' p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; is the third [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] decree, the first being for his grandfather '''[[Ptolemy III]]''' '''([[Decree of Canopus]])''', and the second being The '''[[Raphia Decree]] [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|(Ptolemy IV)]]'''. The Decree for Ptolemy V is the text recorded on the [[Rosetta Stone]] (issued at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 196 BC) in the Egyptian hieroglyphs, [[Demotic (Egyptian)]] script, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].

The [[Hellenistic]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ruled [[Egypt]] from 305 BC to 30 BC, issued a series of decrees over the course of their reign. The [[Rosetta Stone]] is the best known example.

'''''Secretary for Justice v Yau Yuk Lung Zigo and Another ''''' ({{zh|t=《律政司司長訴丘旭龍》}}) was a controversial and significant judicial review court case in [[Hong Kong]]. The case was mainly about sexual orientation discrimination and legal procedures of potentially unconstitutional legislation. The case also led to the creation of a new judicial review standard regarding discrimination and, later on, the extension of protection against domestic violence for [[LGBT community]].

==Background==
In April 2004, the two male respondents in the case, who were 19 and 30 at the time, were found in engaging anal sex in a car parked beside a quiet and dark highway. The two were then prosecuted and charged with violations of Crimes Ordinance Section 118F(1) which prohibited sodomy in public. The case was the very first prosecution of Section 118F(1) since the enactment in 1991. The case was brought before a magistrate judge, Mr John T. Glass, whom then ruled Section 118F(1) unconstitutionally discriminatory against gay men and thus dismissed the charges.

The Government then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appellate court subsequently upheld the magistrate’s rulings. The case was, once again, appealed and brought before the Court of Final Appeal which ruled on the case in July 2007. The Court of Final Appeal upheld the lower courts’ rulings regarding the discriminatory nature of Section 118F(1) but revised the decisions relating to the legal procedures of a magistrate dismissing unconstitutional charges for future cases. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 4–5)&lt;/sub&gt;

==The Justification Test==
In assessing the constitutionality of Crimes Ordinance Section 118F(1), the Court of Final Appeal created the justification test. The test had been used in other cases but was only formally formulated and named in the case.

The Court ruled that equal protection was fundamental and essential to every Hong Kong citizen. However, the Court also recognised the fact that strict equal treatments may cause more harm than good, and different treatments may be warranted under certain circumstances. The Court thus created the justification test for assessing the legality of differential treatments. Any governmental differential treatments that could survive under the scrutiny of the justification test would be deemed constitutional. The Court laid out the requirements under the test:
# The difference in treatment must pursue a legitimate aim. For any aim to be legitimate, a genuine need for such difference must be established.
# The difference in treatment must be rationally connected to the legitimate aim.
# The difference in treatment must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate aim.

&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 19–22)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Major issues==
Before hearing the oral arguments, the Court of Final Appeal identified two issues:
# Is Crimes Ordinance Section 118F(1) discriminatory to the extent that it is inconsistent with the [[Basic Law]] and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance?
# What is the proper order to be made when the charge against the defendant is found to be unconstitutional?
&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraph 8)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Arguments and reasoning==

===Issue 1: Is Crimes Ordinance Section 118F(1) unconstitutionally discriminatory against gay men?===
* Holding:
Yes

* Arguments:
The Government argued that Section 118F(1) was a formalised, enacted specific common law offence to protect the public from behaviours outraging public decency. The Government also indicated that the Legislature must have taken considerations of genuine needs for enacting the law to regulate homosexual conduct. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraph 26)&lt;/sub&gt;

*Reasoning:
The Court ruled that the Government’s concept of a genuine need could be established through the mere act of legislative enactment was plainly wrong. The Court also ruled that the Government failed to identify and make out any genuine needs for enacting Section 118F(1). The Court thus held that Section 118F(1) failed to pass the first hurdle of the justification test. Consequently, Section 118F(1) was declared unconstitutional for infringing the respondents’ right to equality guaranteed under Articles 25 and 39 of the [[Basic Law]] and Articles 1 and 22 of the Bill of Rights Ordinance.

The Court agreed with the Government that the Legislature had the right to pass laws protecting the community from outraging public sexual conduct, but the Court emphasised that the Legislature should never have done so in a discriminatory way. The Court pointed out that Section 118F(1) was discriminatory by singling out and criminalising homosexual buggery but no similar laws against heterosexual buggery or other comparable heterosexual acts. And without any satisfactory justifications, the Court could only uphold the lower courts' rulings regarding the unconstitutional nature of Section 118F(1). &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 25–30)&lt;/sub&gt;

===Issue 2: What is the proper order to be made when the charge against the defendant is found to be unconstitutional?===
* Arguments:
Both parties, the Government and the respondents, of the case stated that the Magistrate had mistakenly dismissed the charges after the declaration of Section 118F(1) unconstitutional. Both sides, at first, suggested different ways for properly dealing with the matter; however, they later on agreed that the Magistrate should have followed the instructions laid out in Section 27 of the Magistrates Ordinance. Thus, the Court was asked for clarification. &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 61–62)&lt;/sub&gt;

*Holding:
The Court upheld the approach of following Magistrates Ordinance Section 27 suggested by the parties. The Court ruled that the Magistrate could have amended and substituted the unconstitutional charges of Section 118F(1) with noncontroversial offences through following the instructions provided under Magistrates Ordinance Section 27 without dismissing the case. And through following Section 27, the Court also indicated that the Magistrate could have utilised Section 105 of the Magistrates Ordinance and requested the opinion from a higher court regarding the constitutionality of Section 118F(1). &lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 63–67, 70-71 &amp; 87)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Significance==
* Equal protection against official sexual orientation discrimination is protected under the term “other status” of Articles 1 and 22 of the Bill of Rights Ordinance and thus Articles 25 and 39 of the [[Basic Law]].
* Governmental sexual orientation discrimination was held equivalent to race and sex discrimination.
* The justification test was formulated.

&lt;sub&gt;(Court of Final Appeal judgement, paragraphs 11, 20–21)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Equal Opportunities Commission suggested the Legislative Council to extend the protection covered under the Domestic Violence Ordinance to same sex couples in case of potential violations of this case’s merits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/bc/bc61/papers/bc61ls-15-e.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shram Suvidha''' is a Web Portal to provide a single platform for all labour compliances.

[[India]] has more than 40 labour laws regulated by the[[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)| Ministry of Labour and Employment]], the [[Government of India]] and State Government. Compliance with these laws is tedious and time-consuming. As a result, employers often do not comply. The scale of noncompliance exceeds the ability of enforcement agencies to regulate. Amidst the confusion, employees do not always receive what they are entitled to under these laws. 

==Objectives==
The primary objectives of Shram Suvidha are:

* A unified portal for all compliance pertaining to Chief Labour Commissioner of India, Director General Mines and Safety, Employee State Insurance Corporation, and Employee Provident Fund Organization. There are 16 laws that are covered here like Payment of Wages Act, [[Minimum Wages Act 1948|Minimum Wages Act]], Contract Labour (Abolition and Regulation) Act.
* Creation of a unique number known as the Labour Identification Number or LIN to supplement all other registration numbers such as PF Establishment Code, [[ESIC]] Registration Number, Contract Labour Registration Number, etc.
* Online servicing of notices from the labour department and online submission of answers with document.
* Employee grievances can now be received online and employer has to clear them and submit proof of clearance.

==Process==
Shram Suvidha allows an organization to know what labour laws apply to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shramsamadhan.com/p/shram-suvidha-compliances-explanations.html|title=Shram Suvidha Compliances &amp; Explanations|website=Shramsamadhan.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shramsuvidha.gov.in/home.action|title=Shram Suvidha : (One-Stop-Shop for Labour Law Compliance)|website=Shramsuvidha.gov.in|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliances are reportable in a single form that makes it simple for those filing such forms. Performance is monitored using key indicators thus making the evaluation process objective. It promotes the use of a common Labour Identification Number (LIN) by all Implementing agencies.

The '''Labor Management Relations Act of 1947''' {{usc|29|141-197}}, better known as the '''Taft–Hartley Act''', (80 H.R. 3020, {{USStatute|80|101|61|136|1947|6|23}}) is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] that restricts the activities and power of [[trade union|labor unions]]. The [[Act of Congress|act]], still effective, was sponsored by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and Representative [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.]], and became law despite U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[veto]] on June 23, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=12675 |title=Harry S.

The principal author of the Taft–Hartley Act was J. Mack Swigert, of the Cincinnati law firm Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister.

==Background==
{{See also|Strike wave of 1946}}
Taft–Hartley was one of more than 250 union-related bills pending in both houses of Congress in 1947.&lt;ref name=giant/&gt; After World War II, 25 percent of the workforce was unionized (around 14.8 million workers had union contracts, 10 million of them being [[union security agreement]]s), and with the war now over, their promise not to strike so as not to impede the war effort had expired.

As a response to the rising union movement and Cold War hostilities, the bill could be seen as a response by business to the post–[[World War II]] labor upsurge of 1946. During the year after [[V-J Day]], more than five million American workers were involved in strikes, which lasted on average four times longer than those during the war.&lt;ref name=laborcomm&gt;{{cite book |last=Cochran|first= Bert|title=Labor and Communism: The Conflict That Shaped American Unions|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taft–Hartley Act was seen as a means of demobilizing the [[labor movement]] by imposing limits on labor's ability to strike and by prohibiting [[far left|radicals]] from their leadership.&lt;ref name=subterranean&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Sharon|title=Subterranean Fire: A History of Working-Class Radicalism in the United States|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=2006|isbn=1-931859-23-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was promoted by large business lobbies including the [[National Association of Manufacturers]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

==Effects of the act==
As stated in Section 1 ({{USC|29|141}}), the purpose of the NLRA is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]o promote the full flow of commerce, to prescribe the legitimate rights of both employees and employers in their relations affecting commerce, to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for preventing the interference by either with the legitimate rights of the other, to protect the rights of individual employees in their relations with labor organizations whose activities affect commerce, to define and proscribe practices on the part of labor and management which affect commerce and are inimical to the general welfare, and to protect the rights of the public in connection with labor disputes affecting commerce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amendments enacted in Taft–Hartley added a list of prohibited actions, or [[unfair labor practice]]s, on the part of unions to the NLRA, which had previously only prohibited unfair labor practices committed by employers. The Taft–Hartley Act prohibited [[jurisdictional strike]]s, [[wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]], solidarity or political strikes, [[secondary action|secondary boycotts]], secondary and mass [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], [[closed shop]]s, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. It also required union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government. [[Union shop]]s were heavily restricted, and states were allowed to pass [[right-to-work law]]s that ban agency fees. Furthermore, the executive branch of the federal government could obtain legal strikebreaking [[injunction]]s if an impending or current strike imperiled the national health or safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/60feb/cox.htm |date=February 1960 |title=Strikes and the Public Interest - A Proposal for New Legislation |first=Archibald |last=Cox |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdictional strikes===
In ''jurisdictional strikes'', outlawed by Taft–Hartley, a union strikes in order to assign particular work to the employees it represents. ''Secondary boycotts'' and ''common situs picketing'', also outlawed by the act, are actions in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which is associated with a targeted business.&lt;ref&gt;29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169 Section 8(b)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A later statute, the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]], passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.

===Campaign expenditures===
According to [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] scholar [[Floyd Abrams]], the Act "was the first law barring unions and corporations from making independent expenditures in support of or [in] opposition to federal candidates".&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/157720/debating-citizens-united Debating 'Citizens United'], ''[[The Nation]]'' (2011-01-13)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed shops===
{{Main|Closed shop}}
The outlawed ''closed shops'' were contractual agreements that required an employer to hire only [[trade union|labor union]] members. ''Union shops'', still permitted, require new recruits to join the union within a certain amount of time. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce [[union security]] clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their [[duty of fair representation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} On the other hand, Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to authorize a union shop a few years after the passage of the Act when it became apparent that workers were approving them in virtually every case.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Union security clauses===
{{Main|Union shop}}
The amendments also authorized individual states to outlaw ''union security clauses'' (such as the union shop) entirely in their jurisdictions by passing [[right-to-work law]]s. A right-to-work law, under Section 14B of Taft–Hartley, prevents unions from negotiating contracts or legally binding documents requiring companies to fire workers who refuse to join the union.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Currently all of the states in the [[Deep South]] and a number of states in the Midwest, Great Plains, and [[Rocky Mountains]] regions have right-to-work laws (with six states—[[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Oklahoma]]—going one step further and enshrining right-to-work laws in their states' constitutions).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Strikes===
The amendments required unions and employers to give 80 days' notice to each other and to certain state and federal mediation bodies before they may undertake [[Strike action|strikes]] or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a new [[collective bargaining agreement]]; it did not, on the other hand, impose any "cooling-off period" after a contract expired. The Act also authorized the President to intervene in strikes or potential strikes that create a national emergency, a reaction to the national coal miners' strikes called by the [[United Mine Workers of America]] in the 1940s. Presidents have used that power less and less frequently in each succeeding decade. President [[George W. Bush]] invoked the law in connection with the employer [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] of the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] during negotiations with West Coast shipping and stevedoring companies in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/09/us/president-invokes-taft-hartley-act-to-open-29-ports.html?pagewanted=all |title=President Invokes Taft-Hartley Act To Open 29 Ports |first1=David E. |last1=Sanger |first2=Steven |last2=Greenhouse |date=October 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also prohibited federal employees from striking.&lt;ref name=Fleischli1968&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleischli|first=George R.|title=DUTY TO BARGAIN UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 10988|journal=Air Force Law Review|date=May–June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-communism===
{{main|McCarthyism}}
The amendments required union leaders to file affidavits with the [[United States Department of Labor]] declaring that they were not supporters of the [[Communist Party]] and had no relationship with any organization seeking the "overthrow of the United States government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means" as a condition to participating in NLRB proceedings. Just over a year after Taft–Hartley passed, 81,000 union officers from nearly 120 unions had filed the required affidavits.&lt;ref name=laborstory/&gt; In 1965, The Supreme Court held that this provision was an [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] [[bill of attainder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Brown |vol=381|reporter=U.S. |opinion=437 |court=[[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] |date=1965-06-07 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/437 |accessdate=2015-11-24 |quote=Held: Section 504 constitutes a bill of attainder and is therefore unconstitutional. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of supervisors===
The amendments expressly excluded supervisors from coverage under the act, and allowed employers to terminate supervisors engaging in union activities or those not supporting the employer's stance.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/taft-hartley-signed-60-years-ago/|title=Taft-Hartley Signed 60 Years Ago|last=Gruenberg|first=Mark|date=June 11, 2007|publisher=[[Political Affairs Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518121009/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/taft-hartley-signed-60-years-ago/|archivedate=May 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments maintained coverage under the act for professional employees, but provided for special procedures before they may be included in the same bargaining unit as non-professional employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PUBLIC LAWS-CHS.114, 120-JUNE 21, 23,1947|publisher=80Ta CONG ., 1ST SESS .-CH. 120-JUNE 23, 194 7|page=136|url=alendar.google.com/calendar/r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right of employer to oppose unions===
The Act revised the Wagner Act's requirement of employer neutrality, to allow employers to deliver anti-union messages in the workplace.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;Anna McCarthy, ''The Citizen Machine: Governing by Television in 1950s America'', New York: The New Press, 2010, p. 54. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-498-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes confirmed an earlier [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that employers have a constitutional right to express their opposition to unions, so long as they did not threaten employees with reprisals for their union activities nor offer any incentives to employees as an alternative to unionizing. The amendments also gave employers the right to file a petition asking the Board to determine if a union represents a majority of its employees, and allow employees to petition either to decertify their union, or to invalidate the union security provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.

===National Labor Relations Board===
{{Main|National Labor Relations Board}}
The amendments gave the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board discretionary power to seek injunctions against either employers or unions that violated the Act.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The law made pursuit of such injunctions mandatory, rather than discretionary, in the case of [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]] by unions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The amendments also established the General Counsel’s autonomy within the administrative framework of the NLRB. Congress also gave employers the right to sue unions for damages caused by a secondary boycott, but gave the General Counsel exclusive power to seek injunctive relief against such activities.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Federal jurisdiction===
The act provided for federal court jurisdiction to enforce [[collective bargaining agreements]]. Although Congress passed this section to empower federal courts to hold unions liable in damages for strikes violating a no-strike clause, this part of the act has instead served as the springboard for creation of a "federal common law" of collective bargaining agreements, which favored [[arbitration]] over litigation or strikes as the preferred means of resolving labor disputes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Other===
The Congress that passed the Taft–Hartley Amendments considered repealing the [[Norris–La Guardia Act]] to the extent necessary to permit courts to issue injunctions against strikes violating a no-strike clause, but chose not to do so. The Supreme Court nonetheless held several decades later that the act implicitly gave the courts the power to enjoin such strikes over subjects that would be subject to final and binding arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement.

Finally, the act imposed a number of procedural and substantive standards that unions and employers must meet before they may use employer funds to provide pensions and other employee benefit to unionized employees. Congress has since passed more extensive protections for workers and employee benefit plans as part of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] ("ERISA").

==Opposition to the Act==
After spending several days considering how to respond to the bill, Truman vetoed Taft–Hartley with a strong message to Congress. Truman had expressed no opinion on the bill prior to his veto message. The committees considering the bill had requested suggestions from the Truman administration, but did not receive any.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Conley, "Triumphs, tribulations, and turnip day sessions in the 80th Congress," in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oNCTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=taft+hartley+override+bipartisan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KdVjQCrQOF&amp;sig=JAcSq1oc5o4AeJX2qdJIQ5KudFc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCWoVChMIqMS4t6G_xwIVCY6SCh25qQH9#v=onepage&amp;q=taft%20hartley%20override%20bipartisan&amp;f=false ''Congress and Harry S. Truman: a Conflicted Legacy''], Donald A. Ritchie (ed.) (Truman State University Press, 2011) 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; With the administration taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. A clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21–21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal51-889-29661-1405696 "Truman-Taft stands – point by point"], ''CQ Almanac'', 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Truman's all-out effort to stop the veto override, Congress overrode his veto with considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17712">'''Abortion restrictions in the United States''' are laws intended or resulting in restricting the availability or practice of [[abortions in the United States]]. Though the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' recognized a legal right for a woman in the United States to get an abortion, and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' invalidated certain restrictions that create an undue burden on women seeking abortions, these cases permit states to make certain restrictions in the guise of regulation of the practice, but which they argue do not create an “undue burden”. Some state laws that impact on the availability of abortions have been upheld. Regulations imposed by individual states that have impacted on the availability of abortions, particularly in the 2010s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/21/16624980-40-years-after-roe-v-wade-more-states-restricting-abortion?lite |publisher=[[NBCNews.com]] |title=40 years after Roe v. Wade, more states restricting abortion |first=Tracy |last=Connor |date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; include requiring a woman seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound, requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and long waiting periods after the first consultation with the abortion provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/31/all-states-except-oregon-now-limit-abortion-access/ |title=All states except Oregon now limit abortion access |first=Sarah |last=Kliff |date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, abortion remains legal in all U.S. states, and every state has at least one abortion clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consult.womenhelp.org/en/using-abortion-pills-for-safe-abortion-usa |title=Using Abortion Pills for Safe Abortion in the USA.

==Laws targeting abortion clinics==
[[File:Abortion_Access_in_Texas_Verifying_Current_State_Lic_Facilities_and_Female_Pop_Proximity.png|thumb|right|This map shows 60-mile access to abortion providers in Texas]]
Some states impose regulations that apply only to [[abortion clinic]]s, sometimes called TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws, which according to ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'' impose standards that may be arbitrary or difficult to implement and are aimed at closing abortion clinics. For example, some laws require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as [[Outpatient surgery|ambulatory surgical center]]s, which entail renovations that are prohibitively expensive for some clinics.

Other regulations require doctors performing abortions to have [[hospital admission|admitting privileges]] at a nearby hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author-link = Congressional Research Service |title =Abortion, Hospital Admitting Privileges, and Whole Woman’s Health v. Cole |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44205.pdf |accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hospitals refuse admitting privileges to doctors who perform abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/06/abortion-foes-latest-backdoor-ban |date=June 27, 2011 |title=Abortion Foes' Latest Backdoor Ban |first=Kate |last=Sheppard |work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrepublic-gosnell"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/113052/kermit-gosnell-trial-how-pro-lifers-are-using-him-pass-new-laws# |work=The New Republic |date=May 1, 2013 |title=The Kermit Gosnell Effect |first=Nora |last=Caplan-Bricker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of admitting privileges laws and other TRAP laws include the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], the [[American Public Health Association]], and the [[American Medical Association]], which have argued that such laws are medically unnecessary and that abortion is already very safe in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=Daniel|last2=Baum|first2=Sarah|last3=Fuentes|first3=Liza|last4=White|first4=Kari|last5=Hopkins|first5=Kristine|last6=Stevenson|first6=Amanda|last7=Potter|first7=Joseph E.|title=Change in abortion services after implementation of a restrictive law in Texas|journal=Contraception|date=November 2014|volume=90|issue=5|pages=496–501|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2014.07.006|pmid=25128413|pmc=4179978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2015/12/14/11/04/opposition-to-requirements-for-hospital-admitting-privileges-for-abortion-providers | title=Opposition to Requirements for Hospital Admitting Privileges and Transfer Agreements for Abortion Providers | work=APHA Policy Statement | accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2011, the crimes of [[Kermit Gosnell]], a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia, spurred federal and state bills to more strictly regulate abortion facilities. Opponents of the restrictions questioned whether stricter regulations would have deterred Gosnell, who was alleged to be knowingly in violation of existing regulations.&lt;ref name="newrepublic-gosnell" /&gt;

Supporters of [[Texas Senate Bill 5]], which included requirements for abortion clinics to meet ambulatory surgical center regulations and for abortion clinic doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, said the bill improved health care for women and babies. Opponents of the bill said it created unnecessary regulations for the purpose of reducing access to abortions. At the time of the bill's signing into law in 2013, five of the state's forty-two abortion clinics met the law's requirements. Courts had blocked enforcement of similar laws in some other states, pending lawsuits challenging their constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324448104578613742718906114 |title=Texas Gov. Perry Signs Abortion Restrictions Into Law |agency=Associated Press |work=Wall Street Journal |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal district judge determined this law to be unconstitutional, finding that the admitting privileges requirement placed an undue burden on a person seeking to have an abortion;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2013-10-28/federal-judge-texas-abortion-limits-unconstitutional |agency=AP |title=Federal judge: Texas abortion limits unconstitutional |first=Chris |last=Tomlinson |date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this decision was reversed by the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], resulting in the immediate closure of all but seven abortion clinics in the state, all of these in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/02/texas-abortion-law/16608857 |work=USA Today |first=William A. |last=Welch |date=October 3, 2014 |title=Appeals court lets Texas enforce law that restricts abortions}}&lt;/ref&gt; For patients in Texas's Rio Grande valley, the nearest clinic is now 300 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/fewer-texas-abortion-providers-court-ruling-051150407.html |first=Paul J. |last=Weber |date=October 2, 2014 |agency=AP |title=Fewer Texas abortion providers after court ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passage of a 2013 Wisconsin law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, three Catholic hospital systems in the state intended to deny admitting privileges to abortion providers. Wisconsin's attorney general said this intent violated the Church Amendment of 1973, which prohibits hospitals receiving federal funds from discriminating against a doctor on the basis of whether the doctor provides abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-attorney-general-says-hospitals-cant-deny-admitting-privileges-to-abortion-doctors-b997046-218608951.html |title=Hospitals can't deny admitting privileges to abortion doctors, AG says |date=August 7, 2013 |last=Ahmed |first=Akbar |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maryland, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', something "rare in this era of polarized abortion politics" occurred when laws that significantly tightened the licensing and inspection of abortion clinics were supported by those on both sides of the abortion issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/us/marylands-path-to-an-accord-in-abortion-fight.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws targeting methods of practice==
On November 4, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the state of Oklahoma to the overturning, on constitutional grounds, of a bill intended to ban the practice of terminations of early pregnancies via medications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-lets-stand-an-oklahoma-ruling-that-a-state-abortion-law-is-unconstitutional/2013/11/12/339d1598-4bdd-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html'Supreme Court lets stand an Oklahoma ruling that a state abortion law is unconstitutional'], [[Washington Post]], Juliet Eilperin, 12 November 2013. Retrieved 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory ultrasounds==
As of March 2012, 20 states require women seeking an abortion to have an [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] before being allowed to have the procedure. Mandatory [[transvaginal ultrasound]]s have been particularly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Mother Jones |first=Kate |last=Sheppard |date=March 5, 2012 |title=Mandatory Transvaginal Ultrasounds: Coming Soon to a State Near You |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/transvaginal-ultrasounds-coming-soon-state-near-you}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, for instance, even if previous ultrasounds had indicated severe congenital defects, a woman seeking an abortion was required under a 2012 law to have another ultrasound done, "administered by her abortion doctor, and [she had to] listen to a state-mandated description of the fetus she was about to abort", though state-issued guidelines later did away with that ultrasound if the fetus had an "irreversible medical condition".&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

On November 12, 2013,  the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the state of Oklahoma to the overturning of a bill that mandated compulsory ultrasound examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-lets-stand-an-oklahoma-ruling-that-a-state-abortion-law-is-unconstitutional/2013/11/12/339d1598-4bdd-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html'Supreme Court lets stand an Oklahoma ruling that a state abortion law is unconstitutional'], [[Washington Post]], Juliet Eilperin, 12 November 2013. Retrieved 12 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waiting periods==
Some states require that a person seeking an abortion wait for a period of one to six days, variously, after visiting the provider for the first time and before having the abortion. The state of South Dakota requires that the patient obtain mandatory counseling from an anti-abortion [[crisis pregnancy center]] during this time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/08/usa-abortion-southdakota-idUSL1N0C08R420130308 |agency=Reuters |date=March 8, 2013 |title=South Dakota governor signs extended abortion wait period law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetal heartbeat bills==
{{Main|Fetal heartbeat bill}}
This type of legislation requires either that a woman be required to listen to her fetus's heartbeat should she attempt to obtain an abortion,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://ideas.time.com/2011/10/17/the-next-abortion-battleground-fetal-heartbeats/ The Next Abortion Battleground: Fetal Heartbeats]&lt;/ref&gt; or, more rigidly, that abortion become illegal as soon as a heartbeat can be detected, which is sometimes as early as six weeks.

==Physician scripts==
In some states, a doctor who is asked to perform an abortion is required to read a prepared script to the patient in order to secure [[informed consent]]. These scripts may include medically inaccurate information intended to persuade the patient not to have an abortion, such as [[abortion-breast cancer hypothesis|the claim that the abortion will increase the risk of breast cancer]] or [[abortion and mental health|of psychological problems]], which are not supported by mainstream medical organizations or scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/22/169059701/we-have-no-choice-a-story-of-the-texas-sonogram-law |publisher=NPR |date=January 22, 2013 |title='We Have No Choice': A Story Of The Texas Sonogram Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0806742 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |title=South Dakota's Abortion Script — Threatening the Physician–Patient Relationship |first=Zita |last=Lazzarini |date=November 20, 2008 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0806742 |pmid=19020321 |volume=359 |issue=21 |pages=2189–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2013, 12 states require that women be given information on the ability of a fetus to [[Neonatal perception#Fetal pain and abortion|feel pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Policies in Brief: An Overview of Abortion Laws|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Rounds]]'', the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a South Dakota law requiring doctors to give patients false or misleading information about the suicide risk in women who have abortions was not unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://verdict.justia.com/2012/08/20/can-the-government-require-doctors-to-provide-misleading-information-to-patients-seeking-abortions Can the Government Require Doctors to Provide Misleading Information to Patients Seeking Abortions?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
A 1997 Louisiana law creates a civil cause of action for abortion-related damages, including damage to the unborn, for up to ten years after the abortion. The same law also bars the state's Patient's Compensation Fund, which limits malpractice liability for participating physicians, from insuring against abortion-related claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5th Circuit finds no undue burden in law curbing liability protection for abortion providers |url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/5th_circuit_finds_no_under_burden_in_law_curbing_liability_protection_for_a/ |last=Cassens Weiss |first=Debra |work=ABA Journal |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abortion providers challenging Louisiana law suffer setback at 5th Circuit |url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/09/5th_circuit_court_of_appeals_r.html |last=Catalanello |first=Rebecca |work=Times-Picayune |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attorney for the [[Center for Reproductive Rights]], which opposes the law, said the law is an attempt to drive abortion providers out of practice, and that every completed abortion imposes [[strict liability]] under the law because abortion necessarily involves damage to the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge forbids La to enforce abortion liability law |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765564221/Judge-forbids-La-to-enforce-abortion-liability-law.html |last=Mcconnaughey |first=Janet |work=Deseret News |agency=Associated Press |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting==
As of 2010, 46 of 50 states and the District of Columbia had either mandatory or voluntary reporting of abortion statistics. According to an associate of the [[Guttmacher Institute]], reporting requirements were generally "benign" and treated confidentially, but the requirements in some states have become more intrusive.&lt;ref name="abc-oklahoma"&gt;{{cite news |title=Okla. Strikes Down Law That Would Have 'Undressed' Women |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/oklahoma-abortion-law-declared-unconstitutional-single-subject-rule/story?id=9891050 | last=Donaldson James |first=Susan |work=ABC News |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 Oklahoma law, overturned by a federal court in 2010, would have required doctors to report information from a 37-question form about every woman receiving an abortion to the state health department for publication in an online registry.&lt;ref name="abc-oklahoma" /&gt; A lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging the law, said the law would have made public potentially identifying details about women, and was intended to dissuade women from seeking abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oklahoma abortion law to force women to list personal details online |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6370300/Oklahoma-abortion-law-to-force-women-to-list-personal-details-online.html |work=Daily Telegraph |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Lamb (politician)|Todd Lamb]], who sponsored the law as a state senator, called it "essential in protecting the sanctity of life" and "pro-life".&lt;ref name="abc-oklahoma" /&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Wartime Law on Industrial Property''' (Kogyo Shoyuken Senji Ho) was a [[Japanese law|special law]] enacted by the Government of [[Japan]] in 1917, which declared that any patents owned by the nationals of countries in a state of war with Japan no longer had effect. The impact of this law was both immense and lasting, because a majority of drugs had been invented in [[Germany]] and this law meant that Japanese companies could produce them without worrying about [[patent infringement]].&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistics]] show that the number of new drugs in 1914 was 658 of which 103, or 16 per cent were developed domestically. By 1928, the number increased 2.6 times to 1,705 and the proportion of domestic development increased to 46 per cent. Further, by 1936, the number of new drugs increased to 2,402 of which more than half, 57 per cent were developed domestically.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"/&gt;

The '''Williamson trade-off model''' is a theoretical model in the [[economics]] of [[industrial organization]] which emphasizes the trade-off associated with [[horizontal merger]]s between gains resulting from lower [[marginal cost|costs of production]] and the losses associated with higher [[price]]s due to greater degree of [[monopoly power]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beynon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=26m3RXKUuQIC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EzE7a9bfw&amp;sig=B1AVpfWqnzC70fm35GJso3iNedQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TGJNS--gM5X2NYWx2O4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "The Routledge critical dictionary of global economics"], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was first presented by [[Oliver Williamson]] in his 1968 paper "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs" in the ''[[American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831653 "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs"], The ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 58, No. 1 (March 1968), pp. 18–36&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson argued that ignoring efficiencies that may result from proposed mergers in antitrust law "fail[ed] to meet the basic test of economic rationality".&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Judit Cseres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ov6Vr9ev57MC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3EjP3DuHN&amp;sig=2pKrldsGbpaPlwTodsQoWzSlpjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mmVNS9ehCJT4NY2wgOoM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20&amp;f=false "Competition law and consumer protection"], Kluwer Law International, 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic idea of the model==

Suppose that a given industry is initially characterized by [[perfect competition]] and has a constant unit cost of production equal to ''c1'' (assumed the same across all firms in the industry). Because of competition, the market price of the good produced will be equal to this unit cost, which means that firms in the industry earn [[normal profit]]s, as captured by the [[producer surplus]] (the area below the market price, but above the supply/unit cost curve).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

Suppose further that after a merger between firms in the industry takes place, unit costs fall to ''c2&lt;c1'' as a result of [[economies of scale]] or other forms of [[synergy]]. However, the industry is now less competitive, with a [[monopoly]] being the most extreme example. Since the firm is no longer a [[price-taking|price taker]], the price it charges will be above the (now lower) unit cost. For a monopoly, for example, the price will be set where the unit/marginal cost intersects [[marginal revenue]]. This means that the amount of [[consumer surplus]], the area below the demand curve and above the price, will be lower.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

The change in overall [[social surplus]] of the market depends on whether the increase in producer surplus due to lower production costs is larger or smaller than the fall in consumer surplus due to higher prices. Note that it is theoretically possible that the fall in unit costs due to the merger could be sufficiently large that the post merger monopoly price ends up being lower than the pre merger competitive price in which case both producer and consumer surplus would increase. In that situation no trade-off exists and the merger is unambiguously beneficial to all market participants. More generally however, a horizontal merger can involve both costs and benefits.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

==Applications in antitrust policy==

One implication of the Williamson model is that the gains from cost reduction do not have to be "large" in order to outweigh the losses that result from higher prices.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
This is because the welfare losses associated with the latter tend to be "second-order" (graphically, they are triangles), while the gains tend to be "first-order" (rectangles). What this means is that the gains from the merger would have to be very small, or alternatively, the demand for the good in question would have to be relatively quite [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]] for social surplus to decrease.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

A broader conclusion of the model is that [[Competition law|antitrust]], or competition, policy should be "discretionary".&lt;ref name=CLP&gt;C. L. Pass, Bryan Lowes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ffoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QlHt5pe8fZ&amp;sig=mPH4gLVvdECPF4N0agXsdwZ5sZE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Business and microeconomics: an introduction to the market economy"], Routledge, 1994, p. 175-178&lt;/ref&gt; That is, government regulators who are faced with a proposed merger need to examine each proposal on a case by case basis. In some instances, the cost savings might make it worth the loss of competition, while in others they will not. This is in contrast to a "non-discretionary" policy where regulators set certain standards that any industry must meet - for example, that no firm has more than 20% market share. Then, they do not actually examine the potential gains or losses to consumer or producer surplus from a proposed merger, but only its impact on meeting the set standard - for example, whether or not the merger will increase a single firm's market share above 20%.&lt;ref name=CLP/&gt;

The model has been applied to the study of mergers in the US rail freight industry and the US food industry, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ivaldi, Marc
and McCullough, Gerard, [http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=5000 "Welfare Trade-Offs in US Rail Mergers"], Centre for Economic Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjib Bhuyan, [http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20469/1/sp01bh01.pdf "Impact of Vertical Mergers on Food Industry Profitability: An Empirical Evaluation"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in evaluation of actual antitrust laws by American legal scholar and judge [[Robert Bork]].&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;Richard Fink, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119536139/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 "General and partial equilibruim theory in Bork's antitrust analysis"], paper delivered at the Annual Western Economic Association International Conference, Las Vegas, Nevada, June 24–28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; A regulatory approach based on the model was popular in the United States in the 1980s and influenced much antitrust legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A McNutt, "Signalling, Strategy and Management Type" [http://www.patrickmcnutt.com/docs/Chapter%207%20Antitrust%20And%20Public%20Policy.pdf Chapter 7, Antitrust &amp; Public Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and limitations==

#The "trade-off" in the Williamson model involves a gain in producers' (firms') surplus and a loss in consumers' surplus. Thus, in focusing the analysis on total surplus, it neglects distributional issues and treats changes in both consumers' and producers' welfare symmetrically. However, anti-trust policy as actually practiced in many countries ([[Europe]], [[Canada]] and [[United States|US]]) appears to have the goal of maximizing consumer surplus (or this goal is stated explicitly).&lt;ref name=Zulfi&gt;S. Zulfi Sadeque, Competition Bureau, Industry Canada, Government of Canada, [http://www.apeccp.org.tw/doc/Workshop/w1996/doc8.htm "Some Aspects of Competition Policy: the View from Canada"], APEC Workshop on Competition Policy and Deregulation, August 17–18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, as long as the post-merger market price is higher than pre-merger, the fact that producer surplus and firm profits rise is immaterial from the point of view of the regulators. In that case, only those mergers in which the fall in unit cost is sufficiently large to ensure a lower price after the merger should be permitted.&lt;ref name=AnP&gt;Michael Whinston in Mark Armstrong, Robert Porter, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bvrn72h8dDwC&amp;pg=PT449&amp;lpg=PT449&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=suaMKWbVit&amp;sig=7NbiL-LKBviWCutjwAFTGPGD88U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Handbook of industrial organization, Volume 3"], Elsevier, 2007, p. 2373-2375&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Williamson model is not applicable in [[European Community competition law]] and is controversial in Canada.&lt;ref name=Monti&gt;Giorgio Monti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHe2PklOqPUC&amp;pg=PT292&amp;lpg=PT292&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJXOk9GH_P&amp;sig=P5OnAH62CPCxHSLGDN97qysclZY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FmNNS7e4KInUM-W-9fcM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "EC competition law"], Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;
#The simplest version of the model compares a situation where initially the market is competitive to a situation where the post-merger market is not. However, if initially price exceeds marginal cost (i.e. the market is not competitive), further increases in price have a "first order" effect on consumer surplus (graphically, they are trapezoids).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model is limited in that it only considers the effect of the merger on price charged by the firm(s). However, in most real life situations, firms compete on many other aspects other than price, for example product quality, capacity, research and development, and product differentiation. These variables are also likely to be affected by a merger and the basic model does not capture these effects. However, the model can and has been extended in these directions by more recent work.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model ignores the possibilities that the same cost reductions and efficiency gains (once technologically feasible) may arise on their own due without any need for a merger,&lt;ref name=Paddy&gt;Paddy McNutt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZTdn1JtFV4C&amp;cd=1e "Law, economics and antitrust: towards a new perspective"], Edward Elgar Publishing, 2005, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; for example via own-firm investment.
