In 2014 there was no primary outdoor global [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] championship, as neither the [[Summer Olympics]] nor the [[World Championships in Athletics]] occurred in the year. The [[2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and the [[2014 IAAF Continental Cup]] were the foremost global events to be held in 2014. The [[2014 IAAF World Relays]] marked the debut of the new international competition exclusively for [[relay (athletics)|relay races]].

The [[2014 IAAF Diamond League|Diamond League]] entered its fifth year as the foremost seasonal [[track and field]] series. The [[2014 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] and the [[2014 IAAF World Race Walking Cup]] were the highest level competitions for those disciplines. Major regional events which took place in 2014 include the [[2014 European Athletics Championships|European Championships]], [[2014 African Championships in Athletics|African Championships]], and [[Athletics at the 2014 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]].

'''Bell MTS Iceplex''' is an [[ice hockey]] facility located in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].  The {{convert|172000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building is owned and operated by [[True North Sports and Entertainment]], which also owns [[Bell MTS Place]] in downtown Winnipeg.  The [[Winnipeg Jets]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and [[Manitoba Moose]] of the [[American Hockey League]] use the Iceplex as their practice and training facility.&lt;ref name="ws1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/grand-opening-for-mts-iceplex-103776984.html|title=Grand opening for MTS Iceplex|publisher=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Bell MTS Iceplex, originally known as the True North MoosePlex Hockey Canada Centre, was built on time and within its budget, at a cost of $26.6 million Canadian.  The [[Government of Canada|federal]] and [[Manitoba#Government|provincial governments]] contributed $11.7 million, while True North covered the remaining $14.9 million.&lt;ref name="ws1"/&gt;  In exchange for public funding, True North guaranteed use of the facility for local amateur and recreational hockey.&lt;ref name="wfp1"/&gt;

In April 2010, as an extension of its naming rights relationship with [[Bell MTS|MTS]] for [[MTS Centre]], the facility was renamed MTS Iceplex.&lt;ref name="cbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2010/04/09/mb-mooseplex-mts-iceplex-winnipeg.html|title=Mooseplex renamed MTS Iceplex|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2011-01-05|date=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 21,000 square foot addition to the Iceplex was completed in 2016.  As part of this expansion, new training facilities and office space were built for the Jets and Moose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtsiceplex.ca/news/tnse-announces-addition-to-mts-iceplex/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907175241/http://www.mtsiceplex.ca/news/tnse-announces-addition-to-mts-iceplex/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-09-07|title=TSNE announces addition to MTS Iceplex|publisher=MTSIceplex.com|date=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was renamed the Bell MTS Iceplex following [[Bell Canada]]'s acquisition of MTS in 2017.&lt;ref name="cbc-belmtsplace"&gt;{{cite web|title=MTS Centre, Iceplex renamed following Bell takeover of MTS|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/mts-centre-renamed-1.4137892|website=CBC News|agency=Canadian Press|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The Iceplex is open year-round and consists of four arenas, each with an NHL [[Hockey rink#North American|regulation size ice surface]].  Each rink is sponsored by a local business: the [[Canadian Tire]] Arena seats 1,350 spectators, while the [[RE/MAX]], [[Assiniboine Credit Union]], and Red River Co-op Arenas seat 225 each.&lt;ref name="cbc1"/&gt;
The Iceplex also features dryland training facilities, 22 dressing rooms, a pro shop, a restaurant and bar, conference rooms, and office space for [[Hockey Manitoba]], [[Hockey Canada]], and True North.&lt;ref name="Quick Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mts1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/156373/la_id/1.htm|title=IF YOU BUILD IT… MANITOBA'S U17 HOSTS SHOWCASE NEW ARENAS|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]|accessdate=2011-06-17|date=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex is located just outside the west [[Perimeter Highway (Winnipeg)|Perimeter Highway]], next to [[Assiniboia Downs]], [[Pointe West AutoPark]], and the [[Red River Exhibition]] grounds.

==Events==
The Iceplex was one of three venues that hosted the [[2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge|2011 World Under 17 Hockey Challenge]], a major international hockey tournament held annually by Hockey Canada.  It was slated to host the [[2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge|2012 tournament]] also, but Hockey Canada, at the request of True North, decided to relocate the tournament to [[Windsor, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeymanitoba.mb.ca/news.php?id=685|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101135950/http://www.hockeymanitoba.mb.ca/news.php?id=685|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-01|title=Winnipeg to host World Under-17 Hockey Challenge in 2011 and 2012|publisher=[[Hockey Manitoba|HockeyManitoba.ca]]|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjhlhockey.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=343:windsor-ont-to-host-2012-world-under-17-hockey-challenge-&amp;catid=5:news&amp;Itemid=14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407112515/http://www.mjhlhockey.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=343:windsor-ont-to-host-2012-world-under-17-hockey-challenge-&amp;catid=5:news&amp;Itemid=14|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-04-07|title=Windsor, Ont., to host 2012 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge|publisher=[[Manitoba Junior Hockey League|mjhlhockey.ca]]|accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddy Burner.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Two prepared Buddy Burners]]

A '''Buddy Burner''' is a simple [[stove]] made from a [[Tin can|can]] and part of a [[corrugated paper]] box. It is usually [[fuel]]ed by [[paraffin wax]] but other fuels, such as boiled butter, animal fat or diesel fuel, can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=November–December 1994|author=Dian Thomas|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/9411/a-tcan.html|title=Tin Can Cookery|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is usually used for cooking but can also provide heat.

The most common type of buddy burner is made from a tuna or cat food can because of the low profile. The corrugated paper is cut into a strip as wide as the can is tall then rolled into a tight coil and placed in the can. The can is then filled with fuel (if fueled with paraffin wax it is first melted) leaving enough of the paper above the fuel to act as a wick. Using paraffin wax as a fuel has two advantages. First, when the burner cools the wax hardens making it convenient to keep in the burner for later use. Second, it is safe to refuel the burner while it is operating since placing solid paraffin wax on top of the burning stove involves no danger of the fresh fuel igniting explosively.

Since oxygen is necessary for combustion, holes may need to be punched around the top of the can to allow air to enter, and to provide a way for combustion gases to escape around the pot.

==Safety precautions==
Modern canning techniques now employ coatings that may produce toxic fumes when burning and can cause [[metal fume fever]], and care must therefore be taken to ensure that cans used for burning are uncoated plain metal. Such coatings are usually used for tomatoes and other acidic foods.

[[Candle]]s are usually made of paraffin wax and can be melted to put into a Buddy Burner. However, candles or paraffin wax blocks should be melted in a double boiler so that they cannot catch fire.

'''[[Cape Verde]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]], with two competitors in track and field, and one in powerlifting. The country sent a single athlete ([[Artimiza Sequeira]]) to the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008 Games]], to compete in the women's shot put, discus and javelin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=CPV&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Cape Verde at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rio de Janeiro 2016, sprinter Gracelino Barbosa won Cape Verde's first Paralympic medal, a bronze in the Men's 400m T20.

Cape Verde has never taken part in the [[Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=CPV&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Cape Verde at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concord Speedway''' is a [[motorsports]] facility located in the town of [[Midland, North Carolina]], southeast of [[Concord, North Carolina]]. The complex features a 1/2 mile tri-oval and a 1/4 mile oval which also features a 1/5 mile oval.  The original track that was located off Poplar Tent Road in Concord held twelve [[NASCAR]] Grand National (now [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]]) events between 1956 and 1964.

==History==
The current track was built by race promoter Henry Furr.  Originally a four-tenths of a mile oval dirt-track, Furr reconfigured the track adding a true dog-leg to the back stretch.  The track now has three unique turns.  Pit road entrance is located in the tri-oval prior to turn three.  The track had seating for over 12,000 fans prior to a recent downsizing that saw the turn one grandstands converted to a dirt berm.

The track has hosted the Big 10 series at two different times.  Most recently [[Late model|super late models]] competed in the series from 2003-2005.  [[Freddie Query]] is the track's all-time leader in wins and claimed the Big 10 series championship in 2004 and 2005.

The track stopped weekly racing on the half-mile tri-oval in 2008 and only has the quarter mile oval currently running weekly, which features [[Legend car racing|INEX Legends]], INEX Bandoleros, the Davis Mini Cup Racing Series and quarter midgets.

In 2015, racing returned to the half mile tri-oval after not having a race on it in 2014 with the PASS South super late models and [[Koma Unwind Modified Madness Series]] running on Memorial Day weekend.

==Notable competitors==
Winners and competitors at the track include Freddy Query, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Jack Sprague]], [[Ernie Irvan]], Bobby Labonte, [[Justin Labonte]], [[Clay Rogers]],Jimmy Simpson, [[Bobby Gill]], Dale Earnhardt Sr., [[Bobby Measmer Jr.]], Ryan Preece, and Jeff Melton.

==Statistics==
The park consists of two tracks: a 1/2 mile tri-oval and a 1/4 mile oval. Originally the 1/4 mile oval was a 1/5 mile oval and the 1/4 mile was added later. The 1/5 mile is still there but only used for Davis Mini Cups and quarter midgets. The tri-oval seats 8,500 fans with room for 28 [[Recreational vehicle|RVs]], while the 1/4 mile track seats 2,050.  Additionally, the track has several air conditioned suites located behind the main grandstand.

The track is active as a site for the filming of several television commercials, television shows, and music videos.

In [[baseball]], the '''designated hitter rule''' is the common name for [[Major League Baseball]] Rule 5.11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2015/official_baseball_rules.pdf |title= Official Baseball Rules 2015 edition |format=PDF |date= December 10, 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the [[American League]] in 1973. The rule allows teams to have one player, known as the '''designated hitter''' (or '''DH'''), to bat in place of the [[pitcher]]. Since 1973, most collegiate, amateur, and [[professional baseball|professional]] leagues have adopted the rule or some variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Charles C.|title=Our Game: An American Baseball History|publisher=Macmillan|year=1991|page=290|isbn=9780805015942}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB's [[National League]] and [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s [[Central League]] are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ringolsby|first=Tracy|title=Tide is turning toward a universal DH|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=January 20, 2016|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/national-league-could-add-dh-before-long/c-162404308|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar Martinez 1997.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Martínez]], who spent most of his career as the full-time designated hitter for the [[Seattle Mariners]]]]

==Major League Baseball rule==
In Major League Baseball, the designated hitter is a hitter who does not play a position, but instead fills in the batting order for the pitcher. The DH may only be used for the pitcher (and not any other [[position player]]), as stated in Rule 5.11. Use of the DH is optional, but must be determined prior to the start of the game. If a team does not begin a game with a DH, the pitcher (or a pinch-hitter) must bat for the entire game.

The designated hitter may be replaced as DH only by a player who has not entered the game. If a [[pinch hitter]] bats for, or a [[pinch runner]] runs for, the DH, that pinch-hitter or pinch-runner becomes the DH.

The designated hitter can be moved to a fielding position during the game. If the DH is moved to another position, his team forfeits the role of the designated hitter, and the pitcher or another player (the latter possible only in case of a multiple substitution) would bat in the spot of the position player replaced by the former DH. If the designated hitter is moved to pitcher, any subsequent pitcher (or pinch-hitter thereof) would bat should that spot in the batting order come up again (except for a further multiple substitution). Likewise, if a pinch-hitter bats for a non-pitcher, and then remains in the game as the pitcher, the team would forfeit the use of the DH for the remainder of the game, and the player who was DH would become a position player (or exit the game).

Unlike other positions, the DH is "locked" into the batting order. No multiple substitution may be made to alter the batting rotation of the DH. In other words, a [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]] involving the DH and a position player is not legal. For example, if the DH is batting fourth and the catcher is batting eighth, the manager cannot replace both players so as to have the new catcher bat fourth and the new DH bat eighth. Once a team loses its DH under any of the scenarios discussed in the previous paragraph, the double switch becomes fully available, and may well be used via necessity, should the former DH be replaced in the lineup.

===Interleague play and exhibitions===
{{See also|Home advantage#Causes}}
In Major League Baseball, during [[interleague play]], the application of the DH rule is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams. If the game is played in an American League park, the designated hitter may be used; in a National League park, the pitcher must bat or else be replaced with a pinch-hitter. On June 12, 1997, [[San Francisco Giants]] outfielder [[Glenallen Hill]] became the first [[National League]] player to DH in a regular-season game, when the Giants met the American League's [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington|The Ballpark in Arlington]] in interleague play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TEX/TEX199706120.shtml |title=June 12, 1997 San Francisco Giants at Texas Rangers Box Score and Play by Play |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=1997-06-12 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the DH rule was not applied to the [[World Series]]. From 1973 to 1975, all World Series games were played under National League rules, with no DH and pitchers batting. For [[1976 World Series|1976]], it was decided the DH rule would apply to all games in a World Series, regardless of venue, but only in even-numbered years. [[Cincinnati Reds]] first baseman [[Dan Driessen]] became the first National League player to act as a DH in any capacity (regular season or postseason) when he was listed as the DH in the first game (he was the DH in all four Series games that year). This practice lasted through [[1985 World Series|1985]]. Beginning in [[1986 World Series|1986]], the DH rule was used in games played in the stadium of the American League representative.

There was initially no DH in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Beginning in 1989, the rule was applied only to games played in American League stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS198907110.shtml |title=July 11, 1989 All-Star Game Play-By-Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this era, if the All-Star Game was scheduled for an American League stadium, fans would vote in the DH for the American League's starting lineup, while the National League's manager decided that league's starting DH. Since 2010, the designated hitter has always been used by both teams regardless of where the game is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Schlegel&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100428&amp;content_id=9645460&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Modifications in place for All-Star Game &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' scheduled 2010 series against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] at [[Rogers Centre]] was moved to Philadelphia, because of security concerns for the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit|G-20 Summit]]. The Blue Jays wore their home white uniforms and batted last as the home team, and the [[designated hitter]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100511&amp;content_id=9963194&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| title=Jays' set vs. Phillies moved to Philadelphia| last=Bastian| first=Jordan| date=May 11, 2010| publisher=Major League Baseball| accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was the first occasion of the use of a designated hitter in a National League ballpark in a regular-season game with [[Ryan Howard]] being the first player to fill the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100625&amp;content_id=11570842&amp;notebook_id=11570848&amp;vkey=notebook_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi| title=Howard is first DH at Citizens Bank Park| last1=Zolecki| first1=Todd| last2=Schonbrun| first2=Zach| date=June 25, 2010| website=Philadelphia Phillies| publisher=MLB| accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[spring training]] games, the home team chooses whether the designated hitter is used. Occasionally National League teams opt to use the designated hitter, usually when a player is recovering from an injury.

==Background and history==
The rationale for the designated hitter rule arose comparatively early in the history of professional baseball. It was observed that, with a few exceptions—most notably [[Babe Ruth]], who began his career as a pitcher with the [[Boston Red Sox]]—pitchers are usually selected for the quality of their pitching, not their hitting, and that most pitchers were weak hitters who had to be batted ninth in the batting order and pinch-hit for late in games when their team was trailing. The designated hitter idea was raised by [[Philadelphia Athletics]] manager [[Connie Mack]] in 1906,&lt;ref name="SI Wulf"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/flashback/1993/distinguished_history|title=Distinguished History|author=Wulf, Steve|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=1993-04-05|accessdate=2008-03-31|quote=The following excerpt is from the article "Why the Pitcher Ought to Bat", which first appeared in the ''Philadelphia North American'' and was reprinted in the Feb. 3, 1906, edition of ''Sporting Life'': The suggestion, often made, that the pitcher be denied a chance to bat, and a substitute player sent up to hit every time, has been brought to life again, and will come up for consideration when the American and National League Committees on rules get together. This time Connie Mack is credited with having made the suggestion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was not the first to propose it. The rumors were that he grew weary of watching [[Eddie Plank]] and [[Charles Bender]] flail at pitches when at bat. Mack's proposal received little support and was even lambasted by the press as "wrong theoretically". The notion did not die. In the late 1920s, [[National League]] president [[John Heydler]] made a number of attempts to introduce a 10th-man designated hitter as a way to speed up the game, and almost convinced National League clubs to agree to try it during spring training in 1929.&lt;ref name="SI Wulf"/&gt;

However, momentum to implement the DH did not pick up until the pitching dominance of the late 1960s. In 1968, [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games and [[Bob Gibson]] had a 1.12 [[earned run average|ERA]], while [[Carl Yastrzemski]] led the [[American League]] in hitting with only a .301 average. After the season, the rules were changed to lower the mound from 15 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches and change the upper limit of the strike zone from the top of a batter's shoulders to his armpits. In addition, in 1969 spring training, both the American League and National League agreed to try the designated pinch hitter (DPH), but they did not agree on the implementation. Most NL teams chose not to participate. On March 6, 1969, two games utilized the new DPH rule for the very first time. Two newly formed expansion teams, the [[Montreal Expos]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]], would participate in one such game, and the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Washington Senators (1961-1971)|Washington Senators]] in the other. On March 26, 1969, Major League Baseball nixed the idea for the time being. However, a four-year trial in which the [[International League]] and four other minor leagues started using the DH for their games began that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://sabr.org/research/historical-evolution-designated-hitter-rule&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other experimental baseball rule changes of the 1960s and 70s, the DH was embraced by Oakland A's owner [[Charlie O. Finley]]. On January 11, 1973, Finley and the other American League owners voted 8–4 to approve the designated hitter for a three-year trial run.&lt;ref name="SI Wulf"/&gt; On April 6, 1973, [[Ron Blomberg]] of the New York Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League Baseball history, facing Boston Red Sox right-handed pitcher [[Luis Tiant]] in his first [[plate appearance]]. "Boomer" Blomberg was [[base on balls|walked]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197304060.shtml |title=April 6, 1973 New York Yankees at Boston Red Sox Box Score and Play by Play |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=1973-04-06 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the first season of the DH was that the American League posted a higher batting average than the National League, something which has remained consistent to this day.

In response to increases in American League attendance because of the designated hitter{{cn|date=May 2018}}, the National League held a yes/no vote on August 13, 1980, to determine whether or not the league would adopt the designated hitter. A majority of the 12 member teams was necessary to pass the rule, and the measure was expected to pass. However, when the teams were informed that the rule would not come into effect until the 1982 season, Philadelphia Phillies vice president [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] was unsure of how the team owner, [[Ruly Carpenter]], wanted him to vote. Unable to contact Carpenter, who was on a fishing trip, Giles was forced{{by whom|date=October 2017}} to abstain from voting. Prior to the meeting, Harding Peterson, general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was told to side with the Phillies.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} The final tally was four teams voting for the DH (Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres), five votes against (Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, and San Francisco Giants), and three abstentions (Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Houston Astros). Five days after that meeting, the Cardinals fired their general manager, John Clairborne, who was the leading proponent for the adoption of the DH rule, and the National League has not held another vote on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN Baseball Tonight, airdate Friday, 12am, July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

As time passed, the designated hitter rule has ended up offering American League managers multiple strategic options in setting their teams' lineups: they can rotate the DH role among part-time players (for example, using a left-handed batter against a right-handed pitcher and vice versa) or they can employ a full-time designated hitter against all pitchers. It also allows them to give a healthy everyday player a partial day off, or to give an injured player the opportunity to bat without exposing him to re-injury while playing in the field.

In recent years, full-time DHs have become less common, and the position has been used to give players a partial off-day, allowing them to bat but rest while the other team is batting. This option comes in very handy when a team's lineup includes several older players. The 2012 Yankees, for example, rotated five players through the DH spot during the season, all of them over 34 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of players compile over 400 at-bats as a DH each year.

With the [[Houston Astros]] having moved to the American League for the [[2013 MLB season]], which requires interleague play season-round (as well as the Astros to start using a DH full-time), there is debate within MLB to unify the rules of the two leagues, with either the American League returning to its pre-1973 rules and have the pitcher hit, like the National League or the National League adopting the DH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320&amp;content_id=27435474&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Debate over the designated hitter still rages &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] indicated that the National League might adopt the DH for the 2017 season when a new collective bargaining agreement is created after the current one expires on December 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/the-national-league-is-getting-closer-to-adding-dhs--maybe-in-2017-194448854.html|title=The National League is getting closer to adding DHs, maybe in 2017 |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date= |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later backtracked on this statement to say that he does not see unification coming any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14643947/mlb-commissioner-rob-manfred-says-no-foreseeable-change-designated-hitter-rule-coming|title=Rob Manfred: No foreseeable change to DH rule coming|last=Crasnick|first=Jerry|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 26, 2016|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the DH rule was not adopted by the National League for 2017.

==Awards==
Major League Baseball presents an annual award to the most outstanding designated hitter of the season, called the [[Edgar Martínez Award]]. Renamed for the former [[Seattle Mariners]] DH after his retirement in 2004, the Outstanding DH Award was introduced in 1973 and has been handed out every season since, except 1994 due to a players' strike. Notable winners include [[Edgar Martínez|Martínez]] (five times) and [[David Ortiz]] (seven times, five consecutively).

DHs have generally not made much impact on the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award]] or [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] voting, because of the relative rareness of the full-time DH and the fact that the DH does not contribute on defense.

During the 1993 season [[Paul Molitor]] became the first player to win the [[World Series Most Valuable Player]] award while playing 137 of 160 games (85.63%) as a designated hitter; [[David Ortiz]] did the same in 2013. Ortiz was also the first designated hitter to win the [[ALCS MVP]] in 2004. Ortiz and Molitor played games at first base in their World Series MVP seasons, leaving [[Hideki Matsui]] in 2009 as the only World Series MVP to never play the field that season.

Among Hall of Famers, [[Paul Molitor]] and [[Jim Rice]] were, until 2014, the only inductees to even have played at least 25% of their games at DH. With the election of [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]] on January 8, 2014, he became the first Hall of Famer to play the majority of his games at DH. Edgar Martínez is currently on the ballot (received 70.4% of votes in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2018|2018]]).

==Debate==
There is considerable debate over whether or not the designated hitter rule should be removed,&lt;ref name= USATODAYproscons /&gt;&lt;ref name= ESPNproscons /&gt;  while some&lt;ref name= USATODAYproscons /&gt; have argued that the [[National League]] should adopt it. On the other hand, there are also fans who enjoy the fact that the American and National Leagues use different rules. Two generations of fans of American League teams have grown up with the designated hitter rule being in place, so some may consider the designated hitter to be as much a traditional part of baseball as the pitcher taking his turn at bat is for fans of National League teams.

Critics often argue that use of the designated hitter introduces an asymmetry to the game by separating players into classes, creating offensive and defensive specialization more akin to [[American football]]. Opponents of the rule believe it effectively separates pitchers, other fielders, and designated hitters into separate roles that never cross, possibly causing issues with promoting '[[batting cage]]' players whose scope of experience is extremely limited. However, when the pitcher bats alongside everyone else, all nine players must take turns at the plate and in the field, and the hybridization of roles requires that everyone knows other roles in addition to their own.

The designated hitter rule also changes managerial strategy in late innings. In the National League, a manager must decide when to let a pitcher bat or remove him, as well as with whom to pinch-hit and where or if that player should take the field afterward. When the decision to remove a pitcher is made, the manager may also elect to [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], delaying the new pitcher's turn at bat. A designated hitter reduces the need for late-inning [[pinch hitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Votano |first=Paul |year=2013 |title=Stand and Deliver: A History of Pinch-Hitting |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-1588-6 |oclc=52047315 |pages=172–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the designated hitter&lt;ref name= USATODAYproscons&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2004-09-06-dh-pros-and-cons_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Renewing the DH debate | date=September 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ESPNproscons&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB – Designated place in history |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to the fact that it has extended many careers, and, in a few cases, ''created'' long, productive careers for players who are weak fielders or have a history of injuries, such as [[Edgar Martínez]] and [[David Ortiz]]. [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] members [[George Brett]], [[Carl Yastrzemski]], and [[Paul Molitor]] continued their careers longer than they ordinarily would have without the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.startribune.com/sports/?id=145283795 |title=Sports |publisher=M.startribune.com |date=2012-04-01 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Bonds]], who spent his entire career in the National League and actually won eight [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Gloves]] earlier in his career, was used strictly as a DH later in his career when the [[San Francisco Giants]] played away interleague games due to his poor fielding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/who-should-sign-barry-bonds/ |title=Who should sign Barry Bonds? |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that extending careers of older players is less of an advantage and more of a disadvantage, filling spots that otherwise may have been taken by younger players who end up not finding a place in the major leagues.

Interleague play has added a new wrinkle to the controversy. Some feel that it is not fair to ask an AL team to play without their DH when their roster has not been set up to do so, or on the other hand, to ask an NL team to use a DH when they may not have an appropriate player. [[Baseball Commissioner|Major League Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] once proposed that the [[road (sports)|road]] team's rules should be followed for interleague games in order to combat this advantage for the home team, but the idea has not received traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-06-24-baseball-interleague_x.htm|title=Interleague: Natural rivals, but more often than not|author=Antonen, Mel|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-06-24|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of pitcher [[Chien-Ming Wang]] due to an interleague game injury has been cited in support of the designated hitter. On June 15, 2008, Wang was taken out of an interleague game versus the [[Houston Astros]] due to a right foot injury he sustained while running the bases, something he was not used to doing, since pitchers do not bat in the American League. Wang was diagnosed with a torn [[Lisfranc ligament]] and a partial tear of the [[peroneus longus]] of the right foot. The cast was removed on July 29, but the extensive rehabilitation process prevented Wang from being an effective pitcher at the major league level since. Yankees part-owner [[Hank Steinbrenner]] showed frustration with pitchers having to bat in the National League and suggested that the League  "join the modern age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2008/06/16/2008-06-16_irate_hank_steinbrenner_blames_chienming.html|date=June 16, 2008|title=Irate Hank Steinbrenner blames Chien-Ming Wang's injury on NL rules|first=Anthony|last=McCarron|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designated hitter outside Major League Baseball==

===Minor League Baseball===
Among [[Minor League Baseball]] teams, Rookie and Single-A level leagues use the DH in all games. At the Double-A and Triple-A level, when both teams are National League affiliates, pitchers may bat. In the [[Pacific Coast League]], pitchers only hit when both clubs are NL affiliates ''and'' both clubs agree to have their pitchers hit. The reason for the difference is that as players get closer to reaching the majors, teams prefer to have the rules mimic, as closely as possible, those of the major league teams for which the players may soon be playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/faq.jsp?mc=milb_info General Minor League information] (at "6. Do pitchers hit in the Minor Leagues?"). MiLB.com. Minor League Baseball. Retrieved 2009-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International baseball leagues===
The DH is used in most professional baseball leagues around the world. One notable exception is the [[Central League]] of Japan, where pitchers bat as they do in the National League. Japan's [[Pacific League]] adopted the designated hitter in 1975. When teams from different leagues play against each other in the [[Japan Series]] or interleague games, the DH rule is adopted if the Pacific League's team hosts the game. The DH rule is used in the Japanese minor leagues.

===Amateur baseball===
In American high schools and other amateur baseball leagues that use [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) rules, a DH may bat in place of one player in any position, not just a pitcher. Many coaches use a designated hitter in place of the weakest hitter in the lineup, if they use one at all. In amateur baseball, many pitchers are also good hitters and will often play another position (or even DH) when not pitching. [[High school baseball in Japan|Japanese high school baseball]] is one of the few amateur baseball leagues in the world that has never used the designated hitter rule at all. In [[high school baseball in South Korea]], the rule has been adopted since 2004. [[American Legion]] rules, on the other hand, allow the DH only to bat for the pitcher; prior to 1995, the use of the DH was not allowed in Legion baseball at all.

In [[college baseball]], [[NCAA]] rules state that the designated hitter must hit for the pitcher, but in many instances the pitcher is also a good hitter, and the coach may elect to let the pitcher bat in the lineup. If the pitcher opts to bat for himself, he is treated as two separate positions – a pitcher and a designated hitter (abbreviated P/DH on the lineup card) – and may be substituted for as such (i.e. if he is removed as the pitcher, he may remain as the designated hitter and vice versa). However, if a player who starts a game as a P/DH is relieved as the starting pitcher, he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the DH, and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as the pitcher unless he immediately moves to another defensive position, in which case the new pitcher must assume the spot in the batting order of the fielder the P/DH substituted for, and the DH is lost for the remainder of the game. Conversely, a player who begins the game as the DH, but not as the pitcher, may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the DH (in effect becoming a P/DH), be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the DH.

In [[Little League Baseball]], the DH is not used. However, a league may adopt a rule which requires all players present and able to play to be listed in the batting order (such that the order contains more than nine players), and thus all players will have a turn to bat even when they are not assigned a fielding position. Players in the batting lineup without a position on the field are given the position designation ''extra hitter'' (EH), a position seen occasionally in other amateur organizations (both youth and adult).

The '''Son Moix Stadium''' ({{lang-ca| Estadi de Son Moix}})  ({{lang-es| Estadio de Son Moix}}) is a football stadium located in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]]. Previously known as the '''Iberostar Stadium''' ({{lang-es|iˈβeɾostar esˈtaðjo|}}) and the '''ONO Estadi''', the Son Moix Stadium was built for the [[1999 Summer Universiade]] in Palma. It is the stadium where [[RCD Mallorca]] has played its football matches since 1999, when the club obtained an agreement with the city council to use it for the next 50 years. It replaced the [[Estadio Lluís Sitjar]]. The stadium, located in the north-west of the city can be seen from Palma's main motorway and is situated in the industrial zone Can Valero in Palma, 3&amp;nbsp;km from the center of the city, 13&amp;nbsp;km to [[Palma de Mallorca Airport]].

The stadium can hold 23,142 spectators making it the biggest stadium situated in the [[Balearic Islands]]. The stadium was designed as a bowl shape with two stands having two tiers with the option of increasing both ends of the stadium to a fully two-tiered stadium, this would increase capacity to over 40,000. Due to financial problems at the club this expansion has never been pursued. The stadium often has a small temporary stand on the athletics track, which can easily be removed for athletics events.

==Future==
The expansion of the stadium now looks highly unlikely due to the club proposing to build a new 40,000 all-seater stadium for the club and its spectators. The project by ''[[Estudio Lamela]]'' includes altogether:

* A new 40,000-seat stadium
* The construction of three skyscrapers of 34, 22, and 16 floors high, the highest of them reaching 160 meters. The towers would have a total area of 200,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* A convention center
* Shopping mall and a large parking lot.

However, this operation is still a long way to go, because currently this is only a proposal by the club and no plans have been put through. Furthermore, it is not even known where the stadium could be located due to the island's size and accessibility, as well as the place of the current stadium (municipal property); the entity proposes other four possible locations. However, the institutions prefer that a new stadium build on the site of the current edifice, if they approve the commencement of the project.

'''Karate''' was first introduced '''in the United Kingdom''' by [[Vernon Bell]] who was taught by [[Henry Plée]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wH4ld9EcwwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=vernon+bell+karate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUzKLK-6bVAhUJIMAKHY67B4YQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=vernon+bell+karate&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt Karate|first=Chris|last=Thompson|date=26 July 2017|publisher=New Holland Publishers|accessdate=26 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The martial art was spread to the United Kingdom by various karate masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|date=1 October 1969|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations  like the [[Karate Union of Great Britain]] were established to spread the martial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10242291.Early_days_of_karate_to_feature_in_BBC_television_programme/|title=Early days of karate to feature in BBC television programme|website=York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K9IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Karate+Union+of+Great+Britain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6Jh7VIP-PIKAaZ_3gMAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Karate+Union+of+Great+Britain&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|date=1 April 1983|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The martial art was initially  controversial due to Anthony Creamer using karate to commit murder in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ks4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=three+seconds+to+die&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfn77m3ZPYAhULmrQKHQQOBNYQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=three+seconds+to+die&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|first=Active Interest Media|last=Inc|date=1 March 1967|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|accessdate=18 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japan Karate Association]] sent many karate masters to Britain to spread the [[Shotokan]] style of karate.

Other styles of karate became established in the U.K. such as [[Wado ryu]] due to [[Tatsuo Suzuki]] and  [[kyokushin]] via [[Steve Arneil]].

==National board==

British Karate Federation is the largest Karate Association in the United Kingdom. Its is a member of the [[British Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbtaekwondo.co.uk/new-martial-arts-partnership-announced-between-karate-and-taekwondo/|title=New Martial Arts Partnership Announced Between Karate and Taekwondo|date=8 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Karate Federation  is a member of the European umbrella organization [[European Karate Federation]] (EKF) as well as the World Association for [[World Karate Federation]] (WKF).

On the part of the British Olympic Committee, the British Karate Association is the only Karate Association authorized to send athletes to the Olympic Games.

==International competition==

'''Macron S.p.A.''' is an Italian sporting apparel company, based in [[Crespellano]], [[Province of Bologna|Bologna]]. It is considered a European leader in the production of active sportswear.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

Macron operates in three main business areas:

* Teamwear: for [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], [[handball]], [[five-a-side football]] and [[Running events|running]].
* Merchandising: official kits, free-time apparel and accessories for the supporters of Macron's sponsored clubs.
* Leisurewear: sports-inspired apparel for those wishing to wear Macron off the field.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;
{{TOC limit|4}}

==History==
Macron was founded in 1971 as a distributor of American sportswear brands in Italy.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt; A major expansion of the organization took place in 1994, coincident with relocation and consolidation to [[Crespellano]].&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

Macron began providing teamwear to [[Professionalism in association football|professional football]] in 2001, its first contract being with [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;  Expansion beyond the domestic Italian market began in 2005.&lt;ref name="boltonnews2014" /&gt;

In 2014, Macron secured a four-year agreement with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for [[naming rights]] to their home stadium, resulting in renaming in July 2014 to [[Macron Stadium]].&lt;ref name="boltonpr2014" /&gt;  Macron supplanted [[Reebok]] as the stadium namesake, and will provide the club's kit.&lt;ref name="boltonpr2014" /&gt;

==Corporate governance==
{{As of|2014}}, Macron's [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) was Gianluca Pavanello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=224331982 | title=Gianluca Pavanello | accessdate=12 Feb 2015 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2014}}, the company's [[President (corporate title)|president]] was Francesco Bromioli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/17038730-francesco-bormioli | title=Francesco Bormioli, Macron SpA | accessdate=12 Feb 2015 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorships and customers ==
Macron [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] or co-sponsors a variety of organizations, teams and events.  In many cases, the wording of published accounts does not make a clear demarcation between a case where a team has purchased [[Kit (association football)|kit]]  (''aka'' uniforms or strip) versus those whose kit has been provided as a matter of sponsorship.  Following is a partial list of these sponsorship/customer relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9517">This is a list of countries according to the best position achieved by athletes of these nations at [[List of hockey world championships|major world tournaments]] in [[roller hockey]]. The [[:Category:Variations of hockey|variations of hockey]] included here are [[roller hockey (quad)|quad]] (also known as rink hockey) and [[roller in-line hockey|inline hockey]]. Aside from the best results achieved at the [[world championships]] for each variation, also included are results from the [[World Games]] and the [[World Roller Games]]. Medals earned by athletes from defunct [[National Olympic Committee|NOCs]] or historical teams have been merged with the results achieved by their immediate [[succession of states|successor states]], as follows: [[Czech Republic]] inherits medals from [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Germany]] inherits medals from [[West Germany]]. Medals earned by teams from [[England]] are merged with results from [[Great Britain]]. Results achieved in youth, junior or U20 events were not considered for the making of this table, neither were [[parasports|para]] adaptations of hockey ([[power hockey]]).

In [[mixed martial arts]], he has competed for [[K-1 Hero's]], [[Bellator MMA]], [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]], [[Road Fighting Championship|Road FC]] and also participated in the [[Dynamite!!

On September 24, 2016 Siliga won the [[Road Fighting Championship|Road FC]] [[Openweight]] Tournament at [[Road Fighting Championship|Road FC]] 33 by knocking out [[Choi Hong-man]] of [[South Korea]].

==Career==
===Kickboxing===
Mighty Mo made his K-1 debut on February 15, 2004 at "K-1 Burning" event in Japan against [[Hiraku Hori]]. He knocked out Hori at 1:22 in 4th round by right hook. After losing in semifinals at his first 8-man tournament in Las Vegas against fellow American [[Dewey Cooper]], Mighty Mo made a huge comeback four months later at the ''Battle of Bellagio II'', winning his first K-1 GP Championship by knocking out [[Brecht Wallis]] in 2nd Round at the tournament finals.

After a year off from [[K-1]], he made his comeback on March 4, 2007 at [[Yokohama]], Japan. His opponent was [[Choi Hong-man]] (218&amp;nbsp;cm) from Korea who had never been knocked out before on his K-1 career until Mighty Mo (185&amp;nbsp;cm) managed to land his trademark right overhand punch, winning the fight by [[KO]] at 0:50 KO in 2nd round. At that time, he held the record for the "Biggest height difference wins (33cm)" resulting in a KO in favor of the shorter in K-1 history and possibly in kick-boxing as well as in boxing in history ([[Nicolai Valuev]], 213&amp;nbsp;cm, is only 28&amp;nbsp;cm taller than [[Ruslan Chagaev]] - 185&amp;nbsp;cm). But on December 31, 2007, at the [[K-1 Dynamite]] Tournament in Osaka, the record was surpassed by Danish [[Karate]] fighter [[Nicholas Pettas]] (180&amp;nbsp;cm), who was able to KO the 217&amp;nbsp;cm Korean Kim Young-hyun (37&amp;nbsp;cm height difference).

On April 28, 2007, Mo entered the [[K-1 World GP 2007 in Hawaii]] tournament as a heavy favorite. He knocked out all three of his opponents and earned himself a spot in the [[K-1 World GP 2007 in Seoul Final 16|K-1 World GP 2007 Elimination]] in Seoul, Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.onthemat.com/articles/Hawaiian_Punch_Courtesy_Mighty_Mo_Hari_Wins_the_Belt_04_29_2007.html| title=Mighty Mo and Hari Wins the Belt| accessdate=2007-04-29| publisher=Hawaiian Punch| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109210148/http://www.onthemat.com/articles/Hawaiian_Punch_Courtesy_Mighty_Mo_Hari_Wins_the_Belt_04_29_2007.html| archivedate=2007-11-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2007, Mighty Mo lost to defending K-1 [[Super Heavyweight]] Champion [[Semmy Schilt]] by unanimous decision at the [[K-1 World GP 2007 in Amsterdam|K-1 World GP in Amsterdam]]. Semmy used his reach to keep Mighty Mo at bay, and Mo was unable to get in close enough to land his devastating overhand right. Rumors surfaced that Mo was nursing a knee and hand injuries from his previous fights. He had fought 7 times in the last 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fansofk1.com/article?aID=693| title=K-1 Las Vegas 2007 Press Conference
| accessdate=2007-08-09| publisher=fansofk1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[K-1 World GP 2007 in Seoul Final 16|K-1 Final Eliminations 2007]] on September 29, he faced [[Choi Hong-man]] again and lost by unanimous decision. During the fight, he was kicked in the groin and was inexplicably ruled a [[knockout#knockdown|knockdown]] by the referee. He was quoted in the post-fight interview: ''"I feel I was robbed. I should have won. There was a lot of favoritism here. He must have picked up a new technique-a kick below the belt. So next time I'll wear a thicker [[Protective cup|cup]]. And next time I want to fight somewhere else."

In his next three fights he went 1-2, losing to [[Paul Slowinski]] and [[Keijiro Maeda]] before defeating Justice Smith on August 9, 2008.

Mighty Mo had replaced [[Andrei Arlovski]] at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16]] held in Seoul against Romanian Raul Catinas and won by unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Mighty Mo fights in the Final to feed his massive family| publisher=K-1| url=http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/news/2010/1122_wgp_01.html| date=| accessdate=2010-12-14| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125110451/http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/news/2010/1122_wgp_01.html| archivedate=2010-11-25| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Mo was the only American to make it into the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final]] on December, 11th. His quarterfinal opponent was [[Peter Aerts]] who beat him via [[Knockout#Technical knockout|TKO]] in the first round.

Mighty Mo was knocked out by Russian [[Sergei Kharitonov]] at the United Glory World Series Finals in Moscow on May 28, 2011.

As of October 2011 Mighty Mo is currently on a six fight losing streak in Kickboxing, all but one by knockout.

He was next set to face [[Rick Roufus]] in Las Vegas on October 22, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivier-angelini.org/article-wck-muaythai-mighty-mo-vs-rick-rufus-li-ning-vs-lerdsila-85275903.html WCK Muay Thai: Mighty Mo vs. Rick Roufus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not medically cleared to compete.

He rematched Raul Cătinaş, the last man he was able to defeat, in a non-tournament bout at the ''SuperKombat World Grand Prix 2012 Final'' in Bucharest, Romania on December 22, 2012 and lost on a unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2127:superkombat-wgp-final-2012-fight-card-ustream-ppv-available&amp;catid=37:kickboxing SuperKombat WGP Final 2012: Fight Card, Ustream PPV available]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2155:superkombat-wgp-2012-final-live-results-watch-here&amp;catid=39:europe&amp;Itemid=59 SuperKombat WGP Final: Live Results, Watch Here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mo next faced K-1 kickboxing champion [[Semmy Schilt]] at the [[Dynamite!! 2008|Fields Dynamite!! 2008]] 2008 event in an MMA bout, in which Schilt defeated Mighty Mo in the first round by [[triangle choke]].

====DREAM====
In 2009, Mo signed with the [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] promotion in Japan.  He was set to fight [[Mirko Filipović|Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipović]] at [[Dream 10|DREAM 10]] but Cro Cop pulled out after re-signing with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].

Mo instead made his debut against [[Josh Barnett]] at [[Dream 13|DREAM 13]] on March 21, 2010 and lost via submission in the first round.

====Bellator MMA====

'''Physical literacy''' is a fundamental and valuable human capability that can be described as a disposition acquired by human individuals encompassing the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that establishes purposeful physical pursuits as an integral part of their lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Almond&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=L|author2=Whitehead, M|title=Physical Literacy: Clarifying the Nature of the Concept|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2012|volume=7|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental and significant aspects of physical literacy&lt;ref name=Whitehead&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=M|title=Physical Literacy throughout the Lifecourse|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=0-415-48743-9|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are:

* everyone can be physically literate as it is appropriate to each individual’s endowment
* everyone’s physical literacy journey is unique
* physical literacy is relevant and valuable at all stages and ages of life
* the concept embraces much more than physical competence
* at the heart of the concept is the motivation and commitment to be active
* the disposition is evidenced by a love of being active, born out of the pleasure and satisfaction individuals experience in participation
* a physically literate individual values and takes responsibility for maintaining purposeful physical pursuits throughout the lifecourse.
* charting of progress of an individual’s personal journey must be judged against previous achievements and not against any form of national benchmarks

==General==

The concept of physical literacy has been developed over many years. It is seen, by a growing number of people, as the goal of the school subject, [[physical education]]. However, whilst this is extremely relevant, it is important to recognise that physical literacy is not restricted to the school years – it is relevant throughout the lifecourse.  In this respect, six phases of physical literacy have been identified: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and older adulthood.&lt;ref name="Whitehead &amp; Murdoch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=M|author2=Murdoch, E|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past few years there has been considerable interest, worldwide, in the concept of physical literacy. In Great Britain, a number of local authorities have adopted it as an overall guiding principle for their work in school-based physical education. In countries such as Northern Ireland and Canada, physical literacy has been the focus for considerable rethinking in respect of children’s physical development and has consequently been the inspiration behind the development of new programmes. In [[India]] this principle has been adapted by [[Sportism]]&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; for training the [[Indian people|Indian]] kids on the basis of Physical literacy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportism.co.in|title=Sportism - Multi-Sports Training|website=www.sportism.co.in|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Multi-Sport Programme for Children|last=TImes|first=Adyar|date=May 22, 2016|work=|via=News Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been a number of interpretations of the concept that have moved away from the central tenets of physical literacy. For example, in some instances physical literacy has been the name given to a programme of fundamental movement skills, implying that the concept is solely about the acquisition of physical competence. Other interpretations have focused on knowledge and understanding, particularly in the games context. Both these scenarios include elements of physical literacy, but do not represent the whole story.&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

==Attributes==

A physically literate individual will display the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

* Physical literacy can be described as a disposition characterised by the motivation to capitalise on innate movement potential to make a significant contribution to the quality of life.
* All human beings exhibit this potential. However, its specific expression will depend   on individuals’ endowment in respect of all capabilities, significantly their movement potential, and will be particular to the culture in which they live.
* Individuals who are physically literate will move with poise, economy and confidence in a wide variety of physically challenging situations
* Physically literate individuals will be perceptive in ‘reading’ all aspects of the physical environment, anticipating movement needs or possibilities and responding appropriately to these with intelligence and imagination
* These individuals will have a well-established sense of self as embodied in the world. This, together with an articulate interaction with the environment, will engender positive self-esteem and self-confidence
* Sensitivity to and awareness of embodied capability will lead to fluent self-expression through non-verbal communication and to perceptive and empathetic interaction with others
* In addition, physically literate individuals will have the ability to identify and articulate the essential qualities that influence the effectiveness of their own movement performance, and will have an understanding of the principles of embodied health with respect to basic aspects such as exercise, sleep and nutrition

==Physical Literacy Worldwide==

===Canada===
'''Physical literacy''' is the mastering of fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills that permit a child to read their environment and make appropriate decisions, allowing them to move confidently and with control in a wide range of physical activity situations. It is the foundation of long-term participation and performance to the best of one’s ability. Physical Literacy is the cornerstone of both participation and excellence in physical activity and sport. Ideally, physical literacy is developed prior to the [[Adolescent development|adolescent growth spurt]].&lt;ref&gt;Physical Literacy | Canadian Sport for Life: http://www.canadiansportforlife.ca/learn-about-canadian-sport-life/physical-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundamental Movement Skills and Fundamental Sport Skills'''

To become physically literate children need to master the 13 fundamental movement skills:&lt;ref name="cs4l"&gt;Balyi, I., Way, R., Norris, S., Cardinal, C. &amp; Higgs, C. (2005). Canadian sport for life: Long‐term athlete development resource paper. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Locomotor and Body Skills:'''
* [[Walking]]
* [[Running]]
* [[Balance (ability)|Balance]]
* [[Ice skating|Skating]]/[[Skiing]]
* [[Jumping]]
* [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]
* [[Cycling]]
* [[Skipping rope|Skipping]]

'''The Sending Skills'''
* Throwing
* [[Kick (football)|Kicking]]
* Striking

'''The Receiving Skills'''
* Catching
* Trapping

Each skill will involve a series of developmental stages that the child will go through in order to master that particular skill.
Fundamental Sport Skills involve using Fundamental Movement Skills in a sport specific setting (i.e. a child can kick a ball, this is a Fundamental Movement Skill; when she kicks a penalty kick in a soccer game, she has used this skill as a Fundamental Sport Skill, the skill of kicking a penalty kick).&lt;ref name="DPL"&gt;Higgs, C., Balyi, I. &amp; Way, R. (2008). Developing physical literacy: A guide for parents of children ages 0 to 12: A supplement to Canadian sport for life. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Four Environments'''

To develop physical literacy children should learn fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills in each of the four basic environments:
# On the ground: as the basis for most games, sport, dance and physical activities
# In the water: as the basis for all aquatic activities
# On snow and ice: as the basis for all winter sliding activities
# In the air: basis for [[gymnastics]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and other aerial activities&lt;ref name="cs4l" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DPL" /&gt;

| White to move. White can [[checkmate]] with a sham queen sacrifice as follows: 1.Qh7+ Kf8 2.Qh8+ Nxh8 3.Rxh8{{chessAN|#}}
}}

In [[chess]], a '''queen sacrifice''' is a move giving up a [[Queen (chess)|queen]] in return for [[Chess tactics|tactical]] or positional compensation. 
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Queen sacrifice: real versus sham==
In his book ''The Art of Sacrifice in Chess'', [[Rudolf Spielmann]] distinguishes between ''real'' and ''sham'' [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]]. A sham sacrifice leads to a {{chessgloss|forced move|forced}} and immediate benefit for the sacrificer, usually in the form of a quick [[checkmate]] (or [[perpetual check]] or [[stalemate]] if seeking a [[draw (chess)|draw]]), or the recouping of the sacrificed {{chessgloss|material}} after a forced {{chessgloss|line}}. Since any amount of material can be sacrificed as long as checkmate will be achieved, the queen is not above being sacrificed as part of a combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Spielmann]]|title=The Art of Sacrifice in Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible reasons for a sham queen sacrifice include:

* a forced checkmate after the opponent takes the queen;
* more than adequate material compensation (say, a [[rook (chess)|rook]] and two [[knight (chess)|knights]]) after a forced continuation;
* clearing the way for a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]]'s [[Promotion (chess)|promotion]] to a replacement queen;
* the subsequent capture of the opponent's queen, resulting in some positional or material gain.

On the other hand, "real" sacrifices, according to Spielmann, are those where the compensation is not immediate, but more positional in nature. Because the queen is the most powerful piece (see [[chess piece relative value]]), positional sacrifices of the queen virtually always entail some partial material compensation (for example, sacrificing the queen for a rook and bishop).

An opportunity may arise where a player trades off his queen for other pieces which may together be of equal or greater value than the queen. [[Bent Larsen]] remarks that giving up the queen for a rook and two {{chessgloss|minor pieces}} is sometimes called a "queen sacrifice", but since a rook plus two minor pieces is more valuable than the queen, he says it should not be considered a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Larsen|title=Lærebok i sjakk|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A celebrated game by [[Adolf Anderssen]], the [[Immortal Game]], featured a queen sacrifice as part of White's final mating combination. In the diagram position Anderssen gave up his queen with 22.Qf6+{{chesspunc|!}} to divert Black's knight: the game continued 22...Nxf6 23.Be7{{chessAN|#}}. This is an example of a sham queen sacrifice, as the sacrifice resulted in checkmate only one move later.  White was able to mate since his minor pieces were clustered around the Black king, while Black's pieces were either undeveloped or trapped in the white camp and so unable to defend.

* In another celebrated game by Anderssen, the [[Evergreen Game]], Anderssen once again sacrificed his queen for a mating combination, playing 21.Qxd7+{{chesspunc|!!}}: the game continued 21...Kxd7 22.Bf5+ Ke8 23.Bd7+ Kf8 24.Bxe7#. The game is another example of a sham queen sacrifice. Although Black is on the verge of checkmating White, his defences around his king are weak, so White was able to mate.

* In the "[[Morphy versus the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard|Opera Game]]", Morphy gave his queen in a final {{chessgloss|deflection}} sacrifice in order to mate.

* ''Philidor's Legacy'' refers to a [[smothered mate]] involving a queen sacrifice.

* For an example of a "real" (positional) queen sacrifice, [[Rudolf Spielmann]] presented this game against [[Jorgen Moeller]] in Gothenburg 1920. In the first diagram Black threatens 9...Bg4 winning the queen, since she must not leave the f2-square unguarded under threat of checkmate. But Spielmann played 9.Nd2! allowing Black to win his queen, and after 9...Bg4 10.Nxe4 Bxf3 11.Nxf3 Qh6 12.Nf6+ Kd8 13.h4 the position in the second diagram was reached. White has only a knight and bishop for his queen and pawn, but his minor pieces are very active and the black queen is out of play. White won on move 28.&lt;ref&gt;The game can be played through [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1006597 here] The game was annotated by Spielmann in ''The Art of Sacrifice in Chess''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Hall''' ({{lang-sl|Rdeča dvorana}}) is a sports facility arena in [[Velenje]], [[Slovenia]]. It is a home arena of handball club [[RK Gorenje Velenje|Gorenje Velenje]]. The venue can accommodate 2,500 spectators.

==History==
The construction of the venue began on 24 August 1974 and was finished in late 1975. The Red Hall had its unofficial opening on 11 October 1975. At first, it was built to host different kinds of fairs, and not sports events.

After some modifications to the object, the government of Slovenia established the public company ''Sports and Recreation Center Red Hall'' ({{lang|sl|Športno-rekreativni center Rdeča dvorana}}) on 25 May 1992. Sports facility was renovated few times in its history, most recently in 2004.

==Usage==
Red Hall is a home arena of [[RK Gorenje Velenje|Gorenje Velenje]] (men's handball club) and [[ŽRK Velenje]] (women's handball club).

Previously hosted events:

*[[Boxing]] matches 
*[[2004 European Men's Handball Championship]] 
*[[Futsal]] events 
*[[Tennis]] events

In 2012, [[Brian Lara]] agreed to become one of the patrons. The stadium is also supported by [[British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]], [[Andrew Mitchell]], [[Jonathan Agnew]], [[Heather Knight (cricketer)|Heather Knight]], [[Peter Gummer, Baron Chadlington]]

The '''[[Seychelles]]''' was represented at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in Melbourne by a 32-member strong contingent comprising 22 sportspersons and 10 officials. The 2006 event was the fifth time the nation has entered the [[Commonwealth Games]], previously having won three medals &amp;ndash; two silver and one bronze. The Seychelles team competed in seven of the 16 sporting disciplines at the Games, including [[Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|athletics]], [[Boxing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|boxing]], [[Weightlifting at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|weightlifting]], [[Badminton at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|badminton]], [[Table Tennis at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|table tennis]], [[Aquatics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|swimming]] and [[Cycling at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|cycling]]. Reigning Seychelles Sportslady of the Year, [[Javelin throw|javelin]] specialist [[Lindy Leveau-Agricole]] was chosen to be the team's flag bearer during the opening ceremony.

Weightlifter Janet Thelermont became the Seychelles' first medal winner of the Games, taking a bronze in the Women's 69&amp;nbsp;kg class after lifting 205 [[kilogram|kg]] (95&amp;nbsp;kg [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]], 110&amp;nbsp;kg [[clean and jerk]]). This result made her only the fourth Seychellois to win a Commonwealth Games medal, and the first outside of [[boxing]]. Four days later, France-based athlete [[Céline Laporte]] became the nation's second medallist, taking bronze in the [[Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games#long jump women|women's long jump]] with a 6.57 metre leap, 25 centimetres further than her personal best before the Games, and was equal to that of [[Australia at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|Australian]] silver medallist [[Kerrie Taurima]].

'''Surakul Stadium''' ({{Lang-th|สนามกีฬาสุระกุล}}; {{rtgs|Sanamkila Surakun}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Phuket Province]], [[Thailand]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches.  The stadium holds 15,000 and was built in 1959.

The stadium co-hosted the [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup]]. The use of the Surakul Stadium for this tournament had to be hastily arranged. Stadiums in [[Bangkok]] were intended to be used but because of the airport takeovers in Bangkok by the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|PAD]] the AFF in consultation with the FAT decided to switch venues. Despite better stadiums being available in [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] ([[5th December Stadium]]); [[Chiang Mai]] ([[700th Anniversary Stadium]]) and [[Songkhla]] ([[Tinsulanon Stadium]]); the Surakul Stadium was chosen as all the teams could fly directly into Phuket.

The stadium also played host to the [[2009 King's Cup]] which included a notorious game involving Thailand and Lebanon where the latter walked off the pitch during the game as they became incensed by what they saw as biased refereeing.

The stadium will be used by [[Phuket F.C.]] for the 2009 season in the newly formed Division 2 Southern Region of the [[Thailand Division 2 League]].

The finals of the well-known Rugby 10's are also played there.

'''Swinney Recreation Center''' is a 1,600-seat arena&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umkckangaroos.com/fls/18300/pdf/2014-15%20Missouri-Kansas%20City%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Quick%20Facts.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=18300&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  Located on the campus of the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], it was the home of the [[UMKC Kangaroos]] men's basketball from 1969 to 1986, and again from 2010 to 2012. The UMKC women's basketball team currently plays most of their home games at Swinney Recreation Center.  The 2014-15 schedule shows three women's games at Municipal Auditorium with the remainder at the SRC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umkckangaroos.com/SportSelect.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=18300&amp;SPID=10800&amp;SPSID=89998&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinney Recreation Center was originally built in 1941 as '''Swinney Gymnasium''' by what was then the University of Kansas City.  It was named in honor of [[Edward F. Swinney]], chairman of First National Bank of Kansas City (now part of [[Bank of America]]), who had donated $250,000 toward the project.&lt;ref&gt;Bomgardner, Nicole. [http://unews.com/2010/10/04/campus-history-swinney-gymnasium Campus History: Swinney Gymnasium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331144006/http://unews.com/2010/10/04/campus-history-swinney-gymnasium/ |date=2012-03-31 }}. ''UNews'', 2010-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  Long known as "Old Swinney," it was renamed Swinney Recreation Center after a $14.5 million addition in 1988.  The facility now has five basketball/volleyball courts, four racquetball courts, a 25 meter indoor/outdoor pool, and exercise rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swinney Recreation Center|url=http://www.umkckangaroos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=18300&amp;ATCLID=1626244|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men's team played at Swinney during its days as an [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] member, and moved to [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]] when it joined the NCAA.  However, in 2010, UMKC announced that the men's basketball team would make Swinney its primary home court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umkckangaroos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=18300&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=204963820 UMKC announcement of the move back to Swinney]&lt;/ref&gt; They moved back to Municipal just two years later.

'''Ten Acres''', known as the '''Silverlake Stadium''' for sponsorship purposes, is a football ground in [[Eastleigh]], [[Hampshire]], England. It has been the home of [[Eastleigh F.C.]] since 1957 when they moved from Walnut Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/eastleigh.html Eastleigh] Pyramid Passion&lt;/ref&gt; The ground's record attendance is 5,025 for an [[FA Cup]] third round match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 9 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/10/bolton-darren-pratley-eastleigh-fa-cup Beleaguered Bolton take respite from Darren Pratley rescue at Eastleigh] The Guardian, 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eastleigh moved to Ten Acres in 1957 from their previous ground Walnut Avenue. In 1976 floodlights were installed.

In 2004, following promotion to the [[Isthmian League]], the old wooden stand was knocked down and a new 352-seat grandstand was built on the halfway line, stretching for just under a third of the pitch. Behind the motorway end hard standing was hard standing with a cover, this was named the Silverlake Stand. In 2006, the roof was widened across the Silverlake Stand to cover the whole width of the pitch.

Until 2006, the area opposite the grandstand was just hard standing backing into a tall fir trees. During the summer of 2006, a metal back and roof were added, along with an electronic scoreboard on the roof which was the Premier Telecom stand.

In 2009, 150 seats were added to the middle of the Silverlake Stand to give Eastleigh the necessary ground grading to compete in the Conference South playoffs.

On 20 December 2012, concerning the situation regarding the stadium, the club announced that an offer had previously been made to the board at ‘Ten Acre Holdings’ (the current owners). Following discussions the board of Ten Acre Holdings felt that they were willing to accept the offer presented to them as long as the remaining shareholders also felt a desire to sell the ground at this stage. On this basis a full shareholders meeting was called and the outcome was that a clear large majority were in favour of accepting the offer and that the sale of the freehold should progress. 
  
Ten Acre Holdings had been set up to safeguard the club and enable it to get back on a sound financial footing, which it has achieved over recent years. The proposed purchase was intended to provide the football club with the strongest possible opportunity to continue its progression.
  
The ground was, again, extensively redeveloped during 2014. New pitch side fencing was installed following damage to the previous fencing during Eastleighs championship winning game against Basingstoke. The former East stand at [[Sandy Park]] (home of [[Exeter chiefs]] RFC) was rebuilt along the premier telecom side of the ground as well as behind the clubhouse goal providing a covered terraced accommodation for 2,000 spectators. On 2 December 2014, the newly completed 2,290-seater South Stand was opened for the first time in a Conference Premier game against [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]] with the club allowing spectators in for free to celebrate the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Wendy|title=Eastleigh's new stand open free of charge to spectators tonight|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/football/eastleighfc/11638243.Eastleigh_s_new_stand_open_free_of_charge_to_spectators_tonight/|accessdate=2 December 2014|publisher=Daily Echo|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mackoy Community Stand was officially opened on 28 February 2015 with a club and stadium record attendance of 4,126 for a conference premier match against Macclesfield, a live match on BT sport that Eastleigh won 4–0.

The attendance record was broken a year later when 5,025 watched the club's FA Cup third round match against Bolton.

During 2016–17 season work began on a double story building behind the goal to allow for Eastlegh FC to cater for its increased fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Development Plans Submitted|url=http://www.eastleighfc.com/2016/05/20/new-development-plans-submitted/|publisher=Eastleigh FC|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stand behind the clubhouse goal has been affectionately named the "shed end" and is where most vocal home fans congregate.

"'''The Wreck of the Relationship'''" is the second episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 26)|26th season]] of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 554th episode of the series overall. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 5, 2014. The episode sees [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] send [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] onto a ship where their father-son conflict can be resolved, while she is left to manage her husband's [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] team.

==Plot==
When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] disrespects his father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s authority, Homer tries to be a stricter parent to Bart. Bart later refuses to eat one piece of [[broccoli]] at dinner, so Homer decides to sit at the table until Bart eats his broccoli, even though they both miss out on important things (Homer's fantasy football draft and Bart being able to watch as Martin Prince beat the hell out of Nelson Muntz). To end the impasse, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] makes two identical smoothies where one contains broccoli and the other doesn't, so that Bart can drink it and Homer can feel that Bart did something well. But Bart deliberately spills the smoothies, and his fighting with a newly enraged Homer leads [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to send them both to a "Relation Ship" with Captain Bowditch ([[Nick Offerman]]), where they can solve their relationship problems. While Homer recovers from [[scurvy]], Bart enjoys and excels at sailing and ends up being promoted to mid-ship man, who can give out direct orders to the crew members, much to Homer's chagrin.

Homer rebels against Bart's newfound position and eventually gets drunk of a flask of [[rum]]. When the captain snatches the rum of Homer, and reveals that he became a captain due to him being a [[recovering alcoholic]], the captain gives into temptation and drinks the rum, becoming drunk with Homer. A huge storm begins, and Bart is left in charge of the ship due to the captain's intoxication. Bart wants to sail around a lighthouse inlet to reach safe harbor, but Homer first says they need to drop anchor and batten down the hanches and then responds to Bart's complaint about Homer ignoring his authority by screaming that Bart NEVER listens to Homer's authority. To Homer's shock, Bart holds out a piece of broccoli he brought from home, eats it and then asks Homer to trust him. Homer does do so, and they combine to get the ship safely home, their relationship now in a much better place.

Meanwhile, Marge had to draft Homer's [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] team called "Somewhere Over the [[Dwayne Bowe]]" despite knowing nothing of the sport and horrifies him by choosing a roster made mostly of placekickers. Initially put off by the [[trash talking]] from Homer's friends, she is advised by [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] to beat them in fantasy football to end the impasse. She and Lisa study football in detail and realize that a coming major storm event in the U.S. will lead to teams attempting and making record numbers of field goals, and thus her roster ends up piling up huge amount of point and defeating all challengers, proving as the narrator says that "fantasy football is mostly just luck."

==Production==
[[File:Nick_Offerman_at_UMBC_(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Nick Offerman]] voiced the captain.]]
In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' actor [[Nick Offerman]] revealed that he had been recommended for the voice of Captain Bowditch by [[Mike Scully]], a writer on both ''The Simpsons'' and ''Parks and Recreation''. Offerman never before thought that he would play a role on ''The Simpsons'' as "They’re writing parts for [[Paul McCartney]]", and was delighted to be cast as a sailor due to his interest in naval literature.&lt;ref name=weekly&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snierson|first1=Dan|title=Nick Offerman on his 'Simpsons' guest spot and the end of 'Parks and Recreation'|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/03/nick-offerman-simpsons-parks-recreation/|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode received an audience of 4.27 million, the highest rated show on Fox that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy |first1=Amanda |title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Once Upon a Time', 'Resurrection' &amp; 'Revenge' Adjusted Up; 'Madam Secretary' Adjusted Down |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/311599/ |publisher=TV by the Numbers |date=October 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009022811/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/311599/ |archivedate=October 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B-, calling the series' habit of relying on family-based plots "both an infinite resource and a curse". He wrote that "Bowditch doesn’t have much of a personality, and the antics on the ship are benignly ordinary...[[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], [[Ned Flanders|Ned]], [[Cletus Spuckler|Cletus]], and some assorted sons are along for the ride, but don’t contribute much, either." However, he praised the sub-plot due to Marge's reactions to a male-dominated game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perkins|first1=Dennis|title=The Simpsons: "The Wreck Of The Relationship"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/simpsons-wreck-relationship-210121|accessdate=October 6, 2014|work=[[The A.V.

The '''World Bowls Tour Awards''' are the annual awards ceremony hosted by the [[World Bowls Tour]] to recognise the achievements of the [[bowls]] players who compete on the World Bowls Tour (WBT). The annual event is usually held in January, which take place just before the [[World Indoor Bowls Championships]] begins. The annual World Bowls Tour Hall of Fame induction happens at the annual awards ceremony too, which was launched along with the inaugural World Bowls Tour Awards ceremony in 2008.
