      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">'''Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes'''  - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals.  Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of [[light scattering by particles]].

==Geometric optics (ray tracing)==
{{main article|Geometric optics}}
Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as [[rainbow]]  of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles. 
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.

The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist [[Edme Mariotte|Edmé Mariotte]] (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction &lt;ref&gt;E. Mariotte, ''Quatrieme Essay.  De la Nature des Couleur'' (Paris, France:  Estienne Michallet, 1681).  Sun dogs as well as the 22° and 46° halos are explained in terms of refractions from ice crystals on [https://books.google.com/books?id=y10O12JjHskC&amp;pg=PA466#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 466 - 524].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from  hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.

'''''Beakman's World''''' was an American [[educational]] [[children's television show]]. The program is based on the [[Universal Press Syndicate]] syndicated comic strip ''[[You Can with Beakman and Jax]]'' created by Jok Church. The series premiered on Wednesday, September 16, 1992, on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]],&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broadcasting"/&gt; and on various other channels a few days later through syndication on 220 other channels.&lt;ref name="Broadcasting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="series_premiere"/&gt;

On September 18, 1993, it moved from national syndication to CBS's Saturday morning children’s lineup. At the peak of its popularity, it was seen in nearly 90 countries around the world.  The series was canceled in 1998.&lt;ref name="cancellation_date"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NY Times|title=For Quality TV, Mad Scientist Returns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/arts/television/30beak.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reruns returned to national syndication in September 2006, after which it was transferred to local stations such as [[KICU-TV|KICU]]. The show debuted a year prior to ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'', which covered similar topics. The show's host, [[Paul Zaloom]], still performs as Beakman in live appearances around the globe.

==Premise==
[[File:Beakman en México 07.jpg|thumbnail|right|Paul Zaloom costumed as Beakman in [[UNAM]], 2014.]]
The program starred [[Paul Zaloom]] as Beakman, an eccentric [[scientist]] who performed comical experiments and demonstrations in response to viewer mail to illustrate various scientific concepts from [[density]] to [[electricity]] to [[flatulence]]. When his experiments were successful, he would often exclaim "Zaloom!", referring to his last name.

Over the years, Beakman was aided in his experiments by a female assistant just as in the comic strip on which it was based. The assistant's name changed throughout the show's run; for the episodes of season 1, it was Josie (played by [[Alanna Ubach]]); for the episodes of seasons 2 and 3, it was Liza (played by [[Eliza Schneider]]); and for the episodes of season 4, it was Phoebe (played by [[Senta Moses]]). Beakman was also assisted by his "lab rat" Lester. In the pilot episode, Lester was a [[puppet]], but in every subsequent episode he was simply a clueless, crude man ([[Mark Ritts]]) in a tattered rat suit. In a [[Running gag|running joke]], it was sometimes implied that his character was actually supposed to be a rat, particularly in moments where he would appear to be in pain because someone was standing on his tail, because he was being tickled, something was on his prosthetic nose, etc. Just as frequently, however, he was specifically identified by himself and others as a guy in a rat suit, or as a serious actor with a bad agent. Frequently unwilling to help with challenges or other segments, Lester was often persuaded by Beakman with the promise of food. 

Another occasional cast member is the unseen cameraman "Ray", who is played by prop-master [[Ron Jancula]]'s hands. Ray assists Beakman by handing him various items, such as the "boguscope". It is suggested throughout the program that Ray has a romantic crush on the show's unnamed make-up lady. Actress [[Jean Stapleton]] also appeared on the show as Beakman's mother, "Beakmom". In some of the skits during the show the character Professor I. M. Boring (also played by Paul Zaloom, in a [[dual role]]) makes appearances and talks about various science topics. 

Zaloom also appeared as various "guest scientists" and historic figures, such as Thomas A. Edison, Robert H. Goddard and Philo T. Farnsworth. When Senta Moses was added to the show's cast, the producers began to use a majority of the sound effects from the NBC game show ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]''.

One segment of the show was the famed "Beakman Challenge". During this segment, Beakman would challenge Lester to do a stunt that illustrated a basic scientific feat. During the first season, virtually every challenge related to either [[air pressure]] or [[Bernoulli's principle]]. The show addressed this during the second season, by having Lester exclaim to Beakman (as he was explaining the science behind a trick) "AIR PRESSURE! IT'S ALWAYS AIR PRESSURE!" In later episodes, the rest of the cast would sometimes have their turn to perform a "Beakman Challenge" under their own name (e.g. "The Lester Challenge" or "The Liza Challenge", etc.) and challenge Beakman to accomplish the feat.

During the show, the following verbal warning was given: "Any experiment performed at home should be done with adult supervision and all appropriate safety precautions should be taken. All directions should be followed exactly and no substitutions should be used."

At the beginning and end of the show, as well as before or after commercial breaks, the show featured short scenes portraying puppet [[penguin]]s, Don (voiced by Bert Berdis) and Herb (voiced by Alan Barzman), at the [[South Pole]] watching ''Beakman's World'' on television. The penguins were named after Don Herbert, who starred as [[Mr. Wizard]] in ''Mr. Wizard's World''. [[Mark Ritts]] (Lester) was also one of the puppeteers operating the penguins.

''Beakman's World'' plays in weekend syndication in the United States and in several other countries. It is distributed by [[Sony Pictures Television]] in the U.S. and in other countries.

A '''chronosequence''' (in [[forest sciences]]) is a set of forested sites that share similar attributes but are of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Edward Arnold |last=Johnson |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GfyIjLypngIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22chronosequence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chronosequence%22&amp;f=false |title=Plant disturbance ecology: the process and the response |isbn=978-0-12-088778-1 |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many processes in [[forest ecology]] take a long time (decades or centuries) to develop, chronosequence methods are used to represent and study the time-dependent development of a forest. [[Fieldata|Field data]] from a chronosequence can be collected in a short period of several months. For example, chronosequences are often used to study the changes in plant communities during [[Ecological succession|succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Knops |first1=Johannes M.H. |author1-link= Johannes M.H.

For example, a study from 2005 used the distance from the nose of a glacier as a proxy for site age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tscherko|first1=Dagmar|last2=Hammesfahr|first2=Ute|last3=Zeltner|first3=Georg|last4=Kandeler|first4=Ellen|last5=Böcker|first5=Reinhard|title=Plant succession and rhizosphere microbial communities in a recently deglaciated alpine terrain|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|date=5 August 2005|volume=6|issue=4|pages=367–383|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179105000356|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2005.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common assumption in establishing '''chronosequences''' is that no other variable besides age (such as various [[abiotic|abiotic components]] and [[biotic components]]) has changed between sites of interest. Because this assumption cannot always be tested for environmental study sites, the use of chronosequences in field successional studies has recently been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Edward|last2=Miyanishi|first2=Kiyoko|title=Testing the assumptions of chronosequences in succession|journal=Ecology Letters|date=13 March 2008|volume=11|issue=5|pages=419–431|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01173.x|pmid=18341585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is hosted by Antony Raj. The motto of the show is a search for Tamilagathin Sirantha Illam Vigyanikana Thedal ([[Tamil Nadu]]’s Young [[Scientist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.co.uk/ezhamarivu/e7ham-arivu-on-dd-pothigai-between-730-pm-to-800-p/|title=Ezham Arivu: Search for Tamil  Nadu’s Young Scientist on DD Podhigai TV|work=|publisher=www.pinterest.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show concept was designed and created by Agnishwar Jayaprakash to pay tribute to the late Dr. [[APJ Abdul Kalam]], Hon. Former [[President of India]] whose dream was to enlighten students’ mind through innovation.

==About Ezham Arivu==
The show is a tailor made to showcase the different and diverse scientific innovations of the students at the same time the program is value added with inspiring background stories and preparatory clips of students creating the inventions. 

This show is aimed at bringing out the young [[scientist]] who thinks out of the box, by serving as an ideal platform to exhibit their talent. The show is a tribute to the late Dr. [[APJ Abdul Kalam]], Hon. Former [[President of India]] whose dream was to enlighten students’ mind through innovation. 

==Format of the show==
* The top 30 contestants of the program were previewed and shortlisted by Dr [[APJ Abdul Kalam]] incidentally this was his last interaction with school children before his death.

* Unique theme based rounds. Viz. [[Inventions]] based on [[Agriculture]], [[Consumer products]], [[Waste Management]], [[Energy]] etc...
* 
* Rapid fire rounds (Agni Paritchai) - In 60 seconds the contestant has to answer questions posed by the judges.

* Daily 6 contestants will be participated, among them least scorers will be eliminated based on their science projects and rapid fire score marks evaluated by judges.

* After daily eliminations, top 6 finalists will be selected.

* Among the top 6 finalists the best will be chosen as a show winner and award them as a Tamilagathin Sirantha Illam Vigyani ([[Tamil Nadu]]’s Young [[Scientist]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">[[File:Edmond Modeste Lescarbault's observatory.jpg|right|thumb|The observatory of Edmond Modeste Lescarbault]]
'''Edmond Modeste Lescarbault''' (1814, [[Châteaudun]] - 1894), was a French doctor and an amateur [[astronomer]], best remembered for his 1859 supposed observation of the non-existent planet [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]].

He graduated and obtained his diploma in 1848. He then started to work as a doctor in [[Orgères-en-Beauce]] and worked there until 1872 (the street where he worked is now named after him). A keen astronomer, he built an observatory with a 3.75&amp;nbsp;inches (95&amp;nbsp;mm) [[refractor]] by his house and began correspondence with various scientific societies. On 26 March 1859 he saw a small object [[Astronomical transit|transiting]] the [[Sun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cohAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336 |title=A Promised Transit of Vulcan|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|volume=52|page=336|date=15 March 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having heard of [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier's]] theory of an intramercurial planet named Vulcan, he wrote a letter to the astronomer and was consequently visited by him in December 1859. Le Verrier announced the discovery on 2 January 1860. Lescarbault became Chevalier of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and was invited to appear before numerous learned societies.

His manuscripts, including correspondence with [[Camille Flammarion]], are kept in Bibliothèque Municipale in Châteaudun. He died in 1894.

[[File:DINISO2768-2example.jpg|thumb|Example for the DIN ISO 2768-2 tolerance table. This is just one example for linear tolerances for a 100mm value. This is just one of the 8 defined ranges (30-120 mm).]]
'''Engineering tolerance'''  is the permissible limit or limits of variation in:
# a physical [[dimension]];
# a measured value or [[physical property]] of a material, [[manufacturing|manufactured]] object, system, or service;
# other measured values (such as temperature, humidity, etc.);
# in [[engineering]] and [[safety]], a physical [[distance]] or space (tolerance), as in a [[truck]] (lorry), [[train]] or [[boat]] under a [[bridge]] as well as a train in a [[tunnel]] (see [[structure gauge]] and [[loading gauge]]);
# in [[mechanical engineering]] the [[Engineering tolerance#Mechanical component tolerance|space]] between a [[Screw|bolt]] and a [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] or a hole, etc..
Dimensions, properties, or conditions may have some variation without significantly affecting functioning of systems, machines, structures, etc.
A variation beyond the tolerance (for example, a temperature that is too hot or too cold) is said to be noncompliant, rejected, or exceeding the tolerance.

==Considerations when setting tolerances==
A primary concern is to determine how wide the tolerances may be without affecting other factors or the outcome of a process.  This can be by the use of scientific principles, engineering knowledge, and professional experience. Experimental investigation is very useful to investigate the effects of tolerances: [[Design of experiments]], formal engineering evaluations, etc.

A good set of engineering tolerances in a [[specification]], by itself, does not imply that compliance with those tolerances will be achieved.  Actual production of any product (or operation of any system) involves some inherent variation of input and output. Measurement error and statistical uncertainty are also present in all measurements.  With a [[normal distribution]], the tails of measured values may extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations from the process average. Appreciable portions of one (or both) tails might extend beyond the specified tolerance.

The [[process capability]] of systems, materials, and products needs to be compatible with the specified engineering tolerances. [[Process control]]s must be in place and an effective [[Quality management system]], such as [[Total Quality Management]], needs to keep actual production within the desired tolerances. A [[process capability index]] is used to indicate the relationship between tolerances and actual measured production.

The choice of tolerances is also affected by the intended statistical [[sampling plan]] and its characteristics such as the Acceptable Quality Level. This relates to the question of whether tolerances must be extremely rigid (high confidence in 100% conformance) or whether some small percentage of being out-of-tolerance may sometimes be acceptable.

==An alternative view of tolerances==
[[Genichi Taguchi]] and others have suggested that traditional two-sided tolerancing is analogous to "goal posts" in a [[Football (disambiguation)|football game]]: It implies that all data within those tolerances are equally acceptable.  The alternative is that the best product has a measurement which is precisely on target. There is an increasing loss which is a function of the deviation or variability from the target value of any design parameter. The greater the deviation from target, the greater is the loss. This is described as the [[Taguchi loss function]] or "quality loss function", and it is the key principle of an alternative system called "inertial tolerancing".

Research and development work conducted by M. Pillet and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Pillet M., Adragna P-A., Germain F., Inertial Tolerancing: "The Sorting Problem", Journal of Machine Engineering : Manufacturing Accuracy Increasing Problems, optimization, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2006, pp. 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Savoy University has resulted in industry-specific adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2007/3825/3825_abs.pdf Thesis Quality Control and Inertial Tolerancing in the watchmaking industry, in french]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the publishing of the French standard NFX 04-008 has allowed further consideration by the manufacturing community.

== Mechanical component tolerance ==
[[File:Mechanical Tolerance Definitions.svg|thumb|Summary of basic size, fundamental deviation and IT grades compared to minimum and maximum sizes of the shaft and hole.]]

Dimensional tolerance is related to, but different from [[Engineering fit|fit]] in mechanical engineering, which is a ''designed-in'' clearance or interference between two parts. Tolerances are assigned to parts for manufacturing purposes, as boundaries for acceptable build. No machine can hold dimensions precisely to the nominal value, so there must be acceptable degrees of variation. If a part is manufactured, but has dimensions that are out of tolerance, it is not a usable part according to the design intent. Tolerances can be applied to any dimension. The commonly used terms are:

* '''Basic size''': the nominal diameter of the shaft (or bolt) and the hole. This is, in general, the same for both components.
* '''Lower deviation''': the difference between the minimum possible component size and the basic size  .
* '''Upper deviation''': the difference between the maximum possible component size and the basic size  .
* '''Fundamental deviation''': the ''minimum'' difference in size between a component and the basic size. This is identical to the upper deviation for shafts and the lower deviation for holes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} If the fundamental deviation is greater than zero, the bolt will always be smaller than the basic size and the hole will always be wider. Fundamental deviation is a form of [[allowance (engineering)|allowance]], rather than tolerance.
* '''International Tolerance grade''': this is a standardised measure of the ''maximum'' difference in size between the component and the basic size (see below).

For example, if a shaft with a nominal diameter of 10 [[millimeter|mm]] is to have a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036&amp;nbsp;mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04&amp;nbsp;mm to 10.076&amp;nbsp;mm (0.04&amp;nbsp;mm fundamental deviation and 0.076&amp;nbsp;mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the "maximum material condition") and 0.112&amp;nbsp;mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036&amp;nbsp;mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.

When no other tolerances are provided, the [[machining industry]] uses the following '''standard tolerances''':&lt;ref&gt;2, 3 and 4 decimal places quoted from page 29 of "Machine Tool Practices", 6th edition, by R.R.;&amp;nbsp;Kibbe, J.E.;&amp;nbsp;Neely, R.O.;&amp;nbsp;Meyer &amp; W.T.;&amp;nbsp;White, {{ISBN|0-13-270232-0}}, 2nd printing, copyright 1999, 1995, 1991, 1987, 1982 and 1979 by Prentice Hall.&lt;br&gt;(All four places, including the single decimal place, are common knowledge in the field, although a reference for the single place could not be found.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Chris McCauley, Editor-In-Chief of Industrial Press' [[Machinery's Handbook]]: '''Standard Tolerance''' "...''does not appear to originate with any of the recent editions (24-28) of [[Machinery's Handbook]], although those tolerances may have been mentioned somewhere in one of the many old editions of the Handbook.''"

===International Tolerance grades===
{{main|IT Grade}}
When designing mechanical components, a system of standardized tolerances called '''International Tolerance grades''' are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, [[Tap and die#Machine tapping|tapped hole]], or [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work in such a way that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015&amp;nbsp;mm larger than the base dimension, and 0&amp;nbsp;mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009&amp;nbsp;mm smaller than the base dimension and 0&amp;nbsp;mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=45975&amp;ICS1=17&amp;ICS2=40&amp;ICS3=10 ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog)].

The table below summarises the International Tolerance (IT) grades and the general applications of these grades:
{{IT grades}}

An analysis of fit by [[Statistical interference]] is also extremely useful: It indicates the frequency (or probability) of parts properly fitting together.

== Electrical component tolerance ==
An electrical specification might call for a [[resistor]] with a nominal value of 100 Ω ([[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]), but will also state a tolerance such as "±1%". This means that any resistor with a value in the range 99 Ω to 101 Ω is acceptable. For critical components, one might specify that the actual resistance must remain within tolerance within a specified temperature range, over a specified lifetime, and so on.

Many commercially available [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s of standard types, and some small [[inductor]]s, are often marked with [[Electronic color code|coloured bands]] to indicate their value and the tolerance. High-precision components of non-standard values may have numerical information printed on them.

==Difference between ''allowance and tolerance''==
The terms are often confused but sometimes a difference is maintained. See [[Allowance (engineering)#Confounding of the engineering concepts of allowance and tolerance]].

==Clearance (civil engineering)==
In [[civil engineering]], '''clearance''' refers to the difference between the [[loading gauge]] and the [[structure gauge]] in the case of [[railroad car]]s or [[tram]]s, or the difference between the size of any [[vehicle]] and the width/height of doors or the height of an [[overpass]] as well as the [[air draft]] under a [[bridge]].

'''Fitnah''' is an [[impact crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Fitnah was first observed in ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' images during that mission's February 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at 45.1° North [[Latitude]], 290.6° West [[Longitude]] and is 16.5 kilometers across.&lt;ref name=gpn /&gt;  The topography of the impact crater appears very subdued, suggesting that the crater has undergone significant viscous relaxation since its formation, leaving behind only the raised rim behind.  

Fitnah is named after the daughter of [[Ayyub (Arabian Nights)|Ayyub]] and brother of [[Ghanim]], in the "[[Tale of Ghanim Bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the Thrall O’ Love]]" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.  Incidentally, craters named [[Ghanim (crater)|Ghanim]] and [[Ayyub (crater)|Ayyub]] are found near Fitnah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">A '''Giuga number''' is a [[composite number]] ''n'' such that for each of its distinct [[prime factor]]s ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;p_i | ({n \over p_i} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently such that for each of its distinct [[prime factor]]s ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;p_i^2 | (n - p_i)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The Giuga numbers are named after the mathematician [[Giuseppe Giuga]], and relate to [[Giuga's conjecture|his conjecture]] on primality.

== Definitions ==
Alternative definition for a '''Giuga number''' due to [[Takashi Agoh]] is:  a [[composite number]] ''n'' is a '''Giuga number''' [[if and only if]] the congruence

:&lt;math&gt;nB_{\varphi(n)} \equiv -1 \pmod n&lt;/math&gt; 

holds true, where ''B'' is a [[Bernoulli number]] and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]].

An equivalent formulation due to [[Giuseppe Giuga]] is:  a [[composite number]] ''n'' is a '''Giuga number''' if and only if the congruence

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^{\varphi(n)} \equiv -1 \pmod n&lt;/math&gt;

and if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|n} \frac{1}{p} - \prod_{p|n} \frac{1}{p} \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

All known Giuga numbers ''n'' in fact satisfy the stronger condition

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|n} \frac{1}{p} - \prod_{p|n} \frac{1}{p} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
The sequence of Giuga numbers begins

:30, 858, 1722, 66198, 2214408306, … {{OEIS|id=A007850}}.

For example, 30 is a Giuga number since its prime factors are 2, 3 and 5, and we can verify that

* 30/2 - 1 = 14, which is divisible by 2,
* 30/3 - 1 = 9, which is 3 squared, and
* 30/5 - 1 = 5, the third prime factor itself.

== Properties ==
The prime factors of a Giuga number must be distinct. If &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then it follows that &lt;math&gt;{n \over p} - 1 = m-1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m=n/p&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;m-1&lt;/math&gt; would not be divisible by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; would not be a Giuga number. 

Thus, only [[square-free integer]]s can be Giuga numbers.  For example, the factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3 and 5, and 60/2 - 1 = 29, which is not divisible by 2. Thus, 60 is not a Giuga number.

This rules out squares of primes, but [[semiprime]]s cannot be Giuga numbers either. For if &lt;math&gt;n=p_1p_2&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; primes, then
&lt;math&gt;{n \over p_2} - 1 =p_1 - 1 &lt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; will not divide &lt;math&gt;{n \over p_2} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not a Giuga number.

{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many Giuga numbers?|Is there a composite Giuga number that is also a Carmichael number?}}
All known Giuga numbers are even. If an odd Giuga number exists, it must be the product of at least 14 [[prime number|prime]]s. It is not known if there are infinitely many Giuga numbers.

It has been conjectured by Paolo P. Lava (2009) that Giuga numbers are the solutions of the differential equation ''n' = n+1'', where ''n' '' is the [[arithmetic derivative]] of ''n''. (For square-free numbers &lt;math&gt; n = \prod_i {p_i} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; n' = \sum_i \frac{n}{p_i} &lt;/math&gt;, so ''n' = n+1'' is just the last equation in the above section ''Definitions'', multiplied by ''n''.)

José Mª Grau and Antonio Oller-Marcén have shown that an integer ''n'' is a  Giuga number if and only if it satisfies ''n' = a n + 1'' for some integer ''a'' &gt; 0, where ''n' '' is the [[arithmetic derivative]] of ''n''. (Again, ''n' = a n + 1'' is identical to the third equation in ''Definitions'', multiplied by ''n''.)

'''Hermann Friedrich Emmrich''' ([[Meiningen]], February 7, 1815 &amp;ndash; Meiningen, 24 January 1879) was a German [[geologist]].

He received his Ph.D. in philosophy and taught at the Institute of Meiningen (Henfling-Gymnasium Meiningen).

He described the [[trilobite]] [[genera]] ''[[Phacops]]'', ''[[Odontopleura]]'' and ''[[Trinucleus]]''.

He published ''Zur Naturgeschichte der Trilobiten'' (On the natural history of trilobites) in 1839 and ''Geologischem Geschichte des Alpes'' (Geological history of the Alps) in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Espasa Calpe|volume= 19|page= 1.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trilobite genus ''[[Emmrichops]]'' was named in his honor.

'''[[Human leukocyte antigen]]s''' (HLA) began as a list of [[antigen]]s identified as a result of transplant rejection. The antigens were initially identified by categorizing and performing massive statistical analyses on interactions between blood types.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Daniel M. The Compatibility Gene. How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This process is based upon the principle of [[serotypes]]. HLA are not typical antigens, like those found on surface of [[infectious agent]]s. HLAs are [[Alloimmunity|''allo''antigens]], they vary from individual to individual as a result of genetic differences.
An organ called the [[thymus]] is responsible for ensuring that any [[T-cells]] that attack self proteins are not allowed to live. In essence, every individual's immune system is tuned to the specific set of HLA and self proteins produced by that individual; where this goes awry is when tissues are transferred to another person. Since individuals almost always have different "banks" of HLAs, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the transplanted tissue as non-self and destroys the foreign tissue, leading to [[transplant rejection]]. It was through the realization of this that HLAs were discovered.

The thought that the mammalian body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign tissues first arose during [[World War II]]. It started with a plane crash in the height of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]]. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts; however, skin grafts were a risky business at the time, often being rejected for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that the first of these "identifying" proteins was found.&lt;ref&gt;Irene Park, Paul Terasaki, Origins of the first HLA specificities, Human Immunology, Volume 61, Issue 3, March 2000, Pages 185-189 {{DOI|10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00154-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the [[WHO]] Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"&gt;"HLA Nomenclature @ Hla.alleles.org." HLA Nomenclature @ Hla.alleles.org. Anthony Nolan Research Institute, 10 Nov. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature" /&gt;

===Identification of Non-Self===

[[Peter Medawar]] was a zoologist turned clinician, who specialized in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest to save lives. Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Medawar, P. B. "A second study of the behaviour and fate of skin homografts in rabbits: a report to the War Wounds Committee of the Medical Research Council. ''Journal of Anatomy'' 1945; 79, 157-76&lt;/ref&gt; Medawar then set out in search of the reason why rabbits rejected non-self grafts.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Medawar continued his work, this time with a team of three at the University College London during the 1950s. Medawar's coworkers were [[Leslie Brent]], a PhD student, and [[Rupert Billingham]], Medawar's first graduate student at Oxford several years prior. Through carefully planned experimentation, the trio showed that mice exposed to cells of unrelated mice as fetuses did ''not'' reject skin grafts from those same mice.&lt;ref&gt;Billingham, R.E., Brent, L. and Medawar, P.B. "Quantitative studies on tissue transplantation immunity. iii. Actively acquired tolerance. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 1956; 239, 357-414&lt;/ref&gt; For this discovery, Medawar and Australian scientist [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet|Macfarlane Burnet]] earned the 1960 Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Learned Self Tolerance===

Burnet, independently of Medawar, came to the conclusion that the immune system must learn to tolerate any self cells, and hypothesized that this must occur during fetal development. For this, he jointly was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960. Burnet's work continued and in 1957 along with [[Niels Jerne]] published a paper that modified and revolutionized antibody theory. "Burnet speculated that one cell makes one particular shape of antibody and that all our antibody-making immune cells together make an unimaginably vast repertoire of 10 billion antibodies, each having a slightly different shape".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Daniel M. The Compatibility Gene. How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014. Print. pg 34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, whenever a non-self molecule appears in the human body, one of these antibodies will have an accurate enough shape to bind to that molecule. This idea is known as [[Clonal selection|Clonal Selection Theory]]. At the time, many leading scientists including [[Linus Pauling]] and [[James Watson]] completely rejected the idea, but repeated experimentation intended to disprove the theory actually served to build up a large body of evidence supporting Burnet and Jerne's theory.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The biggest weakness in Burnet's theory was that he had no explanation for how the body selected for immune cells that only identified non-self. In 1961, [[Jacques Miller]] published a paper offering an explanation. Miller was a PhD student at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London. His discovery centered on the thymus. The thymus had long been regarded as nothing more than a repository for dead cells. Miller didn't buy this hypothesis. By removing the thymus of leukemic mice early in life, he found that the mice had a drastically weakened immune system. Taking inspiration from Medawar's skin transplant work, he performed a series of skin-graft experiments that showed that these immunocompromised mice didn't reject skin grafts from non-genetically identical mice. Miller then hypothesized that the thymus was essential in the construction and maintenance of the immune system. At this point Burnet came back into the picture, extending the hypothesis to specify that the dead cells found in the thymus are not any old immune cells, but instead the cells that are activated by self molecules. In other words, any molecule that binds to and hence "recognizes" a self molecule is killed before exiting the thymus. These cells were later found to be one of two types of immune cells, the [[T-cells]] (named for their origin, the thymus).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Identification of the first HLAs===

The discovery of the first HLA was very much a mystery. In 1958 Jean Dausset noticed that blood serum from one person could react with the white blood cells of another. He had no idea why, but he named the causative agent MAC. Around the same time other researchers were making similar discoveries. Rose Payne and Jon van Rood made an identical conclusion from observations of interactions between the blood of women who had been pregnant multiple times and the white blood cells of others. They hypothesized that this was because they had been "sensitized" (an immunological term meaning previously exposed to and thus more reactive towards) to the non-self proteins of the father through tissue damage during birth. At this point the researchers all realized that the sheer quantity of data they were capable of obtaining was vastly greater than that of any previous study and so collaboration would be essential. The first international meeting, in 1964, highlighted the difficulties of such massive collaborative work. Different experimental methods and inconsistency in the execution of the same tests and a non-homogeneity of naming systems added together to make collaboration incredibly difficult.

===World Health Organization steps in===

In 1967 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) decided that the HLA research needed an official naming system. This in turn would aid in organization and would more easily facilitate the unification of data being collected at numerous laboratories across the world. This committee is still in existence today and vastly accelerated the rate of HLA research. The first meeting of this committee in 1968 set forth guidelines and rules that govern HLAs. First, compatibility genes were divided into two types, class I and class II. Class I molecules were identified via reactions between blood serum and cells. Class II molecules were identified by mixtures of white blood cells. Second, the compatibility genes were renamed Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Despite this clarification and the ever-increasing number of identified HLAs, nobody knew how they worked.

===MHC Restriction===

The red line between them signifies a peptide (in this case an E1A heteroclitic variant of melanoma peptide).

"T-cell Receptor Specificity Maintained by Altered Thermodynamics." Journal of Biological Chemistry 288 (June 2013): 18766-18775.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Late in 1973 a pair of researchers in Australia, Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty made a revelatory discovery that altered the thinking of immunologists forever. The pair was doing research on viral infections in mice and noticed that T-cells that prevented viral infections in some mice wouldn't always prevent the same infection in other mice. After looking at the MHCs present in the mice, they realized that cytotoxic T-cells could only identify virus infections in cells with the right Class I compatibility gene. Traditional thinking was that the immune system identified infections directly but this discovery turned that theory on its head. Compatibility genes were essential in immune system mediated viral clearing. The pair coined the term "MHC Restriction" to describe this relationship between T-cells, specific MHC proteins, and viral detection.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; In 1975, in an article in the journal ''Lancet'', they introduced the idea of "altered self", meaning that viruses alter the MHC proteins and this alteration is detected by T-cells.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, P.C. and Zinkernagel, R.M. A biological role for the major histocompatibility antigens. ''Lancet'' I, 1406-9 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; For their work they won the 1996 Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; It took the work of many others to determine how T-cells made this identification.

===Discovering the protein shape===

Nearly all important molecules in the body are [[proteins]]. Proteins work by each having a specific sequence of [[amino acids]] and a specific shape. Determining the order of amino acids is relatively simple. Finding the shape requires the use of [[x-ray crystallography]] and is anything but easy.&lt;ref name="Cell Biology"&gt;Alberts, Bruce. Essential Cell Biology. New York: Garland Science, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It took a team of three researchers at Harvard, [[Don Wiley]], [[Jack Strominger]], and [[Pamela Bjorkman]], eight years to ferret out the structure of the HLA protein. They worked specifically with HLA-A*02. Bjorkman did the majority of the leg work and in the seven years managed to piece together the structure of 90% of the protein. That last 10% was elusive though. It took another year of work to finally unveil the complete structure of HLA-A*02. They completed their work in the spring of 1987, discovering that the final 10% made a "cup" (of sorts) located on top of the molecule. It was the perfect size to hold peptides. Other researchers had previously determined that T-Cells can recognize cells infected with a virus, cells injected with a single protein from a virus, and even cells injected with pieces of protein from a virus. The discovery of the HLA protein structure made it starkly clear that the HLA proteins hold viral peptides in their binding groove. But the research team from Harvard wasn't done. They also observed that there was clearly a peptide in the binding groove of the HLA molecules they used to determine the shape. However, the cells they had extracted the protein from were definitely not infected by any disease causing viruses.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; The conclusion they made and the conclusion that has stuck to this day, is that HLA molecules can bind both self, and non-self peptides.

==Nomenclature==

==={{anchor|Current HLA naming system}} Current HLA naming system===

The most recent HLA naming system was developed in 2010 by the WHO Committee for Factors of the HLA System. There are two types of MHCs, Class I and Class II. Both are named using the same system. Currently there are 7,678 Class I [[alleles]] and 2,268 Class II alleles.

[[File:HLA Naming Protocol.png|framed|HLA naming protocol&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt;]]
HLA Naming can be quite confusing at first. All alleles start with "HLA", signifying they are part of the human MHC genes. The next portion (HLA'''-A''' or HLA'''-B''') identifies which gene the allele is a modification of. The first two numbers (HLA-A'''*02''') signifies what antigen type that particular allele is, which typically signifies the serological antigen present.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt; In other words, HLAs with the same antigen type (HLA-A*02:101 and HLA-A*02:102) will not react with each other in serological tests. The next set of digits (HLA-A*02''':101''') indicates what protein the allele codes for, and these are numbered sequentially in the order they are discovered. Any HLA that has a different number here produces a different protein (AKA has a nucleotide change that replaces an amino acid with another). The third set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101''':01''') indicates an allele variant that has a different DNA sequence but produces the same protein as the normal gene. The final set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01''':01''') is used to designate a single or multiple nucleotide polymorphism in a non-coding region of the gene. The final aspect of HLA naming is a letter (HLA-A*02:101:01:01'''L'''). There are six letters, each with a different meaning.

===Establishing the system===

A person can have 2 antigen proteins per genetic-locus (one gene from each parent). When first discovered, identified antigens were clustered, creating groups in which no more than two antigens per cluster were found in a given person. Serotype group "A" consisted HL-A1, A2, A3, A9, A10, A11. Another cluster, "B", contained A7, A8, A12, A13, A14, A15. HL-A4 antigen was found to occur on lymphoid cells. Since the "HL-Antigens" no longer belonged to a single group, a new naming system was needed.

In 1968 the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System first met.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt; They established a system that divided the HLAs into HLA-A and HLA-B, A and B corresponding to a group of reactive serotypes. For example, "HL-A2" became [[HLA-A2]], "HL-A7" became [[HLA-B7]] and "HL-A8" became [[HLA-B8]].

In this arrangement there were cells that were 'blank' or had new [[Antigen-antibody interaction|specificities]], these new antigens were called "W" antigens, and as they were reassigned to new groups, for example "A" serotypes, they became Aw or Bw antigens. It was found that some antigens that behaved like A and B antigens but could be excluded based on '2-type max' exclusion. Thus a new group, "C" was created. Classification of [[HLA-C|C]] antigens is still ongoing, and they have retained the name Cw as many serotypes have not been developed.

The classification of the "A4" antigens was complicated. The "A4" subset evolved to become D-region antigens, which was a large cluster of genes that encoded MHC class II. Several renamings occurred. The D-region has 8 major coding loci that combine to form 3 different protein groups; DP, DQ, and DR. DRw antigens were the first to be split, a process made easy by the virtue of having an invariant alpha chain, but complicated by 4 beta chain loci (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5). Serotypes to DQ reacted with alpha and beta chains, or both of certain isoforms. The proper classification was greatly aided by gene sequencing and PCR. Classification and description of DP antigens is ongoing.

==Genetics==

===Genetic complexity typifies HLA===
The naming of [[human leukocyte antigens]] HLA "[[antigen]]s" is deeply rooted in the discovery history of their [[serotype]]s and [[allele]]s. There is no doubt that HLA terminology can be bewildering, this terminology is a consequence of the complex genetics as well as the way these antigens were characterized.

Historical perspective is important to an understanding of how the HLA were systematized. In organ transplant the goal was to explain graft rejection for recipients, and of course, to prevent future rejection. From this perspective, the cause of rejections were found to be "antigens". In the same way bacterial antigens can cause inflammatory response, HLA antigens from the donor of the organ caused an inflammatory response when placed in a recipient. This is called allograft [allo = different, graft(medical) = transplant] rejection.

To explain rejection in a nutshell, certain immune system components are highly variable, the agents are called the Major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens. MHC antigens cause rejection of improperly matched organ transplants. The variability stems from genetics. From the perspective of human evolution, why are antigens of the MHC so variable when many other human proteins lack variability? The cause of host-versus-graft-disease may actually stem from the functions of the system.

The use of the word alloantigen actually masks the fact that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, but something else. But the naming of these antigens is not borne out of function but the need to match organ donors with recipients.

====Transplantation and transplant rejection====
[[File:Alloreactive Antisera.PNG|frame|left|'''A simple example of HLA antigen causing rejection''' &lt;br /&gt; A1, A2, B7, B8 do not cause reaction because they are in both donor and recipient, DR2 and DR3 are found on lymphoid cells]]
In the early 1960s, some physicians began more aggressive attempts at [[organ transplantation]]. Knowing little about ''compatibility factors'', they attempted transplantation between humans and between non-humans and humans.&lt;ref name="pmid14081245"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reemtsma K, Mccracken BH, Schlegel JU, Pearl M | title = Heterotransplantation of the kidney: two clinical experiences | journal = Science | volume = 143 | issue = 3607| pages = 700–2 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14081245 | doi =10.1126/science.143.3607.700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunosuppressive drugs]] worked for a time, but transplanted organs would either always fail or the patients would die from infections. Patients received skin, [[white blood cell]] or kidney donations from other donors (called [[allograft]]s, meaning 'of different genetics' grafts). If these [[allograft]]s were rejected, it was found that the 'rejection' response was accompanied by an [[antibody]] mediated [[agglutination (biology)]] of red blood cells (See figure).&lt;ref name="pmid4866325"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rapaport FT, Kano K, Milgrom F | title = Heterophile antibodies in human transplantation | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–42 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4866325 | doi =10.1172/JCI105759 | pmc = 297209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for these cell surface antigens began. There are several processes by which antibodies can reduce function: 
* [[Transplant rejection#Acute rejection|Acute rejection - Antibodies]] could attract lymphocytes and cause them to lyse cells via the immune system's [[classical complement pathway]]
* Antibodies could bind to and alter function (e.g., flow of a fluid, or prevention of binding of ligands to receptors)
* [[Cytokine]] responses that cause systemic responses.

=====Different antigens can be identified=====
In the accompanying figure, two similar [[haplotype]]s (unknown to early clinicians) are identical, except for the one ''antigen'' in the top haplotype. The transplant may not be rejected, but if rejection does occur that allotypic protein, the allo''[[antigen]]'', in the donor tissue may have induced the dominant allo-reactive antibody in the recipient.

=====Assaying antiserum=====
[[File:Anti-HLA agglutinated RBC.png|frame|right|'''Agglutination of [[HLA-A3]] positive [[red blood cell]]s''' (RBCs) with anti-A3 alloreactive [[antisera]] containing Anti-A3 [[IgM]]]]
'''Hemagglutination assay'''. In generating an immune response to an antigen, the [[B-cell]]s go through a process of maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a [[plasma cell]] producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in [[hemagglutination]] assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination.

'''Complement fixation assay'''. The [[complement fixation test]] was modified to assay Antiserum mediated RBC lysis.

'''Chromium release assay'''. This assay measures the release of (biological) radioactive chromium from cells as a result of killer cell activity. These cells are attracted to class I antigens that either carry foreign antigens, or are foreign to the immune system.

Each person has two HLA [[haplotype]]s, a cassette of genes passed on from each parent. The haplotype frequencies in Europeans are in strong [[linkage disequilibrium]]. This means there are much higher frequencies of certain haplotypes relative to the expectation based on random sorting of gene-alleles.  This aided the discovery of HLA antigens, but was unknown to the pioneering researchers.

In the tables a fortuitous transplant between two unrelated individual has resulted in an antiserum to single alloantigen. By discovering these close-but-non-identical matches, the process with somewhat related haplotypes surface antigens were identified for HLA A, and in the table below, HLA B at the time however these were all grouped together as HL-Antigens. On the left the "B" and "cw" antigens are matched (B and C are close together so if B matches then C likely also matches), but A antigens are not matched. The antisera that is produced by the recipient is most likely to be A3, but if the direction of transplant is reversed A2 is the likely alloantigen. Two of the first three alloantigens are thus readily easy to detect because of the similarity and frequency of the A2-B7 and A3-B7 haplotypes (see example 1).

In these instances, the A1/A2, A2/A3, A1/A3 are matched, decreasing the probability of a rejection because many are linked to a given haplotype. Occasionally the 'recombinant' A1-Cw7-B7(rare), B7 becomes the alloantigen in a recipient with A1-Cw7-B8(common).

This linkage disequilibrium in Europeans explains why A1, A2, A3, "A7"[B7], and "A8"[B8] were identified, first. It would have taken substantially longer to identify other alleles because frequencies were lower, and haplotypes that migrated into the European population had undergone equilibration or were from multiple sources.

This is the genetic background against which scientists tried to uncover and understand the histocompatibility antigens.

====A list of antigens created====
In the late 1960s, scientist began reacting [[blood serum|sera]] from patients with rejecting transplants to donor or 'third party' tissues. Their [[Serum (blood)|sera]] (the liquid part of the blood when blood clots) was sensitized to the cells from donors - it was ''alloreactive''. By testing different anti-sera from recipients they were able to uncover some with unique reactivities. As a result, scientists were able to identify a few antigens. At first the first antigens were called the Hu-1 antigens&lt;ref name="pmid4887739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bach FH, Amos DB | title = Hu-1: Major histocompatibility locus in man | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3781 | pages = 1506–8 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4887739 | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3781.1506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tentatively tagged as gene products of the Human equivalent of the mouse histocompatibility locus (H2). In 1968, it was discovered that matching these antigens between kidney donor and recipient improved the likelihood of kidney survival in the recipient.&lt;ref name="pmid4876470"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196809052791001 |vauthors=Patel R, Mickey MR, Terasaki PI | title = Serotyping for homotransplantation. XVI. Analysis of kidney transplants from unrelated donors | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 279 | issue = 10 | pages = 501–6 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4876470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antigen list still exists,  although it has been reorganized to fit what we have since learned about genetics, refined, and greatly expanded.

====Lymphocyte bearing antigens recognized====
[[File:LAvsA4.PNG|left]]
As the study of these 'rejection' [[Serum (blood)|sera]] and "allo"-antigens progressed, certain patterns in the antibody recognition were recognized. The first major observation, in 1969, was that an allotypic antibodies to "4" ("Four") was only found on lymphocytes, while most of the antigens, termed "LA", recognized most cells in the body.&lt;ref name="pmid5773111"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mann DL, Rogentine GN, Fahey JL, Nathenson SG | title = Molecular heterogeneity of human lymphoid (HL-A) alloantigens | journal = Science | volume = 163 | issue = 3874 | pages = 1460–2 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5773111 | doi = 10.1126/science.163.3874.1460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group "4" antigen on lymphocytes would expand into "4a", "4b" and so on, becoming the "D" series (HLA-D (Class II) antigens) DP, DQ, and DR. This is an interesting history in itself.

The Hu-1 antigens were renamed the Human-lymphoid (HL) allo-antigens (HL-As). Allo-antigen comes from the observation that a tolerated protein in the donor becomes antigenic in the recipient. This can be compared with an [[autoantigen]], in which a person develops antibodies to one or more of their own proteins. This also suggested  the donor and recipient have a different genetic makeup for these antigens. The "LA" group thereafter was composed of HL-A1, A2, A3, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14 and A15 until further divisions and renaming were necessary. Some of the antigens above, for example HL-A1, are similar to [[HLA-A1]], as they are the same serotype. Some of the above, like A5, are not mentioned within the last few years, as they have been renamed.

During these early studies it became known that there were associations with many autoimmune diseases. And the [[HLA A1-B8 haplotype]] is linked to a very long piece of conserved chromosome 6 variant called [[HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2|AH8.1 haplotype]]. In these studies ''HL-A1,8'' were frequently found co-linked to disease. This linkage is not necessarily a function of either gene, but a consequence of the way AH8.1 evolved.

====Subclassification of lymphoid antigens====
[[File:HL-Series A and B.PNG|right]]
A series of tests on cultured cells revealed that, within the "LA" group, a donor tissue might have some antigens but not others. For example, an antiserum may react with patterns (on a given tissue):

* A1, A2, A7, A12
* A1, A3, A7, A8
* A1, A11, A8, A5
* A1, A8

But fail to react in the following patterns:

* A1, A2, A3, ...
* A1, A2, A11, ....
* A2, A3, A11, ....
* . . . A7, A8, A12

====The HLA serotype series====

=====Series "A"=====
{|style="margin-left:2em;  border:1px #ccffdd solid; background:#ebffef" align="right"
|-
|
{|style="text-align:left; margin-left:1em; background:#ebffef" 
|- align = "center"
| &lt;div style="font-size:medium; line-height:120%;"&gt;'''Genetics of Serotyping'''&lt;/div&gt;
|-
| '''Effects of intraseries exclusion'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | Once it was determined that a tissue with two antigens of a series (such as "A") excluded the possibility of a third antigen of the same series, HLA serotypes began to clarify the genetic alleles present in humans. HL-Series "A" antigens became the HLA-A locus gene products, but with exceptions. Some serotypes, such as HL-A1 were so homogeneous in nature that mistaking that serotyped allele (HLA-A*0101) for another allele was unlikely. &lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Interpreting Serotypes as Alleles'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | HL-A1 antiserum reacts to [[HLA-A1]] [[gene product]], a cell surface antigen, the similar cell surface antigens are found on almost all cells in the body. The frequency of HLA-A1 alleles is: HLA-A1'''*0101'''- 17.3%, '''*0103'''- 0.016%. The frequency of *0101 is 1000 times more abundant than *0103, or 99.9% of the time you have identified the correct allele with the serotype. The false negative rate for [[HLA-A1#Serotype|HLA-A1 serotype]] is 1% and the giving the HLA-A1 serotyping a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 98.9% for the A1*0101 allele.&lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Increasing confidence of Interpretation'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | Sensitivity is lower, particularly in the study of non-caucasians as the HL-A1 can cross-react to similar sites on  [[Genetic recombination|genetic recombinant]]s (most often [[gene conversion]]). Sensitivity can be improved by knowing the haplotype. In Europe, HLA-A1 is strongly linked to a 'chunk of chromosome' called a 'haplotype'. This haplotype, Super-B8, is A1-Cw7-B8-DR3-DQ2, about 2 million DNA codons (the [[nucleotide]] building blocks) long. This chunk has avoided recombination for thousands of years. When the A1 serotype is found with B8 (i.e., the 'old' HL-A8) serotype in Europe, there is an even greater chance the HL-A1 antiserum has detected the A1*0101 allele's gene product. &lt;br /&gt;
|}
|}
If 2 members of the series (A1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11) were typed, a reaction with a third member of the series to the donor was not observed. This 'exclusivity' identified series "A".&lt;ref&gt;Bach ML, Bach FH. (1970) ''The genetics of histocompatibility''.  ''Hosp. Practice'' 5(8): 33-44&lt;/ref&gt; One might notice the similarities of this numeric series with the [[Template:HLA-A serotypes|HLA-A series]], as series "A" antigens are the first six members of [[HLA-A]]. Inadvertently, the scientist had discovered an antibody set that recognized only [[gene product]]s from one locus, [[HLA-A#HLA-A gene|HLA-A gene]] the "antigens" being the gene products. The implication is that an alloreactive anti-sera can be a tool for genetic identification.

=====Series "B"=====
Not long after the series A antigens were separated from the (rapidly expanding) list of antigens, it was determined another group also could be separated along the same ''logical'' lines.  This group included HL-A5, A7, A8, A12.  This became the series "B".
Note the similarity of Series "B" to the first few members [[Template:HLA-B serotypes|HLA-B serotypes]]. The names of these antigens were necessarily changed to fit the new putative series they were assigned to. From HL-A# to HLA-B#. The problem was that the literature was using "A7" and would soon be using "B7" as shorthand for [[HLA-B7]].

=====Pseudo-series "w"=====
Since it was now certain, by the early 1970s, that the "antigens" were encoded by different series, implicit loci, numeric lists became somewhat cumbersome. Many groups were discovering antigens. In these instances an antigen was assigned a temporary name, like "RoMa2" and after discussion, the next open numeric slot could be assigned, but not to an "A" or "B" series until proper testing had been done. To work around this problem a 'workshop' number "w#" was often assigned while testing continued to determine which series the antigen belonged to.

=====Series "C"=====
Before too long, a series "C" was uncovered. Series C has proved difficult to serotype, and the alleles in the series still carry the "w" tag signifying that status; in addition, it reminds us that Series C were not assigned names the same way as Series A and B, it has its own numeric list Cw1, Cw2, Cw3.

====Serotype group expansion and refinement====
By the mid 1970s, genetic research was finally beginning to make sense of the simple list of antigens, a new series "C" had been discovered and, in turn genetic research had determined the order of HLA-A, C, B and D encoding loci on the human [[chromosome 6|6]]p.&lt;ref name="pmid136874"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yunis EJ, Dupont B, Hansen J | title = Immunogenetic aspects of allotransplantation | journal = Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. | volume = 73 Pt B | issue = | pages = 231–51 | year = 1976 | pmid = 136874 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-3300-5_20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With new series came new antigens; Cw1 and 2 were quickly populated, although Cw typing lagged. Almost half of the antigens could not be resolved by serotyping in the early 90s. Currently genetics defines 18 groups.

At this point, Dw was still being used to identify DR, DQ, and DP antigens. The ability to identify new antigens far exceeded the ability to characterize those new antigens.

As technology for transplantation was deployed around the world, it became clear that these antigens were far from a complete set, and in fact hardly useful in some areas of the world (e.g., Africa, or those descended from Africans). Some serotyping antibodies proved to be poor, with broad specificities, and new serotypes were found that identified a smaller set of antigens more precisely. These broad antigen groups, like A9 and B5, were subdivided into "split" antigen groups, A23 &amp; A24 and B51 &amp; B52, respectively. As the HL-A serotyping developed, so did identification of new antigens.

====Genetic identification====
In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a restriction fragment segregates with individuals who bear the [[HLA-B8]] serotype.  By 1990, it was discovered that a single amino acid sequence difference between HLA-B44 (B*4401 versus B*4402) could result in allograft rejection. This revelation appeared to make serotyping based matching strategies problematic if many such differences existed. In the case of B44, the antigen had already been split from the B12 broad antigen group. In 1983, the cDNA sequences of [[HLA-A3]] and [[HLA-Cw3|Cw3]]&lt;ref name="pmid6609814"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strachan T, Sodoyer R, Damotte M, Jordan BR | title = Complete nucleotide sequence of a functional class I HLA gene, HLA-A3: implications for the evolution of HLA genes | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 887–94 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6609814 | doi = | pmc = 557443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three sequences compared well with mouse MHC class I antigens. The Western European [[HLA-B7]] antigen had been sequenced (although the first sequence had errors and was replaced). In short order, many HLA class I alleles were sequenced
including 2 Cw1 alleles.&lt;ref name="pmid3375250"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Parham P, Lomen CE, Lawlor DA, etal | title = Nature of polymorphism in HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 85 | issue = 11 | pages = 4005–9 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3375250 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.11.4005 | pmc = 280349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the full complexity of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with multiple alleles for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. [[RFLP]] analysis helped determine new alleles, but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and Agarose Gel identification of alleles within an 8-hour day. Alleles that could not be clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.

Serotypes like B*4401, B*4402, B*4403, each abundant within those with B44 serotypes could be determined with unambiguous accuracy. The molecular genetics has advanced HLA technology markedly over serotyping technology, but serotyping still survives. Serotyping had identified the most similar antigens that now form the HLA subgroups. Serotyping can reveal whether an antigen coded by the relevant HLA gene is expressed. An HLA allele coding non-expressed gene is termed "Null Allele", for example: HLA-B*15:01:01:02N. The expression level can also detected by serotyping, an HLA gene coding for antigens which has low protein expression on the cell surface is termed "Low Expresser", for example: HLA-A*02:01:01:02L.

==Summary==
* [[Lymphoid tissue|Lymphoid]] "antigens" became an experimental [[Iatrogenesis|artifact]] of medical techniques (i.e., of transplantation). Simply, as scientist gained familiarity with the human immune system they learned more about graft rejection, the cause was antibody production to proteins in donor tissue. The key word is allo - which means of different origin. 'Allo'typic proteins in 'allo'grafts developed immune responses in recipients. What makes these proteins different?
* From a more modern perspective, HLA [[gene product]]s (i.e., antigen-presenting, [[cell-surface receptor]]s) did not evolve to be transplantation antigens, nor to interfere with transplantation, organ transplantation being unknown until 1960. The HLA genes are much older. Variation in HLA major antigens is the cause of transplant rejection, but variation at HLA is under preservative selection (Called heterozygous selection or [[balancing selection]]). Variation of HLA has led to an estimate that they are at least 60 million years in age for humans (DRB1).&lt;ref name="pmid8533083"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayala FJ | title = The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5244 | pages = 1930–6 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8533083 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5244.1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, the number of HLA alleles is expanding, even with many genes, many more are still tolerable as immune presentation antigens.

The scientific problem has been to explain the natural function of a molecule, such as a self [[cell-surface antigen|cell-surface receptor]] involved in [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. It also seeks to explain how variation developed (perhaps by evolutionary pressure), and how the genetic mechanisms works ([[dominance (genetics)|dominant]], [[codominant]], [[Dominant gene#Incomplete dominance|semidominant]], or [[recessive]]; [[purifying selection]] or [[balancing selection]]).

'''Immunosurgery''' is a method of selectively removing the external [[Cell (biology)|cell]] layer ([[trophoblast]]) of a [[blastocyst]] through a [[cytotoxicity]] procedure.

Immunosurgery can be used to obtain large quantities of pure inner cell masses in a relatively short period of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">{{Distinguish|Interactive computing}}

In [[computer science]], '''interactive computation''' is a [[mathematical model]] for [[computation]] that involves [[input/output]] communication with the external world ''during'' computation. This is in contrast to the traditional understanding of computation which assumes reading input only before computation and writing output only after computation, thus defining a kind of "closed" computation.

The [[Church-Turing thesis]] attempts to define computation and computability in terms of [[Turing machines]]. Because the Turing machine model only provides an answer to the question of what computability of ''functions'' means, but interactive tasks are not always reducible to functions,{{clarify|date=November 2018}} it fails to capture a broader intuition of computation and computability. It was not until recently{{when|date=November 2018}} that the theoretical computer science community realized the necessity to define adequate mathematical models of interactive computation.

==Uses==

Among the currently studied mathematical models of computation that attempt to capture interaction are [[Giorgi Japaridze]]'s hard- and easy-play machines elaborated within the framework of [[computability logic]], [[Dina Q. Goldin]]'s Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), and [[Yuri Gurevich]]'s [[abstract state machine]]s. [[Peter Wegner]] has additionally done a great deal of work on this area of computer science {{cn|date=August 2018}}.

== Early life and education ==
Fetrow is a native of [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/10/jacquelyn_s_fetrow.html|title=Camp Hill native to lead Albright College in 2017|work=PennLive.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Mildred F. Fetrow, was a [[State school|public school]] teacher in the [[West Shore School District]], teaching [[kindergarten]], first grade and second grade for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obits.pennlive.com/obituaries/pennlive/obituary.aspx?n=mildred-f-fetrow-millie&amp;pid=180839835&amp;fhid=22850|title=Mildred F. "Millie" Fetrow's Obituary on Patriot-News|website=Patriot-News|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, David E. Fetrow, was a carpenter. He also worked as a truck salesman, real estate salesman, and office manager.

Fetrow attended [[Camp Hill School District|Camp Hill public schools]] through twelfth grade, [[Albright College]] for her bachelor’s degree (Biochemistry), and [[Penn State College of Medicine]] for a Ph.D. (Biological Chemistry), which she earned in 1986 working with [[George D. Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biophysics.jhu.edu/directory/george-d-rose/|title=George D. Rose|website=Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/new-albright-president-sworn-in|title=New Albright president sworn in {{!}} Reading Eagle - NEWS|work=Reading Eagle|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did post-doctoral stints at the [[University of Rochester School of Medicine]] under the mentorship of [[Fred Sherman (scientist)|Fred Sherman]], and at the [[Whitehead Institute]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] under the tutelage of [[Peter S. Kim]].

== Career ==
Fetrow worked at the [[University at Albany, SUNY]], from 1990 to 1998, serving as assistant and then associate professor of biological sciences.  She then accepted a position at [[The Scripps Research Institute]].  Technology that she helped develop at Scripps served as the foundation for GeneFormatics, Inc., the company that Fetrow co-founded and at which she served as Chief Scientific Officer and Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.albright.edu/reporter/fall2002/biotech.html|title=The Business of Biotech|website=www.albright.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003 she was appointed Reynolds Professor of Computational Biology at [[Wake Forest University]], and in January 2009 she was appointed as Dean of Wake Forest College.  She moved to the University of Richmond to serve as Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs at the [[University of Richmond]] in 2014.  In 2017 she was appointed president of her [[alma mater]], [[Albright College]].

== Research ==
Fetrow was the first to describe the non-regular protein structure, [[omega loop]], a structure she identified and studied for her doctoral dissertation (work published under the name Jacquelyn F. Leszczynski).&lt;ref name="Leszczynski and Rose 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leszczynski JF, Rose GD | title = Loops in globular proteins: a novel category of secondary structure | journal = Science | volume = 234 | issue = 4778 | pages = 849–55 | date = November 1986 | pmid = 3775366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early research work involved the experimental analysis of these structures in the protein [[Cytochrome c family|cytochrome ''c'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fetrow JS, Cardillo TS, Sherman F | title = Deletions and replacements of omega loops in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c | journal = Proteins | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–81 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2560195 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340060404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murphy ME, Fetrow JS, Burton RE, Brayer GD | title = The structure and function of omega loop A replacements in cytochrome c | journal = Protein Science | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 1429–40 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8401228 | pmc = 2142463 | doi = 10.1002/pro.5560020907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mulligan-Pullyblank P, Spitzer JS, Gilden BM, Fetrow JS | title = Loop replacement and random mutagenesis of omega-loop D, residues 70-84, in iso-1-cytochrome c | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 15 | pages = 8633–45 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8621494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, her worked turned to the classification of [[functional site]]s in [[protein structure]]s, resulting in Fuzzy Functional Forms&lt;ref name="Fetrow Skolnick 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fetrow JS, Skolnick J | title = Method for prediction of protein function from sequence using the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm with application to glutaredoxins/thioredoxins and T1 ribonucleases | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 281 | issue = 5 | pages = 949–68 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9719646 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1998.1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and active site profiling.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cammer SA, Hoffman BT, Speir JA, Canady MA, Nelson MR, Knutson S, Gallina M, Baxter SM, Fetrow JS | title = Structure-based active site profiles for genome analysis and functional family subclassification | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 334 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–401 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14623182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work formed the foundation for the company she co-founded, GeneFormatics.

The '''''Journal of Mundane Behavior''''' was a triannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] of [[sociology]] covering [[everyday life|everyday]] behavior and experiences. It was published online with three issues a year. The journal's first issue came out in February 2000 and the last issue appeared in 2004. 

The journal was dedicated to exploring "the minor, redundant and commonplace scenes of life" and celebrating "the majesty of the obvious".&lt;ref&gt;Orleans, Myron: "Why the Mundane?" in ''Journal of Mundane Behavior'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue included articles about the behavior of Japanese people on elevators, the arrangement of books on library shelves, and the social implications of [[facial hair]].&lt;ref name = "Berman" /&gt; The journal reflected a recent trend among [[sociologist]]s to "investigate the largely unconscious verbal and nonverbal conventions of everyday [[social interaction]]s," in contrast to the field's historical focus on [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/20/arts/think-tank-the-mundane-seeks-equal-time-with-the-weird-and-the-deviant.html |title=Think Tank: The Mundane Seeks Equal Time With the Weird and the Deviant |last=Eakin |first=Emily |date=May 20, 2000 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[editor-in-chief]] was Scott Schaffer ([[Millersville University of Pennsylvania]]). The original concept for the journal came from Schaffer and founding co-editor Myron Orleans ([[California State University, Fullerton]]). They were "inspired in part by an article in the scholarly journal [[Sociological Theory (journal)|''Sociological Theory'']] that called for closer inspection of those parts of life that we routinely ignore."&lt;ref name = "Berman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/54160383.html?dids=54160383:54160383&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+25%2C+2000&amp;author=A.S.+Berman&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;desc=Online+journal+puts+the+oddly+mundane+under+a+microscope&amp;pqatl=google |title=Online journal puts the oddly mundane under a microscope |last=Berman |first=A.

'''Kosmos 140''' ({{lang-ru|Космос 140}} meaning ''Cosmos 140'') was an unmanned flight of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/history/flights_soyuz.html |title=Soyuz spacecraft flights |accessdate=2009-04-16 |publisher=S.P.Korolev RSC Energia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third attempted test flight of the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]] model, after orbital ([[Kosmos 133]]) and launch ([[List of R-7 launches (1965–1969)#1967|Soyuz 11A511]]) failures of the first two Soyuz spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{ws |[[s:Mir Hardware Heritage/Part 1 - Soyuz|Part 1 - Soyuz]] in ''Mir Hardware Heritage'' by David S. F. Portree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followup to Cosmos 133 was planned for 14 December, but ended disastrously. At liftoff, the Blok A core stage of the 11A57 booster ignited, but not the strap-ons. A shutdown command was immediately sent and pad crews began to move the service towers back in place and drain the propellants. This task was completed for the core stage and strap-ons, and then about 30 minutes after the attempted launch, the escape tower suddenly fired. Its exhaust caused the Blok I third stage propellant tanks to overheat and explode, killing one person on the ground and damaging the Soyuz and core stage/strap-ons beyond repair. LC-1 was also badly damaged and took a month of repair work in the frigid Kazakhstan winter to be restored to use. The reason for the LES firing was thought to be either a timer being activated due to the Earth's rotation affecting the gyroscope package in the launch vehicle or perhaps one of the service towers bumping it.

In February 1967, the backup booster and spacecraft were set up at LC-1 and the planned mission could be carried out.

The spacecraft suffered [[attitude control]] problems and excessive fuel consumption in orbit, but remained controllable. An attempted maneuver on the 22nd orbit still showed problems with the control system. It malfunctioned yet again during retrofire, leading to a steeper than planned [[ballistic reentry]] and a {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} hole being burned in the heat shield.&lt;ref name="nssdc_details"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1967-009A |title=Cosmos 140 Spacecraft Details |work = National Space Science Data Center Master Catalog |publisher= NASA |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the event would have been lethal to any human occupants, the capsule's recovery systems operated and the capsule crashed through the ice of the frozen [[Aral Sea]], hundreds of kilometers short of its landing zone. The spacecraft finally sank in 10 meters of water and had to be retrieved by divers. The test performance was nonetheless deemed "good enough"; the manned docking missions of [[Soyuz 1]] and [[Soyuz 2A|Soyuz 2]] were approved for the next flight.&lt;ref name="nssdc_details"/&gt;

'''Kurt Heinrich Debus'''&lt;ref name=Darling /&gt; (November 29, 1908 – October 10, 1983) was a German [[V-2 rocket]] scientist [[Nazi Germany|during World War II]] who, after being brought to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]], in 1962 became the first director of [[NASA]]'s Launch Operations Center (later the [[Kennedy Space Center]]).

Debus directed the design, development, construction and operation of NASA's [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch facilities at the north end of Cape Canaveral and adjacent Merritt Island in Florida. Under him, NASA conducted 150 launches of military missiles and space vehicles, including 13 [[Saturn V]] rockets, the booster for the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] manned moon landings.

==Biography==
===Germany===
Born to Heinrich and Melly Debus&lt;ref name=McCleskey&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/84985main_debus.pdf |title=Dr. Kurt H. Debus: Launching a Vision |conference=35th History of Astronautics Symposium. 1–5 October 2001. Toulouse, France. |first1=C. M. |last1=McCleskey |first2=D. L. |last2=Christensen |date=2001 |id=IAA-01-IAA-2.1.08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Frankfurt, Germany in 1908, Debus received all his schooling in that country. He attended [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|Technische Hochschule Darmstadt]] where he earned his initial and advanced degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering. He served as a graduate assistant on the faculty for electrical engineering and high-voltage engineering while studying for his master's degree.

In 1939, he obtained his engineering doctorate with a thesis on surge voltages, and was appointed assistant professor at the university. During World War II, Debus was a member of the [[Nazi Party]], a member of the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) and Himmler's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fr.de/wissen/astronomieraumfahrt/mond-helden-von-huntsville-braune-flecken-auf-der-weste-a-1088769 |title=Braune Flecken auf der Weste |work=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]] |first=Karl-Heinz |last=Karisch |date=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1995/0826/chefredaktion/0010/index.html |title=Die Operation 'Paperclip' |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |first=Martin |last=Koch |date=August 26, 1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030422215529/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/1995/0826/chefredaktion/0010/index.html |archivedate=April 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Debus was appointed by Hitler as the V-weapons flight test director and was actively engaged in the rocket research program at [[Peenemünde]] and the development of the [[V-2 rocket]], Debus led the Test Stand Group&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |first=Michael J. |last=Neufeld |page=57 |date=1995 |isbn=0-02-922895-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; personnel at Peenemünde&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;{{cite book |title=The Birth of the Missile: The Secrets of Peenemünde |publisher=Gerhard Stalling Verlag |location=Hamburg |first1=Ernst |last1=Klee |first2=Otto |last2=Merk |translator-first=T. |translator-last=Schoeters |page=109 |date=1965 |oclc=566125989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the engineer in charge at [[Test Stand VII]].&lt;ref name=Huzel&gt;{{cite book |title=Peenemünde to Canaveral |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |first=Dieter K. |last=Huzel |date=1962 |oclc=1374588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Debus and a small group of the V-2 engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]]'s brother sought out the advancing American 44th Infantry Division near Schattwald on May 2, 1945. Debus was detained by the U.S. Army with the rest of the Peenemünde scientists at Garmisch–Partenkirchen.&lt;ref name=McCleskey /&gt;

Debus served as both a technical and diplomatic liaison between German rocket engineers and the British during Operation Backfire, a series of V-2 test launches from an abandoned German naval gun range near Cuxhaven, Germany, in October 1945.&lt;ref name="McCleskey" /&gt;

===United States===
In late 1945, Debus was transferred to [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]], under contract as a "special employee" of the U.S. Army, as were the other German rocket specialists.  He was deputy director at the Guidance and Control Branch through December 1948, when he was promoted to assistant technical director to von Braun at the [[Redstone Arsenal]] in Huntsville, Alabama.[[Image:Saturn 500F Rollout Attendees - GPN-2000-000616.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Debus (right) and Wernher von Braun at a Saturn V test vehicle rollout, 1966]]

The arsenal became the focal point of the Army's rocket and space projects; larger rockets were launched first from [[White Sands Missile Range]] in New Mexico, and later from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]]. The Army assigned von Braun as chairman of a Development Board, and Debus supervised the development program of the Guided Missile Branch until November 1951.&lt;ref name="McCleskey" /&gt;

The Army Ordnance Department reorganized the team and called it the Ordnance Guided Missile Center.  By November 1951, the pace had picked up and a new missile program, the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]], was taking shape. Von Braun named Debus to lead a new Experimental Missiles Firing Branch.&lt;ref name="McCleskey" /&gt; Debus' organization also launched the first U.S. missiles carrying atomic warheads in the Pacific Ocean area during a series of tests.&lt;ref name=NASA2 /&gt;

Starting in 1952, Debus supervised the development and construction of rocket launch facilities at Cape Canaveral for the Redstone, [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]], [[Jupiter-C]], Juno and Pershing military configurations continuing through 1960. The organization he directed was transferred from the Army to NASA.

Beginning in 1961, Debus directed the design, development and construction of NASA's [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launch facilities at the north end of Cape Canaveral and adjacent Merritt Island.&lt;ref name=NASA2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/biographies/debus.html |title=Dr. Kurt H. Debus |series=Kennedy Biographies |publisher=NASA |date=February 1987 |access-date=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1962, the Florida launch facility at Cape Canaveral was officially designated as NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center|Launch Operations Center]] (renamed to honor President John Kennedy after his assassination in 1963) and Debus was officially named its first director. In October 1965, he became responsible for NASA unmanned launch operations at the [[Eastern Range|Eastern]] and [[Western Range]]s, assuming the additional title of Kennedy Space Center (KSC) director of launch operations until [[Rocco Petrone]] took the post in 1966.

Under Debus' leadership, NASA and its team of contractors built what was hailed as the [[Free World]]'s Moonport&amp;nbsp;— KSC's [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]]&amp;nbsp;— as well as tested and launched the Saturn family of rockets for the Apollo and [[Skylab]] programs. Debus retired as KSC director in November 1974.

===Family===
Debus married Irmgard "Gay" (née Brueckmann) June 30, 1937; they had two daughters while still in Germany: Siegrid and Ute.&lt;ref name=McCleskey /&gt;

==Recognition==
A small [[Debus (crater)|lunar crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] to the east-southeast of the crater [[Ganskiy (crater)|Ganskiy]], past the eastern limb, is named for Debus; as is The Kurt Debus Conference Center at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]]. Debus was inducted into the National Space Hall of Fame in 1969.

Since 1990, the National Space Club of Florida has presented its annual Debus Award to recognize significant aerospace achievements in Florida, including individuals associated with launch vehicles, spacecraft operations, ground support services, range activities, space education and spaceport research and development. The award was conceived as an adjunct to the Goddard Award given each year by the [[National Space Club]] in Washington, D.C. to an individual in the aerospace field on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nscfl.org/debus-award |title=Dr. Kurt H.

'''''Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder''''' is a 2005 book by author [[Richard Louv]] that documents decreased exposure of children to [[nature]] in American society and how this "[[nature-deficit disorder]]" harms children and society.  The book examines research and concludes that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy [[childhood]] development and for the physical and [[emotional]] health of children and [[adult]]s. The author also suggests solutions to the problems he describes.  A revised and expanded edition was published in 2008.

== Reception ==
The book was on the [[New York Times]] best seller list for best paper nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/books/bestseller/0629bestpapernonfiction.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin The New York Times; Top 30 Paperback Nonfiction; nytimes.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author received the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] "for sounding the alarm about the health and societal costs of children's isolation from the natural world—and for sparking a growing movement to remedy the problem."&lt;ref name="Timm"&gt;{{cite news | first = Brenda | last = Timm | title = Author Richard Louv honored with the 50th Audubon medal | url = http://web1.audubon.org/news/pressRelease.php?id=240 | date = January 24, 2008 | publisher = Audubon | accessdate = 2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Si100Reconstructed.png|thumbnail|240px|'''Figure 1''': LEED pattern of a Si(100) reconstructed surface. The underlying lattice is a square lattice while the surface reconstruction has a 2x1 periodicity. As discussed in the text, the pattern shows that reconstruction exists in symmetrically equivalent domains which are oriented along different crystallographic axes. The diffraction spots are generated by acceleration of elastically scattered electrons onto a hemispherical fluorescent screen. Also seen is the electron gun which generates the primary electron beam. It covers up parts of the screen.]]

LEED may be used in one of two ways:

# Qualitatively, where the diffraction pattern is recorded and analysis of the spot positions gives information on the symmetry of the surface structure. In the presence of an adsorbate the qualitative analysis may reveal information about the size and rotational alignment of the adsorbate unit cell with respect to the substrate unit cell.
# Quantitatively, where the intensities of diffracted beams are recorded as a function of incident electron beam energy to generate the so-called I-V curves. By comparison with theoretical curves, these may provide accurate information on atomic positions on the surface at hand.

=== Davisson and Germer's discovery of electron diffraction===
The theoretical possibility of the occurrence of electron diffraction first emerged in 1924 when Louis de Broglie introduced wave mechanics and proposed the wavelike nature of all particles. In his Nobel laureated work de Broglie postulated that the wavelength of a particle with linear momentum ''p'' is given by ''h/p'', where ''h'' is Planck's constant.
The de Broglie hypothesis was [[Davisson–Germer experiment|confirmed experimentally]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1927 when Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer fired low-energy electrons at a crystalline [[nickel]] target and observed that the angular dependence of the intensity of backscattered electrons showed diffraction patterns. These observations were consistent with the diffraction theory for [[X-ray]]s developed by Bragg and Laue earlier. Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis diffraction was believed to be an exclusive property of waves.

Davisson and Germer published notes of their electron diffraction experiment result in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] and in [[Physical Review]] in 1927. One month after Davisson and Germer's work appeared, Thompson and Reid published their electron diffraction work with higher kinetic energy (thousand times higher than the energy used by Davisson and Germer) in the same journal. Those experiments revealed the wave property of electrons and opened up an era of electron diffraction study.

===Development of LEED as a tool in surface science===
Though discovered in 1927, low energy electron diffraction did not become a popular tool for surface analysis until the early 1960s. The main reasons were that monitoring directions and intensities of diffracted beams was a difficult experimental process due to inadequate vacuum techniques and slow detection methods such as a [[Faraday cup]]. Also, since LEED is a surface sensitive method, it required well-ordered surface structures. Techniques for the preparation of clean metal surfaces first became available much later.
Nonetheless, H. E. Farnsworth and coworkers at [[Brown University]] pioneered the use of LEED as a method for characterizing the absorption of gases onto clean metal surfaces and the associated regular adsorption phases, starting shortly after the Davisson and Germer discovery into the 1970's.

In the early 1960s LEED experienced a renaissance, as ultra high vacuum became widely available and the post acceleration detection method was introduced by none less than Germer and his coworkers at Bell Labs using a flat phosphor screen.&lt;ref name="GermerLEED"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.1716903 | author=E. J. Scheibner, L. H. Germer, and C. D. Hartman |title=Apparatus for Direct Observation of LEED Patterns | journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum. | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=112-114 | date=1960| bibcode=1960RScI...31..112S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="directviewLEED"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.1717051 | author=L. H.

Instrum. | volume=31 | issue=7 | pages=784 | date=1960| bibcode=1960RScI...31..784G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this technique diffracted electrons were accelerated to high energies to produce clear and visible diffraction patterns on a fluorescent screen. Ironically the post-acceleration method had already been proposed by Ehrenberg in 1934.&lt;ref name="postacceleration"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/14786443409462562 | author=W. Ehrenberg |title=A new method of investigating the diffraction of slow electrons by crystals | journal=Phil. Mag. | volume=18 | issue=122 | pages=878-901 | date=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 Lander and colleagues introduced the modern hemispherical screen with associated hemispherical grids.&lt;ref name="hemisphericalLEED"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.1717975 | author=J. J. Lander, J. Morrison, and F. Unterwald |title=Improved Design and Method of Operation of LEED Equipment | journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum. | volume=33 | issue=7 | pages=782-783 | date=1962| bibcode=1962RScI...33..782L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid sixties, modern LEED systems became commercially available as part of the ultra-high vacuum instrumentation suite by [[Varian Associates]] and triggered an enormous boost of activities in surface science. Notably future Nobel prize winner Gerhard Ertl started his studies of surface chemistry and catalysis on such a Varian system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ertl|first=G.|date=1967|title=Untersuchung von oberflächenreaktionen mittels beugung langsamer elektronen (LEED)|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0039602867900052|journal=Surface Science|volume=6|issue=2|pages=208–232|doi=10.1016/0039-6028(67)90005-2|issn=0039-6028|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became clear that the kinematic (single scattering) theory, which had been successfully used to explain [[X-ray diffraction]] experiments, was inadequate for the quantitative interpretation of experimental data obtained from LEED. At this stage a detailed determination of surface structures, including adsorption sites, bond angles and bond lengths was not possible.
A dynamical electron diffraction theory which took into account the possibility of multiple scattering was established in the late 1960s. With this theory it later became possible to reproduce experimental data with high precision.

==Experimental Setup==
In order to keep the studied sample clean and free from unwanted adsorbates, LEED experiments are performed in an ultra-high-vacuum environment (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar). [[File:LEED Experimental Diagram.jpg|thumbnail|410px|'''Figure 2''' Diagram of a LEED optics apparatus.]]
The most important elements in a LEED experiment are:&lt;ref name="VanHove"/&gt;

# A sample holder with the prepared sample
# An electron gun
# A display system, usually a hemispherical fluorescent screen on which the diffraction pattern can be observed directly
# A sputtering gun for cleaning the surface
# An [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] system in order to determine the purity of the surface.

A simplified sketch of an LEED setup is shown in figure 2.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, A., "Physics at Surfaces", Cambridge University Press (1988), p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample preparation===
The sample is usually prepared outside the vacuum chamber by cutting a slice of around 1&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness and 1&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter along the desired crystallographic axis.
The correct alignment of the crystal can be achieved with the help of x-ray methods and should be within 1° of the desired angle.&lt;ref name="PendryLEED"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pendry| title=Low-Energy Electron Diffraction | publisher=Academic Press Inc. (London) LTD | date=1974 | pages=1–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After being mounted in the UHV chamber the sample is chemically cleaned and flattened. Unwanted surface contaminants are removed by ion sputtering or by chemical processes such as [[Redox|oxidation and reduction]] cycles. The surface is flattened by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] at high temperatures.
Once a clean and well-defined surface is prepared, monolayers can be adsorbed on the surface by exposing it to a gas consisting of the desired adsorbate atoms or molecules.

Often the annealing process will let bulk impurities diffuse to the surface and therefore give rise to a re-contamination after each cleaning cycle. The problem is that impurities which adsorb without changing the basic symmetry of the surface, cannot easily be identified in the diffraction pattern. Therefore, in many LEED experiments Auger electron spectroscopy is used to accurately determine the purity of the sample.

===Electron gun===
In the [[electron gun]], monochromatic electrons are emitted by a [[cathode]] filament which is at a negative potential, typically 10-600 V, with respect to the sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of the electrons incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface as wide as the electron beam, although sometimes polycrystalline surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.

===Detector system===
A LEED detector usually contains three or four hemispherical concentric grids and a [[phosphor]] screen or other position-sensitive detector. The grids are used for screening out the inelastically scattered electrons. Most new LEED systems use a reverse view scheme, which has a minimized electron gun, and the pattern is viewed from behind through a transmission screen and a viewport. Recently, a new digitized position sensitive detector called a delay-line detector with better [[Stops (Dynamic Range)|dynamic range]] and resolution has been developed.

The LEED contains a retarding field analyzer to block inelastically scattered electrons.
Because only spherical fields around the sampled point are allowed and the geometry of the sample and the surrounding area is not spherical, no field is allowed. Therefore, the first grid screens separates the space above the sample from the retarding field. The next grid is at a potential to block low energy electrons, it is called the suppressor or the [[gate]]. To make the retarding field homogeneous and mechanically more stable this grid often consists of two grids. The fourth grid is only necessary when the LEED is used like a [[tetrode]] and the current at the screen is measured, when it serves as screen between the gate and the [[anode]].

===Using the detector for Auger electron spectroscopy===
To improve the measured signal in [[Auger electron spectroscopy]], the gate voltage is scanned in a linear ramp. An [[RC circuit]] serves to derive the second [[derivative]], which is then amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are summed up. The first derivative is very large due to the residual capacitive coupling between gate and the anode and may degrade the performance of the circuit. By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q [[RLC circuit]] is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.

===Data acquisition===
[[Image:LEED pattern of clean Platinum-Rhodium single crystal.jpg|left|thumbnail|240px|'''Image 1''': LEED pattern of a clean platinum-rhodium (100) (Miller-index) single crystal. Taken in high vacuum using an electron gun with an energy of 85 eV.]]

[[Image:LEED pattern of CO on Platinum-Rhodium (100) surface, E = 94 eV.JPG|right|thumbnail|240px|'''Image 2''': LEED pattern of CO on platinum-rhodium (100) (Miller-index) surface of a single crystal. Taken in high vacuum using an electron gun with an energy of 94 eV.]]

A modern data acquisition system usually contains a [[image sensor|CCD/CMOS]] camera pointed to the screen for diffraction pattern visualization and a computer for data recording and further analysis.

The shown images are examples of LEED diffraction patterns. The difference between image 1 and 2 is remarkable; where image 1 is of a clean (100) platinum-rhodium single crystal, and image 2 of the same crystal with CO adsorbed on the surface. The original surface order of the clean crystal is clearly visible in image 1, it shows a [[Low-energy electron diffraction#Interpretation of LEED patterns|C(1x1)]] structure; the extra spots in image 2 are caused by the CO on the surface and are an example of a C(2x2) structure. The diffraction spots are generated by acceleration of elastically scattered electrons onto a hemispherical fluorescent screen, a retarding field analyzer. In the middle one can see the bright spot of the electron gun which generates the primary electron beam.

==Theory==

===Surface sensitivity===
The basic reason for the high surface sensitivity of LEED is that for low-energy electrons the interaction between the solid and electrons is especially strong. Upon penetrating the crystal, primary electrons will lose kinetic energy due to inelastic scattering processes such as plasmon- and phonon excitations as well as electron-electron interactions.
In cases where the detailed nature of the inelastic processes is unimportant they are commonly treated by assuming an exponential decay of the primary electron beam intensity, I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in the direction of propagation:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(d) = I_0 * e^{-d/\Lambda(E)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the penetration depth and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(E)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inelastic mean free path]], defined as the distance an electron can travel before its intensity has decreased by the factor ''1/e''. While the inelastic scattering processes and consequently the electronic mean free path depend on the energy, it is relatively independent of the material. The mean free path turns out to be minimal (5–10 Å) in the energy range of low-energy electrons (20–200 eV).&lt;ref name = "Oura"/&gt; This effective attenuation means that only a few atomic layers are sampled by the electron beam and as a consequence the contribution of deeper atoms to the diffraction progressively decreases.

===Kinematic theory: single scattering===
[[Image:Ewaldsphere1.png|thumbnail|400 px| '''Figure 3''': [[Ewald's sphere]] construction for the case of diffraction from a 2D-lattice. The intersections between Ewald's sphere and reciprocal lattice rods define the allowed diffracted beams.]]
Kinematic diffraction is defined as the situation where electrons impinging on a well-ordered crystal surface are elastically scattered only once by that surface. In the theory the electron beam is represented by a plane wave with a wavelength in accordance to the [[De Broglie wavelength#de Broglie relations|de Broglie hypothesis]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}, \qquad \lambda[\textrm{nm}]\approx\sqrt{\frac{1.5}{E[\textrm{eV}]}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The interaction between the scatterers present in the surface and the incident electrons is most conveniently described in reciprocal space. In three dimensions the primitive [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors are related to the real space lattice {'''a, b, c'''} in the following way:&lt;ref name="Kittel"&gt;{{cite book | author=C. Kittel | title= Introduction to Solid State Physics | publisher=John Wiley, US | date=1996 | chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textbf{a}^* &amp;=\frac{2\pi\textbf{b}\times\textbf{c}}{\textbf{a}\cdot(\textbf{b}\times\textbf{c})}, \\
\textbf{b}^* &amp;= \frac{2\pi\textbf{c}\times\textbf{a}}{\textbf{b}\cdot(\textbf{c}\times\textbf{a})}, \\
 \textbf{c}^* &amp;= \frac{2\pi\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}}{\textbf{c}\cdot(\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b})}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For an incident electron with wave vector &lt;math&gt;\textbf{k}_0=2\pi/\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; and scattered wave vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\textbf{k}=2\pi/\lambda\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;, the condition for constructive interference and hence diffraction of scattered electron waves is given by the [[Laue equations|Laue condition]]
[[Image:EwaldsphereLEED.png|thumbnail|400px| '''Figure 4''': Ewald's sphere construction for the case of normal incidence of the primary electron beam. The diffracted beams are indexed according to the values of ''h'' and ''l''.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textbf{k}-\textbf{k}_0 = \textbf{G}_\textrm{hkl}, (1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where (''h'',''k'',''l'') is a set of integers and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \textbf{G}_\textrm{hkl} = h\textbf{a}^*+k\textbf{b}^*+l\textbf{c}^*
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a vector of the reciprocal lattice. The magnitudes of the wave vectors are unchanged, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|\textbf{k}_0|=|\textbf{k}|&lt;/math&gt;, since only elastic scattering is considered.
Since the mean free path of low energy electrons in a crystal is only a few angstroms, only the first few atomic layers contribute to the diffraction. This means that there are no diffraction conditions in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As a consequence the reciprocal lattice of a surface is a 2D lattice with rods extending perpendicular from each lattice point. The rods can be pictured as regions where the reciprocal lattice points are infinitely dense.
Therefore, in the case of diffraction from a surface equation (1) reduces to the 2D form:&lt;ref name="VanHove"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \textbf{k}^{||}-\textbf{k}_0^{||} = \textbf{G}_\textrm{hk}=h\textbf{a}^*+k\textbf{b}^*, (2)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{b}^*&lt;/math&gt; are the primitive translation vectors of the 2D reciprocal lattice of the surface and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{k}^{||},\textbf{k}_0^{||}&lt;/math&gt; denote the component of respectively the reflected and incident wave vector parallel to the sample surface. &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{b}^*&lt;/math&gt; are related to the real space surface lattice in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \textbf{a}^* &amp;=\frac{2\pi\textbf{b}\times\hat{\textbf{n}}}{|\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}|}\\
 \textbf{b}^* &amp;=\frac{2\pi\hat{\textbf{n}}\times{\textbf{a}}}{|\textbf{a}\times\textbf{b}|}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Laue condition equation (2) can readily be visualized using the Ewald's sphere construction.
Figure 4 shows a simple illustration of this principle: The wave vector &lt;math&gt;\textbf{k}_0&lt;/math&gt; of the incident electron beam is drawn such that it terminates at a reciprocal lattice point. The Ewald's sphere is then the sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;|\textbf{k}_0|&lt;/math&gt; and origin at the center of the incident wave vector.

By construction, every wave vector centered at the origin and terminating at an intersection between a rod and the sphere will then satisfy the Laue condition and thus represent an allowed diffracted beam.

===Interpretation of LEED patterns===
[[Image:Diffractionpattern.png|thumbnail|400 px| '''Figure 5''': Real space- and reciprocal lattices for the case of '''a)''' a (100) face of a simple cubic lattice and '''b)''' a (2×1) commensurate superstructure. The white spots in the LEED pattern are the ''extra spots'' associated with the adsorbate structure.]]
Figure 4 shows the Ewald's sphere for the case of normal incidence of the primary electron beam, as would be the case in an actual LEED setup. It is apparent that the pattern observed on the fluorescent screen is a direct picture of the reciprocal lattice of the surface. The size of the Ewald's sphere and hence the number of diffraction spots on the screen is controlled by the incident electron energy. From the knowledge of the reciprocal lattice models for the real space lattice can be constructed and the surface can be characterized at least qualitatively in terms of the surface periodicity and the point group. Figure 5.a shows a model of an unreconstructed (100) face of a simple cubic crystal and the expected LEED pattern. The spots are indexed according to the values of ''h'' and ''k''.

We now consider the case of an overlaying superstructure on a substrate surface. If the LEED pattern of the underlying (1×1) surface is known, spots due to the superstructure can be identified as ''extra spots'' or ''super spots''. Figure 5.b shows the simple example of a (2×1) superstructure on a square lattice.

For a commensurate superstructure the symmetry and the rotational alignment with respect to adsorbent surface can be determined from the LEED pattern. This is easiest shown by using a matrix notation,&lt;ref name="Oura" /&gt; where the primitive translation vectors of the superlattice {'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;,'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;} are linked to the primitive translation vectors of the underlying (1x1) lattice {'''a''','''b'''} in the following way

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textbf{a}_s &amp;= G_{11}\textbf{a} + G_{12}\textbf{b},\\
\textbf{b}_s &amp;= G_{21}\textbf{a} + G_{22}\textbf{b}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix for the superstructure then is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 G_{11}&amp;G_{12} \\
 G_{21}&amp;G_{22}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the primitive translation vectors of the lattice describing the ''extra spots'' {'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;} are linked to the primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice {'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,'''b'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textbf{a}_s^* &amp;= G_{11}^*\textbf{a}^* + G_{12}^*\textbf{b}^*,\\
\textbf{b}_s^* &amp;= G_{21}^*\textbf{a}^* + G_{22}^*\textbf{b}^*.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is related to &lt;small&gt;G&lt;/small&gt; in the following way

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G^* &amp;= (G^{-1})^T\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{det(G)}\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 G_{22}&amp;-G_{21} \\
 -G_{12}&amp;G_{11}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Domains====
An essential problem when considering LEED patterns is the existence of symmetrically equivalent domains. Domains may lead to diffraction patterns which have higher symmetry than the actual surface at hand. The reason is that usually the cross sectional area of the primary electron beam (~1&amp;nbsp;mm²) is large compared to the average domain size on the surface and hence the LEED pattern might be a superposition of diffraction beams from domains oriented along different axes of the substrate lattice.

However, since the average domain size generally is larger than the coherence length of the probing electrons, interference between electrons scattered from different domains can be neglected. Therefore, the total LEED pattern emerges as the incoherent sum of the diffraction patterns associated with the individual domains.

Figure 6 shows the superposition of the diffraction patterns for the two orthogonal domains (2x1) and (1x2) on a square lattice, i.e. for the case where one structure is just rotated by 90° with respect to the other. The (2x1) structure and the respective LEED pattern are shown in figure 5.b. It is apparent that the local symmetry of the surface structure is twofold while the LEED pattern exhibits a fourfold symmetry.

Figure 1 shows a real diffraction pattern of the same situation for the case of a Si(100) surface. However, here the (2x1) structure is formed due to [[surface reconstruction]].

[[Image:Domains.png|thumbnail|400px| '''Figure 6''': Superposition of the LEED patterns associated with the two orthogonal domains (2x1) and (1x2). The LEED pattern has a fourfold rotational symmetry.]]

===Dynamical theory: multiple scattering===
The inspection of the LEED pattern gives a qualitative picture of the surface periodicity i.e. the size of the surface unit cell and to a certain degree of surface symmetries. However it will give no information about the atomic arrangement within a surface unit cell or the sites of adsorbed atoms. For instance if the whole superstructure in figure 5.b is shifted such that the atoms adsorb in bridge sites instead of on-top sites the LEED pattern will be the same.

A more quantitative analysis of LEED experimental data can be achieved by analysis of so-called I-V curves, which are measurements of the intensity versus incident electron energy. The I-V curves can be recorded by using a camera connected to computer controlled data handling or by direct measurement with a movable Faraday cup. The experimental curves are then compared to computer calculations based on the assumption of a particular model system. The model is changed in an iterative process until a satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical curves is achieved. A quantitative measure for this agreement is the so-called ''reliability''- or R-factor. A commonly used reliability factor is the one proposed by Pendry.&lt;ref name="PendryRFactor"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0022-3719/13/5/024 | author=J.B. Pendry|title=Reliability Factors for LEED Calculations | journal=J. Phys. C | volume=13 | issue=5| pages=937-944 | date=1980 |bibcode = 1980JPhC...13..937P }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expressed in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 L(E)&amp;= I'/I.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The R-factor is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \sum_g \int (Y_\textrm{gth}-Y_\textrm{gexpt})^2dE/\sum_g \int (Y^2_\textrm{gth}+Y^2_\textrm{gexpt})dE,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y(E)=L^{-1}/(L^{-2}+V^2_{oi})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{oi}&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the electron self-energy. In general, &lt;math&gt;R_p\leq0.2&lt;/math&gt; is considered as a good agreement, &lt;math&gt;R_p\simeq0.3&lt;/math&gt; is considered mediocre and &lt;math&gt;R_p\simeq0.5&lt;/math&gt; is considered a bad agreement. Figure 7 shows examples of the comparison between experimental I-V spectra and theoretical calculations.

===Dynamical LEED calculations===
The term ''dynamical'' stems from the studies of X-ray diffraction and describes the situation where the response of the crystal to an incident wave is included self-consistently and multiple scattering can occur. The aim of any dynamical LEED theory is to calculate the intensities of diffraction of an electron beam impinging on a surface as accurately as possible.

A common method to achieve this is the self-consistent multiple scattering approach.&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0039-6028(67)90071-4 | author=E.G. McRae|title=Self-Consistent Multiple-Scattering Approach to the Interpretation of Low-Energy Electron Diffraction | journal= Surface Science | volume=8 | issue=1–2 | pages=14–34 | date=1967 |bibcode = 1967SurSc...8...14M }}&lt;/ref&gt; One essential point in this approach is the assumption that the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.

A common approach in LEED calculations is to describe the scattering potential of the crystal by a "muffin tin" model, where the crystal potential can be imagined being divided up by non-overlapping spheres centered at each atom such that the potential has a spherically symmetric form inside the spheres and is constant everywhere else. The choice of this potential reduces the problem to scattering from spherical potentials, which can be dealt with effectively. The task is then to solve the [[Schrödinger equation]] for an incident electron wave in that "muffin tin" potential.

=== Tensor LEED ===
In LEED the exact atomic configuration of a surface is determined by a trial and error process where measured I-V curves are compared to computer-calculated spectra under the assumption of a model structure. From an initial reference structure a set of trial structures is created by varying the model parameters. The parameters are changed until an optimal agreement between theory and experiment is achieved. However, for each trial structure a full LEED calculation with multiple scattering corrections must be conducted. For systems with a large parameter space the need for computational time might become significant. This is the case for complex surfaces structures or when considering large molecules as adsorbates.

Tensor LEED&lt;ref name="TensorPendry"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0010-4655(89)90039-8 | author=P.J. Rous J.B.

Sci. | volume=219 | issue=3 | pages=355–372 | date=1989|bibcode = 1989SurSc.219..355R }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an attempt to reduce the computational effort needed by avoiding full LEED calculations for each trial structure. The scheme is as follows: One first defines a reference surface structure for which the I-V spectrum is calculated. Next a trial structure is created by displacing some of the atoms. If the displacements are small the trial structure can be considered as a small perturbation of the reference structure and first-order perturbation theory can be used to determine the I-V curves of a large set of trial structures.

=== Spot Profile Analysis Low-Energy Electron Diffraction ===
A real surface is not perfectly periodic but has many imperfections in the form of dislocations, atomic steps, terraces and the presence of unwanted adsorbed atoms. This departure from a perfect surface leads to a broadening of the diffraction spots and adds to the background intensity in the LEED pattern.

SPA-LEED&lt;ref name="HenzlerSPALEED"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0378-5963(82)90092-7 | author=M. Henzler|title=Studies of Surface Imperfections | journal=Appl. Surf. Sci | volume=11/12 | pages=450-469 | date=1982 |bibcode = 1982ApSS...11..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique where the intensity of diffraction beams is measured in order to determine the diffraction spot profiles. The spots are sensitive to the irregularities in the surface structure and their examination therefore permits more-detailed conclusions about some surface characteristics. Using SPA-LEED may for instance permit a quantitative determination of the surface roughness, terrace sizes or surface steps.&lt;ref name="HenzlerSPALEED"/&gt;

[[File:Electronic and vibrational levels of the hydrogen molecule.png|thumb|electronic and vibrational levels of the hydrogen molecule]]
In reference to the figure shown, Lyman-Werner photons are emitted as described below:
*A hydrogen molecule can absorb a far-ultraviolet photon (11.2eV&lt;[[photon energy|energy of the photon]]&lt;13.6eV) and make a transition from the ground [[electronic state]] X to excited state B (Lyman) or C (Werner).
*Radiative decay occurs rapidly.
*10-15% of the decays occur into the vibrational continuum. This means that the hydrogen molecule has dissociated.
*Photo-dissociation fragments carry away some of the photon energy as [[kinetic energy]], heating the gas.
*Rest of the decays are either radiative decay ([[infrared]] emission) or collisional, which ultimately end up heating the gas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11735">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;, a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, and the constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]]; the letters MV refer to the [[Many-valued logic|''many-valued'' logic]] of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative [[BCK algebra]]s.

==Definitions==
An '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, \lnot, 0\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; consisting of
* a [[empty set|non-empty]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; and
* a constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; denoting a fixed [[element (mathematics)|element]] of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:
* &lt;math&gt; (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus 0 = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus y = y \oplus x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot \lnot x = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus \lnot 0 = \lnot 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot ( \lnot x \oplus y)\oplus y = \lnot ( \lnot y \oplus x) \oplus x.&lt;/math&gt;

By virtue of the first three axioms, &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative [[monoid]]. Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of [[BL (logic)|BL]]-algebras and contains all [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

An MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]] &lt;math&gt;\langle L, \wedge, \vee, \otimes, \rightarrow, 0, 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the additional identity &lt;math&gt;x \vee y = (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of MV-algebras==
A simple numerical example is &lt;math&gt;A=[0,1],&lt;/math&gt; with operations &lt;math&gt;x \oplus y = \min(x+y,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot x=1-x.&lt;/math&gt; In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the ''standard MV-algebra'', as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

The ''trivial'' MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way, &lt;math&gt;0\oplus0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot0=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''two-element'' MV-algebra is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\},&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; coinciding with Boolean disjunction and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x = x&lt;/math&gt; to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomatization of Boolean algebras.

If instead the axiom added is &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \oplus x = x \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;, then the axioms define the MV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Axiomatizations of Ln need Grigolia's axioms|date=February 2013}}. Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\dots,1\},&lt;/math&gt; which is closed under the operations &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another important example is ''Chang's MV-algebra'', consisting just of infinitesimals (with the [[order type]] &amp;omega;) and their co-infinitesimals.

Chang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary [[Linearly ordered group|totally ordered abelian group]] ''G'' by fixing a positive element ''u'' and defining the segment [0, ''u''] as { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' }, which becomes an MV-algebra with ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = min(''u'', ''x''+''y'') and ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x''. Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.

D. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian [[lattice-ordered group]]s. If ''G'' is such a group with strong (order) unit ''u'', then the "unit interval" { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' } can be equipped with ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x'', ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = ''u''∧&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (x+y), ''x'' ⊗ ''y'' = 0∨&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+''y''−''u''). This construction establishes a [[categorical equivalence]] between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.

==Relation to Łukasiewicz logic==
[[C. C. Chang]] devised MV-algebras to study [[many-valued logic]]s, introduced by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]], as described below.

Given an MV-algebra ''A'', an ''A''-[[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the algebra of [[propositional formula]]s (in the language consisting of &lt;math&gt;\oplus,\lnot,&lt;/math&gt; and 0) into ''A''. Formulas mapped to 1 (or &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;0) for all ''A''-valuations are called ''A''-[[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Chang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]], defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.

The way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]] in a manner analogous to the way that [[Boolean algebras]] characterize classical [[two-element Boolean algebra|bivalent logic]] (see [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]).

In 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the [[Wajsberg algebra]] as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, "Wajsberg Algebras", ''Stochastica'', VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras ===
{{expand section|the extra axioms|date=August 2014}}
In the 1940s [[Grigore Moisil]] introduced his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]s (LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras) in the hope of giving [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] for the (finitely) ''n''-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz ''n''-valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]]. For the axiomatically more complicated (finitely) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by [[Revaz Grigolia]] and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras; the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are MV-algebras which satisfy some additional axioms, just like the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics have additional axioms added to the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued logic.

In 1982 [[Roberto Cignoli]] published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R.

There are multiple frameworks implementing fuzzy logic (type II), and most of them implement what has been called a '''multi-adjoint logic'''. This is no more than the implementation of a MV-algebra.

[[File:Mangroves in Kannur, India.jpg|thumbnail|Mangroves in [[Kannur]], India.]]

A '''mangrove swamp''' was a distinct saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat formed by [[mangrove]] trees. They are characterized by [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from [[brackish water]], through pure [[seawater]] (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the [[salinity]] of ocean seawater (up to 9%).&lt;ref name=NHMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |title=Morphological and Physiological Adaptations: Florida mangrove website |publisher=Nhmi.org |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204222702/http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds sanctuaries==

Mangrove swamps are home and sanctuaries for thousands of [[aquatic bird]] species, including:

* [[Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Pichavaram]]
* [[Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary]]
* [[Sundarbans National Park]]

==Natural coastal protection==

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during [[hurricanes]]), and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazda | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kobashi | first2 = D. | last3 = Okada | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | title = Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps | url = | journal = Wetlands Ecology and Management | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 647–655 | doi=10.1007/s11273-005-0613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danielsen | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = The Asian tsunami: a protective role for coastal vegetation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = | page = 643 | doi=10.1126/science.1118387 | pmid=16254180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mangroves' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy.&lt;ref name="Massel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Massel | first1 = S.

The protective value of mangrove swamps is sometimes overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Andrew (26 December 2006) "False Hopes and Natural Disasters" ''New York Times'' editorial&lt;/ref&gt; so their effect on erosion can only be measured over long periods.&lt;ref name="Massel" /&gt; Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is limited to events such as storm surges and tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dahdouh-Guebas | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami? | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 443–447 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.008 | pmid=15964259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erosion often occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that wind through mangroves, while new stands of mangroves are appearing on the inner sides where sediment is [[Accretion (geology)|accruing]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7532">'''Marianne Horak''' (born 1944) is a Swiss-Australian entomologist who specialises in Australian [[Lepidoptera]], particularly the [[Phycitinae|phycitine]] and [[Tortricidae|tortricid]] moths.&lt;ref name="TheConversation"/&gt; She also did important research on the [[scribbly gum moth]]s,&lt;ref name="ALRE"/&gt; during which eleven new species of ''[[Ogmograptis]]'' were discovered.&lt;ref name="Horak-2012-Ogmograptis"/&gt;

Horak was born in [[Glarus]], [[Switzerland]], where she was inspired to study entomology from her childhood growing up in a valley in the Alps. She studied at the [[ETH Zurich|Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in Zürich, earning her M.Sc. in 1970 and Ph.D. in 1983. She did extensive field work in [[New Zealand]] (1967–69), [[New Guinea]] (1971–73), and [[Indonesia]] (1985) before settling permanently in Australia.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoch |first1=Hannelore |title=Taxonomy Profile: Marianne Horak |journal=Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift |date=26 May 2009 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=5–6 |doi=10.1002/mmnd.200900001 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mmnd.200900001 |accessdate=5 August 2018 |language=en |issn=1435-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the current [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Monographs of Australian Lepidoptera'',&lt;ref name="ALRE"/&gt; chairperson of the Australian Lepidoptera Research Endowment,&lt;ref name="ALRE"/&gt; and honorary research fellow in Lepidoptera systematics at the [[Australian National Insect Collection]] at [[CSIRO]],&lt;ref name="TheConversation"/&gt; where she works as Lepidoptera curator&lt;ref name="CSIRO-Curator"/&gt; and was head of Lepidoptera research until her retirement in 2010.&lt;ref name="ALRE"/&gt;

Horak has discovered several new species of Lepidoptera, including multiple species of ''[[Cadra]]'',&lt;ref name="Horak-1994-Cadra"/&gt; ''[[Heterochorista]]'',&lt;ref name="Horak-1984-Heterochorista"/&gt; and ''[[Ogmograptis]]''.&lt;ref name="Horak-2012-Ogmograptis"/&gt; She also is the [[Author citation (zoology)|taxon authority]] for several [[genera]], including ''[[Aglaogonia]]'', ''[[Atriscripta]]'' and ''[[Cnecidophora]]''.&lt;ref name="Horak-2006-Olethreutine"/&gt;

Horak was the first recipient of the [[J.O. Westwood Medal]] for excellence in insect taxonomy for "her outstanding monograph entitled ''The Olethreutine Moths of Australia (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)''".&lt;ref name="Royensoc"/&gt; The moth species ''[[Coleophora horakae]]'',&lt;ref name="Baldizzone-1996"/&gt; ''[[Hilarographa mariannae]]'',&lt;ref name="Razowski-2009"/&gt; and ''[[Myrtartona mariannae]]''&lt;ref name="Tarmann-2004"/&gt; are dedicated to her.

Horak is considered one of the worldwide leading experts on the systematics of [[Tortricidae]].&lt;ref name="TORTS-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson-2005"/&gt;

She was previously married to the Austrian mycologist [[Egon Horak]].&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">'''Martin Albrow''' (born 1937) is a British [[Sociology|sociologist]], noted for his works on [[globalization]], the theory of the global age and global [[civil society]]. He was appointed in 1963 as the first full-time sociologist at [[University of Reading|Reading University]], and subsequently worked at [[Cardiff University|University College Cardiff]], where he was Head of Department, and at [[Roehampton University]]. He has also held visiting or guest positions at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]], the [[Beijing Foreign Studies University]], and the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/_Albrow-Martin_.html|title=Martin Albrow - Books &amp; ideas|website=www.booksandideas.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globaldialogue.isa-sociology.org/the-end-of-the-global-age-an-interview-with-martin-albrow/|title=The End of the Global Age? An Interview with Martin Albrow|website=globaldialogue.isa-sociology.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albrow was President of the [[British Sociological Association]] from 1985 to 1987, and the editor-in-chief of its journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'' from 1981 to 1984. Additionally, he was the founding editor of the [[International Sociological Association]]'s journal, ''[[International Sociology]]''. He wrote ''The Global Age: State and Society beyond Modernity'', awarded the 1997 [[European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences|European Amalfi Prize]], which argued against the view that globalization was an inevitable one-way process, and that a new age had supplanted both the [[Modernity|modern]] and postmodern ages. He is a Fellow of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]].

Albrow lives in London with his wife, [[Sue Owen]].

His books include: ''Bureaucracy'', London, Pall Mall, 1970; ''Max Weber's Construction of Social Theory'', London, Macmillan, 1990; ''The Global Age: State and Society beyond Modernity'', Cambridge, Polity 1996; ''Do Organizations Have Feelings?'', London and New York, Routledge, 1997; ''Sociology: The Basics'', London and New York, Routledge, 1999; and ''Global Age Essays on Social and Cultural Change'', Frankfurt am Main, Klosterman, 2014. The English-language edition of his book ''China's Role in a Shared Human Future'' was published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/11/c_137101296.htm|title=Book detailing China's role in shared human future launched at London Book Fair |work= Xinhua |date= 2018-04-10  |access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;The book was launched at the [[London Book Fair]].

In contemporary [[education]], '''mathematics education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[mathematics]], along with the associated scholarly [[research]].

Researchers in mathematics education are primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice; however, [[List of mathematics education journals|mathematics education research]], known on the continent of Europe as the [[didactics]] or [[pedagogy]] of mathematics, has developed into an extensive field of study, with its own concepts, theories, methods, national and international organisations, conferences and literature. This article describes some of the history, influences and recent controversies.

==History==
Elementary mathematics was part of the [[Education|education system]] in most ancient civilisations, including [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], [[Vedic civilization|Vedic society]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. In most cases, a formal education was only available to [[male]] children with a sufficiently high status, wealth or [[caste]].
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration at the beginning of a 14th-century translation of Euclid's ''Elements''.]]

In [[Plato]]'s division of the [[liberal arts]] into the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and the [[quadrivium]], the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. This structure was continued in the structure of [[Medieval university|classical education]] that was developed in medieval Europe. Teaching of geometry was almost universally based on [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements''. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants and money-lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.

In the [[Renaissance]], the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce, and considered somewhat un-Christian.&lt;ref name="taboo"&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=486172977 |title=Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years |date=23 Jul 2016 |author=Gabrielle Emanuel |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of [[Natural Philosophy|Natural]], [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Moral philosophy|Moral]] Philosophy.  The first modern arithmetic curriculum (starting with addition, then subtraction, multiplication, and division) arose at [[reckoning school]]s in Italy in the 1300s.&lt;ref name="taboo2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/23/486172977/a-history-lesson-when-math-was-taboo Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spreading along trade routes, these methods were designed to be used in commerce. They contrasted with Platonic math taught at universities, which was more philosophical and concerned numbers as concepts rather than calculating methods.&lt;ref name="taboo2" /&gt;  They also contrasted with mathematical methods learned by [[artisan]] apprentices, which were specific to the tasks and tools at hand. For example, the division of a board into thirds can be accomplished with a piece of string, instead of measuring the length and using the arithmetic operation of division.&lt;ref name="taboo" /&gt;

The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by [[Robert Recorde]], beginning with ''The Grounde of Artes'' in 1540. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE.  These were mostly located in Mesopotamia where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division.  There are also artifacts demonstrating their own methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation.  After the Sumerians some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics come from Egypt in the form of the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].  The more famous [[Rhind Papyrus]] has been dated to approximately 1650 BCE but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll.  This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.

The social status of mathematical study was improving by the seventeenth century, with the [[University of Aberdeen]] creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in [[University of Oxford]] in 1619 and the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] being established by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1662. However, it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities.{{fact|date=April 2018}} [[Isaac Newton]], for example, received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1661.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to an enormous increase in [[urban area|urban]] populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money and carry out simple [[arithmetic]], became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new [[public education]] systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.

By the twentieth century, mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all [[developed country|developed countries]].

During the twentieth century, mathematics education was established as an independent field of research. Here are some of the main events in this development:

* In 1893, a Chair in mathematics education was created at the University of Göttingen, under the administration of [[Felix Klein]]
* The [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI) was founded in 1908, and Felix Klein became the first president of the organisation
* The professional [[periodical literature]] on mathematics education in the U.S.A. had generated more than 4000 articles after 1920, so in 1941 William L. Schaaf published a [[subject indexing|classified index]], sorting them into their various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Schaaf (1941) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b417103;view=1up;seq=11 A Bibliography of Mathematical Education], Forest Hills, N.Y. : Stevinus Press, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A renewed interest in mathematics education emerged in the 1960s, and the International Commission was revitalised
* In 1968, the [[Shell Centre for Mathematical Education]] was established in [[Nottingham]]
* The first [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]] (ICME) was held in [[Lyon]] in 1969. The second congress was in [[Exeter]] in 1972, and after that it has been held every four years

In the 20th century, the cultural impact of the "[[Information Age|electronic age]]" (McLuhan) was also taken up by [[educational theory]] and the teaching of mathematics. While previous approach focused on "working with specialized 'problems' in [[arithmetic]]", the emerging structural approach to knowledge had "small children meditating about [[number theory]] and '[[set theory|sets]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - C 05 - School in Sara, Guinea-Bissau - Boy in front of blackboard - 1974.tif|thumb|Boy doing sums, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]
At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:

* The teaching and learning of basic [[numeracy]] skills to all pupils
* The teaching of practical mathematics ([[arithmetic]], [[elementary algebra]], plane and solid [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]]) to most pupils, to equip them to follow a trade or craft
* The teaching of abstract mathematical concepts (such as [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and [[function (mathematics)|function]]) at an early age
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[Euclidean geometry]]) as an example of an [[axiomatic system]] and a model of [[deductive reasoning]]
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[calculus]]) as an example of the intellectual achievements of the [[modern world]]
* The teaching of advanced mathematics to those pupils who wish to follow a career in [[STEM fields|Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)]] fields.
* The teaching of [[heuristics]] and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems.

==Methods==

The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:

* '''Classical education''': the teaching of mathematics within the [[quadrivium]], part of the classical education curriculum of the [[Middle Ages]], which was typically based on [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] taught as a [[paradigm]] of [[deductive reasoning]].
[[File:Number bingo improves math skills LPB Laos.jpg|thumb|Games can motivate students to improve skills that are usually learned by rote. In "Number Bingo," players roll 3 dice, then perform basic mathematical operations on those numbers to get a new number, which they cover on the board trying to cover 4 squares in a row. This game was played at a "Discovery Day" organized by [[Big Brother Mouse]] in Laos.]]
* '''[[Computer-based math]]''' an approach based around use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation. Mobile applications have also been developed to help students learn mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/06/passing-mathematics-just-got-easier-for-students-with-this-new-platform-mathematica/|title=Passing Mathematics Just Got Easier For Students With This New Platform: Mathematica - Techzim|date=2018-06-16|work=Techzim|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/10/5-apps-help-all-students-math|title=5 Apps to Help All Students with Math|date=2017-10-13|work=Technology Solutions That Drive Education|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/photomath-app-solve-math-problems_n_6025948.html|title=This Free App Will Solve Math Problems For You|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2014-10-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conventional approach''': the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with [[arithmetic]] and is followed by [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[elementary algebra]] taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about [[elementary mathematics]], since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.
* '''[[Exercise (mathematics)|Exercise]]s''': the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding [[vulgar fraction]]s or solving [[quadratic equation]]s.
* '''Historical method''': teaching the [[history of mathematics|development of mathematics]] within an historical, social and cultural context. Provides more [[human interest]] than the conventional approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bharath |last=Sriraman |title=Crossroads in the History of Mathematics and Mathematics Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38a50_NT8oC |year=2012 |publisher=IAP |isbn=978-1-61735-704-6 |series=Monograph Series in Mathematics Education |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mathematics mastery|Mastery]]''': an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing
* '''[[New Math]]''': a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as [[set theory]], functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was [[Morris Kline]]'s 1973 book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add]]''. The New Math method was the topic of one of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: "...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer."
* '''[[Problem solving]]''': the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity and [[heuristic]] thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s to problems from international [[mathematics competitions]] such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. Problem solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students' prior understandings.
* '''[[Recreational mathematics]]''': Mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase enjoyment of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=David Singmaster |first=David |last=Singmaster |title=The Unreasonable Utility of Recreational Mathematics |date=7 September 1993 |work=For First European Congress of Mathematics, Paris, July, 1992 |url=http://anduin.eldar.org/%7Eproblemi/singmast/ecmutil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reform mathematics|Standards-based mathematics]]''': a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] which created the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]].
* '''Relational approach''': Uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120085344/http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helping them to apply mathematics to real world situations outside of the classroom.
* '''[[Rote learning]]''': the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is ''drill and kill''. In [[traditional education]], rote learning is used to teach [[multiplication table]]s, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.

==Content and age levels==
Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or [[honors class]].

Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion, though there are differences. In the [[Mathematics education in the United States|United States]] fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade, whereas in other countries they are usually taught later, since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel |year=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf |page=20 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K-12 topics include [[elementary arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and [[pre-algebra]].

In most of the U.S., [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and analysis ([[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]]) are taught as separate courses in different years of high school. Mathematics in most other countries (and in a few U.S. states) is integrated, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year. Students in many countries choose an option or pre-defined course of study rather than choosing courses ''à la carte'' as in the United States. Students in science-oriented curricula typically study [[differential calculus]] and [[trigonometry]] at age 16–17 and [[integral calculus]], [[complex numbers]], [[analytic geometry]], [[exponential function|exponential]] and [[logarithmic function]]s, and [[infinite series]] in their final year of secondary school. [[Probability]] and [[statistics]] may be taught in secondary education classes.

Science and engineering students in colleges and universities may be required to take [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[linear algebra]].  [[Applied mathematics]] is also used in specific majors; for example, [[civil engineers]] may be required to study [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233214/https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while "math for computer science" might include [[graph theory]], [[permutation]], probability, and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics students would continue to study potentially any area.

==Standards==
Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.

In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In [[England]], for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mathematics curriculum |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=UK Department of Education |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/secondary/b00199003/mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Scotland maintains its own educational system. In the USA, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers have published the national mathematics [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].

Ma (2000) summarised the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ma, X. |title=A longitudinal assessment of antecedent course work in mathematics and subsequent mathematical attainment |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=16–29 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/00220670009598739 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670009598739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has published the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]], which boosted the trend towards [[reform mathematics]]. In 2006, they released ''Curriculum Focal Points'', which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8.  However, these standards are enforced as American states and Canadian provinces choose. A US state's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of the state, and is not mandated by the Federal Government. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/myths-vs-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;"States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has state affiliates that have different education standards at the state level. For example, Missouri has the Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) which has its own pillars and standards of education listed on its website. The MCTM also offers membership opportunities to teachers and future teachers so they can stay up to date on the changes in math educational standards. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.moctm.org/Home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{Manual|section|date=April 2016}}
"Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist".&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws&gt;{{Citation | last = Hiebert | first = James | last2 = Grouws | first2 = Douglas | title = The Effects of Classroom Mathematics Teaching on Students' Learning | place = Reston VA | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | chapter = 9 | pages = 371–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education:

;Important results&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature in effective teaching is giving students "opportunity to learn". Teachers can set expectations, time, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and type of discussions that will influence students' opportunity to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.

;Conceptual understanding&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Institute of Education Sciences | contribution = Highlights From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Mathematics Teaching | year = 2003 | publisher = U.S. Department of Education | url = http://nces.ed.gov/timss}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.

:Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the end result is greater learning. This has been shown to be true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.
 
;Formative assessment&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=P. |last2=Wiliam |first2=Dylan |title=Assessment and Classroom Learning |journal=Assessment in Education |year=1998 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=7–74 |doi=10.1080/0969595980050102 |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/t4/learningandteaching/files/PGCTHE/BlackandWiliam1998.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Formative assessment]] is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers' content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.

;Homework&lt;ref name=ResearchClips&gt;[http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=8468 Research clips and briefs]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Homework which leads students to practice past lessons or prepare future lessons are more effective than those going over today's lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.

;Students with difficulties&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with [[Recall of facts|basic facts]], answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor [[number sense]] and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by [[formative assessment]] and encouraging students to think aloud.

;Algebraic reasoning&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:It is important for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the [[equals sign]] to mean "the answer is...."

===Methodology===
As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. [[Quantitative research]] includes studies that use [[inferential statistics]] to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods in order to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.

[[Qualitative research]], such as [[case studies]], [[action research]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[Jean Piaget|clinical interviews]], depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood ''why'' treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to "lethal mutations"&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt; of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X034005025 | last = Raudenbush | first = Stephen | title = Learning from Attempts to Improve Schooling: The Contribution of Methodological Diversity | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2005 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/5/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.

====Randomized trials====
There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas D. |last=Cook |title=Randomized Experiments in Educational Policy Research: A Critical Examination of the Reasons the Educational Evaluation Community has Offered for Not Doing Them |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–199 |year=2002 |doi=10.3102/01623737024003175 |url=http://epa.sagepub.com/content/24/3/175.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheaffer&gt;{{cite web |author=Working Group on Statistics in Mathematics Education Research |title=Using Statistics Effectively in Mathematics Education Research: A report from a series of workshops organized by the American Statistical Association with funding from the National Science Foundation |year=2007 |publisher=The American Statistical Association |url=http://www.amstat.org/research_grants/pdfs/SMERReport.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shadish, William R. |author2=Cook, Thomas D. |author3=Campbell, Donald T. |year=2002 |title=Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-395-61556-9 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See articles on [[No Child Left Behind|NCLB]], [[National Mathematics Advisory Panel]], [[Scientifically based research]] and [[What Works Clearinghouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods.&lt;ref name=Scheaffer/&gt; On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the United States, the [[Math_wars#National_Mathematics_Advisory_Panel|National Mathematics Advisory Panel]] (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to [[experimental unit]]s, such as classrooms or students.

==Mathematics educators==
The following are some of the people who have had a significant influence on the teaching of mathematics at various periods in history:

* [[Euclid]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 300 BC), Ancient Greek, author of ''[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]''
* [[Felix Klein]] (1849 - 1925), German mathematician who had substantial influence on math education in the early 20th Century, Inaugural president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction
* [[Andrei Petrovich Kiselyov]] (1852 – 1940) [[Russia]]n and [[USSR|Soviet]] mathematician. His textbooks on basic arithmetics, algebra and geometry were the standard for Russian classrooms since 1892 well into the 1960s, when Russian mathematics education got embroiled in the [[New Math]] reforms. In 2006 these texbooks were re-printed and became popular again.
* [[David Eugene Smith]] (1860 – 1944) American mathematician, educator, and editor, considered one of the founders of the field of mathematics education
* [[Tatyana Afanasyeva|Tatyana Alexeyevna Afanasyeva]] (1876–1964), [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/Russian mathematician who advocated the use of visual aids and examples for introductory courses in geometry for high school students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tatjana |last=Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa  |title=Exercises in Experimental Geometry |origyear=1931 |date=March 2003 |others=Hoeschsmann, Klaus (translator) |format=PDF |url=http://www.pims.math.ca/~hoek/teageo/TEA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Robert Lee Moore]] (1882–1974), American mathematician, originator of the [[Moore method]]
* [[George Pólya]] (1887–1985), Hungarian mathematician, author of ''[[How to Solve It]]''
* [[Georges Cuisenaire]] (1891–1976), [[Belgium|Belgian]] primary school teacher who invented [[Cuisenaire rods]]
* [[William A. Brownell|William Arthur Brownell]] (1895–1977), American educator who led the movement to make mathematics meaningful to children, often considered the beginning of modern mathematics education
* [[Hans Freudenthal]] (1905–1990), Dutch mathematician who had a profound impact on Dutch education and founded the [[Freudenthal Institute for Science and Mathematics Education]] in 1971
* [[Caleb Gattegno]] (1911-1988), Egyptian, Founder of the Association for Teaching Aids in Mathematics in Britain (1952) and founder of the journal ''Mathematics Teaching''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Caleb Gattegno|url=http://www.calebgattegno.org/caleb-gattegno-biography.html|publisher=The Association For The Science of Education|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Toru Kumon]] (1914–1995), Japanese, originator of the [[Kumon method]], based on mastery through exercise 
* Pierre [[van Hiele model|van Hiele]] and Dina van Hiele-Geldof, Dutch educators (1930s–1950s) who proposed a [[Van Hiele model|theory]] of how children learn geometry (1957), which eventually became very influential worldwide
* [[Robert Parris Moses]] (1935–), founder of the nationwide [[United States|US]] [[Algebra project]]
*[[Robert M. Gagné]] (1958–1980s), pioneer in mathematics education research.

==Mathematics teachers==
The following people all taught mathematics at some stage in their lives, although they are better known for other things:

* [[Lewis Carroll]], pen name of [[United Kingdom|British]] author Charles Dodgson, lectured in mathematics at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. As a mathematics educator, Dodgson defended the use of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] as a geometry textbook; ''[[Euclid and his Modern Rivals]]'' is a criticism of a reform movement in geometry education led by the [[Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=Attempts made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to reform the teaching of geometry |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=October 1910 |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=181–201 |jstor=2973645 | doi = 10.2307/2973645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Dalton]], British chemist and physicist, taught mathematics at schools and colleges in [[Manchester]], [[Oxford]] and [[York]]
* [[Tom Lehrer]], [[United States|American]] songwriter and satirist, taught mathematics at [[Harvard]], [[MIT]] and currently at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]
* [[Brian May]], rock guitarist and composer, worked briefly as a mathematics teacher before joining [[Queen (band)|Queen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freddie Mercury Interview |newspaper=Melody Maker |date=2 May 1981 |url=http://mr-mercury.co.uk/freddie_1981_interview.htm |access-date=20 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207053113/http://mr-mercury.co.uk/freddie_1981_interview.htm |archive-date=7 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], [[Austria]]n cartographer and disciple of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], taught mathematics at the [[University of Wittenberg]]
* [[Edmund Rich]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the 13th century, lectured on mathematics at the universities of [[Oxford]] and [[Paris]]
* [[Éamon de Valera]], a leader of Ireland's struggle for independence in the early 20th century and founder of the [[Fianna Fáil]] party, taught mathematics at schools and colleges in [[Dublin]]
* [[Archie Williams]], [[United States|American]] athlete and Olympic gold medalist, taught mathematics at high schools in [[California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5939">'''Ogden tables''' are a set of statistical tables and other information for use in [[court case]]s in the [[UK]].

Their purpose is to make it easier to calculate future losses in [[personal injury]] and [[fatal accident]] cases. The tables take into account [[life expectancy]] and provide a range of [[discount window|discount rates]] from -2.0% to 3.0% in steps of 0.5%. The discount rate is fixed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] under section 1 of the Damages Act 1996;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/48/pdfs/ukpga_19960048_en.pdf Damages Act 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; as of 27 February 2017, this rate is -0.75%.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Justice, [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-discount-rate-for-personal-injury-claims-announced New discount rate for personalinjury claims announced], 27 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent edition of the tables (7th Edition) makes changes to the discount rate range (previously 0.0% to 5.0% revised to -2.0% to 3.0%) to allow for a revision of the discount rate by the Lord Chancellor (currently under consideration as at 24 October 2011) and to provide for the implications of the case of ''Helmot v. Simon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/245859/ogden_tables_7th_edition.pdf | publisher=UK Government Actuary Department | title=Personal Injury and Fatal Accident Cases, 7th edition | page=6 | accessdate=November 30, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130201803/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/245859/ogden_tables_7th_edition.pdf | archivedate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Evidence Act 1995 permitted their use in the UK and they were first used by the [[House of Lords]] in ''Wells v. Wells'' in July 1999.

The full, and official, name of the tables is ''Actuarial Tables with explanatory notes for use in Personal Injury and Fatal Accident Cases'' but the unofficial name became common parlance following the Civil Evidence Act 1995, where this shorthand name was used as a subheading – Sir Michael Ogden QC having been the [[chairman]] of the Working Party for the first four editions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/309971/Ogden_Tables_5th_edition.pdf | publisher=UK Government Actuary Department | title=Personal Injury and Fatal Accident Cases, 5th edition | page=5 | accessdate=November 30, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130202533/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/309971/Ogden_Tables_5th_edition.pdf | archivedate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using the Ogden tables==

There are 28 tables of data in the Ogden Tables. Table 1 (Males) and Table 2 (Females) are for life expectancy and loss for life. Tables 3 to 14 are for loss of earnings up to various retirement ages. Tables 15 to 26 are for loss of pension from various retirement ages. Table 27 is for discounting to a period in the future and Table 28 is for a recurring loss over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/245859/ogden_tables_7th_edition.pdf | publisher=UK Government Actuary Department | title=Personal Injury and Fatal Accident Cases, 7th edition | page=ToC | accessdate=November 30, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130201803/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/245859/ogden_tables_7th_edition.pdf | archivedate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===How to calculate life expectancy===
To calculate life expectancy, you need to use Table 1 (for males) or Table 2 (for females) and use the data in the 0% column. So for a 45 year old female, using Table 2 you would look down the first column to find 45 and then across to the 0% column which gives a figure of 43.93. In cases where the age is not a whole number, i.e. female who is 45.75 years, then you use the figure for 45 years (43.93) and the figure for 46 years (42.87) and interpolate between the two (46-45.75) x 43.93 + (45.75-45) x 42.87 to give 43.14 years.

===How to calculate multiplier for lifetime loss===
If the claimant is to suffer a loss that will last their entire life, you need to use Table 1 (for males) or Table 2 (for females) and use the data in the 2.5% column. So for a 50-year-old male, using Table 1 you would look down to first column to find 50 and then across to the 2.5% column which gives a figure of 22.69.

===How to calculate value of a single loss in the future===
If the claimant needs to pay for something in the future, then the present value can be worked out using Table 27. Look up the period in the future in the first column and then across to the 2.5% column for the multiplier. For example, a purchase required in 10 years time would need to multiplier by 0.7812.

===How to calculate multiplier for loss over a period===
If the claimant has a recurring loss over a period of say 15 years, then use Table 28 looking up 15 in the first column and then across to the 2.5% column which gives a multiplier of 12.54. If the loss does not start until some time in the future, then you can combine Table 27 and Table 28 to give an overall multiplier. For example a loss over a period of 15 years that starts in 10 years time would have a Table 27 multiplier of 0.7812 and a Table 28 multiplier of 12.54 giving an overall multiplier of 9.80.

'''Przybylski's Star''' {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ᵻ|ˈ|b|ɪ|l|s|k|i|z}}, or '''HD 101065''', is a [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]] at roughly {{Convert|355|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Sun]] in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]].

==Scientific history==
In 1961, the Polish-Australian astronomer [[Antoni Przybylski]] discovered that this star had a peculiar spectrum that would not fit into the standard framework for [[stellar classification]].&lt;ref name=pasp75_445_349/&gt;&lt;ref name="DISC-20170630"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Powell |first1=C. S. |last2=Wright |first2=J. |title=The Strangest (and Second-Strangest) Star in the Galaxy |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2017/06/30/wright/ |date=30 June 2017 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |accessdate=10 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Przybylski's observations indicated unusually low amounts of [[iron]] and [[nickel]] in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], but higher amounts of unusual elements like [[strontium]], [[holmium]], [[niobium]], [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], [[caesium]], [[neodymium]], [[praseodymium]], [[thorium]], [[ytterbium]], and [[uranium]]. In fact, at first Przybylski doubted that iron was present in the spectrum at all. Modern work shows that the iron-group elements are somewhat below normal in abundance, but it is clear that the [[lanthanide]]s and other exotic elements are highly overabundant. Lanthanide elements are from 1000 to 10,000 times more abundant than in the Sun. As a result of these peculiar abundances this star belongs firmly in the [[Ap star]] class.

Przybylski's Star also contains many different short-lived [[actinide]] elements with [[actinium]], [[protactinium]], [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], and [[einsteinium]] being detected. Other radioactive elements discovered in this star include [[technetium]] and [[promethium]].&lt;ref name=gopka08&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gopka |first1=V. F. |last2=Yushchenko |first2=A. V. |last3=Yushchenko |first3=V. A. |last4=Panov |first4=I. V. |last5=Kim |first5=Ch. |title=Identification of absorption lines of short half-life actinides in the spectrum of Przybylski's star (HD 101065) |journal=Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies |date=15 May 2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=89–98 |doi=10.3103/S0884591308020049 |bibcode = 2008KPCB...24...89G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to neighboring stars, HD&amp;nbsp;101065 has a high [[peculiar velocity]] of {{nowrap|23.8 ± 1.9 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=mnras410_1_190/&gt;

==Odd theories==
Because of the odd properties of this star, there are numerous theories about why the oddities occur. The most interesting of them is that the star contains some long-lived nuclides from the [[island of stability]] (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;298&lt;/sup&gt;[[flerovium|Fl]], &lt;sup&gt;304&lt;/sup&gt;[[unbinilium|120]], or &lt;sup&gt;310&lt;/sup&gt;126) and that the observed short-lived actinides are the daughters of these progenitors, occurring in [[secular equilibrium]] with their parents.&lt;ref name=Isotope1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Isotope2/&gt;

==Properties==
HD 101065 is the prototype star of the [[rapidly oscillating Ap star]] (roAP) variable star class. In 1978, it was discovered to pulsate [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometrically]] with a period of 12.15 min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978IBVS.1436....1K |title= 12.15 Minute Light Variations in Przybylski's Star, HD 101065 |journal= Information Bulletin on Variable Stars |volume= 1436 |pages= 1 |last1= Kurtz |first1= D. W. |year= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential companion had also been detected, a 14th magnitude star (in infrared) 8 arc seconds away.  This would be a separation of nearly 1,000 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201118538 |arxiv = 1208.0480 |bibcode = 2012A&amp;A...545A..38S |title = Multiplicity of rapidly oscillating Ap stars |journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume = 545 |pages = A38 |year = 2012 |last1 = Schöller |first1 = M. |last2 = Correia |first2 = S. |last3 = Hubrig |first3 = S. |last4 = Kurtz |first4 = D. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Gaia Data Release 2]] suggests that this star lies at a distance of {{val|890|90}} light-years, more than twice the distance of Przybylski's Star.&lt;ref name=GaiaDR2comp/&gt;

&lt;!--Do not float the TOC--&gt;
[[Science fiction]] authors have designed imaginary [[spacesuit]]s for their characters almost since the beginning of [[fiction]] set in [[space]].

Often, [[comic]] book creators seem unaware of the effects of internal [[pressure]] which tends to inflate a spacesuit in [[vacuum]], and draw their imaginary spacesuits as hanging in folds like a [[boilersuit]]; this can often be seen in the [[Dan Dare]] stories, where the artist often drew from actual or photographed posed actors. Many space story writers merely mention a "spacesuit" without considering or describing design details, in the same way as they mention a [[raygun]] or a [[spacecraft|spaceship]] without considering how its mechanism would work.{{or|date=December 2017}}

The [[rebreather|breathing apparatus]] which is part of the [[Primary Life Support System]] of real [[space suit]]s is always a [[rebreather]] type system. However, in illustrations in fiction such as [[comic]]s, a spacesuit's life support system is often largely composed of two big backpack cylinders, as if it was [[scuba set#Open circuit scuba sets|open circuit]]; at least one fictional scenario{{which|date=December 2017}} has [[liquid breathing]] spacesuits.{{or|date=December 2017}}

==Early concepts==

===Edison's Conquest of Mars===
[[File:Aa air tight suit.gif|thumbnail|120px|left|The spacesuit described in ''Edison's Conquest of Mars'']]

From ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898):

{{quotation|...since it was probable that necessity would arise for occasionally quitting the interior of the electrical ships, Mr. [[Thomas A. Edison|Edison]] had provided for this emergency by inventing an air-tight dress constructed somewhat after the manner of a [[Standard diving dress|diver's suit]], but of much lighter material. Each ship was provided with several of these suits, by wearing which one could venture outside the car [spaceship] even when it was beyond the [[atmosphere]] of the earth...Provision had been made to meet the terrific cold which we knew would be encountered the moment we had passed beyond the atmosphere—that awful absolute zero which men had measured by anticipation, but never yet experienced—by a simple system of producing within the air-tight suits a temperature sufficiently elevated to counteract the effects of the frigidity without. By means of long, flexible tubes, air could be continually supplied to the wearers of the suits, and by an ingenious contrivance a store of compressed air sufficient to last for several hours was provided for each suit, so that in case of necessity the wearer could throw off the tubes connecting him with the air tanks in the car...Inside the headpiece of each of the electrical suits was the mouthpiece of a telephone. This was connected with a wire which, when not in use, could be conveniently coiled upon the arm of the wearer. Near the ears, similarly connected with wires, were telephonic receivers...When two persons wearing the air-tight dresses wished to converse with one another it was only necessary for them to connect themselves by the wires, and conversation could then be easily carried on.}}

This illustration of the suit appears to be skintight (note the wrinkles), and to have a soft hood with a built-in [[fullface mask]], rather than a hard helmet, although according to the story the suits had helmets.

This common early idea for a spacesuit would have not worked in reality for several reasons:
*The suits have no [[Space suit#Theories of spacesuit design|constant volume joints]] to prevent the suits from ballooning under their interior pressure.
*The suits have no [[glove]]s.
*The rubberized material of a diving suit would have quickly become brittle due to loss of volatiles in space vacuum; and also due to cold making the rubber brittle when out of sunlight, if they radiate heat away faster than the spaceman's body heat warms them.

Skintight spacesuits ([[skinsuit]]s) appear in the original [[Buck Rogers]] [[comics]] published from 1928 on. This [[comic]] was so popular that expressions such as "Buck Rogers outfit" for real protective suits that look somewhat like spacesuits entered common usage.

With the rise of the Science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s in the 1920s many depictions of imaginary spacesuits were created from scratch by artists such as [[Frank R. Paul]], often appearing on the covers of the magazines. Very often these artists' creations were absurd, with such errors as a helmet whose neck hole is too narrow for the head to get through.

Often fictional spacesuits are drawn with two large backpack cylinders as their only life-support gear, as if the exhaled gas is vented to space as in an ordinary [[open-circuit scuba|open-circuit]] [[scuba set]].

The Lensman series by E.E. "Doc" Smith features armored spacesuits used in hand-to-hand combat.  Some especially heavily armored spacesuits in the series use motors to help the wearer move about.

==After World War II==
Following [[World War II]], fictional spacesuits were influenced both by the real life [[pressure suit]]s and [[G-suits]] which had seen use during the war for high-altitude aviation and also by the speculative articles on space travel which were published in magazines like the [[Saturday Evening Post]] and [[Collier's Weekly]] by such space pioneers as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Willy Ley]] and which featured carefully considered spacesuit designs.

===In films===
Some early space travel fiction films showed characters in spacesuits much more often than [[Star Trek]] and afterwards.

===The First Men in the Moon===
[[File:Aa 26a claiming the moon.jpg|thumb|px150|''The First Men in the Moon'': the 1899 model space suits.]]
In [[H.G. Wells]]'s original novel, ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', published in 1901, the Moon has a breathable atmosphere during its two-week-long day and spacesuits are not needed; the spacecraft has an airtight hatch, but no airlock.

[[File:Aa 09a nasasuit flagfound.jpg|thumb|px150|''The First Men in the Moon'': the 1964 model space suits.]]
In [[First Men in the Moon|the film version]], made in 1964, the Moon has no atmosphere and no surface vegetation. Two types of spacesuits are featured.
* During the events of the story which take place in the 1890s, [[standard diving dress]]es, each fitted with a 1960s type aqualung cylinder worn on the back, are used as spacesuits. No provision is made to prevent the suits from ballooning in the vacuum, or to protect the hands from the vacuum.
* The film depicts the 1960s astronaut [[spacesuit]]s as close copies of a British high-altitude pressure suit of the sort intended to be used aboard the TSR-1 and fitted with a 1960s-type [[Aqua-lung|aqualung]] cylinder instead of the [[NASA]]-type [[life support]] backpack which came into common usage a few years after the movie was made.

===Dan Dare===
In the [[Dan Dare]] comic series, which started in April 1950 in the "[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]" comic, the standard Spacefleet spacesuit had no backpack, had a corselet as per [[Standard Diving Dress]], and its life-support system was stated to be between the layers of a double-walled helmet.[http://www.fpigraphics.co.uk/blogger/Dan%20DAre%20spacesuit.jpg] The spacesuits used in the Dan Dare scenario "[[Operation Saturn (Dan Dare)|Operation Saturn]]" by the villain Blasco are a different design and have small life-support backpacks. The Dan Dare stories also show various alien spacesuits.

===Have Space Suit, Will Travel===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}
[[File:Aa Heinlein spacesuit.gif|thumb|right|150px|1977 edition cover&lt;ref&gt;1977, [[Ballantine Books]], paperback, {{ISBN|0-345-26071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[:File:Have Space suit.jpg]] for another cover image)]]
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Have Space suit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|First edition cover of ''Have Space Suit — Will Travel'']] --&gt;
Author [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'' (1958) drew both on these contemporary articles and on his experience designing pressure suits during World War II and featured a detailed description of a very realistic space suit with constant volume joints and fixed helmet and shoulder yoke, which was entered through a frontal [[gasket]]ed [[zipper]] (similar to that in a [[drysuit]]).

Front cover illustrations (one shown here, one linked to in its caption) for the novel obviously inspired by contemporary diving apparatus show its life-support backpack as a correctly drawn old-type [[Diving cylinder#Open-circuit|open-circuit]] two-cylinder [[Aqua-lung|aqualung]] as used for [[scuba diving]] with manifold and large round [[diving regulator|regulator]] and [[A-clamp]]. The artist avoided the error found in most comic-strip drawings of old-type aqualungs, of drawing each [[Breathing tube (breathing apparatus)|breathing tube]] coming directly from a cylinder top and no regulator. But to make this type of aqualung (as shown here) work in space, its [[diving regulator|regulator]]'s existing perforated "wet-side" cover would have to be replaced by a sealed cover with a spring-loaded exit valve to keep a breathable pressure on the "wet" side of the regulator diaphragm. And the whole breathing system would have to be checked for leaks which would be harmless in scuba diving but would blow in space vacuum.
*On the first image the [[Breathing tube (breathing apparatus)|breathing tubes]] run to a control panel on his chest, and the regulator can be seen. The image shows two spacesuits, whose helmets differ. One has a worklight on top; the other has two worklights, one on each side, and on top what is intended to represent a radio spike antenna and [[microwave horn]] antenna (two different antennas are also shown in a second book illustration, though the "microwave horn" antenna is incorrectly drawn attached by its wide end like an animal horn, instead of the correct [[horn (disambiguation)|musical-horn]]-like shape of a microwave horn antenna).
*On the second image the breathing tubes run to each side of the "chin" of his helmet, and the regulator is hidden behind his head.

The spacesuits in these drawings differ much, but all depict the helmet base as being wide enough for the wearer to get it on over his head, showing that their artists had paid little attention to the writer's detailed descriptions.
[[File:Aqualung old type.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Diver with old-type aqualung]]

In a description of the spacesuit Heinlein appears to be confused about the various effects of [[oxygen toxicity]] and [[Decompression sickness|bends]] and [[nitrogen narcosis]].&lt;ref&gt;page 27 of the February 2005 edition ({{ISBN|1-4165-0549-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinlein's description of pressure regulation came very close to the experience of astronauts in the Apollo program. His characters preferred to keep the pressure of their suits just high enough for survival, but not high enough to make it difficult to move around, much like the selected design pressure range of the real Apollo [[A7L]] suits.

The life support system of the suits in ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'' was very similar to the backup Oxygen Purge System on the real Apollo [[Primary Life Support System]], the only major difference being that the Apollo suits had a largely automatic pressure regulator, and Heinlein's suit had manual pressure regulation.

One major component of modern pressure suit [[Primary Life Support System]] backpacks which he missed was the [[lithium hydroxide]] canister which absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air in the suit: see [[rebreather]]. Without this, his suit's breathing apparatus would have to be [[open-circuit scuba|open circuit]] and limited to approximately two hours on a filling of [[oxygen]] or [[air]], with the time varying according to exertion and cylinder size and his body size.

Another was the cooling system. He correctly recognised that overheating would be a major problem for the wearer of the suit. His cooling system was the same as the Apollo [[oxygen purge system]]: waste oxygen by letting it flow at a high rate and use it to dump heat. In practice, real suits used a water supply feeding a [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimator]] to provide cooling.

In ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' the suits are strongly influenced by experience in the space program. He correctly describes a technique for helping an injured man in a pressure suit by decompressing the suit for less than a minute. Earlier books such as ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'' described horrible injuries for people decompressed for short times.

In ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'' Heinlein has people going onto the moon surface for about half a day in daylight and suffering from radiation exposure. In practice, overheating was the biggest risk of lunar surface operations, and cooling systems were easy to build.

===Perry Rhodan===
The front cover of the first issue of the German pulp science fiction series [[Perry Rhodan]], published in 1961, [[:File:Perry Rhodan issue1.jpg|shows a typical science-fiction open-circuit]] design with two large backpack cylinders instead of a modern life-support pack.

===Armored space suits===
*[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' (1959) famously featured armored power-assisted spacesuit-like battlesuits used in combat.  The suits are arguably one of the first examples of [[powered armor]] to be written of in American literature.  The Japanese ''[[anime]]'' [[OVA]] film ''[[Starship Troopers (OVA)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1988) based on the novel also used powered armor suits inspired by Heinlein's example, but they appeared differently and incorporated built-in weaponry.  However, the [[Starship Troopers (film)|1997 film]]'s interpretation did not use powered armor, much to the consternation of the book's fans.
*Heroine of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Metroid]]'' series of video games (1986–Present), [[Samus Aran]], is another example of a character in fiction utilizing an armored space suit. Known as the Power Suit, Samus' original suit it a modular powered armor developed by the bird-like Chozo race who raised Samus after her parents where killed by Space Pirates. Its capabilities are enhanced by upgrades such as the Varia and Gravity Suit. It also allows Samus to transform into a sphere called the Morph Ball. In ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'', after her original Power Suit is lost when her Gunship is shot down following her defeat of Mother Brain, it is replaced by a more powerful and ancient Power Suit she obtains from a Chozo Temple, which she uses throughout the ''Metroid'', series up until ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'', where it is replaced by the Fusion Suit, a suit created for Samus after she and the organic components of her Power Suit are infected by X-Parasites. Though man-made, the Fusion Suit retains the module nature of Samus' Chozo Power Suit.

===Self-sealing and limb-constriction suits===

*In [[Ray Bradbury]]'s short story ''Kaleidoscope'' (1949), used in '''[[The Illustrated Man]]''' (1951) occurs one of the first uses of self-sealing spacesuits which automatically [[tourniquet]] limbs to keep the wearer alive and pressurized, in cases of holes or amputations (in the story, occurring as a result of [[meteoroid]]s in space).
*A self-repair style of suit is briefly mentioned in ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' (1968) by John Brunner. Spacesuits used by lunar explorers feature 'decompression sphincters' that clamp down and seal off any areas of a spacesuit that suffer damage. Repair patches or returning to the base must be achieved quickly before anhydrous gangrene destroys the area exposed to vacuum.
*[[Joe Haldeman]]'s novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' (1974) featured armored vacuum combat suits which were similar in principle but more advanced in design. Because the novel takes place over the timespan of several hundred years, the evolution of the battle suits can be observed and commented on by the lead character throughout with new features introduced — such as emergency hydraulic-powered joints which sever the limb of a soldier and inject [[anesthetics]] and [[blood plasma]] if enough damage is inflicted and a risk of decompression is apparent.

==After first real space flights==
After the establishment of [[NASA]], and the first space missions, fictional spacesuits tended to follow real spacesuit design, including such features as a large rectangular backpack to hold life support components, except in low-budget science fiction movies and comics which were still inspired more by imagination than by reality.

===''2001: A Space Odyssey''===

This film by [[Stanley Kubrick]] was groundbreaking for its time and for decades later.  At the debut of [[2001: A Space Odyssey]], (1968) cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov]] and astronaut [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] had made space walks starting in 1965, followed by a handful of other astronauts, while the first lunar landing was still over a year in the future.  Thus space suits had been tested but not on the lunar surface.  In the film, space suits play notable roles several times, including in the lunar EVA when the monolith is inspected, and during different events in the journey aboard the [[Discovery One]].  The design of the Space Odyssey helmets with a down-facing face plate and jutting top plate was (is) most strikingly different from both the actual 1960's designs including the Apollo lunar suit, and from the advancements in design seen in the decades leading to the real 2001.  Kubrick and co-author [[Arthur C. Clark]] forecast rather optimistically that by 2001 there would be ongoing exploration and settlement of the moon and an advanced space construction program, and designs based on their speculations for 30 years later were bold but are still scientifically plausible.

===''Dune'' film===
During the production of the spacesuits and [[stillsuit]]s for the film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', the [[Theatrical property|prop]] and [[costume]] designers stated a need to avoid "the standard outer-space stuff ... that sort of NASA look".&lt;ref&gt;pp 69 &amp; 71, ''The Making of Dune'', by [[Ed Naha]], publ. [[R.H.Allen]] 1984, {{ISBN|0-426-19641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerry Anderson's ''UFO'' series===
[[File:2aliens on desert planet.jpg|thumbnail|[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] image of alien spacesuits shown in the television series ''UFO''.]]
The [[Gerry Anderson]]'s ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' series of the late 1960s/early 1970s features two types of spacesuit:
* Alien spacesuits, filled with a [[Liquid breathing|breathable liquid]] to resist acceleration stresses on the occupant.
* [[UFO (TV series)#SHADO|SHADO]], Dalotek Corporation and [[Soviet space program|Sovatex Corporation]] issue spacesuits.

The design of the alien spacesuits was revised during filming; in some episodes they are partly covered with bright metallic [[chainmail]], and in some they are as per the image shown. The studio which made the series seems to have had only two alien spacesuit costumes. In the episode "Ordeal" where two aliens carry a human (Foster) who is in an alien spacesuit, one of the aliens has to be out of shot, or else 3 alien spacesuits would have been needed. The helmet splits into front and back halves to get it on over his head.

====''[[Space: 1999]]''====
In this other Anderson's series (a spin-off of ''UFO''), spacesuits are orange and yellow with a white mechanical object on the torso of any astronaut and with an openable personalised helmet; often the episodes feature a recurring blooper: the astronaut's helmet is accidentally open.

===''Gundam''===
Spacesuits are commonly used in the [[Gundam]] [[anime]] [[metaseries]], but are often renamed to avoid confusion with space-use [[Mobile weapons#Mobile suits|mobile suits]]. In the [[Universal Century]] timeline, spacesuits are called "normal suits"; the [[After Colony]] timeline calls them "astrosuit". Two types of spacesuit are frequently seen - as well as the more traditional bulky style, mobile suit pilots wear a thinner lighter suit, better designed for operating a mobile suit's controls. Gundam spacesuits often have a pouch full of adhesive strips, used to temporarily seal tears in the suit (as demonstrated in [[Mobile Suit Gundam]]) or cracks in the helmet (as demonstrated in [[Char's Counterattack]]).

===''Perry Rhodan''===
The German pulp science fiction series ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' features a type of spacesuit known as a SERUN, for Semi-Reconstituent Recycling Unit. This suit contains advanced recycling systems that can provide the necessary oxygen, water, and food to keep the inhabitant alive for weeks. It also contains a sophisticated computerized medical treatment system, [[antigrav]] units for propulsion, and a generator for a defense screen.

===''Planet 51''===
{{main|Earth in Planet 51}}

=== ''Gravity'' ===
The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', by [[Alfonso Cuarón]] with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, was both appreciated and criticized for its use of space suits.  Besides objections to the unrestricted look of extravehicular activities was the lack of protective undergarments, displayed (not) by Bullock when she removed her suit—lacking critical items such as a [[liquid cooling and ventilation garment]] or socks.&lt;ref name='An Astronaut Fact-checks "Gravity"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Gwynne|title=An Astronaut Fact-checks "Gravity"|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/astronaut-fact-checks-gravity.html|website=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC.|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=7 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|title=Learn About Spacesuits|website=NASA: Spacesuits and Spacewalks|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=13 Nov 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Interstellar''===

In the 2014 film ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', [[NASA]] uses futuristic spacesuits during the ''Lazarus'' missions and during Cooper and Brand's missions.  Cooper also uses a black spacesuit at the film's end.

===''Scorpion''===
In the episode "[[List of Scorpion episodes#Season 2 (2015-2016)|The Old College Try]]", to survive in subzero temperatures near a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]], [[Walter O'Brien (character)|Walter]] wears an [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|A7L]] spacesuit from the [[Apollo program]].

Sylvester and Happy wears vintage spacesuits, too, but they are probably fictional (like the two characters themselves).

===''The Martian''===
In [[Andy Weir]]'s 2011 novel ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'', astronauts from the Ares missions use white spacesuits to walk on Mars' surface. The suits in the book are described as similar to the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]] suit.

====Movie adaptation====
The [[The Martian (film)|2015 adaptation of the novel]], directed by [[Ridley Scott]], features these suits:
;Ares III spacesuit
Used by Watney during his period on Mars, this is a small orange and grey spacesuit, equipped with a [[GoPro]]-like ''suitcam'', a vocal device which signals about malfunctions and a [[backpack]].
Watney crashes his helmet during the explosion of the Hab, but it is replaced by another Ares III helmet (during the rest of the period of Mars) and an Ares IV helmet (during the spaceflight).
;''Hermes''/Ares IV spacesuit
Used by the ''Hermes'' crew and projected also for the Ares IV one, is a specialized spacesuit used during the Mars-Earth and Earth-Mars spaceflights on NASA's ''Hermes'' spacecraft.
Commander Melissa Lewis also uses a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU) during the film's end.
;Ares V spacesuit

Used by Rick Martinez and the other Ares V astronauts during the end credits of the film, is another suit, seen only during the launch of the Ares V mission.

=== Skintight spacesuits ===

The potential for greater mobility and simpler operation with a skintight spacesuit, generally referred to as a [[space activity suit]] or mechanical counterpressure suit, make this type of space suit an attractive choice for fiction, where flexibility of use can be a boon to plot development.
 
Some space story writers whose work mentions flexible skin-tight spacesuits include:
 
* The spacesuits in early [[Buck Rogers]] [[comic]]s seem to be skintight.
* [[Jerry Pournelle]], who has been extensively involved in analysis and design of space technology systems.  Pournelle envisions a layered design where the inner flexible suit can be overlain with various kinds of thermal protection or armor, for protection against meteoroids or space battle damage, in the same way a [[flak jacket]] protects the occupants of a warplane.  Skintight spacesuits first appeared in recent science fiction in Pournelle's [[novel]] ''[[Exiles To Glory]]'' in 1977.
* [[A. Bertram Chandler]].
* [[Grant Callin]]'s ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'' and ''[[A Lion on Tharthee]]'' feature 'micropore suits' which use minute gas bubbles in foam rather than mechanical tension to provide counterpressure in vacuum.
* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s Manifold series, notably ''[[Manifold: Time]]'', covers the technical aspects of using a skintight suit for short EVAs, including the need to don the suit without creasing to prevent embolisms.
* In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'', skintights are the preferred type of spacesuit used by [[Belter (Niven)|belter]]s in the 22nd and 23rd century.  They often decorated them with elaborate (and expensive) torso paintings as a form of [[heraldry]].  Pournelle's design in particular is featured in some of Niven's later [[Ringworld]] novels.
* [[Victor Koman]] in ''[[Kings of the High Frontier]]''.
* [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] used suits called "Walkers" that work on a similar principle for Martian surface exploration in the [[Mars Trilogy]] novels.
* [[Roger Leloup]] in the adventures of [[Yoko Tsuno]]
* In [[Spider Robinson|Spider]] &amp; [[Jeanne Robinson]]'s novel ''[[Stardance]]'' (1979) they played a significant role.
* [[Skinsuit]]s feature rather prominently in the [[Honorverse]] books by [[David Weber]].
* In [[Electronic Arts|EA Games]]'s ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series, engineers and miners use an airtight suit called a RIG when working in the [[vacuum]] of space or an otherwise unsafe environment.
* In [[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Venus Belt]]'', the protagonist describes in some detail a skin-tight ''Smartsuit'' which is capable of furnishing not only life support in various types of hostile environments, but also limited medical treatment for the wearer.  The suit also functions as a powerful [[wearable computer]], with the circuitry, displays, and controls integrated into the fabric of the suit.  In the novel, the suit is, as a matter of tradition, included in the price of a space-liner ticket to [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].  The character notes that a properly fitted Smartsuit leaves the wearer feeling "completely naked...a testament to the makers' art."  Most spacefarers live in their Smartsuits for indefinite periods, as the suit can handle waste management and hygiene for the wearer.
* In [[Elecia White]]'s novel ''[[Pony Up (novel)|Pony Up]]'', the protagonist utilized a next-generation NASA "skinsuit" during a protracted space walk.
* [[Steven Gould]], in his 2013 novel ''[[Exo (novel)|Exo]]'', the fourth in his ''[[Jumper (novel)|Jumper]]'' series, centered the ambitions of his young protagonist, Cent, on the use of a mechanical counterpressure suit to allow her to teleport into space.

===Symbionts===
Spider and Jeanne Robinson's novel ''[[Starseed (novel)|Starseed]]'' (the second volume of their [[Stardance]] trilogy) and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s [[Eight Worlds#Symbiotic spacesuits|Eight Worlds]] universe both feature [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[symbiont]]s which act as living space suits, supplying their wearer with oxygen and recycling waste gases and deriving their energy from [[solar power]]. [[James Blish]]'s novella ''How Beautiful With Banners'' features a spacesuit formed from the protein coat of a genetically modified virus. The suit is able to be controlled by small electrical impulses, supplied by a control box mounted on the wearer's belt.

=== Space fiction without prominent use of spacesuits ===

In some space fiction, space suits are largely absent.  Spacesuits were seen only once in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' TV series (1966–1969), in the episode "[[The Tholian Web]]", mostly due to television budget constraints.  They play a more significant part in several of the movies: ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979), ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' (1982), ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996), and several episodes of the TV series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (1995–2001).  Space suits are far more frequently used in the [[prequel]] series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (2001–2005), though they also doubled as environmental-hazard suits.
 
Spacesuits appear in all the original [[Star Wars]] movies, but only used by pilots of [[Military spacecraft in fiction|fighter]]-type [[spacecraft]].  Spacesuits used outside spacecraft occur in some Star Wars [[novel]]s and [[comic]]s.

===Force fields instead of spacesuits===
Some fiction scenarios, instead of spacesuits, have a personal force field which keeps a bubble of breathable atmosphere around the user. Examples are:
* The [[Flickinger field]] in [[Jack McDevitt]]'s fiction: A Flickinger field projects just above the user's clothing except for an extended bubble in front of the face for breathability. They are primarily invisible but can be seen as a faint aura in the right light. It occurs in the novels ''The Engines of God'', ''Deepsix'', ''Chindi'', ''Omega'', ''Odyssey'', and "Starhawk" and the short story "Oculus" (2002).
* [[John Varley (author)|John Varley's]] novels ''[[The Ophiuchi Hotline]]'', ''[[Steel Beach]]'' and ''[[The Golden Globe]]'' feature 'null-field' suits whose mechanism replaces one of the user's [[lung]]s and in use generates a reflective force-field around the wearer.
* Life support belts appear in several ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' episodes, including "[[Beyond the Farthest Star (Star Trek: The Animated Series)|Beyond the Farthest Star]]" and "[[The Slaver Weapon]]".
* The bubble around the boys' spacecraft in ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]''.
* The Vell-os in ''[[Escape Velocity Nova]]'' use [[telekinesis]] to hold bubbles of pressurised air around them to traverse space.
* Pee-wee's "new spring suit" in Heinlein's ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'' (1958).

}}'''Stephen John Blundell''' (born 1967)&lt;ref name=LibraryOfCongress/&gt; is a professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was previously head of [[Condensed Matter Physics]] at Oxford, and is also a professorial [[fellow]] of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]]. His research is concerned with using [[muon]]-spin rotation and [[magnetoresistance]] techniques to study a range of organic and inorganic materials, particularly those showing interesting magnetic, superconducting, or dynamical properties.&lt;ref name=scopus/&gt;

==Education==
Blundell completed both his undergraduate and graduate studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], attending [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] for his undergraduate degree in [[physics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and doing his [[PhD]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=bphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=http://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44CAM_ALMA21431180850003606&amp;context=L&amp;vid=44CAM_PROD&amp;search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&amp;tab=cam_lib_coll&amp;lang=en_US|doi=|title=Spin-dependent transport in artificial structures|first= Stephen John|last=Blundell|date=1993|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.309331}}|website=lib.cam.ac.uk|oclc=557401624|hdl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
He was subsequently offered a [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC) [[research fellow]]ship which involved a move to the [[Clarendon Laboratory]] at Oxford; he was later awarded a junior research fellowship at [[Merton College, Oxford]], where he began research in organic magnets and superconductors using muon-spin rotation. In 1997 he was appointed to a [[Lecturer|university lectureship]] in the Oxford Physics Department and a tutorial fellowship at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], and was subsequently promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]].{{when|date=February 2018}} On 28 July 2004, at the age of 35, he was appointed professor of physics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Blundell is also involved in teaching for the Honour School of Physics – including running two undergraduate lecture courses on thermal and statistical physics, and tutoring second-, third- and fourth-year undergraduates.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} He has also authored two textbooks, the first being ''Magnetism in Condensed Matter'' {{ISBN missing}}, which covers the quantum mechanical nature of magnetism. Most recently he has co-authored, with his wife and colleague, astrophycist [[Katherine Blundell]] of [[St John's College, Oxford]], a textbook entitled ''Concepts in Thermal Physics''.&lt;ref name=citp/&gt; It provides an introduction to the topics of thermal physics and statistical mechanics covered in a typical undergraduate course in physics. Additionally, he has authored the ''Very Short Introduction to Superconductivity'',&lt;ref&gt;Very Short Introduction to Superconductivity {{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Very Short Introductions]] series published by [[Oxford University Press]].

He has authored or co-authored over 300 articles&lt;ref name=scopus&gt;{{Scopus id}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging right across the world of [[solid-state physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sjb/publications.html|website=users.ox.ac.uk|title=Stephen Blundell Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honours===
He was a joint winner of the [[Daiwa Adrian Prize]] in 1999 for his work on organic magnets.&lt;ref name=citp&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concepts in thermal physics|last=Blundell|first=Stephen J.|last2=Blundell|first2=Katherine M.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=9780199562107|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=607907330|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199562091.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Blundell lives in Oxford with his wife, Professor [[Katherine Blundell]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4017">In [[mathematics]], a [[Newtonian series]], named after [[Isaac Newton]], is a sum over a [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(s) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n {s\choose n} a_n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-s)_n}{n!} a_n&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;{s \choose n}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[binomial coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;(s)_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rising factorial]].  Newtonian series often appear in relations of the form seen in [[umbral calculus]].

==List==

The generalized [[binomial theorem]] gives

:&lt;math&gt; (1+z)^s = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}{s \choose n}z^n = 1+{s \choose 1}z+{s \choose 2}z^2+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

A proof for this identity can be obtained by showing that it satisfies the differential equation

: &lt;math&gt; (1+z) \frac{d(1+z)^s}{dz} = s (1+z)^s.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[digamma function]]: 

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(s+1)=-\gamma-\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n} {s \choose n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]] are given by the finite sum

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right\}
=\frac{1}{k!}\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}{k \choose j} j^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is a special case of the ''k''th [[forward difference]] of the [[monomial]] ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; evaluated at&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta^k x^n = \sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}{k \choose j} (x+j)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

A related identity forms the basis of the [[Nörlund–Rice integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}\frac {(-1)^k}{s-k} = 
\frac{n!}{s(s-1)(s-2)\cdots(s-n)} = 
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(s-n)}{\Gamma(s+1)}= 
B(n+1,s-n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]] and &lt;math&gt;B(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Beta function]].

The [[trigonometric function]]s have [[umbral calculus|umbral]] identities:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n {s \choose 2n} = 2^{s/2} \cos \frac{\pi s}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n {s \choose 2n+1} = 2^{s/2} \sin \frac{\pi s}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

The umbral nature of these identities is a bit more clear by writing them in terms of the [[falling factorial]] &lt;math&gt;(s)_n&lt;/math&gt;. The first few terms of the sin series are

:&lt;math&gt;s - \frac{(s)_3}{3!} +  \frac{(s)_5}{5!} - \frac{(s)_7}{7!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

which can be recognized as resembling the [[Taylor series]] for sin&amp;nbsp;''x'', with (''s'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; standing in the place of&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[analytic number theory]] it is of interest to sum
:&lt;math&gt;\!\sum_{k=0}B_k z^k,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B'' are the [[Bernoulli numbers]]. Employing the generating function its Borel sum can be evaluated as 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}B_k z^k= \int_0^\infty e^{-t} \frac{t z}{e^{t z}-1}d t= \sum_{k=1}\frac z{(k z+1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The general relation gives the Newton series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}\frac{B_k(x)}{z^k}\frac{{1-s\choose k}}{s-1}= z^{s-1}\zeta(s,x+z),&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] and &lt;math&gt;B_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Bernoulli polynomials|Bernoulli polynomial]]. The series does not converge, the identity holds formally.

Another identity is 
&lt;math&gt;\frac 1{\Gamma(x)}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty {x-a\choose k}\sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(-1)^{k-j}}{\Gamma(a+j)}{k\choose j},&lt;/math&gt;
which converges for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  This follows from the general form of a Newton series for equidistant nodes (when it exists, i.e. is convergent)
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{k=0}{\frac{x-a}h \choose k} \sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{k-j}{k\choose j}f(a+j h).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Time clocks-1905.jpg|frame|These automatic signal clocks were [[synchronization|synchronized]] by [[telegraphy]] in 1905 before the widespread use of radio]]
A '''time signal''' is a visible, audible, mechanical, or electronic [[signal]] used as a reference to determine the [[time of day]]. 

[[Church bell]]s or voices announcing hours of [[prayer]] gave way to automatically operated [[wikt:chime|chime]]s on public [[clock]]s; however, audible signals (even signal guns) have limited range. Busy sea[[port]]s used a visual signal, the dropping of a ball, to allow mariners to check the chronometers used for navigation. The advent of electrical [[telegraph]]s allowed widespread and precise distribution of time signals from central observatories. [[Railway]]s were among the first customers for time signals, which allowed synchronization of their operations over wide geographic areas. Dedicated radio time signal stations transmit a signal that allows automatic synchronization of clocks, and commercial broadcasters still include time signals in their programming. 

Today, [[GPS]] navigation radio signals are used to precisely distribute time signals over much of the world. There are many commercially available [[Radio clock|radio controlled clocks]] available to accurately indicate the local time, both for business and residential use. Computers often set their time from an [[time server|Internet atomic clock source]]. Where this is not available, a locally connected GPS receiver can precisely set the time using one of several software applications.

==Audible and visible time signals==

One sort of public time signal is a [[striking clock]].  These clocks are only as good as the clockwork that activates them, but they have improved substantially since the first clocks from the 14th century.  Until modern times, a public clock such as [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] was the only time standard the general public needed.

Accurate knowledge of time of day is essential for [[navigation]], and ships carried the most accurate [[marine chronometer]]s available, although they did not keep perfect time. A number of accurate audible or visible time signals were established in many [[seaport]] cities to enable navigators to set their chronometers.

=== Signal guns ===

In [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], a "[[9 O'Clock Gun]]" is still shot every night at 9&amp;nbsp;pm.  (This gun was brought to [[Stanley Park]] in 1894 by the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries]] originally to warn [[fishermen]] of the 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm Sunday closing of fishing.)  The 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm firing was later established as a time signal for the general population. Until a time gun was installed, the nearby [[Brockton Point]] lighthouse keeper detonated a stick of dynamite. Elsewhere in Canada, a "[[Noon Gun]]" is fired daily from the citadels in [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Halifax]] and [[Citadelle of Quebec|Quebec City]].

In the same manner, a noon gun has been fired in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, since 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bokaap.co.za/noon-gun/|title=Noon Gun -|author=|date=|website=bokaap.co.za|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gun is fired daily from the Lion Battery at [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]].

A cannon was fired at one o'clock every weekday at [[Liverpool]], England, at the [[Edinburgh Castle|Castle]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and also at [[Perth Observatory|Perth]] in Australia to establish the time. The Edinburgh "[[One O'Clock Gun]]" is still in operation. A cannon located at the top of Santa Lucia Hill, in [[Santiago, Chile]], is shot every noon.

In [[Rome]], on the [[Janiculum]], a hill west of the [[Tiber]] since 1904 a cannon is fired daily at noon towards the river as a time signal. This was introduced in 1847 by [[Pope Pius IX]] to synchronise all the church bells of Rome. It was situated in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] until 1903 when it was moved to [[Monte Mario]] for a few months until it was placed in its current position. The cannon was silenced from the start of WWII for about twenty years until 21 April 1959, the 2712th anniversary of Rome's founding, and has been in use since then.

For many years an old cannon was fired "about noon" from a mountain near [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0422/042212.html|title=The noon gun|author=|date=22 April 1982|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalsilver.co.uk/TimeGun/kabul_gun.html|title=The Old Noon Day Gun of Kabul - Afghanistan|author=|date=|website=digitalsilver.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sirens, whistles, and other audible signals ===

In many Midwestern US cities where tornadoes are a common hazard, the [[emergency siren]]s are tested regularly at a specified time (say, noon each Saturday); while not primarily intended to mark the time, local people often check their watches when they hear this signal. In many non-seafaring communities, loud factory [[whistle]]s served as public time signals before radio made them obsolete. Sometimes, the tradition of a factory whistle becomes so deeply entrenched in a community that the whistle is maintained long after its original function as a time keeper became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Jenna |title=Midwestern towns with sirens weigh nostalgia against nuisance |url=http://www.startribune.com/towns-with-daily-sirens-balance-nostalgia-nuisance/288938591/ |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=Minneapolis Star Tribune |date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example the [[University of Iowa]]'s power plant whistle has been reinstated several times by popular demand after numerous attempts to silence it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Snee |first1=Tom |title=The enduring exhalations of The Whistle |url=https://fyi.uiowa.edu/04/18/the-whistle/ |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=Iowa Now |date=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual signals ===

In 1861 and 1862, the Edinburgh Post Office Directory published time gun [[map]]s relating the number of seconds required for the report of the time gun to reach various locations in the city.[[Image:Royal observatory greenwich.jpg|thumb|right|The [[time ball]] at [[Greenwich Observatory]], London, is shown in the top right of picture.]] Because [[speed of light|light]] travels much faster than [[speed of sound|sound]], visible signals enabled greater precision than audible ones, although audible signals could operate better under conditions of reduced visibility. The first [[time ball]] was erected at [[Portsmouth]], England in 1829 by its inventor [[Robert Wauchope (admiral)|Robert Wauchope]].&lt;ref name=AUB&gt;Aubin, David [https://books.google.com/books?id=9EKzLQL3RQEC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=Robert+Wauchope+time+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BBIYTe6mLNCGhQehyJi3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Wauchope%20time%20ball&amp;f=false The Heavens on Earth: Observatories and Astronomy in Nineteenth-Century Science and Culture] p.164. Duke University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; One was installed in 1833 on the roof of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich]], London, and the time ball has dropped at 1:00 pm every day since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.co.uk/info/timeball.htm|title=Greenwich Time Ball|author=|date=|website=greenwichmeantime.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023194034/http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.co.uk/info/timeball.htm|archivedate=23 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first American time ball went into service in 1845.&lt;ref name=AUB/&gt; In New York City, the ceremonial [[Times Square Ball]] drop on New Year's Eve in [[Times Square]] is a vestige of a visual time signal.

==Electrical time signals==

{{Globalize/US | section |date=January 2015 }}

Telegraph signals were used regularly for time coordination by the [[United States Naval Observatory]] starting in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/history.html Timekeeping at the U.S. Naval Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandford Fleming]] proposed a single 24-hour clock for the entire world. At a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on 8 February 1879 he linked it to the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|anti-meridian of Greenwich]] (now 180°). He suggested that standard [[time zone]]s could be used locally, but they were subordinate to his single world time.

[[Standard time]] came into existence in the United States on 18 November 1883.  Earlier, on 11 October 1883, the General Time Convention, forerunner to the [[American Railway Association]], approved a plan that divided the United States into several [[time zone]]s.  On that November day, the US Naval Observatory telegraphed a signal that coordinated noon at Eastern standard time with 11&amp;nbsp;am Central, 10&amp;nbsp;am Mountain, and 9&amp;nbsp;am Pacific standard time.

A March 1905 issue of ''The Technical World'' describes the role of the United States Naval Observatory as a source of time signals:

:''One of the most important functions of the Naval Observatory is found in the daily distribution of the correct time to every portion of the United States. This is effected by means of telegraphic signals, which are sent out from Washington at noon daily, except Sundays. The original object of this time service was to furnish mariners in the seaboard cities with the means of regulating their chronometers; but, like many another governmental activity, its scope has gradually broadened until it has become of general usefulness. The electrical impulse which goes forth from the Observatory at noon each day, now sets or regulates automatically more than 70,000 clocks located in all parts of the United States, and also serves, in each of the larger cities of the country, to release a time-ball located on some lofty building of central location. The dropping of the time-ball – accompanied, at some points, with the simultaneous firing of a cannon – is the signal for the regulation by hand of hundreds of other clocks and watches in the vicinity.''

===Dedicated time signal broadcasts===
{{Globalize | section |date=August 2015 }}
The telegraphic distribution of time signals was made obsolete by the use of AM, FM, [[shortwave radio]], Internet [[Network Time Protocol]] [[Server (computing)|servers]] as well as [[atomic clock]]s in [[Satellite Navigation|satellite navigation]] systems.  Since 1905 time signals have been transmitted by radio.&lt;ref name=Burns04&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Communications: an international history of the formative years'', IET, 2004 {{ISBN|0863413277}} page 121&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|dedicated radio time signal stations]] around the world.

Time stations operating in the [[longwave]] radio band have highly predictable [[radio propagation]] characteristics, which gives low uncertainty in the received time signals. Stations operating in the [[shortwave]] band can cover wider areas with relatively low-power transmitters, but the varying distance that the signal travels increases the uncertainty of the time signal on a scale of milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis D. McCarthy, P. Kenneth Seidelmann ''Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics'', Wiley-VCH, 2009
{{ISBN|3-527-40780-4}}, page 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio time signal stations broadcast the time in both audible and machine-readable [[time code]] form that can be used as references for [[radio clock]]s and [[Watch#Electronic_movements|radio-controlled watches]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis D. McCarthy, P. Kenneth Seidelmann, '' Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics '', Wiley-VCH, 2009 {{ISBN|3-527-40780-4}}, page 256&lt;/ref&gt;
The audio portions of the shortwave [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] and [[WWVH]] broadcasts can also be heard by telephone. The time announcements are normally delayed by less than 30 ms when using land lines from within the continental United States, and the stability (delay variation) is generally &lt; 1 ms. When mobile phones are used, the delays are often more than 100 ms due to the multiple access methods used to share cell channels. In rare instances when the telephone connection is made by satellite, the time is delayed by 250 to 500 ms.
These broadcasts are available by telephone by dialling US numbers (303) 499-7111 for WWV (Colorado), and (808) 335-4363 for WWVH (Hawaii). Calls, which are not toll-free, are disconnected after 2 minutes.
[[Image:Low cost DCF77 receiver.jpg|thumb|A low cost [[Low frequency|LF]] [[radio clock]] receiver, antenna left, receiver right.]]

[[Loran-C]] time signals may also be used for radio clock synchronization, by augmenting their highly accurate frequency transmissions with external measurements of the offsets of LORAN navigation signals against time standards.

===General broadcasters===
As radio receivers became more widely available, broadcasters included time information in the form of voice announcements or automated tones to accurately indicate the hour. The [[BBC]] has included time [[Greenwich Time Signal|"pips"]] in its broadcasts from 1922.&lt;ref name=Burns04/&gt;

In the United States many information-based radio stations (full-service, all-news and news/talk) also broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour. In New York, [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] have distinctive beginning-of-the-hour tones, though the WINS signal is only approximate (several seconds error){{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Is this possibly due to lack of correction for the delay for HD Radio?  Typically stations employing HD Radio delay analog transmission so that if a receiver is hopping between HD and analogue the audio will be roughly synchronized.  Many radio stations need to join and leave a network so their time is usually pretty accurate.}}. WINS also has a tone at 30 minutes past the hour for those setting their clocks. [[WTIC-AM|WTIC]] uses the [[Morse code]] V for victory to the tune of Beethoven's 5th Symphony at the beginning of the hour continuously since 1943.

Stations using iBiquity Digital Corporation's "[[HD Radio]]" system are contractually required&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiquity.com/i/Licensing_%20Fact_%20Sheet_2009.pdf iBiquity Licensing Fact Sheet 2009 (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt; to delay their analog broadcast by about eight seconds so it remains in sync with the digital stream. Thus, network-generated time signals and service cues will also be delayed by about eight seconds (for this reason, when [[WBEN (AM)|WBEN-AM]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] was broadcasting time markers and was simulcast on an FM station that broadcast in HD, the FM signal did not carry the time signal; WBEN does not broadcast in HD). Local signals may also be delayed.

The [[all-news radio]] stations of the [[CBS Radio Network]], of which WCBS is the flagship, air a "bong" (at a frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, the [[A440 (pitch standard)|standard musical note ''A'']]) that immediately precedes each top-of-the-hour network newscast. (The same bong could be heard on the [[CBS]] Television Network, at the top of the hour immediately before the beginning of any televised program, in the 1960s and 1970s.) An automated "chirp" at one second before the hour signals a switch to the radio network broadcast. As an example, [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], the CBS Radio Network all-news station in Los Angeles, broadcasts this "bong" sound on the hour. However, due to buffering of the digital broadcast on some computers, this signal may be delayed as much as 20 seconds from the actual start of the hour (this is presumably the same situation for all CBS Radio stations, as each station's digital stream is produced and distributed in a similar manner), though unlike program content which is on a [[broadcast delay]] for content concerns, the time signal airs as-is over-the-air, meaning it can sometimes be talked over during a live news event or sports play-by-play. [[KYW-AM]] in Philadelphia broadcasts a time signal at the top of the hour along with its jingle.

[[Bonneville International]]-owned news/talk station [[KSL (radio)|KSL]] (AM-FM)  in Salt Lake City uses a "clang" that originates from the Nauvoo Bell on Temple Square in Salt Lake City which has been a staple on the station since the early 1960s.

In Canada, the national English-language non-commercial [[CBC Radio One]] network has broadcast the daily [[National Research Council Time Signal]] since November 5, 1939;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/the-beginning-of-the-long-dash-indicates-75-years-of-official-time-on-cbc-1.2823599|title='The beginning of the long dash' indicates 75 years of official time on CBC - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the simulcast occurs daily at 1pm [[Eastern Time]]. Its French-language counterpart, [[Radio-Canada]], broadcasts a similar signal at noon. [[Vancouver]] radio station [[CKNW]] also broadcasts time signals, using a chime every half-hour. The CBC's predecessor, the [[CNR Radio|Canadian National Railways Radio network]], broadcast the time signal over its [[CBO-FM|Ottawa station]], CNRO (originally CKCH), at 9 pm daily and also on its Moncton station, CNRA, beginning in 1923. CNRA closed in 1931 but the broadcasts continued on CNRO when the station was acquired by the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] in 1933 and by the CBC in 1936 before going national in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/science-technology/measurement/general-5/1939-the-beginning-of-the-long-dash.html|title=CBC Archives|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, many information-based radio stations broadcast time signals at the beginning of the hour, and a [[Speaking clock#Australia|speaking clock]] service is also available.  However, the [[Radio VNG|VNG]] dedicated time signal service has been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Kruijshoop and Marjorie Walker [http://tufi.alphalink.com.au/time Introduction - Time NZ &amp; A] retrieved 23 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital delay===

Program material, including time signals, that is transmitted digitally (e.g. [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]], [[Internet radio]]) can be delayed by tens of seconds due to buffering and error correction, making time signals received on a digital radio unreliable when accuracy is needed.

'''Woodrow Wilson Skirvin''' (September 19, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Findagrave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/16329894|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) was an American inventor, industrialist, aviator and a prominent Indiana businessmen in the mid-20th century. His contribution to US aircraft engineering lead to the United States' setting of multiple world [[air speed record]]s.

==Early years==
W.W. Skirvin was the youngest of ten children (six boys, four girls). They all lived together on tobacco farms in Kentucky and Indiana. At a young age Skirvin learned to work the fields.

As a child in the 1920s Skirvin curiosity got the best of him including a dynamite explosion and a near deafening joy-ride. He once stripped a buggy to the wheels and raced it down a steep incline. It picked up so much speed that he lost control, and as he rolled down the hill a stick, poking up from the ground struck him in his ear.&lt;ref&gt;Skirvin, L. "Memories of Woodrow Wilson Skirvin" Paperback Book P.1,2&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 13, Skirvin and his brother hopped a freight train on a "hobo jaunt" heading down south. They slept in hobo camps and picked up food where they could find it.

==Woody's Billiard Parlor==
Skirvin cleaned windows, drove cabs, and even pushed a vegetable cart door to door before making his first real estate purchase in the late 1930s. It was Woody's [[Cue sports|Billiard]] Parlor on E. Michigan Street in Indianapolis, Indiana. The building had a pool room which he operated, and apartments upstairs.

In World War II there were many jobs with good wages in the war plants. Skirvin and wife Leona moved to Detroit, Michigan where he worked at a [[tool and die]] shop.

==Skirvin Tool &amp; Engineering==
Two engine-lathes and two bench drill-presses in a two-car garage: such was the start of the Skirvin Tool &amp; Engineering Company in 1944.
The first project was an aircraft job. Due to its success, more orders came in and the little garage was not large enough. So a series of "forced" moves led to the building of a completely new 25,000 sq. ft. plant in [[Fountain Square, Indianapolis|Fountain Square]] area Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;(1951) Skirvin Manual P.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, aircraft parts engineered by Skirvin &amp; Co. were used on the United States Air Force Lockheed [[P-80 Shooting Star]] &amp; the Navy D-558 [[Douglas Skystreak]]. These airplanes set new world air speed records.&lt;ref&gt;Newill, E.B. (1951) Allison Div. GM Letter&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other inventions, In 1953, Skirvin produced the [[Cycle-Scoot]], designed and manufactured in Indianapolis, IN USA. Skirvin's throttle and brake design was unique in the scooter industry. The rider pushed down with the toe to go, pushed down with the heel to stop. [[Indy 500]], three-time winner, [[Wilbur Shaw]] officially tested and proved the scooter on the 500 track in 1954 before the race.&lt;ref&gt;(1954) Indianapolis Star Daily Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; The Indianapolis Cycle-Scoot was widely distributed in the US.

==Later years==
Skirvin &amp; Sons bought and operated other real estate including the Indiana Parking Garages, Indianapolis downtown parking lots &amp; housing.
