'''''-ism''''' is a suffix in many English words, originally derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] suffix [[wikt:-ισμός|-ισμός]] (''-ismós''), and reaching English through the [[Latin]] ''-ismus'', and the [[French language | French]] ''-isme''.&lt;ref name=suffix&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2014 |title= -ism |encyclopedia= Oxford English Dictionary online |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100006}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It means "taking side with" or "imitation of", and is often used to describe [[philosophy|philosophies]], theories, [[religion]]s, social movements, artistic movements and behaviors.&lt;ref name=noun&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2014 |title= ism ''n.'' |encyclopedia= Oxford English Dictionary online|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100005}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suffix "-ism" is neutral and therefore bears no connotations associated with any of the many ideologies it identifies; such determinations can only be informed by [[public opinion]] regarding specific ideologies.

The concept of an -ism may resemble that of a [[grand narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prettejohn|first1=Elizabeth|author-link1=Elizabeth Prettejohn|chapter=The Discovery of Greek Sculpture|title=The Modernity of Ancient Sculpture: Greek Sculpture and Modern Art from Winckelmann to Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZtCo4FavAkC|series=New Directions in Classics Series|volume=2|location=London|publisher=I.B.Tauris|publication-date=2012|page=61|isbn=9781848859036|quote=[...] another grand narrative, no less compelling than the familiar succession of 'isms' [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first recorded usage of the suffix ''ism'' as a separate word in its own right was in 1680. By the nineteenth century it was being used by [[Thomas Carlyle]] to signify a pre-packaged [[ideology]]. It was later used in this sense by such writers as [[Julian Huxley]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].  In the United States of the mid-nineteenth century, the phrase "the isms" was used as a collective derogatory term to lump together the radical social reform movements of the day (such as [[abolitionism|slavery abolitionism]], [[feminism]], [[prohibitionism|alcohol prohibitionism]], [[Charles Fourier|Fourierism]], [[pacifism]], early [[socialism]], etc.) and various spiritual or religious movements considered non-mainstream by the standards of the time (such as [[Transcendentalism]], [[spiritualism]] or "spirit rapping", [[Mormonism]], the [[Oneida Society|Oneida]] movement often accused of "free love", etc.).  Southerners often prided themselves on the American South being free from all of these pernicious "Isms" (except for alcohol temperance campaigning, which was compatible with a traditional Protestant focus on individual morality).  So on September 5 and 9, 1856, the ''Examiner'' newspaper of [[Richmond, Virginia]] ran editorials on "Our Enemies, the Isms and their Purposes", while in 1858 [[William Gannaway Brownlow|"Parson" Brownlow]] called for a "Missionary Society of the South, for the Conversion of the Freedom Shriekers, Spiritualists, Free-lovers, Fourierites, and [[atheism|Infidel]] Reformers of the North" (see ''The Freedom-of-thought Struggle in the Old South'' by [[Clement Eaton]]).  In the present day, it appears in the title of a standard survey of political thought, ''Today's Isms'' by William Ebenstein, first published in the 1950s, and now in its 11th edition.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary declared in December 2015, this word -ism to be the Word of the Year. A suffix is the Word of the Year because a small group of words that share this three-letter ending triggered both high volume and significant year-over-year increase in lookups at Merriam-Webster.com. Taken together, these seven words represent millions of individual dictionary lookups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-of-the-year-2015/-ism|title = The Word of the Year is: -ism {{!}} Merriam-Webster|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi''' (227–425 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] / 842–1034 [[Common Era|CE]]) Abul Fadl ‘Abdul Wāhid b. ‘Abdu-l ‘Azīz b. Hārith b. Asad at-Tamīmī or  Abdul Wahid Tamimi  ({{lang-ar| ابوالفضل عبد الواحد تمیمی}}) was a 9th century saint who belonged to the [[Junayd of Baghdad|Junaidia]] order.  He was the son and disciple of Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad [[al-Tamimi]]. He was an ardent worshipper and ascetic.&lt;ref name="Abu Fazl Abdul Wahid bin Abdul Aziz Tamimi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdul Razzaq Al-Kailani|title=Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=-MGE0Mhx6KgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=abdul+wahid+tameemi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MaYVeapIIjfUd7NgLAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=abdul%20wahid%20tameemi&amp;f=false|publisher=PT Mizan Publications|page=119 |isbn= 978-6-028-23638-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Not many details about his early life are known except that he was born in [[Yemen]] which is why he was often regarded as "Yemeni". His name was Abdul Wahid and he was the son of Shaikh Abdul Aziz Tamimi bin Haris bin Asad. ‘Tamimi’ was a part of his name as his family belonged to the tribe [[Banu Tamim|al-Tamimi]]&lt;ref name="Scholarly Families-The Tamims"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daphna Ephrat|title=A Learned Society in the Period of Transition:The Sunni Ulama of Eleventh Century Baghdad|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O_ThejxhdP0C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=abdul+wahid+tameemi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MaYVeapIIjfUd7NgLAD&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=abdul%20wahid%20tameemi&amp;f=false|publisher=SUNY Press|page=157 |isbn= 978-0-791-44645-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Arabia.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual career==
Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi is often associated with [[Abu Bakr Shibli]]&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lewisohn, "The Heritage of Sufism: Classical Persian Sufism from its origins to Rumi", the University of Michigan, 1999.  pg 53: "Two Persian Sufis - Mansur Hallaj and Abu Bakr Shibli (d. 945), the latter from Samarqand by origin but born origin in Baghdad"&lt;/ref&gt; due to his character.  This is probably because he gained beneficence from [[Abu Bakr Shibli]] although he took [[Bay'at|Bayat]]at the hands of his father Abdul Aziz bin Haris bin Asad [[al-Tamimi]] from whom he was given the Sufi khirqa. Muhaddith [[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi]] is reported to have said, “Abdul Wahid at-Tamimi wore the [[Khirqa]] from both ‘Abdul Aziz al-Tamimi and Abu Bakr Shibli. This is reflected in many of the authentic chains of spiritual transmission.” Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi spent most of his life guiding people often while travelling. Amongst his various disciples, his prominent khalifah was Mohammad Yousaf Abu-al-Farrah Turtoosi also noted in various books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muqtadaria.com/dqcnm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=188|title=Abdul Wahid bin Abdul Aziz Tamimi - Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Darashikhoh, “Safina tul-Auliya”&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritual Lineage===
Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid [[al-Tamimi]]‘s saintly lineage of Faqr was given to him through his father and [[Murshid]] Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad [[al-Tamimi]] in the following order:&lt;ref name="spiritual lineage "&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Bāhū|title=Death Before Dying: The Sufi Poems of Sultan Bahu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlECx1j0B4IC|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|title=Sarwari Qadiri Order |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Ux_TbwAACAAJ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cBaoVJHuNofSgwTn6oH4CA&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA |location=India |publisher=General Books LLC |isbn=9781158473861 |origyear=1st.

'''Africana philosophy''' is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the [[African diaspora]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include pre-Socratic [[African philosophy]] and modern-day debates discussing the early history of [[Western philosophy]], post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, [[black existentialism]] in the United States, and the meaning of "blackness" in the modern world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lucius Outlaw writes:
{{quote|"Africana philosophy" is very much a heuristic notion—that is, one that suggests orientations for philosophical endeavors by professional philosophers and other intellectuals devoted to matters pertinent to African and African-descended persons and peoples.}}

Professional philosophers in the areas of [[ethics]], [[social philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of biology]], [[semantics]], [[critical race theory]], and [[postcolonialism]] are currently exploring Africana philosophy. The [[American Philosophical Association]] has 10,000 members in North America. It is estimated that only 100 of its members in North America are of African descent.&lt;ref name="true"&gt;{{Cite news| author=Robin Wilson | title= Black Women Seek Role in Philosophy | url=http://chronicle.com/free/v54/i05/05b00401.htm | work= The Chronicle of Higher Education | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Gordon]] writes:
{{quote|Africana philosophy is a species of Africana thought, which involves the theoretical questions raised by critical engagements with ideas in Africana cultures and their hybrid, mixed, or creolized forms worldwide. Since there was no reason for the people of the African continent to have considered themselves African until that identity was imposed upon them through conquest and colonization in the modern era... this area of thought also refers to the unique set of questions raised by the emergence of "Africans" and their diaspora here designated by the term "Africana"... Africana philosophy refers to the philosophical dimensions of this area of thought.}}

'''Alexander Aleksandrovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Богда́нов}}; born '''Alyaksandr Alyaksandravich Malinovsky'''; {{lang-be|Алякса́ндр Алякса́ндравіч Маліно́ўскі}}; {{OldStyleDateDY|22 August|1873|10 August}} &amp;ndash; 7 April 1928) was a [[Russia]]n and later [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[physician]], [[philosopher]], [[science fiction]] writer, and [[revolutionary]] of [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] ethnicity.

He was a key figure in the early history of the [[Bolshevik]] majority faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]], (RSDLP - later the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [CPSU]), originally established 1898, being one of its co-founders in 1903, after the split with the [[Mensheviks]] minority faction and a rival to [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924), until being expelled in 1909. Following the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolutions]] of 1917, when the Bolsheviks came to power in the collapsing [[Russian Empire]], during the first decade of the subsequent [[Soviet Union]] in the [[1920s]], he was an influential opponent of the Bolshevik government and Lenin from a [[Marxism|Marxist]] leftist perspective. Bogdanov received training in medicine and psychiatry. His wide various scientific and medical interests ranged from the universal [[systems theory]] to the possibility of human [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] through [[blood transfusion]]. He invented an original philosophy called "[[tectology]]", now regarded as a forerunner of [[systems theory]]. He was also an economist, culture theorist, science fiction writer, and political activist. He was one of the [[Russian Machism|Russian Machists]].

==Early years==
Alyaksandr Malinovsky was born in [[Sokółka]], Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire (now Poland), into a rural teacher's family, the second of six children. He attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], which he compared to a barracks  or prison. He was awarded a gold medal when he graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Upon completion of the gymnasium, Bogdanov was admitted to the Natural Science Department of Moscow University. In his autobiography, Bogdanov reported that, while studying at Moscow University, he joined the Union Council of Regional Societies, and he was arrested and exiled to Tula because of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanov, Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; 

The occasion of his arrest and exile is as follows. The head of the Moscow [[Okhrana]] used an informant to acquire the names of members of the Union Council of Regional Societies, which included Bogdanov's name. on October 30, 1894, students rowdily demonstrated against a lecture by the famous history Professor [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] who, despite being a well-known liberal, had written a favourable eulogy for the recently deceased Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]]. Punishment of a few of the students was arbitrary and unfair that the Union Council requested a fair reexamination of the issue. That very night, the Okhrana arrested all the students on the list mentioned above - including Bogdanov - who were expelled from the university and banished to their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Bogdanov remained in Tula from 1894 to 1899, where - since his own family was living in Sokółka - he lodged with Alexander Rudnev, the father of [[Vladimir Bazarov]], who became a close friend and collaborator in future years. Here he met and married Natalya Bogdanovna Korsak, who, as a woman, had been refused entrance to the university. She was eight years older than him&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huestis|first=Douglas W.|title=Alexander Bogdanov: The Forgotten Pioneer of Blood Transfusion|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0887796307000478|journal=Transfusion Medicine Reviews|volume=21|issue=4|pages=337–340|doi=10.1016/j.tmrv.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as a nurse for Rudnev. Malinovsky adopted the [[nom de plume]] that he used when he wrote his major theoretical works and his novels from her [[patronym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alongside Bazarov and [[Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov]] he became a tutor in a workers' [[study circle]]. This was organised in the Tula Armament Factory by Ivan Saveliev, whom Bogdanov credited with founding [[Social Democracy]] in Tula. During this period, he wrote his ''Brief course of economic science'' which was published &amp;ndash; "subject to many modifications made for the benefit of the censor" &amp;ndash; only in 1897. He later said that this experience of student-led education gave him his first lesson in [[proletarian culture]]. In autumn 1895, he resumed his medical studies at the University of [[Kharkiv]] (Ukraine) but still spent much time in Tula. He gained access to the works of [[Lenin]] in 1896, particularly the latter's critique of [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]]. In 1899, he graduated as a medical doctor and published his next work, "Basic elements of the historical perspective on nature". However, because of his political views, he was also arrested by the Tsar's police, spent six months in prison, and was exiled to [[Vologda]].

==Bolshevism==

Bogdanov dates his support for Bolshevism from autumn of 1903. Early in 1904, [[Martin Lyadov]] was sent by the Bolsheviks in [[Geneva]] to seek out supporters in Russia. He found a sympathetic group of revolutionaries in [[Tver]]. Bogdanov was then sent by the Tver Committee to Geneva, where he was greatly impressed by Lenin's ''[[One Step Forward, Two Steps Back]]''.
Bogdanov was arrested on 3 December 1905 and held in prison until 27 May 1906. Upon release, he was exiled to [[Bezhetsk]] for three years. However he obtained permission to spend his exile abroad, and joined Lenin in [[Kokkola]], Finland.
For the next six years, Bogdanov was a major figure among the early Bolsheviks, second only to [[Vladimir Lenin]] in influence. In 1904-1906, he published three volumes of the philosophic treatise ''Empiriomonizm'' (''Empiriomonism''), in which he tried to merge [[Marxism]] with the philosophy of [[Ernst Mach]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Richard Avenarius]]. His work later affected a number of Russian Marxist theoreticians, including [[Nikolai Bukharin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he helped organize the [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery]] with both Lenin and [[Leonid Krasin]].

For four years after the collapse of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Bogdanov led a group within the Bolsheviks ("[[ultimatists]]" and "[[otzovists]]" or "recallists"), who demanded a recall of Social Democratic deputies from the [[State Duma]], and he vied with Lenin for the leadership of the Bolshevik faction. In 1908 he joined Bazarov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich and Suvorov in a symposium ''Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism'' which espoused the views of the Russian Marxists. By mid-1908, the factionalism with the Bolsheviks had become irreconcilable. A majority of Bolshevik leaders either supported Bogdanov or were undecided between him and Lenin. Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909 he published a scathing book of criticism entitled ''[[Materialism and Empiriocriticism]]'', assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of [[philosophical idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Part Three&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated by Lenin at a Bolshevik mini-conference in [[Paris]] organized by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine ''[[Proletary]]'' and was expelled from the Bolsheviks.

He joined his brother-in-law [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and other [[Vpered]]ists on the island of [[Capri]], where they started the [[Capri Party School]] for Russian factory workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]], and their supporters moved the school to [[Bologna]], where they continued teaching classes through 1911, while Lenin and his allies soon started the [[Longjumeau Party School]] just outside of Paris.

Bogdanov broke with the ''Vpered'' in 1912 and abandoned revolutionary activities. After six years of his political exile in Europe, Bogdanov returned to Russia in 1914, following the political amnesty declared by Tsar Nicholas II as part of the festivities connected with the tercentenery of the Romanov Dynasty.

==During World War I==
Bogdanov was drafted soon after the outbreak of [[World War I]], and he was assigned as a junior regimental doctor with the 221st [[Smolensk]] infantry division in the Second Army commanded by General [[Alexander Samsonov]]. In the Battle of Tannenberg, August 26–30, the Second Army was surrounded and almost completely destroyed, but Bogdanov survived because he had been sent to accompany a seriously wounded officer to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogachevskii|first=Andrei|title='Life Makes No Sense': Aleksandr Bogdanov's Experiences in the First World War|journal=Proveedings of the Annual Conference of the Scottish Society for Russian and East European Studies|year=1995|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; However following the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], he succumbed to a [[Shell shock|nervous disorder]], and subsequently became Junior house surgeon at an evacuation hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Biggart J. (1998) 'the Rehabitation of Bogdanov' in ''Bogdanov and His Work'', Aldershot: Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he wrote four articles for [[Vpered]] which provided an analysis of the World War and the dynamics of war economies. He attributed a central role to the armed forces in the economic restructuring of the belligerent powers. He saw the army as creating a "consumers' communism" with the state taking over ever increasing parts of the economy. At the same time military authoritarianism was also spread to civil society. this created the conditions for two consequences: consumption-led [[war communism]] and the destruction of the means of production. He thus predicted that even after the war, the new system of [[state capitalism]] would replace that of [[finance capitalism]] even though the destruction of the forces of production would cease.&lt;ref name="New Class"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biggart|first=John|title=Alexander Bogdanov and the Theory of a "New Class"|journal=Russian Review|year=1990|volume=49|issue=3|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Russian Revolution==
Bogdanov had no party-political involvement in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], although he did publish a number of articles and books about the events that unfurled around him. He supported  the [[Zimmerwald]]ist programme of "peace without annexations or indemnities". He deplored the [[Provisional Government]]'s continued prosecution of the war. After the [[July Crisis]], he advocated "revolutionary democracy" as he now considered the socialists capable of forming a government. However, he viewed this as a broad-based socialist provisional government that would convene a [[Constituent Assembly]]. In May 1917, he published ''Chto my svergli'' in ''Novaya Zhizn''. Here he argued that between 1904 and 1907, the Bolsheviks had been "decidedly democratic" and that there was no pronounced cult of leadership. However, following the decision of Lenin and the émigré group around him to break with ''Vpered'' in order to unify with the Mensheviks, the principle of leadership became more pronounced. After 1912, when Lenin insisted on splitting the Duma group of the RSDLP, the leadership principle became entrenched. However, he saw this problem as not being confined to the Bolsheviks, noting that similar authoritarian ways of thinking were shown in the Menshevik attitude to [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]], or the cult of heroic individuals and leaders amongst the [[Narodnik]]s.
: Every organisation, on achieving a position of decisive influence in the life and ordering of society, quite inevitably, irrespective of the formal tenets of the its programme, attempts to impose on society its own type of structure, the one with which it is most familiar and to which it is most accustomed. Every collective re-creates, as far as it can, the whole social environment after its own image and in its own likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==After the October Revolution==
At the beginning of February 1918, Bogdanov denied that the Bolsheviks' October rise to power had constituted a conspiracy. Rather, he explained that an explosive situation had arisen through the prolongation of the war. He pointed to a lack of cultural development in that all strata of society, whether the bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, or the workers, had shown a failure to resolve conflicts through negotiation. He described the revolution as being a combination of a peasant revolution in the countryside and a soldier-worker revolution in the cities. He regarded it as paradoxical that the peasantry expressed itself through the Bolshevik party rather than through the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]].

He analysed the effect of the [[First World War]] as creating '[[War Communism]]' which he defined a 'consumer communism', which created the circumstances for the creation of [[state capitalism]]. He saw military state capitalism as temporary phenomenon in the West, lasting only as long as the war. However, thanks to the predominance of the soldiers in the Bolshevik Party, he regarded it as inevitable that their backwardness should predominate in the re-organisation of society. Instead of proceeding in a methodical fashion, the pre-existing state was simply uprooted. The military-consumerist approach of simply requisitioning what was required had predominated and could not cope with the more complex social relations necessitated by the market:
: There is a War Communist party which is mobilising the working class, and there are groups of socialist intelligentsia. The war has made the army the end and the working class the means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He refused multiple offers to rejoin the party and denounced the new regime as similar to [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]]'s arbitrary and despotic rule in the early 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Bogdanov became a professor of economics at the [[University of Moscow]] and director of the newly established Socialist Academy of Social Sciences.

==Proletkult==
Between 1918 and 1920, Bogdanov co-founded the proletarian art movement [[Proletkult]] and was its leading theoretician. In his lectures and articles, he called for the total destruction of the "old bourgeois culture" in favour of a "pure proletarian culture" of the future. It was also through Proletkult that Bogdanov's educational theories were given form with first the establishment of the [[Moscow Proletarian University]]. At first Proletkult, like other radical cultural movements of the era, received financial support from the Bolshevik government, but by 1920, the Bolshevik leadership grew hostile, and on December 1, 1920, ''[[Pravda]]'' published a decree denouncing Proletkult as a "petit bourgeois" organization operating outside of Soviet institutions and a haven for "socially alien elements". Later in that month, the president of Proletkult was removed, and Bogdanov lost his seat on its Central Committee. He withdrew from the organization completely in 1921-1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p.&amp;nbsp;162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Bogdanov gave a lecture to a club at [[Moscow University]], which, according to [[Yakov Yakovlev]], included an account of the formation of [[Vpered]] and reiterated some of the criticisms Bogdanov had made at the time of the individualism of certain leaders. Yakovlev further claimed that Bogdanov discussed the development of the concept of proletarian culture up to the present day and discussed to what extent the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] saw Proletkult as a rival. He further hinted at the prospect of a new International that might emerge if there were a revival of the socialist movement in the West. He said he envisaged such an International as merging political, trade union, and cultural activities into a single organisation. Yakovlev characterised these ideas as [[Menshevik]], pointing to the refusal of ''Vpered'' to acknowledge the authority of the 1912 [[Prague Conference]]. He cited Bogdanov's characterization of the [[October revolution]] as "soldiers'-peasants' revolt", his criticisms of the [[New Economic Policy]], and his description of the new regime as expressing the interests of a new class of technocratic and bureaucratic intelligentsia, as evidence that Bogdanov was involved in forming a new party.&lt;ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Workers' Truth]] had received publicity in  the Berlin-based Menshevik journal ''Sotsialisticheskii Vestnik'', and they also distributed a manifesto at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|12th Bolshevik Congress]] and were active in the industrial unrest which swept Moscow and [[Petrograd]] in July and August 1923. On 8 September 1923, Bogdanov was among a number of people arrested by the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] (the Soviet secret police) on suspicion of being involved in them. He demanded to be interviewed by [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], to whom he explained that while he shared a range of views with Workers' Truth, he had no formal association with them. He was released after five weeks on 13 October; however, his file was not closed until a decree passed by the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] on 16 January 1989. He wrote about his experiences under arrest in ''Five weeks with the GPU''.&lt;ref&gt;'The rehabilitation of Bogdanov' by John Biggart in ''Bogdanov and His Work: A Guide to the Published and Unpublished Works of Alexander A. Bogdanov (Malinovsky), 1873-1928'', 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
In 1924, Bogdanov started his [[blood transfusion]] experiments, apparently hoping to achieve [[elixir of life|eternal youth]] or at least partial [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. Lenin's sister [[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Maria Ulyanova]] was among many who volunteered to take part in Bogdanov's experiments. After undergoing 11 blood transfusions, he remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms. His fellow revolutionary [[Leonid Krasin]] wrote to his wife that "Bogdanov seems to have become 7, no, 10 years younger after the operation". In 1925–1926, Bogdanov founded the Institute for [[Hematology|Haemotology]] and Blood Transfusions, which was later named after him. But a later transfusion cost him his life, when he took the blood of a student suffering from [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]. (Bogdanov died, but the student injected with his blood made a complete recovery.) Some scholars (e.g. [[Loren Graham]]) have speculated that his death may have been a suicide, because Bogdanov wrote a highly nervous political letter shortly beforehand. Others, however, attribute his death to blood type incompatibility, which was poorly understood at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Both Bogdanov's fiction and his political writings imply that he expected the coming revolution against [[capitalism]] to lead to a [[technocratic]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Sochor, p. ___&lt;/ref&gt;  This was because the workers lacked the knowledge and initiative to seize control of social affairs for themselves as a result of the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of the capitalist production process. However, Bogdanov also considered that the hierarchical and authoritarian mode of organization of the Bolshevik party was also partly to blame, although Bogdanov considered at least some such organization necessary and inevitable.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Bogdanov's theorizing, being the product of a non-Leninist Bolshevik, became an important, though "underground", influence on certain dissident factions in the [[Soviet Union]] who turned against Bolshevik autocracy while accepting the necessity of the Revolution and wishing to preserve its achievements.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialist Standard'', April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==

===Fiction===

In 1908, Bogdanov published the novel ''[[Red Star (novel)|Red Star]]'', about a [[utopia]] set on [[Mars]]. In it, he made predictions about future scientific and social developments. His utopia also dealt with [[feminism|feminist]] themes, which would become more common in later utopian science fiction, e.g., the two sexes becoming virtually identical in the future, or women escaping "domestic slavery" (one reason for physical changes) and being free to pursue relationships with the same freedom as men, without stigma. Other notable differences between the utopia of ''Red Star'' and present day society include workers having total control over their working hours, as well as more subtle differences in social behavior such as conversations being patiently "set at the level of the person with whom they were speaking and with understanding for his personality although it might very much differ from their own". The novel also gave a detailed description of blood transfusion in the Martian society.

===Tectology===
{{Main|Tectology}}
From 1913 until 1922, Bogdanov immersed himself in the writing of a lengthy philosophical treatise of original ideas, ''Tectology: Universal Organization Science''. ''Tectology'' anticipated many basic ideas of [[Systems Analysis]], later explored by [[Cybernetics]] and Bogdanov attributed some of his ideas on the development of a [[monistic]] system to [[Ludwig Noire]]. In ''Tectology'', Bogdanov proposed to unify all social, biological, and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and by seeking the organizational principles that underlie all systems. His three volume book anticipated many ideas later popularized by [[Norbert Wiener]] in ''Cybernetics'' and [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] in ''General Systems Theory''. Both Wiener and von Bertalanffy may have read the German translation of ''Tectology'', published in 1926, with a second edition published in 1928. In Russia, [[Vladimir Lenin]] (and later [[Joseph Stalin]]) considered Bogdanov's natural philosophy an ideological threat to [[dialectic materialism]]. The rediscovery of ''Tectology'' occurred only in the 1970s.

'''Anselm of Canterbury'''{{efn|{{lang-la|Anselmus Cantuariensis}}}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|s|ɛ|l|m}}; 1033/4–1109), also called {{nowrap|'''Anselm of Aosta'''}} ({{lang-it|Anselmo d'Aosta}}) after his [[Aosta|birthplace]] and {{nowrap|'''Anselm of Bec'''}} ({{lang-fr|Anselme du Bec}}) after his [[Abbey of Bec|monastery]], was an Italian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Anselm-of-Canterbury |title=Saint Anselm of Canterbury |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedictines|Benedictine monk]], [[abbot]], [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who held the office of [[archbishop of Canterbury|archbishop]] of [[diocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]] from 1093 to 1109. After his death, he was [[canonization|canonized]] as a [[Christian saint|saint]]; his [[calendar of the saints|feast day]] is 21 April.

Beginning at [[Bec Abbey|Bec]], Anselm composed dialogues and treatises with a rational and [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach, sometimes causing him to be credited as the founder of [[Scholasticism]]. Despite his lack of recognition in this field in his own time, Anselm is now famed as the originator of the [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] and of the [[satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction theory]] of [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. He was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] by a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope&amp;nbsp;Clement&amp;nbsp;XI]] in 1720.

As archbishop, he defended the church's interests in England amid the [[Investiture Controversy]]. For his resistance to the English kings [[William II of England|William&amp;nbsp;II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;I]], he was exiled twice: once from 1097 to 1100 and then from 1105 to 1107. While in exile, he helped guide the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek bishops]] of southern Italy to adopt Roman rites at the [[Council of Bari]]. He worked for the [[primate bishop|primacy]] of Canterbury over the bishops of [[archbishop of York|York]] and [[Catholic Church in Wales|Wales]] but, though at his death he appeared to have been successful, [[Pope Paschal&amp;nbsp;II]] later reversed himself and restored York's independence.

===Family===
Anselm was born in or [[Valle D'Aosta|around]] [[Aosta]] in [[Upper Burgundy]] sometime between April 1033 and April 1034.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA1 1–2]}} The area now forms part of the [[Republic of Italy]], but Aosta had been part of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Kingdom of Arles]] until the death of the childless [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph&amp;nbsp;III]] in 1032.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=7}} The [[Conrad&amp;nbsp;II|Emperor]] and the [[Odo II, count of Blois|Count of Blois]] then went to war over his succession. [[Humbert the White-Handed]], [[count of Maurienne|count]] of [[county of Maurienne|Maurienne]], so distinguished himself that he was granted a [[county of Aosta|new county]] carved out of the secular holdings of the less helpful [[bishop of Aosta|bishop]] of [[diocese of Aosta|Aosta]]. Humbert's son [[Otto I, count of Savoy|Otto]] was subsequently permitted to inherit the extensive [[march of Susa]] through his wife [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide]] in preference to her uncle's families, who had supported the effort to establish an independent [[Kingdom of Italy (HRE)|Kingdom of Italy]] under [[William V of Aquitaine|William the Great]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Otto and Adelaide's unified lands then controlled the most important passes in the [[western Alps]] and formed the [[county of Savoy]] whose [[House of Savoy|dynasty]] would later rule the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|kingdoms of Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

Records during this period are scanty, but both sides of Anselm's immediate family appear to have been dispossessed by these decisions{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA1 1–4]}} in favour of their extended relations.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=8}} His father Gundulph{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} or Gundulf{{sfnp|Robson|1996}} was a [[Lombards|Lombard]] noble,{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 73]}} probably one of Adelaide's [[Arduinici]] uncles or cousins;{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}} his mother Ermenberga was almost certainly the granddaughter of [[Conrad the Peaceful]], related both to the Anselmid bishops of Aosta and to the heirs of [[Henry II (HRE)|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] who had been passed over in favour of Conrad.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}} The marriage was thus probably arranged for political reasons but was incapable of resisting Conrad's decrees after his successful annexation of Burgundy on 1 August 1034.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}} ([[Burchard, bishop of Aosta|Bishop Burchard]] subsequently revolted against imperial control but was defeated; he was ultimately [[translation (bishop)|translated]] to [[diocese of Lyon|Lyons]].) Ermenberga appears to have been the wealthier of the two. Gundulph moved to his wife's town,{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=7}} where she held a palace, likely near the cathedral, along with a villa in the [[Valle D'Aosta|valley]].{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA4 4–7]}} Anselm's father is sometimes described as having a harsh and violent temper{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} but contemporary accounts merely portray him as having been overgenerous or careless with his wealth;{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA7 7–8]}} Anselm's patient and devoutly religious mother,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} meanwhile, made up for her husband's fault with her own prudent management of the family estates.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA7 7–8]}} In later life, there are records of three relations who visited Bec: Folceraldus, Haimo, and Rainaldus. The first repeatedly attempted to impose on Anselm's success but was rebuffed owing to his ties to another monastery; the latter two Anselm attempted in vain to persuade to join his community.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=9}}

[[File:Becca di Nona.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Becca di Nona]] south of [[Aosta]], the sight of a [[#Veneration|supposed mystical vision]] during Anselm's childhood{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VUBTzaMXEDEC&amp;pg=PA12 12–14]}}]]

===Early life===
At the age of fifteen, Anselm desired to enter a monastery but, failing to obtain his father's consent, he was refused by the abbot.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} The illness he then suffered has been considered a [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] effect of his disappointment,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} but upon his recovery he gave up his studies and for a time lived a carefree life.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}}

Following the death of his mother, probably at the birth of his sister Richera,{{sfnp|Wilmot-Buxton|1915|loc= Ch.&amp;nbsp;3}} Anselm's father repented his earlier lifestyle but professed his new faith with a severity that the boy found likewise unbearable.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=365–366}} Once Gundulph had entered a convent,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=366}} Anselm, at age 23,{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=9}} left home with a single attendant,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} crossed the [[Alps]], and wandered through [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] for three years.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}}{{efn|An entry concerning Anselm's parents in the records of Christ Church in Canterbury leaves open the possibility of a later reconciliation.{{sfnp|Robson|1996}}}} His countryman [[Lanfranc]] of [[Pavia]] was then [[prior]] of the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] [[abbey of Bec]]; attracted by the fame of his fellow countryman, Anselm reached [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] in 1059.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} After spending some time in [[Avranches]], he returned the next year. His father having died, he consulted with Lanfranc as to whether to return to his estates and employ their income in providing [[almsgiving|alms]] or to renounce them, becoming a [[hermit]] or a monk at Bec or [[Cluny]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§1}} Professing to fear his own bias, Lanfranc sent him to [[Maurilius]], the [[archbishop of Rouen|archbishop]] of [[diocese of Rouen|Rouen]], who convinced him to enter the abbey as a [[Catholic novitiate|novice]] at the age of 27.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} Probably in his first year, he wrote his first work on philosophy, a treatment of [[Latin]] paradoxes called the ''[[#Dialogues|Grammarian]]''.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} Over the next decade, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] reshaped his thought.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=32}}

===Abbot of Bec===

====Early years====
Three years later, in 1063, [[William the Conqueror|Duke William II]] summoned Lanfranc to serve as the abbot of his new [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen|abbey of St&amp;nbsp;Stephen]] at [[Caen]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} and the monks of Bec—with some dissenters at first on account of his youth{{sfnp|Butler|1864}}—elected Anselm as his replacement.{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=10}} A notable opponent was a young monk named Osborne. Anselm overcame his hostility first by praising, indulging, and privileging him in all things despite his hostility and then, when his affection and trust were gained, gradually withdrawing all preference until he upheld the strictest obedience.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|pp=366–367}} Along similar lines, he remonstrated a neighboring abbot who complained that his charges were incorrigible despite being beaten "night and day".{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=367–368}} After fifteen years, in 1078, Anselm was unanimously elected as Bec's abbot following the death of its founder,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=368}} the warrior-monk Herluin.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} He was [[consecration|consecrated]] by the [[Gilbert d'Arques|Bishop of Évreux]] on 22 February 1079.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=282}}

[[File:Moine de l'abbaye du Bec-Hellouni.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Bec Abbey]] in [[Normandy]]]]
Under Anselm's direction, Bec became the foremost seat of learning in Europe,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} attracting students from France, [[medieval Italy|Italy]], and elsewhere.{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=15}} During this time, he wrote the ''[[#Monologion|Monologion]]'' and ''[[#Proslogion|Proslogion]]''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} He then composed a series of [[dialogue]]s on the nature of [[truth]], [[free will]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} and the [[fall of Satan]].{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} When the [[nominalism|nominalist]] [[Roscelin]] attempted to appeal to the authority of [[Lanfranc]] and Anselm at his trial for the heresy of [[tritheism]] at [[Council of Soissons|Soissons]] in 1092,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA483 483]}} Anselm composed the first draft of ''[[#Other works|De Fide Trinitatis]]'' as a rebuttal and as a defence of [[Trinitarianism]] and [[universals]].{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} The fame of the monastery grew not only from his intellectual achievements, however, but also from his good example{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§1}} and his loving, kindly method of discipline{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}}—particularly with the younger monks{{sfnp|Butler|1864}}—and from his spirited defence of the abbey's independence from lay and archiepiscopal control, protecting it from the influence of both the [[William Bona Anima|new Archbishop of Rouen]] and the [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=281}}

Following the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] in 1066, devoted lords had given the abbey extensive lands across the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} Anselm occasionally visited to oversee the monastery's property, to wait upon his sovereign [[William the Conqueror|William I of England]] (formerly Duke William II of Normandy),{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=369}} and to visit Lanfranc, who had been installed as [[archbishop of Canterbury|archbishop]] of [[archdiocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]] in 1070.{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=16}} He was respected by William I{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=74}} and the good impression he made while in Canterbury made him the favourite of its cathedral chapter as a future successor to Lanfranc.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} Instead, upon the archbishop's death in 1089, [[William II of England|King&amp;nbsp;William&amp;nbsp;II]]—William Rufus or William the Red—refused the appointment of any successor and appropriated the see's lands and revenues for himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} Fearing the difficulties that would attend being named to the position in opposition to the king, Anselm avoided journeying to England during this time.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} The gravely ill [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh]], [[earl of Chester|Earl]] of [[Earldom of Chester|Chester]], finally lured him over with three pressing messages in 1092,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=370}} seeking advice on how best to handle the establishment of a new monastery at [[Abbey of St Werburgh|St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh's]].{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} Hugh was recovered by the time of Anselm's arrival,{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} but he was occupied four{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} or five months by his assistance.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} He then travelled to his former pupil [[Gilbert Crispin]], [[abbot of Westminster|abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], and waited, apparently delayed by the need to assemble the donors of Bec's new lands in order to obtain royal approval of the grants.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&amp;pg=PA189 189]}}

[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 118 - Anselm Made Archbishop of Canterbury.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 19th-century portrayal of Anselm being dragged to the cathedral by the English bishops]]
At Christmas, William II pledged by the [[Holy Face of Lucca]] that neither Anselm nor any other would sit at Canterbury while he lived{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=371}} but in March he fell seriously ill at [[Alveston]]. Believing his [[sin]]ful behavior was responsible,{{sfnp|Barlow|1983|pp=298–299}} he summoned Anselm to hear his [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] and administer [[last rites]].{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&amp;pg=PA189 189]}} He published a proclamation releasing his captives, discharging his debts, and promising to henceforth govern according to the law.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} On 6 March 1093, he further nominated Anselm to fill the vacancy at Canterbury; the clerics gathered at court acclaiming him, forcing the [[crozier]] into his hands, and bodily carrying him to a nearby church amid a ''[[Te Deum]]''.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&amp;pg=PA189 189–190]}} Anselm tried to refuse on the grounds of age and ill-health for months{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=16}} and the monks of Bec refused to give him permission to leave them.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&amp;pg=PA191 191–192]}} Negotiations were handled by the recently restored [[William de St-Calais|Bishop William]] of [[Diocese of Durham|Durham]] and [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert]], [[count of Meulan|count]] of [[County of Meulan|Meulan]].{{sfnp|Barlow|1983|p=306}} On 24 August, Anselm gave King&amp;nbsp;William the conditions under which he would accept the position, which amounted to the agenda of the [[Gregorian Reform]]: the king would have to return the church lands which had been seized, accept his spiritual counsel, and forswear the [[antipope]] [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&amp;nbsp;III]] in favour of [[Pope Urban II|Urban&amp;nbsp;II]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1974|p=246}} William Rufus was exceedingly reluctant to accept these conditions: he consented only to the first{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=286}} and, a few days afterwards, reneged on that, suspending preparations for Anselm's [[investiture]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Public pressure forced William to return to Anselm and in the end they settled on a partial return of Canterbury's lands as his own concession.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1974|p=248}} Anselm received [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] from his duties in Normandy,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} did [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to William, and—on 25 September 1093—was [[enthronement|enthroned]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|p=17}} The same day, William&amp;nbsp;II finally returned the lands of the see.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=286}}

From the mid-8th century, it had become customary that [[metropolitan bishop]]s could not be [[consecration|consecrated]] without a woolen [[pallium]] given or sent by the [[pope]] himself.{{sfnp|Boniface|747|loc=Letter to Cuthbert}} Anselm insisted that he journey to [[Rome]] for this purpose but William would not permit it. Amid the [[Investiture Controversy]],  [[Pope&amp;nbsp;Gregory&amp;nbsp;VII]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] had [[Papal deposing power|deposed]] each other twice; bishops loyal to Henry finally elected [[Antipope Clement III|Guibert]], [[bishop of Ravenna|archbishop]] of [[diocese of Ravenna|Ravenna]], as a second pope. In France, [[Philip I of France|Philip&amp;nbsp;I]] had recognized Gregory and his successors [[Pope Victor III|Victor&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Urban II|Urban&amp;nbsp;II]], but Guibert (as "Clement&amp;nbsp;III") held Rome after 1084.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Guibert of Ravenna|volume=12|page=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; William had not chosen a side and maintained his right to prevent the acknowledgement of either pope by an English subject prior to his choice.{{sfnp|''CE''|1907}} In the end, a ceremony was held to [[consecration|consecrate]] Anselm as archbishop on 4 December, without the pallium.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=286}}

[[File:Anselmstatuecanterburycathedraloutside.jpg|thumb|200px|The statue of Anselm on the southwest porch of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], holding a copy of {{lang|la|[[#Cur Deus Homo|Cur Deus Homo]]}} in its right hand]]
It has been argued whether Anselm's reluctance to take the see was sincere or not. Scholars such as [[Richard Southern|Southern]]{{sfnp|Vaughn|1974|p=240}} and [[William H. Kent (scholar)|Kent]]{{sfnp|''CE''|1907}} maintain Anselm's honest preference was to remain at Bec. Anselm had initially considered becoming a [[hermit]]{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} and, naturally drawn to contemplation, he likely would have cared little for such a political office at the best of times and disliked it all the more amid his own troubled age.{{sfnp|''CE''|1907}} Against this, [[Sally N. Vaughn|Vaughn]] notes that feigned reluctance to accept important positions was a common practice within the medieval church, as open eagerness risked earning a reputation as an ambitious careerist. She further notes that his approach improved his negotiating position and that he finally acted at the moment that gained him the greatest leverage in advancing the interests of his see and the reform movement within the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper-Bill|first1=Christopher|title=The Anglo-Norman Church|date=1992|publisher=Headstart History|location=Bangor|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
As archbishop, Anselm maintained his monastic ideals, including stewardship, prudence, and proper instruction, prayer and contemplation.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1988|p=218}} Anselm continued to agitate for [[Gregorian Reform|reform]] and the interests of Canterbury.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=357}} As such, he repeatedly took advantage of expedient moments to press the English monarchy for concessions and support of the reform agenda.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=293}} His principled opposition to royal prerogatives over the church, meanwhile, twice led to his exile from England.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|pp=91–92}}

The traditional view of historians has been to see Anselm as aligned with the papacy against lay authority and Anselm's term in office as the English theatre of the [[Investiture Controversy]] begun by Pope&amp;nbsp;Gregory&amp;nbsp;VII and the emperor Henry&amp;nbsp;IV.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|pp=91–92}} [[Sally N. Vaughn|Vaughn]] has argued against this and seen Anselm as primarily concerned with the dignity of Canterbury rather than the Church at large, thus acting as a third pole in the controversy.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=61}} By the time of a charter of {{circa|lk=no|3}} September 1101, he was styling himself "Archbishop of Canterbury and [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Great Britain and Ireland and vicar of the High Pontiff [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal]]".{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} By the end of his life, he had proven successful, having freed Canterbury from submission to the English king,{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=82}} received papal recognition of the subservience of [[Canterbury–York dispute|the wayward]] [[archdiocese of York|York]]{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=83}} and the [[Celtic Christianity|Welsh bishops]], and gained strong authority over the Irish bishops.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=298}} He died before the [[Canterbury–York dispute]] was definitively settled, however, and [[Pope Honorius&amp;nbsp;II]] finally found in favour of York instead.{{sfnp|Duggan|1965|pp=98–99}}

Although the work was largely handled by [[Christ Church Cathedral Priory|Christ Church]]'s [[Prior of Christ Church|priors]] [[Ernulf]] (1096–1107) and [[Conrad (prior)|Conrad]] (1108–1126), Anselm's episcopate also saw the expansion of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] from Lanfranc's initial plans.{{sfnp|Willis|1845|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1kgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17 17–18]}} The eastern end was demolished and an expanded [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] placed over a large and well-decorated [[crypt]], doubling the cathedral's length.{{sfnp|Cook|1949|p=49}} The new choir formed a church unto itself with its own [[transept]]s and a semicircular [[ambulatory]] opening into three [[side chapel|chapels]].{{sfnp|Willis|1845|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1kgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA45 45–47]}}

====Conflicts with William Rufus====
Anselm's vision was of a universal Church with its own internal authority, which clashed with William&amp;nbsp;II's desire for royal control over both church and state.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=293}} One of Anselm's first conflicts with William came in the month he was consecrated. William&amp;nbsp;II was preparing to wrest [[duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] from his elder brother, [[Robert II, Duke of Normandy|Robert&amp;nbsp;II]], and needed funds.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=287}} Anselm was among those expected to pay him. He offered [[GBP|£]]500 but William refused, encouraged by his courtiers to insist on 1000 as a kind of [[annates]] for Anselm's elevation to archbishop. Anselm not only refused, he further pressed the king to fill England's other vacant positions, permit bishops to meet freely in councils, and to allow Anselm to resume enforcement of [[canon law]], particularly against [[Incest#Christian|incestuous marriages]],{{sfnp|Butler|1864}} until he was ordered to silence.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA482 482]}} When a group of bishops subsequently suggested that William might now settle for the original sum, Anselm replied that he had already [[almsgiving|given the money to the poor]] and "that he disdained to purchase his master's favour as he would a horse or ass".{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA483 483]}} The king being told this, he replied Anselm's blessing for his invasion would not be needed as "I hated him before, I hate him now, and shall hate him still more hereafter".{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA482 482]}} Withdrawing to Canterbury, Anselm began work on the ''[[#Cur Deus Homo|Cur Deus Homo]]''.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA483 483]}}

[[File:AnselmP136.gif|thumb|left|200px|"Anselm Assuming the [[Pallium]] in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]" from [[Ethel Mary Wilmot-Buxton|E. M. Wilmot-Buxton]]'s 1915 ''Anselm''{{sfnp|Wilmot-Buxton|1915|p= 136}}]]
Upon William's return, Anselm insisted that he travel to the court of Urban&amp;nbsp;II&lt;!--not in Rome--&gt; to secure the pallium that legitimized his office.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA483 483]}} On 25 February 1095, the [[Lords Spiritual]] and [[Lords Temporal|Temporal]] of England met in a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to discuss the issue. The next day, William ordered the bishops not to treat Anselm as their primate or as Canterbury's archbishop, as he openly adhered to Urban. The bishops sided with the king, the [[William de St-Calais|Bishop of Durham]] presenting his case{{sfnp|Powell &amp; al.|1968|p=52}} and even advising William to depose and exile Anselm.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1987|pp=182–185}} The nobles siding with Anselm, the conference ended in deadlock and the matter was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/it-happened-today/2/25 "Anselm Defended Himself at Rockingham", Christian History Instituute]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following this, William secretly sent [[William Warelwast]] and [[Gerard (archbishop of York)|Gerard]] to Italy,&lt;!--not in Rome; likely at Council of Piacenza--&gt;{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=357}} prevailing on Urban to send a [[papal legate|legate]] bearing Canterbury's pallium.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=289}} [[Walter of Albano|Walter]], [[bishop of Albano|bishop]] of [[diocese of Albano|Albano]], was chosen and negotiated in secret with William's representative, the [[William de St-Calais|Bishop of Durham]].{{sfnp|Cantor|1958|p=92}} The king agreed to publicly support Urban's cause in exchange for acknowledgement of his rights to accept no legates without invitation and to block clerics from receiving or obeying papal letters without his approval. William's greatest desire was for Anselm to be removed from office. Walter said that "there was good reason to expect a successful issue in accordance with the king's wishes" but, upon William's open acknowledgement of Urban as pope, Walter steadfastly refused to depose the archbishop.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} William then tried to sell the pallium to others, failed,{{sfnp|Davies|1874|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eIADAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 73]}} tried to extract a payment from Anselm for the pallium, but was again refused. William then tried to personally bestow the pallium to Anselm, an act connoting the church's subservience to the throne, and was again refused.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA485 485]}} In the end, the pallium was laid on the altar at Canterbury, whence Anselm took it on 10 June 1095.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA485 485]}}

The [[First Crusade]] was declared at the [[Council of Clermont]] in November.{{efn|Anselm did not publicly condemn the Crusade but replied to an Italian whose brother was then in Asia Minor that he would be better off in a monastery instead. [[R.W. Southern|Southern]] summarized his position in this way: "For him, the important choice was quite simply between the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], the true vision of Peace signified by the name Jerusalem, which was to be found in the monastic life, and the carnage of the [[History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages|earthly Jerusalem]] in this world, which under whatever name was nothing but a vision of destruction".{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=169}}}} Despite his service for the king which earned him rough treatment from Anselm's biographer [[Eadmer]],{{sfnp|Cantor|1958|p=97}}{{sfnp|Vaughn|1987|p=188}} upon the grave illness of the [[William de St-Calais|Bishop of Durham]] in December, Anselm journeyed to console and bless him on his deathbed.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1987|p=194}} Over the next two years, William opposed several of Anselm's efforts at reform—including his right to convene a council{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=74}}—but no overt dispute is known. However, in 1094, the [[Medieval Wales|Welsh]] had begun to recover their lands from the [[Marcher Lords]] and William's 1095 invasion had accomplished little; two larger forays were made in 1097 against [[Cadwgan ap Bleddyn|Cadwgan]] in [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Gruffudd ap Cynan|Gruffudd]] in [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. These were also unsuccessful and William was compelled to erect a series of border fortresses.{{sfnp|Potter|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} He charged Anselm with having given him insufficient knights for the campaign and tried to fine him.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=291}} In the face of William's refusal to fulfill his promise of church reform, Anselm resolved to proceed to Rome—where an army of French crusaders had finally installed Urban—in order to seek the counsel of the pope.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=293}} William again denied him permission. The negotiations ended with Anselm being "given the choice of exile or total submission": if he left, William declared he would seize Canterbury and never again receive Anselm as archbishop; if he were to stay, William would impose his fine and force him to swear never again to appeal to the papacy.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=292}}

Anselm chose to depart in October 1097.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=293}} Although Anselm retained his nominal title, William immediately seized the revenues of his bishopric and retained them til death.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=360}} From [[Lyons]], Anselm wrote to Urban, requesting that he be permitted to resign his office. Urban refused but commissioned him to prepare a defence of the [[Filioque|Western doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit]] against representatives from the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]].{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cimpTwnAjxwC&amp;pg=PA279 279]}} Anselm arrived in Rome by April{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cimpTwnAjxwC&amp;pg=PA279 279]}} and, according to his biographer [[Eadmer]], lived beside the pope during the [[Siege of Capua (1098)|Siege of Capua]] in May.{{sfnp|Southern|1963}} [[Roger I of Sicily|Count Roger]]'s [[Muslim Sicily|Saracen]] troops supposedly offered him food and other gifts but the count actively resisted the clerics' attempts to convert them to Catholicism.{{sfnp|Southern|1963}}

At the [[Council of Bari]] in October, Anselm delivered his defence of the ''[[Filioque]]'' and the use of [[unleavened bread]] in the [[Eucharist]] before 185 bishops.{{sfnp|Kidd|1927|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tc5FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252 252–3]}} Although this is sometimes portrayed as a failed [[ecumenism|ecumenical dialogue]], it is more likely that the "Greeks" present were the local bishops of Southern Italy,{{sfnp|Fortescue|1907|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gu5d7_bByvIC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}} some of whom had been ruled by [[Constantinople]] as recently as 1071.{{sfnp|Kidd|1927|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tc5FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252 252–3]}} The formal acts of the council have been lost and Eadmer's account of Anselm's speech principally consists of descriptions of the bishops' [[vestments]], but Anselm later collected his arguments on the topic as {{lang|la|[[#Other works|De Processione Spiritus Sancti]]}}.{{sfnp|Fortescue|1907|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gu5d7_bByvIC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}} Under pressure from their [[Norman Italy|Norman lords]], the Italian Greeks seem to have accepted papal supremacy and Anselm's theology.{{sfnp|Fortescue|1907|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gu5d7_bByvIC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}} The council also condemned William II. Eadmer credited Anselm with restraining the pope from excommunicating him,{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cimpTwnAjxwC&amp;pg=PA279 279]}} although others attribute Urban's politic nature.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}

Anselm was present in a seat of honour at the [[Easter Council]] at [[Old St Peter's|St&amp;nbsp;Peter's]] in Rome the next year.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=280}} There, amid an outcry to address Anselm's situation, Urban renewed bans on [[lay investiture]] and on clerics doing homage.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=281}} Anselm departed the next day, first for [[Schiavi]]—where he completed his work ''[[#Cur Deus Homo|Cur Deus Homo]]''—and then for [[Lyons]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1484/J.JML.1.100545| volume = 19| pages = 1–87| last = Sharpe| first = Richard| title = Anselm as author: Publishing in the late eleventh century| journal = The Journal of Medieval Latin| date = 2009| url = http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/ohf/documents/Anselm_JMLat.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160608134224/http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/ohf/documents/Anselm_JMLat.pdf |archive-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflicts with Henry I====

William Rufus [[Walter Tirel#Death of William II|was killed hunting in the New Forest]] on 2 August 1100. His brother [[Henry I of England|Henry]] was present and moved quickly to secure the throne before the return of his elder brother [[Robert Curthose|Robert]], [[duke of Normandy|duke]] of [[duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], from the [[First Crusade]]. Henry invited Anselm to return, pledging in his letter to submit himself to the archbishop's counsel.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=63}} The cleric's support of Robert would have caused great trouble but Anselm returned before establishing any other terms than those offered by Henry.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&amp;pg=PA291 291]}} Once in England, Anselm was ordered by Henry to do homage for his Canterbury estates{{sfnp|Hollister|1983|p=120}} and to receive his investiture by [[episcopal ring|ring]] and [[crozier]] anew.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=67}} Despite having done so under William, the bishop now refused to violate [[canon law]]. Henry for his part refused to relinquish a right possessed by his predecessors and even sent an embassy to [[Pope&amp;nbsp;Paschal&amp;nbsp;II]] to present his case.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} Paschal reaffirmed Urban's bans to that mission and the one that followed it.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}

Meanwhile, Anselm publicly supported Henry against the claims and threatened invasion of his brother [[Robert Curthose]]. Anselm wooed wavering barons to the king's cause, emphasizing the religious nature of their oaths and duty of loyalty;{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=137–138}} he supported the deposition of [[Ranulf Flambard]], the disloyal new [[bishop of Durham|bishop]] of [[Diocese of Durham|Durham]];{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=135–136}} and he threatened Robert with excommunication.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} The lack of popular support greeting his invasion near [[Portsmouth]] compelled Robert to accept the [[Treaty of Alton]] instead, renouncing his claims for an annual payment of 3000&amp;nbsp;[[mark (currency)|marks]].

Anselm held a council at [[Lambeth Palace]] which found that Henry's beloved [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]] had not technically become a [[nun]] and was thus eligible to wed and become queen.{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=128–129}} On [[Michaelmas]] in 1102, Anselm was finally able to convene a [[Council of London in 1102|general church council at London]], establishing the [[Gregorian Reform]] within England. The council prohibited marriage, [[concubinage]], and drunkenness to all those in holy orders,{{sfnp|Partner|1973|pp=467–475, 468}} condemned [[sodomy]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|p=215}} and [[simony]],{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} and regulated [[vestments|clerical dress]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} Anselm also obtained a resolution against the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British slave trade]].{{sfnp|Crawley|1910}} Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed—in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them—that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA489 489–91]}} In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy [[William Warelwast]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=71}} Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}

====Second exile====
After this ruling, Anselm received a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyons to await Paschal's response.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Henry's chief advisor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=74}} He further finally threatened Henry with the same;{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=19–20}} in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA496 496–97]}} and through his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} This was probably a negotiation tactic{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=75}} but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at [[Laigle]] on 22 July 1105. Henry would forsake lay investiture if Anselm obtained Paschal's permission for clerics to do homage for their lands;{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}}{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Henry's bishops'{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and counselors' excommunications were to be lifted provided they advise him to obey the papacy (Anselm performed this act on his own authority and latter had to answer for it to Paschal);{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}} the revenues of Canterbury would be returned to the archbishop; and priests would no longer be permitted to marry.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Anselm insisted on the agreement's ratification by the pope before he would consent to return to England, but wrote to Paschal in favour of the deal, arguing that Henry's forsaking of lay investiture was a greater victory than the matter of homage.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=77}} On 23 March 1106, Paschal wrote Anselm accepting the terms established at Laigle, although both clerics saw this as a temporary compromise and intended to continue pressing for reforms,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA497 497–98]}} including the ending of homage to lay authorities.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|pp=296–297}}

Even after this, Anselm refused to return to England.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=80}} Henry travelled to [[Le Bec Hellouin|Bec]] and met with him on 15 August 1106. Henry was forced to make further concessions. He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=297}} He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be exempt from taxation for three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These compromises on Henry's part strengthened the rights of the Church against the king. Anselm returned to England before the new year.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}

====Final years====
In 1107, the [[Concordat of London]] formalized the agreements between the king and archbishop,{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=82}} Henry formally renouncing the right of English kings to invest the bishops of the church.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} The remaining two years of Anselm's life were spent in the duties of his archbishopric.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} He succeeded in getting [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal]] to send the pallium for the [[archbishop of York]] to Canterbury, so that future archbishops-elect would have to profess obedience before receiving it.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=83}} The incumbent archbishop [[Thomas II of York|Thomas&amp;nbsp;II]] had received his own pallium directly and insisted on [[archdiocese of York|York]]'s independence. From his deathbed, Anselm [[anathema]]tized all who failed to recognize Canterbury's primacy over all the English church. This ultimately forced Henry to order Thomas to confess his obedience to Anselm's successor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=298}} On his deathbed, he announced himself content, except that he had a treatise in mind on the origin of the [[soul]] and did not know, once he was gone, if another was likely to compose it.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA498 498]}}

He died on [[Holy Wednesday]], 21 April 1109.{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} His remains were [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]{{sfnp|Willis|1845|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1kgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 46]}}  and laid at the head of Lanfranc at his initial resting place to the south of the Altar of the [[Holy Trinity]] (now [[Thomas Becket|St&amp;nbsp;Thomas]]'s Chapel).{{refn|name=SS|A letter of 9 January 1753 by "S.S."

On 23 December 1752, [[Thomas Herring|Archbishop Herring]] was contacted by [[Count Perron]], the [[kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] [[Italo-British relations|ambassador]], on behalf of [[Charles Emmanuel I of Sardinia|King Charles Emmanuel]], who requested permission to translate Anselm's [[relic]]s to Italy.{{sfnp|Ollard &amp; al.|1931|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWsX2dhAONAC&amp;pg=PA20 App.&amp;nbsp;D, p.&amp;nbsp;20]}} (Charles had been [[duke of Aosta|duke]] of [[Duchy of Aosta|Aosta]] during his minority.) Herring ordered [[John Lynch (Dean of Canterbury)|his dean]] to look into the matter, saying that while "the parting with the rotten Remains of a Rebel to his King, a Slave to the Popedom, and an Enemy to the married Clergy (all this Anselm was)" would be no great matter, he likewise "should make no Conscience of palming on the Simpletons any other old Bishop with the Name of Anselm".{{refn|A letter of 23 December 1752 by [[Thomas Herring]] to [[John Lynch (Dean of Canterbury)|John Lynch]].{{sfnp|HMC|1901|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GWcpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA226 226]}}}} The ambassador insisted on witnessing the excavation, however,{{refn|A letter of 6 January 1753 by [[Thomas Herring]] to [[John Lynch (Dean of Canterbury)|John Lynch]].{{sfnp|HMC|1901|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GWcpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA227 227]}}}} and resistance on the part of the prebendaries seems to have quieted the matter.{{sfnp|Ollard &amp; al.|1931|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWsX2dhAONAC&amp;pg=PA21 App.&amp;nbsp;D, p.&amp;nbsp;21]}} They considered the state of the cathedral's crypts would have offended the sensibilities of a Catholic and that it was probable that Anselm had been removed to near the altar of SS&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], whose [[side chapel]] to the right (i.e., south) of the high altar took Anselm's name following his canonization. At that time, his relics would presumably have been placed in a [[shrine]] and its contents "disposed of" during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref name=SS/&gt; The ambassador's own investigation was of the opinion that Anselm's body had been confused with [[Theobald of Bec|Archbishop Theobald]]'s and likely remained entombed near the altar of the [[Virgin Mary]],{{refn|name=perron|A letter of 31 March 1753 by P.

==Writings==
[[File:AnselmCanterbury2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A late 16th-century engraving of Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury]]
Anselm has been called "the most luminous and penetrating intellect between [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas|St&amp;nbsp;Thomas Aquinas]]"{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} and "the father of [[scholasticism]]",{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Scotus Erigena]] having employed more [[mysticism]] in his arguments.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} Anselm's works are considered philosophical as well as theological since they endeavor to render [[Christianity|Christian]] tenets of faith, traditionally taken as a [[revelation|revealed]] truth, as a [[reason|rational]] system.{{sfnp|Davies &amp; al.|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}} Anselm also studiously analyzed the language used in his subjects, carefully distinguishing the meaning of the terms employed from the verbal forms, which he found at times wholly inadequate.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=Introduction}} His worldview was broadly [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], as it was reconciled with Christianity in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]],{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=23–24}}{{efn|Direct knowledge of Plato's works was still quite limited. [[Calcidius]]'s incomplete Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' was available and a staple of 12th-century philosophy but "seems not to have interested" Anselm.{{sfnp|Marenbon|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrq2qXlegt4C&amp;pg=PA170 170]}}}} with his understanding of [[Aristotelian logic]] gathered from the works of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§2}}{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} He or the thinkers in northern France who shortly followed him—including [[Abelard]], [[William of Conches]], and [[Gilbert of Poitiers]]—inaugurated "one of the most brilliant periods of [[Western philosophy]]", innovating [[logic]], [[semantics]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and other areas of [[philosophy of religion|philosophical theology]].{{sfnp|Marenbon|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrq2qXlegt4C&amp;pg=PA169 169–170]}}

Anselm held that faith necessarily precedes reason, but that reason can expand upon faith:{{sfnp|Hollister|1982|p=302}} "And I do not seek to understand that I may believe but believe that I might understand. For this too I believe since, unless I first believe, I shall not understand".{{efn|{{lang-la|Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed [[credo ut intelligam]]. Nam et hoc credo, quia, nisi credidero, non intelligam.}}}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} This is possibly drawn from Tractate&amp;nbsp;XXIX of [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]]'s ''Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John'': regarding [[John 7]]:14–18, Augustine counseled "Do not seek to understand in order to believe but believe that thou may understand".{{sfnp|Schaff|2005}} Anselm rephrased the idea repeatedly{{efn|Other examples include "The Christian ought to go forth to understanding through faith, not journey to faith through understanding" ({{lang|la|Christianus per fidem debet ad intellectum proficere, non per intellectum ad fidem accedere}}) and "The correct order demands that we believe the depths of the Christian faith before we presume to discuss it with reason" ({{lang|la|Rectus ordo exigit, ut profunda Christianae fidei credamus, priusquam ea praesumamus ratione discutere}}).{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}}} and Thomas Williams{{harv|''SEP''|2007}} considered that his aptest motto was the original title of the ''[[Proslogion]]'', "faith seeking understanding", which intended "an active love of God seeking a deeper knowledge of God".{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007}} Once the faith is held fast, however, he argued an attempt ''must'' be made to demonstrate its truth by means of reason: "To me, it seems to be negligence if, after confirmation in the faith, we do not study to understand that which we believe".{{efn|{{lang-la|Negligentise mihi esse videtur, si, postquam confirmatius in fide, non studemus quod credimus, intelligere.}}}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} Merely rational proofs are always, however, to be tested by scripture{{sfn|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Cur Deus Homo'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, §2}}{{sfn|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''De Fide Trinitatis'', §2}} and he employs Biblical passages and "what we believe" ({{lang|la|quod credimus}}) at times to raise problems or to present erroneous understandings, whose inconsistencies are then resolved by reason.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}}

Stylistically, Anselm's treatises take two basic forms, dialogues and sustained meditations.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} In both, he strove to state the rational grounds for central aspects of Christian doctrines as a pedagogical exercise for his initial audience of fellow monks and correspondents.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} The subjects of Anselm's works were sometimes dictated by contemporary events, such as his speech at the [[Council of Bari]] or the need to refute his association with the thinking of [[Roscelin]], but he intended for his books to form a unity, with his letters and latter works advising the reader to consult his other books for the arguments supporting various points in his reasoning.{{sfnp|Davies &amp; al.|2004|[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}} It seems to have been a recurring problem that early drafts of his works were copied and circulated without his permission.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}}

===Monologion===
The ''Monologion'' ({{lang-la|Monologium}}, "Monologue"), originally entitled ''A Monologue on the Reason for Faith'' ({{lang|la|Monoloquium de Ratione Fidei}}){{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA85 85]}}{{efn|Anselm requested the works be retitled in a letter to [[Hugh, Archbishop of Lyons|Hugh]], [[archbishop of Lyons|archbishop]] of [[diocese of Lyons|Lyons]],{{sfn|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Letters'', No.&amp;nbsp;109}} but didn't explain why he chose to use the Greek forms. [[Ian Logan|Logan]] conjectures it may have derived from Anselm's secondhand acquaintance with [[Stoicism|Stoic]] terms used by [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] and by [[Martianus Capella]].{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA85 85]}}}} and sometimes also known as ''An Example of Meditation on the Reason for Faith'' ({{lang|la|Exemplum Meditandi de Ratione Fidei}}),{{sfnp|Luscombe|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_T2cAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 44]}}{{efn|Although the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|meditandus}}}}'' is usually translated as "[[meditation]]", Anselm was not using the term in its modern sense of "self-reflection" or "consideration" but instead as a philosophical [[term of art]] which described the more active process of silently "reaching out into the unknown".{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA86 86]}}}} was written in 1075 and 1076.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} It follows St&amp;nbsp;Augustine to such an extent that [[Margaret Gibson (historian)|Gibson]] argues neither Boethius nor Anselm state anything which was not already dealt with in greater detail by Augustine's ''[[De Trinitate]]'';{{sfnp|Gibson|1981|p=214}} Anselm even acknowledges his debt to that work in the ''Monologion'''s prologue.{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}} However, he takes pains to present his reasons for belief in God without appeal to scriptural or patristic authority,{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA21 21–22]}} using new and bold arguments.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} He attributes this style—and the book's existence—to the requests of his fellow monks that "nothing whatsoever in these matters should be made convincing by the authority of Scripture, but whatsoever... the necessity of reason would concisely prove".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Monologion'', p.&amp;nbsp;7}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}}}}

In the first chapter, Anselm begins with a statement that anyone should be able to convince themselves of the existence of God through reason alone "if he is even moderately intelligent".{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.1}} He argues that many different things are known as "good", in many varying kinds and degrees. These must be understood as being judged relative to a single attribute of goodness.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006}} He then argues that goodness is itself very good and, further, is good through itself. As such, it must be the highest good and, further, "that which is supremely good is also supremely great. There is, therefore, some one thing that is supremely good and supremely great—in other words, supreme among all existing things."{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.2}} Chapter 2 follows a similar argument, while Chapter 3 argues that the "best and greatest and supreme among all existing things" must be responsible for the existence of all other things.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.2}} Chapter 4 argues that there must be a highest level of dignity among existing things and that highest level must have a single member. "Therefore, there is a certain nature or substance or essence who through himself is good and great and through himself is what he is; through whom exists whatever truly is good or great or anything at all; and who is the supreme good, the supreme great thing, the supreme being or subsistent, that is, supreme among all existing things."{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.2}} The remaining chapters of the book are devoted to consideration of the attributes necessary to such a being.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.2}} The [[Euthyphro dilemma]], although not addressed by that name, is dealt with as a [[false dichotomy]].{{sfnp|Rogers|2008|p=8}} God is taken to neither conform to nor invent the moral order but to embody it:{{sfnp|Rogers|2008|p=8}} in each case of his attributes, "God ''having'' that attribute ''is precisely'' that attribute itself".{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§6}}

A letter survives of Anselm responding to Lanfranc's criticism of the work. The elder cleric took exception to its lack of appeals to scripture and authority.{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}} The preface of the ''Proslogion'' records his own dissatisfaction with the ''Monologion'''s arguments, since they are rooted in ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evidence and [[inductive reasoning]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}

===Proslogion===
{{main|Proslogion|Ontological argument}}
The ''[[Proslogion]]'' ({{lang-la|Proslogium}}, "Discourse"), originally entitled ''Faith Seeking Understanding'' ({{lang|la|Fides Quaerens Intellectum}}) and then ''An Address on God's Existence'' ({{lang|la|Alloquium de Dei Existentia}}),{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfnp|Forshall|1840|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvNfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}}{{efn|See note above on the renaming of Anselm's works.}} was written over the next two years (1077–1078).{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} It is written in the form of an extended direct address to God.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} It grew out of his dissatisfaction with the [[#Monologion|Monologion]]'s interlinking and contingent arguments.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} His "single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof, that would by itself be enough to show that God really exists"{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}} is commonly{{efn|As by Thomas Williams.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}}}} taken to be merely the second chapter of the work. In it, Anselm reasoned that even atheists can imagine a greatest being, having such attributes that nothing greater could exist ({{lang|la|id quo nihil maius cogitari possit}}).{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} However, if such a being's attributes did not include existence, a still greater being could be imagined: one with all of the attributes of the first ''and'' existence. Therefore, the truly greatest possible being must necessarily exist. Further, this necessarily-existing greatest being must be God, who therefore necessarily exists.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} This reasoning was known to the Scholastics as "Anselm's argument" ({{lang|la|ratio Anselmi}}) but it became known as the [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] following [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s treatment of it.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}}{{efn|Various scholars have disputed the use of the term "ontological" in reference to Anselm's argument. A list up to his own time is provided by [[James McEvoy (philosopher)|McEvoy]].{{sfnp|McEvoy|1994}}}}

More probably, Anselm intended his "single argument" to include most of the rest of the work as well,{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} wherein he establishes the attributes of God and their compatibility with one another. Continuing to construct a being greater than which nothing else can be conceived, Anselm proposes such a being must be "just, truthful, happy, and whatever it is better to be than not to be".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Proslogion'', p.&amp;nbsp;104}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}}}} Chapter 6 specifically enumerates the additional qualities of awareness, omnipotence, mercifulness, impassibility (inability to suffer),{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}} and immateriality;{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§3.1}} Chapter 11, self-existent,{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§3.1}} wisdom, goodness, happiness, and permanence; and Chapter 18, unity.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}} Anselm addresses the [[beg the question|question-begging]] nature of "greatness" in this formula partially by appeal to intuition and partially by independent consideration of the attributes being examined.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§3.1}} The incompatibility of, e.g., omnipotence, justness, and mercifulness are addressed in the abstract by reason, although Anselm concedes that specific acts of God are a matter of revelation beyond the scope of reasoning.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§3.2}} At one point during the 15th chapter, he reaches the conclusion that God is "not only that than which nothing greater can be thought but something greater than can be thought".{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} In any case, God's unity is such that all of his attributes are to be understood as facets of a single nature: "all of them are one and each of them is entirely what [God is] and what the other[s] are".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Proslogion'', p.&amp;nbsp;115}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}}}} This is then used to argue for the [[Holy Trinity|triune]] nature of the God, [[Jesus]], and "the one love common to [God] and [his] Son, that is, the [[Holy Spirit]] who proceeds from both".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Proslogion'', p.&amp;nbsp;117}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}}}} The last three chapters are a digression on what God's goodness might entail.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} Extracts from the work were later compiled under the name ''Meditations'' or ''The Manual of St&amp;nbsp;Austin''.{{sfnp|Butler|1864}}

===Responsio===
The argument presented in the ''Proslogion'' has rarely seemed satisfactory{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}{{efn|Variations of the argument were elaborated and defended by [[John Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]], [[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga]], and [[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm]]. In addition to Gaunilo, other notable objectors to its reasoning include [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], with the most thorough analysis having been done by [[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta]] and [[Paul E. Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]].{{sfnp|Zalta &amp; al.|1991}}{{sfnp|Zalta &amp; al.|2007}}{{sfnp|Zalta &amp; al.|2011}}}} and was swiftly opposed by [[Gaunilo]], a monk from the [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|abbey of Marmoutier]] in [[Tours]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§5}} His book "for the fool" ({{lang|la|Liber pro Insipiente}}){{efn|The title is a reference to Anselm's invocation of the [[Psalms]]' "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’".&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 14:1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 53:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaunilo offers that, if Anselm's argument were all that supported the existence of God, the fool would be correct in rejecting his reasoning.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}}}} argues that we cannot arbitrarily pass from idea to reality{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} ({{lang|la|de posse ad esse not fit illatio}}).{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} The most famous of Gaunilo's objections is a parody of Anselm's argument involving an island greater than which nothing can be conceived.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}} Since we can conceive of such an island, it exists in our understanding and so must exist in reality. This is, however, absurd, since its shore might arbitrarily be increased and in any case varies with the tide.

Anselm's reply ({{lang|la|Responsio}}) or apology ({{lang|la|Liber Apologeticus}}){{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} does not address this argument directly, which has led [[Gyula Klima|Klima]],{{sfnp|Klima|2000}} [[Tadeusz Grzesik|Grzesik]],{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} and others to construct replies for him and led [[Nicholas Wolterstorff|Wolterstorff]]{{sfnp|Wolterstorff|1993}} and others to conclude that Gaunilo's attack is definitive.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}} Anselm, however, considered that Gaunilo had misunderstood his argument.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}}{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§5}} In each of Gaunilo's four arguments, he takes Anselm's description of "that than which nothing greater can be thought" to be equivalent to "that which is greater than everything else that can be thought".{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§5}} Anselm countered that anything which does not actually exist is necessarily excluded from his reasoning and anything which might or probably does not exist is likewise aside the point. The ''Proslogion'' had already stated "anything else whatsoever other than [God] can be thought not to exist".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''Proslogion'', p.&amp;nbsp;103}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§4}}}} The ''Proslogion'''s argument concerns and can only concern the ''single'' greatest entity out of all existing things. That entity both must exist and must be God.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§2.3}}

===Dialogues===
[[File:Littlemore.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=MS Auct. D2. 6|An illuminated archbishop—presumably Anselm—from a 12th-century edition of his ''Meditations'']]
All of Anselm's [[dialogue]]s take the form of a lesson between a gifted and inquisitive student and a knowledgeable teacher. Except for in ''[[#Cur Deus Homo|Cur Deus Homo]]'', the student is not identified but the teacher is always recognizably Anselm himself.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}}

Anselm's {{lang|la|De Grammatico}} ("On the Grammarian"), of uncertain date,{{efn|[[Richard Southern|Southern]]{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=65}} and Thomas Williams{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} date it to 1059–60, while [[John Marenbon|Marenbon]] places it "probably... shortly after" 1087.{{sfnp|Marenbon|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrq2qXlegt4C&amp;pg=PA170 170]}}}} deals with eliminating various [[paradox]]es arising from the grammar of Latin nouns and adjectives{{sfnp|Luscombe|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_T2cAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 44]}} by examining the [[syllogism]]s involved to ensure the terms in the premises agree in meaning and not merely expression.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§8}} The treatment shows a clear debt to [[Boethius]]'s treatment of [[Aristotle]].{{sfnp|Logan|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KO0zKJuNi4C&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}

Between 1080 and 1086, while still at Bec, Anselm composed the dialogues {{lang|la|De Veritate}} ("On Truth"), {{lang|la|De Libertate Arbitrii}} ("On the Freedom of Choice"), and {{lang|la|De Casu Diaboli}} ("On the Devil's Fall").{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} {{lang|la|De Veritate}} is concerned not merely with the truth of statements but with correctness in will, action, and essence as well.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.1}} Correctness in such matters is understood as doing what a thing ought or was designed to do.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.1}} Anselm employs [[Aristotelian logic]] to affirm the existence of an [[absolute truth]] of which all other truth forms separate kinds. He identifies this absolute truth with God, who therefore forms the fundamental principle both in the existence of things and the correctness of thought.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} As a corollary, he affirms that "everything that is, is rightly".{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''De Veritate'', p.&amp;nbsp;185}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§9}}}} {{lang|la|De Libertate Arbitrii}} elaborates Anselm's reasoning on correctness with regard to [[free will]]. He does not consider this a capacity to '''sin'' but a capacity to ''do good'' for its own sake (as opposed to owing to coercion or for self-interest).{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.1}} God and the good [[angel]]s therefore have free will despite being incapable of sinning; similarly, the non-coercive aspect of free will enabled man and the rebel angels to sin, despite this not being a necessary element of free will itself.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.2}} In {{lang|la|De Casu Diaboli}}, Anselm further considers the case of the fallen angels, which serves to discuss the case of rational agents in general.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§11}} The teacher argues that there are two forms of good—justice ({{lang|la|justicia}}) and benefit ({{lang|la|commodum}})—and two forms of evil: injustice and harm ({{lang|la|incommodum}}). All rational beings seek benefit and shun harm on their own account but independent choice permits them to abandon bounds imposed by justice.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§11}} Some angels chose their own happiness in preference to justice and were punished by God for their injustice with less happiness. The angels who upheld justice were rewarded with such happiness that they are now incapable of sin, there being no happiness left for them to seek in opposition to the bounds of justice.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.2}} Humans, meanwhile, retain the theoretical capacity to will justly but, owing to [[Fall of Man|the Fall]], they are incapable of doing so in practice except by divine grace.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.3}}

===''Cur Deus Homo''===&lt;!--Linked from [[Template:Atonement in Christianity]]--&gt;
{{main|Cur Deus Homo|Satisfaction theory of atonement}}
{{lang|la|[[Cur Deus Homo]]}} ("Why God was a Man")&lt;!--NOT "Why God-Man"--&gt; was written from 1095 to 1098 once Anselm was already archbishop of Canterbury{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} as a response for requests to discuss the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§7}} It takes the form of a dialogue between Anselm and Boso, one of his students.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3 &amp; 7}} Its core is a purely rational argument for the necessity of the Christian [[atonement in Christianity|mystery of atonement]], the belief that [[Jesus]]'s [[crucifixion]] was necessary to [[atonement in Christianity|atone]] for mankind's sin. Anselm argues that, owing to [[Fall of Man|the Fall]] and mankind's fallen nature ever since, humanity has offended God. Divine justice demands restitution for sin but human beings are incapable of providing it, as all the actions of men are already obligated to the furtherance of God's glory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=83}} Further, God's infinite justice demands infinite restitution for the impairment of his infinite dignity.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.3}} The enormity of the offence led Anselm to reject personal acts of atonement, even [[Peter Damian]]'s [[flagellants|flagellation]], as inadequate{{sfnp|Fulton|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7NEzHGR24wwC&amp;pg=PA176 176]}} and ultimately vain.{{sfnp|Fulton|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7NEzHGR24wwC&amp;pg=PA178 178]}} Instead, full recompense could only be made by God, which His infinite mercy inclines Him to provide. Atonement for humanity, however, could only be made through the figure of [[Jesus]], as a sinless being both fully divine and fully human.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§7}} Taking it upon himself to offer his own life on our behalf, his crucifixion accrues infinite worth, more than redeeming mankind and permitting it to enjoy a just will in accord with its intended nature.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§4.3}} This interpretation is notable for permitting divine justice and mercy to be entirely compatible{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006}} and has exercised immense influence over church doctrine,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}{{sfnp|Foley|1909}} largely supplanting the earlier theory developed by [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]]{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} that had focused primarily on [[Satan]]'s power over [[Fall of Man|fallen man]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} {{lang|la|Cur Deus Homo}} is often accounted Anselm's greatest work,{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} but the legalist and amoral nature of the argument, along with its neglect of the individuals actually being redeemed, has been criticized  both by comparison with the treatment by [[Abelard]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} and for its subsequent development in [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant]] theology.{{sfnp|Foley|1909|pp=256–7}}

===Other works===
Anselm's {{lang|la|De Fide Trinitatis et de Incarnatione Verbi Contra Blasphemias Ruzelini}} ("On Faith in the Trinity and on the Incarnation of the Word Against the Blasphemies of Roscelin"),{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} also known as {{lang|la|Epistolae de Incarnatione Verbi}} ("Letters on the Incarnation of the Word"),{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} was written in two drafts in 1092 and 1094.{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} It defended [[Lanfranc]] and Anselm from association with the supposedly [[tritheist]] heresy espoused by [[Roscelin of Compiègne]], as well as arguing in favour of [[Trinitarianism]] and [[universals]].

{{lang|la|De Conceptu Virginali et de Originali Peccato}} ("On the Virgin Conception and Original Sin") was written in 1099.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} He claimed to have written it out of a desire to expand on an aspect of ''[[#Cur Deus Homo|Cur Deus Homo]]'' for his student and friend Boso and takes the form of Anselm's half of a conversation with him.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} Although Anselm denied belief in [[Virgin Mary|Mary]]'s [[Immaculate Conception]],{{sfnp|Janaro|2006|p=51}} his thinking laid two principles which formed the groundwork for that dogma's development. The first is that it was proper that Mary should be so pure that—apart from God—no purer being could be imagined. The second was his treatment of original sin. Earlier theologians had held that it was transmitted from generation to generation by the sinful nature of [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. As in his earlier works, Anselm instead held that [[Adam]]'s sin was borne by his descendants through the change in human nature which occurred during the Fall. Parents were unable to establish a just nature in their children which they had never had themselves.{{sfnp|Janaro|2006|p=52}} This would subsequently be addressed in Mary's case by dogma surrounding the circumstances of her own birth.

{{lang|la|De Processione Spiritus Sancti Contra Graecos}} ("On the Procession of the Holy Spirit Against the Greeks"),{{sfnp|Forshall|1840|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvNfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA74 74]}} written in 1102,{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} is a recapitulation of Anselm's treatment of the subject at the [[Council of Bari]].{{sfnp|Fortescue|1907|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gu5d7_bByvIC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}} He discussed the Trinity first by stating that human beings could not know God from Himself but only from analogy. The analogy that he used was the self-consciousness of man. The peculiar double-nature of consciousness, memory, and intelligence represent the relation of the Father to the Son. The mutual love of these two (memory and intelligence), proceeding from the relation they hold to one another, symbolizes the Holy Spirit.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}

{{lang|la|De Concordia Praescientiae et Praedestinationis et Gratiae Dei cum Libero Arbitrio}} ("On the Harmony of Foreknowledge and Predestination and the Grace of God with Free Choice") was written from 1107 to 1108.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} Like the {{lang|la|De Conceptu Virginali}}, it takes the form of a single narrator in a dialogue, offering presumable objections from the other side.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§3}} Its treatment of free will relies on Anselm's earlier works, but goes into greater detail as to the ways in which there is no actual incompatibility or paradox created by the divine attributes.{{sfnp|Davies &amp; al.|2004|[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}} In its 5th chapter, Anselm reprises his consideration of [[eternity]] from the ''[[#Monologion|Monologion]]''. "Although nothing is there except what is present, it is not the temporal present, like ours, but rather the eternal, within which all times altogether are contained. If in a certain way the present time contains every place and all the things that are in any place, likewise, every time is encompassed in the eternal present, and everything that is in any time."{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''De Concordia'', p.&amp;nbsp;254}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§12}}}} It is an overarching present, all beheld at once by God, thus permitting both his "foreknowledge" and genuine free choice on the part of mankind.{{sfnp|Holland|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3oNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43 43]}}

Fragments survive of the work Anselm left unfinished at his death, which would have been a dialogue concerning certain pairs of opposites, including ability/inability, possibility/impossibility, and necessity/freedom.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§13}} It is thus sometimes cited under the name {{lang|la|De Potestate et Impotentia, Possibilitate et Impossibilitate, Necessitate et Libertate}}.{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} Another work, probably left unfinished by Anselm and subsequently revised and expanded, was {{lang|la|De Humanis Moribus per Similitudines}} ("On Mankind's Morals, Told Through Likenesses") or {{lang|la|De Similitudinibus}} ("On Likenesses").{{sfnp|Dinkova-Bruun|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pA6yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85 85]}} A collection of his sayings ({{lang|la|Dicta Anselmi}}) was compiled, probably by the monk Alexander.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§14}} He also composed prayers to various saints.{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 73]}}

Anselm wrote nearly 500 surviving letters ({{lang|la|Epistolae}}) to clerics, monks, relatives, and others,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=361}} the earliest being those written to the Norman monks who followed Lanfranc to England in 1070.{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 73]}} [[Richard Southern|Southern]] asserts that all of Anselm's letters "even the most intimate" are statements of his religious beliefs, consciously composed so as to be read by many others.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=396}} His long letters to [[Waltram]], [[bishop of Naumburg|bishop]] of [[diocese of Naumburg|Naumberg]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] ({{lang|la|Epistolae ad Walerannum}}) {{lang|la|De Sacrificio Azymi et Fermentati}} ("On Unleavened and Leavened Sacrifice") and {{lang|la|De Sacramentis Ecclesiae}} ("On the Church's Sacraments") were both written between 1106 and 1107 and are sometimes bound as separate books.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=§1}} Although he seldom asked others to pray for him, two of his letters to hermits do so, "evidence of his belief in their spiritual prowess".{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} His letters of guidance—one to Hugh, a hermit near [[Caen]], and two to a community of lay nuns—endorse their lives as a refuge from the difficulties of the political world with which Anselm had to contend.{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}

[[File:Eadmer of Canterbury Writing - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 12th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] of Eadmer composing Anselm's biography]]
Many of Anselm's letters contain passionate expressions of attachment and affection, often addressed "to the beloved lover" ({{lang|la|dilecto dilectori}}). While there is wide agreement that Anselm was personally committed to the monastic ideal of [[celibacy]], some academics such as [[Brian P. McGuire|McGuire]]{{sfnp|McGuire|1985}} and [[John Boswell|Boswell]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|pp=218–219}} have characterized these writings as expressions of a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] inclination.{{sfnp|Doe|2000|p=18}} The general view, expressed by [[Glenn Olsen|Olsen]]{{sfnp|Olsen|1988}} and [[Richard Southern|Southern]], sees the expressions as representing a "wholly spiritual" affection "nourished by an incorporeal ideal".{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=157}}

==Legacy==
Two biographies of Saint Anselm were written shortly after his death by his chaplain and secretary [[Eadmer]] ({{lang|la|Vita et Conversatione Anselmi Cantuariensis}}) and the monk Alexander ({{lang|la|Ex Dictis Beati Anselmi}}).{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§1}} Eadmer also detailed Anselm's struggles with the English monarchs in his history ({{lang|la|Historia Novorum}}). Another was compiled about fifty years later by [[John of Salisbury]] at the behest of [[Thomas Becket]].{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=361}} The historians [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Orderic Vitalis]], and [[Matthew Paris]] all left full accounts of his struggles against the second and third Norman kings.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=361}}

Anselm's students included [[Eadmer]], Alexander, [[Gilbert Crispin]], [[Honorius Augustodunensis]], and [[Anselm of Laon]]. His works were copied and disseminated in his lifetime and exercised an influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], including [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[John Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§2}} His thoughts have guided much subsequent discussion on the procession of the [[Holy Spirit]] and the [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. His work also anticipates much of the later controversies over [[free will]] and [[predestination]].{{sfnp|''CE''|1907}} An extensive debate occurred—primarily among French scholars—in the early 1930s about "nature and possibility" of [[Christian philosophy]], which drew strongly on Anselm's work.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=§2}}

Modern scholarship remains sharply divided over the nature of Anselm's episcopal leadership. Some, including [[Walter Fröhlich|Fröhlich]]{{sfnp|Fröhlich|1990|pp=37–52}} and [[Dom Schmitt|Schmitt]],{{sfnp|Gale|2010}} argue for Anselm's attempts to manage his reputation as a devout scholar and cleric, minimizing the worldly conflicts he found himself forced into.{{sfnp|Gale|2010}} [[Sally Vaughn|Vaughn]]{{sfnp|Vaughn|1987}} and others argue that the "carefully nurtured image of simple holiness and profound thinking" was precisely employed as a tool by an adept, disingenuous political operator,{{sfnp|Gale|2010}} while the traditional view of the pious and reluctant church leader recorded by [[Eadmer]]—one who genuinely "nursed a deep-seated horror of worldly advancement"—is upheld by [[Richard Southern|Southern]]{{sfnp|Southern|1990|pp=459–481}} among others.{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}{{sfnp|Gale|2010}}

Anselm's [[hagiography]] records that, when a child, he had a [[religious experience|miraculous vision]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] on the summit of the [[Becca di Nona]] near his home, with God asking his name, his home, and his quest before sharing bread with him.

{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}
{{Philosophy sidebar}}
'''Buddhist philosophy''' refers to the philosophical investigations and systems of inquiry that developed among various [[Buddhist schools]] in India following the death of the [[Buddha]] and later spread throughout Asia. The Buddhist path combines both philosophical reasoning and meditation.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6"&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist traditions present a multitude of [[Buddhist paths to liberation]], and Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in [[East Asia]] have covered topics as varied as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of time]] in their analysis of these paths.

Early Buddhism was based on [[empirical evidence]] gained by the sense organs (''[[ayatana]]'')&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Buddha seems to have retained a skeptical distance from [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]], refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. A recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the reification of concepts, and the subsequent return to the Buddhist [[Middle Way]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different [[schools of Buddhism]]. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to [[Early Buddhist schools|various schools in early Buddhism]] of [[Abhidharma]], and to the [[Mahayana]] traditions and schools of the [[prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Yogacara]].

==Historical phases of early Buddhist philosophy in India==

Edward Conze splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases. The first phase concerns questions of the original doctrines derived from oral traditions that originated during the life of the Buddha, and are common to all later sects of Buddhism. The second phase concerns Hinayana "scholastic" Buddhism, as evident in the Abhidharma texts beginning in the third century BCE that feature scholastic reworking and schematic classification of material in the sutras. The third phase of development of Indian Buddhist philosophy concerns Mahayana "metaphysical" Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE, which emphasizes monastic life and the path of a bodhisattva. Various elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and world view of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. Buddhist thought in India: Three phases of Buddhist philosophy. Vol. 4. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical orientation==
Philosophy in India was aimed mainly at [[moksha|spiritual liberation]] and had [[soteriology|soteriological]] goals. In his study of [[Mādhyamaka]] Buddhist philosophy in India, Peter Deller Santina writes:&lt;ref&gt;Santina, Peter Della. ''Madhyamaka Schools in India: A Study of the Madhyamaka Philosophy and of the Division of the System into the Prasangika and Svatantrika Schools.'' 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Attention must first of all be drawn to the fact that philosophical systems in India were seldom, if ever, purely speculative or descriptive. Virtually all the great philosophical systems of India: [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitavedānta]], Mādhyamaka and so forth, were preeminently concerned with providing a means to liberation or salvation. It was a tacit assumption with these systems that if their philosophy were correctly understood and assimilated, an [[Nirvana|unconditioned state]] free of suffering and limitation could be achieved. [...] If this fact is overlooked, as often happens as a result of the propensity engendered by formal [[western philosophy|Occidental philosophy]] to consider the philosophical enterprise as a purely descriptive one, the real significance of Indian and Buddhist philosophy will be missed.}}

For the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of the Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis (''pramana'') of the world.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6"/&gt; The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha's teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom and the gradual training also requires that a disciple “investigate” (''upaparikkhati'') and “scrutinize” (''tuleti'') the teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Douglas; Whitaker, Justin; Reading the Buddha as a philosopher, Philosophy east and west, volume 66, April 2016, page 515-538, University of Hawaii Press, http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil551854.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the [[Vīmaṃsaka Sutta]].

==The Buddha and early Buddhism==
{{Main article|Presectarian Buddhism}}
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 13-14.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gautama Buddha surrounded by followers, from an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]

===The Buddha===
Scholarly opinion varies as to whether the Buddha himself was engaged in philosophical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Douglass, and Justin Whitaker. "Reading the Buddha as a Philosopher." Philosophy East and West 66, no. 2 (2016): 515-538.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddha]] (circa 5th century BC) was a north Indian [[sramana]] from [[Magadha]]. He cultivated various yogic techniques and ascetic practices and taught throughout north India, where his teachings took hold. These teachings are preserved in the Pali [[Nikayas]] and in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections. Dating these texts is difficult, and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha's teachings are about attaining the highest good of nirvana, they also contain an analysis of the source of human suffering, the nature of [[personal identity]], and the process of acquiring knowledge about the world.

===The Middle Way===
{{Main|Middle Way}}
The Buddha defined his teaching as "the middle way". In the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]], this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of [[asceticism]] and bodily denial (as practiced by the [[Jains]] and other [[sramana]]s) and sensual [[hedonism]] or indulgence. Many sramanas of the Buddha's time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as fasting, to liberate the mind from the body. The Buddha however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Buddhism's main concern is not with luxury or poverty, but instead with the human response to circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald K. Ethics, wealth, and salvation: A study in Buddhist social ethics. Edited by Russell F. Sizemore. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1990. (from the introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic teachings===
{{Main|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}

Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2002, page 34 and table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Middle Way]]
* [[Four Noble Truths|The four noble truths]]
* [[Noble Eightfold Path|The Noble Eightfold Path]]
* [[Three marks of existence]] (impermanence, unease, not-self)
* [[Skandha|Five aggregates]]
* [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent arising]]
* [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]
* [[Nirvana]]

Critical studies by Schmithausen, Vetter, Bronkhorst, Gombrich and others have adjusted this list of basic teachings, and revealed a more nuanced genesis of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way".{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Vetter argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' constituted the original "liberating practice",{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=58}} while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}}

According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Lambert Schmithausen concluded that the four truths were a later development in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Carol Anderson, following Lambert Schmithausen and K.R. Norman, notes that the four truths are missing in critical passages in the canon,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=viii}} and states:
{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}

According to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to ''reject'' more than on what doctrines to ''accept''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See for example Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary on the Mulapariyaya Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html].}} Only knowledge that is useful in achieving [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.

===The noble truths and causation===
{{Main|Four Noble Truths}}
The four noble truths or "truths of the noble one" are a central feature of the teachings and are put forth in the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]. The first truth of [[Dukkha]], often translated as ''suffering'', is the inherent unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly 'craving' ([[tanha]]) and ignorance ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]). The third truth is then the fact that if you let go of craving and remove ignorance through knowledge, dukkha ceases ([[nirodha]]). The fourth is the [[Eightfold Path|eightfold path]] which are eight practices that end suffering, they are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right [[mindfulness]] and right [[samadhi]] (mental unification, meditation). The goal taught by the Buddha, [[nirvana]], literally means 'extinguishing' and signified "the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power [[samsara]]".&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2011, page 48"&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana also means that after an enlightened being's death, there is no further rebirth. In early Buddhism, the concept of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]] was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Eviatar. "Early meanings of dependent-origination." Journal of Indian Philosophy 36, no. 2 (2008): 297-317.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time, are considered to be static or independent. Craving, for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations. Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha's causal theory is simply descriptive: ‘This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.’ This understanding of causation as 'impersonal lawlike causal ordering' is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2011, page 48"/&gt;

The removal of suffering then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality ([[prajña]]). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require [[meditation]], paired with understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddha, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly see the nature of reality, which is said to have the marks of suffering, impermanence and not-self. Understanding and meditation are said to work together to 'clearly see' ([[vipassana]]) the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.

===Anatta===
{{PancaKhandha}}
{{main article|Anatta}}
The Buddha argued that [[anatta|there is no permanent self]], no 'essence of a person' or 'what makes me, me'. This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, it means that there is no individual "part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time".&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33"&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This is in opposition to the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] concept of an unchanging [[Atman (Hinduism)|ultimate self]] and any view of an eternal [[soul]]. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering, and the main obstacle to [[Moksha|liberation]].

The most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates that make up a person and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

#All psycho-physical processes ([[skandhas]]) are impermanent.
#If there were a self it would be permanent.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.] 
::∴ There is no self.

This argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33"/&gt;

This argument is famously expounded in the [[Anattalakkhana Sutta]]. According to this argument, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the [[skandhas|temporary aggregates]], the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view a 'person' is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, an 'individual' is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences just like a [[chariot]] is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is [[empiricist]], for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for 'non-self', the 'argument from lack of control'&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Panjvani, Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the 'executive function' of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the Indian 'Anti Reflexivity Principle' which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so, the Buddha uses this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, "Buddha", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/buddha/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

#If the self existed it would be the part of the person that performs the executive function, the "controller."
#The self could never desire that it be changed (anti-reflexivity principle).
#Each of the five kinds of psycho-physical element is such that one can desire that it be changed.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.]
::∴ There is no self.

This argument then denies that there is one permanent "controller" in the person. Instead it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:

"What the Buddhist has in mind is that on one occasion one part of the person might perform the executive function, on another occasion another part might do so. This would make it possible for every part to be subject to control without there being any part that always fills the role of controller (and so is the self). On some occasions a given part might fall on the controller side, while on other occasions it might fall on the side of the controlled. This would explain how it's possible for us to seek to change any of the skandhas while there is nothing more to us than just those skandhas."&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[K.R. Norman]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], the Buddha extended his [[anatta]] critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] that the Self (Atman) was indeed the whole world, or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Gombrich; Recovering the Buddha's Message © The Buddhist Forum, Vol I, Seminar Papers 1987-1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, KR; A note on Attā in the Alagaddūpama Sutta – 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown by the Alagaddūpama-sutta, where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the Self cannot be the whole world. {{refn|group=lower-alpha|MN 22, Alagaddupama Sutta, "Bhikkhus, what do you think? If people carried off the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Jeta Grove, or burned them, or did what they liked with them, would you think: ‘People are carrying us off or burning us or doing what they like with us’?”—“No, venerable sir. Why not? Because that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self." [https://suttacentral.net/en/mn22/69-70].}} In this sutta (as well as in the Soattā Sutta) the Buddha outlines six wrong views about Self:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are six wrong views: An unwise, untrained person may think of the body, ‘This is mine, this is me, this is my self’; he may think that of feelings; of perceptions; of volitions; or of what has been seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought or considered by the mind. The sixth is to identify the world and self, to believe: ‘At death I shall become permanent, eternal, unchanging, and so remain forever the same; and that is mine, that is me, that is my self.’ A wise and well-trained person sees that all these positions are wrong, and so he is not worried about something that does not exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Buddha argues that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the Self. The idea that "this cosmos is the self" is one of the [[View (Buddhism)|views]] rejected by the Buddha &lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], MN 22 PTS: M i 130 Alagaddupama Sutta: The Water-Snake Simile, 2004, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; along with the related [[Monism|Monistic]] theory that held that "everything is a Oneness" (SN 12.48 Lokayatika Sutta).&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], SN 12.48 PTS: S ii 77 CDB i 584 Lokayatika Sutta: The Cosmologist, 1999;  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.048.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of not-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance about the true nature of personality led to further suffering.

===Epistemology===
{{See also|Epistemology}}

All schools of [[Indian philosophy]] recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or ''[[pramana|pramāṇa]]'' and many see the [[Vedas]] as providing access to truth. The Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of having a proper understanding of reality ('right view').&lt;ref&gt;BOdhi; The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, page 117; AN 1.307 “Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of
which unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase
and expand so much as right view.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Buddha's epistemic project is different than that of modern philosophy, it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.

The Buddha's epistemology has been compared to [[empiricism]], in the sense that it was based on experience of the world through the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields ([[ayatanas]]) was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some suttas go further, stating that "the All", or everything that exists (''sabbam''), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, Sabba Sutta) &lt;ref&gt;D. J. Kalupahana, A Buddhist tract on empiricism, https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/80-300/kalupahana1969.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and that anyone who attempts to describe another "All" will be unable to do so because "it lies beyond range".&lt;ref&gt;SN 35.23 PTS: S iv 15 CDB ii 1140
Sabba Sutta: The All, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu © 2001, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html&lt;/ref&gt; This sutta seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or [[noumena]], are beyond our epistemological reach (''avisaya'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Sue. 2000. Early Buddhism: a New Approach: the I of the Beholder. Richmond, Surrey:
Curzon&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in the [[Kalama sutta]] the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one's beliefs is verification in one’s own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from personal authority, sacred tradition (''anussava'') or any kind of [[rationalism]] which constructs metaphysical theories (''takka'').&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 177; 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of [[Brahman]]. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN.I.265):

::"Monks, do you only speak that which is known by yourselves seen by yourselves, found by yourselves?" 
::"Yes, we do, sir." 
::"Good, monks, That is how you have been instructed by me in this timeless doctrine which can be realized and verified, that leads to the goal and can be understood by those who are intelligent."

Furthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the "Discourse to Prince Abhaya" (MN.I.392–4) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or 'what works' has been called by scholars such as [[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Mrs Rhys Davids]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|Vallée-Poussin]] a form of [[Pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] argues the Buddha's epistemology can also be taken to be a form of [[correspondence theory]] (as per the 'Apannaka Sutta') with elements of [[Coherentism]] &lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 352-353.&lt;/ref&gt; and that for the Buddha, it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to cessation of suffering and evil.

The Buddha discouraged his followers from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the goal of awakening. Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the [[Pali Canon|scriptures]], during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[The unanswered questions|questions]] which he regarded as the basis for "unwise reflection". These 'unanswered questions' (avyākata) regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]], the complete inexistence of a person after [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and death, and others. The Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable ([[Acinteyya]]) issues led to "a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views" (Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta).

One explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic [[Epoché]] is that such questions distract from activity that is practical to realizing [[bodhi|enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 72 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997)]. For further discussion of the context in which these statements was made, see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt; and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the Dharma is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the 'Parable of the raft' and the [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma is a like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana ("for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto", MN 22) once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that, the particulars of how one was [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|injured by a poisoned arrow]] (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense the Buddha was often called 'the great physician' because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, it is still clear that resisting (even, refuting) a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha's confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn't be disparaged by buddhists.

After the Buddha's death, some Buddhists such as [[Dharmakirti]] went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Theravada|Theravāda]] commentary, ascribed to [[Dhammapala]], on the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettipakaraṇa]]'', says (Pāli ''pamāṇa'' is equivalent to Sanskrit ''pramāṇa''): "''na hi pāḷito aññaṃ pamāṇataraṃ atthi'' (quoted in [[Pāli Text Society]] edition of the Nettipakaraṇa, 1902, page XI) which Nanamoli translates as: "for there is no other criterion beyond a text" (''The Guide'', Pāli Text Society, 1962, page xi).}})

===Transcendence===
Another possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in [[metaphysics]] is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' inadequate to explain it.&lt;ref name="Nagao"&gt;Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate [[misology]] or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened.&lt;ref name="Nagao"/&gt; Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on imagining direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in yogic meditation.

The Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of "truth") as "beyond reasoning" or "transcending logic", in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going "beyond reasoning" means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside the system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism''. Routledge, 2000, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meta-ethics===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
The Buddha's ethics are based on the [[soteriological]] need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of [[karma]]. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to [[virtue ethics]] (this approach began with Damien Keown).&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Keown writes that Buddhist [[Nirvana]] is analogous to the Aristotelian [[Eudaimonia]], and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.

The Buddha outlined [[five precepts]] (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.

First, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result (and vice versa). Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However the important word here is ''intentionally'', for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the [[Jains]] who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls ‘an ethicised consciousness’.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha; intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful (''akusala'') in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.

The third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of "my" suffering and someone else's. Instead an enlightened person would just work to end suffering ''tout court'', without thinking of the conventional concept of persons.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.

==Abhidharma==
[[File:Buddhaghosa_with_three_copies_of_Visuddhimagga.jpg|thumbnail|[[Buddhaghosa]] (c. 5th century), the most important Abhidharma scholar of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, presenting three copies of the [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main article|Abhidharma}}
The main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed ''[[Abhidharma]]'' which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called "''[[Abhidharma#The dharma theory|dharmas]]''". Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharmic schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[process philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Nyanaponika page 35"&gt;Nyanaponika, Abhidhamma studies, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist metaphysics&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of ''dharmas'', or phenomenal events, but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream, everything else is merely conceptual (''paññatti'') and nominal.

This view has been termed "[[Mereology|mereological]] reductionism" by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.), "disappear under analysis" and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the [[Nyaya]] school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]].&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Some Abhidharmikas such as the [[Prajñaptivāda]] were also strict [[nominalists]], and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.

===Competing Abhidharma schools===
An important Abhidhamma work from the [[Theravāda]] school is the [[Kathāvatthu]] ("Points of controversy"), by the scholar-monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] (ca.327–247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that 'all exists' (sarvāstivāda), the theory of momentariness (khāṇavāda) and the personalist view ([[pudgalavada]])&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David page 128"&gt;Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the major philosophical theories which divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India. After being brought to [[Sri Lanka]] in the first century BCE, the Theravada Pali language Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of [[Buddhaghosa]] (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the [[Theravada]] school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of [[Atthakatha]], commentaries (as well as [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]) on the Pali Abhidhamma, but also included short summaries and compendiums.

The [[Sarvāstivāda]] was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katyāyāniputra (the compiler of the [[Mahavibhasa]], a central text of the school) eventually refined this system into a robust [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which also included a type of [[essentialism]]. This realism was based on a quality of dharmas, which was called [[svabhava]] or 'intrinsic existence'.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David; A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Svabhava is a sort of [[essence]], though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarvāstivāda system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] with regards to time, hence the name of their school means "the view that everything exists".&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David page 128"/&gt;

Other Buddhist schools such as the Prajñaptivadins ('nominalists'), the Purvasailas and the Vainasikas refused to accept the concept of [[svabhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources&lt;/ref&gt; The main topic of the [[Tattvasiddhi]] Śāstra by Harivarman (3-4th century AD), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravādins and other schools such as the [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]] attacked the realism of the Sarvāstivādins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar [[Vasubandhu]], an ex-Sarvāstivādin, who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for [[philosophical presentism]] in his comprehensive treatise, the [[Abhidharmakosa]]. This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Theravāda also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also [[Philosophical presentism|presentists]].&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2011, page 124"&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādin presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarvāstivādin view, but is more of a phenomenology&lt;ref name="Nyanaponika page 35"/&gt; and hence the concept of svabhava for the Theravādins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. According to [[Y Karunadasa]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Pali tradition it is only for the sake of definition and description that each dhamma is postulated as if it were a separate entity; but in reality it is by no means a solitary phenomenon having an existence of its own...If this Abhidhammic view of existence, as seen from its doctrine of dhammas, cannot be interpreted as a radical pluralism, neither can it be interpreted as an out-and-out monism. For what are called dhammas -- the component factors of the universe, both within us and outside us -- are not fractions of an absolute unity but a multiplicity of co-ordinate factors. They are not reducible to, nor do they emerge from, a single reality, the fundamental postulate of monistic metaphysics. If they are to be interpreted as phenomena, this should be done with the proviso that they are phenomena with no corresponding [[noumena]], no hidden underlying ground. For they are not manifestations of some mysterious metaphysical substratum, but processes taking place due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Y. Karunadasa, THE DHAMMA THEORY, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important theory held by some Sarvāstivādins, Theravādins and Sautrāntikas was the theory of "momentariness" (Skt., kṣāṇavāda, Pali, khāṇavāda). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment (''ksana'') after they arise. The Sarvāstivādins saw these 'moments' in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the [[Sarvāstivāda]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, "Abhidharma", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Khaṇikakathā of the [[Kathavatthu]] which attempts to refute the doctrine that "all phenomena (dhamma) are
as momentary as a single mental entity."&lt;ref&gt;Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However momentariness was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Theravādins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar [[Buddhagosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

All Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of [[perception]]. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred [[representationalism]] and held that we only perceive objects indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, "Abhidharma", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The major argument used for this view by the Sautrāntikas was the "time lag argument." According to Mark Siderits: "The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can't be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists."&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.

One major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the [[Pudgalavadin]] or 'personalist' schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of 'personhood' in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2011, page 124"/&gt; This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (prajñapti) and only conventionally real.

==Indian Mahāyāna philosophy==
From about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called [[Mahāyāna]] (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery-university complexes such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramasila]], which became centres of learning in North India. Mahāyāna philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma while at the same time critiquing them and introducing new concepts and ideas. Since the Mahāyāna held to the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic concept of truth]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1989, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally "true" in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, the new theories and practices were seen as 'skillful means' ([[Upaya]]). The Mahayana also promoted the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal, which included an attitude of compassion for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in [[samsara]] (the cycle of birth and death) to benefit all other beings who are suffering.

Major Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the [[Prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Tathagatagarbha]], the Epistemological school of Dignaga, [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Tiantai]] and the Chan/[[Zen]] schools.

===Prajñāpāramitā and Madhyamaka===
[[File:Nagardjuna.jpg|thumb|Nagarjuna, protected by the [[Nāga|Nagas]] snake spirits who are said to be the guardians of the Prajnaparamita sutras.]]
The earliest [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā-sutras]] (1st century BC) emphasize the emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) of phenomena or dhammas. The 'perfection of insight' (Prajñāpāramitā) is said to be true knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is illusory and empty of essence. The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states that: 
{{quote|All conditioned phenomena&lt;br&gt;
 Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow,&lt;br&gt;
 Like dew or a flash of lightning;&lt;br&gt;

The ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' famously affirms the emptiness or voidness ([[shunyata]]) of phenomena:
{{quote|"Oh, Sariputra, Form Does not Differ From the Void,&lt;br&gt;
And the Void Does Not Differ From Form.&lt;br&gt;
Form is Void and Void is Form;&lt;br&gt;
The Same is True For Feelings,&lt;br&gt;
Perceptions, Volitions and Consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Prajñāpāramitā teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. AD 150 – c. 250) and the [[Madhyamaka]] (Middle way) school. Nāgārjuna was one of the most influential Indian Buddhist thinkers; he gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of [[phenomena]] and attacked the Sarvāstivāda and Pudgalavada schools' essentialism in his magnum opus, ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way]]'' (''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'', Nagarjuna relies on [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments to refute various theories which assume an inherent [[essence]] or "own being" ([[svabhava]]). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarjuna]] asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, [[dependent origination]], selflessness (''[[anatta]]''), and emptiness (''[[śūnyatā]]''). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of any substantial being (''anatta'') underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as emptiness (''śūnyatā''), or emptiness of a nature or essence (''[[svabhāva]] sunyam'').

Later philosophers of the Madhyamaka school built upon Nagarjuna's analysis and defended Madhyamaka against their opponents. These included [[Āryadeva]] (3rd century CE), Nāgārjuna's pupil; [[Candrakīrti]] (600–c. 650), who wrote an important commentary on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā; and [[Shantideva]] (8th century). [[Buddhapālita]] (470–550) has been understood as the originator of the 'prāsaṅgika' approach which is based on critiquing essentialism only through ''reductio ad absurdum'' arguments. He was criticized by [[Bhāvaviveka]] (c. 500 – c. 578), who argued for the use of syllogisms "to set one's own doctrinal stance". These two approaches were later termed the Prāsaṅgika and the Svātantrika approaches to Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Influenced by the work of [[Dignaga]], [[Bhāvaviveka]]'s Madhyamika philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. [[Candrakīrti]] on the other hand, critiqued Bhāvaviveka's adoption of the epistemological (''[[pramana]]'') tradition on the grounds that it contained a subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna's famous statement in the ''Vigrahavyavartani'' which says "I have no thesis" for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; [[Candrakīrti]] held that a true Madhyamika could only use "consequence" (''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]'') in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponents position without asserting an "autonomous inference" (''[[Svatantrika|svatantra]]''), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.

In China, the Madhyamaka school (known as [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sānlùn]]) was founded by [[Kumārajīva]] (344–413 CE) who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include [[Kumārajīva]] 's pupil [[Sengzhao]], [[Jizang]] (549–623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka and [[Hyegwan]], a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.

===Yogācāra===
{{main article|Yogācāra}}
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumbnail|[[Vasubandhu]]  wrote in defense of Vijñapti-matra (appearance only) as well as writing a massive work on [[Abhidharma]], the [[Abhidharmakosa]].]]
The [[Yogācāra|Yogācāra school]] (''Yoga practice'') was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 147"&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 147&lt;/ref&gt; and with various sutras such as the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. The central feature of Yogācāra thought is the concept of ''Vijñapti-mātra'', often translated as "impressions only" or "appearance only" and this has been interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]] or as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]. Other names for the Yogacara school are 'Vijñanavada' (the doctrine of consciousness) and 'Cittamatra' (mind-only).&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 147"/&gt;

Yogacara thinkers like  [[Vasubandhu]] argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu's ''Vijnaptimatratasiddhi'', or 'The Proof that There Are Only Impressions' (20 verses) begins thus:

"I. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, 
Just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like." &lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 149"&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 149&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vasubandhu]] then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something "out there" when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the [[dream argument]] to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 149"/&gt; The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be intersubjective is proved by the event of a [[wet dream]] and by the mass or shared [[hallucinations]] created by the karma of certain types of beings.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 156&lt;/ref&gt;

After having argued that impressions only is a theory which can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to [[wikt:Parsimony|parsimony]] - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 158"&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 158&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various mental streams and their [[karma]], and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the 'internal' sense of self as observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator Sthiramati explains this thus:

"There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is no thing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer."&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of [[Buddhist atomism]] and the Abhidharma theory of [[svabhava]]. He argued that atoms as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities) would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark pp 158"/&gt;

Later Yogacara thinkers include [[Dharmapala of Nalanda]], [[Sthiramati]], [[Chandragomin]] (who debated Candrakirti), and [[Śīlabhadra]]. Yogacarins such as [[Paramartha]] and [[Guṇabhadra]] brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as [[East Asian Yogācāra|Wéishí-zōng or Fǎxiàng-zōng]]. As an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra is [[Xuanzang]]'s ''Cheng Weishi Lun'', or "Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.

===Yogācāra-Mādhyamika synthesis===
[[Jñānagarbha]] (8th century) and his student [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) brought together Yogacara, Madhyamaka and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the ''Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Mādhyamika''. Śāntarakṣita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet which was conducted at Samye. [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s disciples included [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] and [[Kamalaśīla]]. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought.

===Tathagatagarbha===
{{main article|Tathagatagarbha}}

The ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgathagarbha sutras]]'', in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that the potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) philosophical trend within Buddhism to a decidedly more [[cataphatic]] (positive) modus.

Prior to the period of these scriptures, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the ''tathāgatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism.

In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174–192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "self" (''atman'') is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the "true self" is described as the perfection of the wisdom of [[anatta|not-self]] in the ''Buddha-Nature Treatise'', for example.&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp" /&gt; Language that had previously been used by essentialist non-Buddhist philosophers was now adopted, with new definitions, by Buddhists to promote orthodox teachings.

The ''tathāgatagarbha'' does not, according to some scholars, represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of [[sunyata|emptiness]] and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha'' is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174–192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgathagarbha]]'', the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] doctrine of ''[[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]]'', and the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] [[store consciousness]] were all identified at some point with the [[luminous mind]] of the Nikāyas.

In the Mahayana ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]'', the Buddha insists that while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from liberation and the [[Buddha-nature]].

==The Dignāga school of Pramāṇa==
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|180 × 240px|thumbnail|Dignāga in formal debating stance]]
{{main article|Buddhist logico-epistemology}}
[[Dignāga]] (c. 480–540) and [[Dharmakīrti]] (c. 6-7th century) were Buddhist philosophers who developed a system of epistemology ([[Pramāṇa]]) and [[Buddhist logic|logic]] in their debates with the Brahminical philosophers in order to defend Buddhist doctrine. This tradition is called “those who follow reasoning” (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pramāṇavāda', or “the Epistemological School.”&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, Tom, "Dharmakīrti", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dharmakiirti/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They were associated with the [[Yogacara]] and [[Sautrantika]] schools, and defended theories held by both of these schools.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, page 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; Dignaga's influence was profound and led to an “epistemological turn” among all Buddhist and also all Sanskrit philosophers in India after his death. In the centuries following Dignaga's work, Sanskrit philosophers became much more focused on defending all of their propositions with fully developed theories of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil. Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India: Jnanasrimitra on Exclusion. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "School of Dignāga" includes later philosophers and commentators like Santabhadra, [[Dharmottara]] (8th century), [[Jñanasrimitra]] (975–1025), [[Ratnakīrti]] (11th century) and Samkarananda. 
The [[epistemology]] they developed defends the view that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (''pramāṇa''); "perception" ([[Pramana#Hinduism|pratyaksa]]) and "inference" ([[anumāṇa]]). Perception is a non-conceptual awareness of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/ Dharmakirti], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

These Buddhist philosophers argued in favor of the theory of momentariness, the Yogacara "awareness only" view, the reality of particulars (svalakṣaṇa), atomism, nominalism and the self-reflexive nature of consciousness ([[svasaṃvedana]]). They attacked Hindu theories of God, universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul (''atman'').

==Tantra==
The tradition associated with a group of texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]], known as [[Vajrayana]], developed by the eighth century in North India. By this time Tantra was a key feature of Indian Buddhism, and Indian Tantric scholars developed philosophical defenses, [[hermeneutics]] and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the [[Guhyasamāja Tantra]] and the [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]].

While the view of the Vajrayana was based on [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara]] and [[Buddha-nature]] theories,&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125.&lt;/ref&gt; it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods ([[upaya]]) of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret [[mantras]], alcohol, [[Karmamudrā|sexual yoga]], complex visualizations of [[mandalas]] filled with [[wrathful deities]] and other practices and injunctions which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist thought. The Guhyasamāja Tantra for example, states "you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women".&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, Charles S. Prebish (editors) Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Guhyasamaja tantra and Guhyagarbha tantra&lt;/ref&gt; Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bibhuti Baruah; Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism, pp. 154-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense of these practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting, the [[Hevajra tantra]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the [[Vimalaprabha]] of Pundarika (a commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra) is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice. For example, in the Vimalaprabha, "killing living beings" refers to stopping the [[prana]] at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti's ''Pradipoddyotana'', a commentary to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, killing living beings is glossed as "making them void" by means of a "special [[samadhi]]" which according to Bus-ton is associated with [[completion stage]] tantric practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald (editor); Buddhist Hermeneutics, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation ([[nirvana]]) and [[Buddhahood]] is not seen as something outside or an event in the future, but as imminently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like [[deity yoga]], and hence Vajrayana is also called the "resultant vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in "A companion to Buddhist philosophy", page 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajrayana as a form of [[pantheism]], by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in "A companion to Buddhist philosophy", page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as [[Buddhaguhya]], Padmavajra (author of the ''Guhyasiddhi''), Nagarjuna (7th century disciple of [[Saraha]]), [[Indrabhuti]] (author of the ''Jñānasiddhi''), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, [[Ratnākaraśānti]] and [[Abhayakaragupta]] wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (ed.), Davidson (ed.); Tibetan Buddhism: Reason and Revelation, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, Benoytosh; An Introduction to Buddhist Esoterism, pp. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Śubhakarasiṃha]] brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as [[Yi Xing]] and [[Kūkai]]. In [[Tibet]], philosophers such as [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-28 – 1251), [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364) and [[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Tibetan.

==Tibetan Buddhist philosophy==
{{main article|Tibetan Buddhism}}
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian traditions of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and the Dignaga-Dharmakīrti school of epistemology or "reliable cognition" (Sanskrit: ''Pramana'', Tib. ''tshad ma''). The initial efforts of [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]] brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet. Other influences include Buddhist Tantras and the Buddha nature texts.

The initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries, this initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of [[Dharmakirti]] and these include Ngok Lo-dza-wa (1059-1109) and Cha-ba (1182-1251). Their works are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of [[Chandrakirti]], the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa]], Kanakavarman&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald; A study of Svatantrika, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the [[prasangika]] and [[svatantrika]] views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Kamalaśīla]] and their defenders, reason is useful is establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness, then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual [[gnosis]] that does not rely on reason. For Chandrakirti however, this is wrong, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason's role here is to negate any essence or essentialist views, and then eventually negate itself along with any [[Conceptual proliferation]].&lt;ref name="Garfield, Jay p. 217"&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the [[Sakya]] school holds a mostly [[anti-realist]] philosophical position, while the [[Gelug]] school tends to defend a form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. The [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).&lt;ref name="Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2"&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shengtong and Buddha nature===
The 14th century saw increasing interest in the [[Buddha nature]] texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284-1339), especially his treatise "Profound Inner Meaning".&lt;ref name="Garfield, Jay p. 256"&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise describes ultimate nature or [[suchness]] as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Jay p. 256"/&gt;

[[Dolpopa]] (''Dol-bo-ba'', 1292–1361), founder of the [[Jonang]] school, developed a view called [[shentong]] (Wylie: gzhan {{nat|stong}}) (other empty), which is closely tied to [[Yogacara]] and Buddha-nature theories. This view holds that the qualities of Buddhahood or [[Buddha nature]] are already present in the mind, and that it is empty of all conventional reality which occludes its own nature as Buddhahood or [[Dharmakaya]]. According to Dolpopa all beings are said to have Buddha nature which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. Dolpopa's shentong view taught that ultimate reality was truly a "Great Self" or "Supreme Self" referring to works such as the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]].''&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, ''Mountain Doctrine'', 2006 passim&lt;/ref&gt; This view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] thinkers and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar [[Tāranātha]] (1575–1634).

In the late 17th century the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the [[5th Dalai Lama]], who converted the majority of their monasteries in [[Tibet]] to the [[Gelug]] order, although several survived in secret.&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dolpo : a study of the life and thought of the Tibetan master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120818330}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gelug===
[[File:Tsongkapa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Tsongkapa, 15th-century painting, [[Rubin Museum of Art]] ]]
[[Je Tsongkhapa]] (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357–1419) founded the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism which came to dominate the country through the office of the [[Dalai Lama]] and is the major defender of the [[Prasaṅgika]] Madhyamaka view, his work is influenced by the philosophy of [[Candrakirti]] and [[Dharmakirti]]. Tsongkhapa's magnum opus is ''The Ocean of Reasoning'', a Commentary on Nagarjuna’s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]]. Gelug philosophy is based upon study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa's works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).

Tsongkhapa defended Prasangika [[Madhyamaka]] as the highest view and critiqued the [[Svatantrika]]. Tsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the [[Shunyata|emptiness]] of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization.&lt;ref&gt;Shantarakshita and Ju Mipham (2005) The Adornment of the Middle Way Padmakara Translation, pp. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Jay p. 217"/&gt; Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of [[svabhava]] or own essence) which could lead to Absolutism and over-negation which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa's solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the [[two truths]] framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism &lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; while holding that from the view of ultimate truth (''paramarthika satya''), all things (including [[Buddha nature]] and [[Nirvana]]) are empty of inherent existence ([[svabhava]]) and true enlightenment is this realization of emptiness.

Sakya scholars such as Rongtön and [[Gorampa]] disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa's realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa's students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars' anti-realism.

[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251) was a 13th-century head of the [[Sakya]] school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'' (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' (''Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter'') set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2"/&gt; Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden enlightenment which was held by some teachers of the "Chinese Great Perfection" in Tibet.

Later Sakyas such as [[Gorampa]] (1429–1489) and [[Sakya Chokden]] (1428–1507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. [[Sakya Chokden]] also critiqued Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his ''Definite ascertainment of the middle way'', Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver [ed.]; Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy; Sakya Chokden&lt;/ref&gt; Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, SK. The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga, SUNY pres, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.

===Nyingma and Rimé===
[[File:MiphamNew.jpg|thumb|Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.]]
The Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of [[Dzogchen]] (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364) was a major philosopher of the [[Nyingma]] school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of [[Dzogchen]] and on Buddhist [[Tantra]]. These include the ''[[Seven Treasuries|Seven Treasures]]'', the ''[[Trilogy of Natural Ease]]'', and his ''[[Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness]]''. Longchenpa's works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions.&lt;ref&gt;D. Germano, The Tantric Philosophical Prose and Poetry of Longchenpa, Religion and the Literary in Tibet, AAR, November 7, 2012, https://tiblit.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/germano_aartiblit2012_combined.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous clarity, [[rigpa]], or [[Buddha nature]] and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and [[tantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas, Jamgon Mipam his life and teachings, pp 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Longchenpa's philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the "Ground" (''gzhi''), the immanent Buddha nature, "the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present" which is "free from all elaborated extremes".&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw the rise of the [[Rimé movement]] (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school's criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and [[Bon]] philosophical views and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813-1899) were the founders of Rimé. The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I&gt;Callahan, Elizabeth (2007). ''The Treasury of Knowledge: Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy''. Introduction, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement was "a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned."&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; Philosophically, [[Jamgön Kongtrül]] defended [[Shentong]] as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rimé scholar [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846–1912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a [[Nyingma]] perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung 'jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of ''rangtong'' (self emptiness).&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894–1959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their "object of negation"; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] was also influenced by this eclectic approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation – 14th Dalai Lama&lt;ref&gt;The 14th Dalai Lama, Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==East Asian Buddhism==
[[File:Sramana Zhiyi.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Painting of Śramaṇa [[Zhiyi]] of the Tiantai school.]]

===Tiantai===

{{main article|Tiantai}}

The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by [[Zhiyi]] (538–597),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JeeLoo Liu, Tian-tai Metaphysics vs. Hua-yan Metaphysics A Comparative Study&lt;/ref&gt; was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. The doctrine of Tiantai was based on the [[ekayana]] or "one vehicle" doctrine taught in the [[Lotus sutra]] and sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings and texts into a comprehensively inclusive hierarchical system, which placed the Lotus sutra at the top of this hierarchy.

Tiantai's metaphysics is an immanent [[holism]], which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all “inherently entailed” within each other.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Ziporyn, Brook, "Tiantai Buddhism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/buddhism-tiantai/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Each moment of consciousness is simply the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.

This metaphysics is entailed in the Tiantai teaching of the "three truths" which is an extension of the Mādhyamaka [[two truths]] doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness ([[shunyata]]) and the third truth of 'the exclusive Center' (但中 ''danzhong'') or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and expressed by the claim that nothing is “Neither-Same-Nor-Different” than anything else, but rather each 'thing' is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of 'The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances'(諸法實相 zhufashixiang) and each thought "contains three thousand worlds". This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as "evil is ineradicable from the highest good, [[Buddhahood]]."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are the ultimately the same, as Zhiyi writes "A single, unalloyed reality is all there is – no entities whatever exist outside of it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Though Zhiyi did write "One thought contains three thousand worlds", this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, "The objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning" (The Esoteric Meaning, 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.

Other key figures of Tiantai thought are [[Zhanran]] (711–782) and [[Siming Zhili]] (960–1028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have [[Buddha nature]], since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as [[Tendai]] and was first brought to the island by [[Saicho]].

===Huayan===

[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A 3D rendering of [[Indra's net]].]]
{{main article|Huayan school}}

The [[Huayan school|Huayan]] developed the doctrine of "interpenetration" or "coalescence" (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: ''yuganaddha''),&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Robert C. (1987).[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/neville.htm New metaphysics for eternal experience], Journal of Chinese Philosophy 14, 357-370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/zung_'jug&lt;/ref&gt; based on the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' (Flower Garland sutra), a Mahāyāna scripture. Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[dharmas]]'') are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomena contains every other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as [[Indra's net]]. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.

[[Fazang]] (Fa-tsang, 643–712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote 'Essay on the Golden Lion' and 'Treatise on the Five Teachings', which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a [[House of mirrors]]. Fazang introduced the distinction of "the Realm of Principle" and "the Realm of Things". This theory was further developed by [[Chengguan (monk)|Cheng-guan]] (738–839) into the major Huayan thesis of "the fourfold [[Dharmadhatu]]" (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion, the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion.&lt;ref name="Taigen Dan Leighton 2006"&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton, Huayan Buddhism and the Phenomenal Universe of the Flower Ornament Sutra, "Buddhadharma" magazine (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
While both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to [[idealism]]. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician’s conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that "The triple world is illusory – it is only made by one mind" and Fazang echoes this by writing "outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world "according to their mental patterns", and "these worlds are infinite in kind" and constantly arising and passing away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, in Huayan, mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or "Principle" is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In [[Korea]], this school was known as [[Hwaeom]] and is represented in the work of [[Wonhyo]] (617–686), who also wrote about the idea of [[Essence-Function|essence-function]], a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In [[Japan]], Huayan is known as [[Kegon]] and one of its major proponents was [[Myōe]], who also introduced Tantric practices.

===Chan and Japanese Buddhism===

The philosophy of Chinese [[Chan Buddhism]] and Japanese [[Zen]] is based on various sources, these include Madhyamaka, Yogacara, the [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], Huayan and the Buddha nature texts. An important issue in Chan is that of [[subitism]] or "sudden enlightenment", the idea that enlightenment happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by [[Shenhui]] and is a central issue discussed in the  [[Platform Sutra]], a key Chan scripture composed in China.

Huayan philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the [[Five Ranks]] of [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (806-869), the founder of the [[Caodong]] Chan lineage.&lt;ref name="Taigen Dan Leighton 2006"/&gt; [[Guifeng Zongmi]], who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra. 

[[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] during the 6th and 7th centuries saw an increase in the proliferation of new schools and forms of thought, a period known as the six schools of Nara (''[[Nanto Rokushū]]''). The [[Kamakura period|Kamakura Period]] (1185–1333) also saw another flurry of intellectual activity. During this period, the influential figure of [[Nichiren]] (1222–1282) made the practice and universal message of the [[Lotus Sutra]] more readily available to the population. He is of particular importance in the history of thought and religion as his teachings constitute a separate sect of Buddhism, one of the only major sects to have originated in Japan &lt;ref name="Yampolsky1990"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21035153|title=Selected writings of Nichiren|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=Yampolsky, Philip B.

Also during the Kamakura period, the founder of [[Soto Zen]], [[Dogen]] (1200–1253), wrote many works on the philosophy of Zen, and the [[Shobogenzo]] is his magnum opus. In Korea, [[Chinul]] was an important exponent of Seon Buddhism at around the same time.

===Esoteric Buddhism===

[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]]. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] arrived in China in the 7th century, during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as Mìzōng (密宗), or "Esoteric School"  and ''Zhenyan'' (true word, Sanskrit: [[Mantrayana]]). [[Kūkai]]  (AD774–835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric [[Shingon]] (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under [[Huiguo]], Kūkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.

Kūkai's philosophy is based on the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] and the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]] (both from the seventh century). His ''Benkenmitsu nikkyôron'' (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream [[Mahayana Buddhism]] (kengyô) and esoteric [[Tantric Buddhism]] (mikkyô).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Krummel, John, "Kûkai", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/kukai/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Kūkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bringing the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of Kūkai's thought is the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, which holds there are three "bodies of the Buddha".

According to Kūkai, esoteric Buddhism has the [[Dharmakaya]] (Jpn: ''hosshin'', embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with [[Vairocana]] Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as [[mudras]] and [[mantras]]. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirmankaya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For Kūkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is ''hosshin seppô'' (literally: “the dharmakâya's expounding of the Dharma”) which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In a broad sense, the universe itself a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be "read".

Dainichi means "Great Sun" and Kūkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to enlightenment ([[hongaku]]) and [[Buddha nature]], and that because of this, there is the possibility of "becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence" (''sokushinjôbutsu'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This is achieved because of the [[non-dual]] relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.

Kūkai's exposition of what has been called Shingon's "metaphysics", is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin - body, appearance and function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty ([[Shunyata]]) The physical universe for Shingon, contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such the [[Womb Realm]] mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence reach enlightenment here and now.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[File:Kitaro Nishidain in Feb. 1943.jpg|thumb|170px|Kitarō Nishida, professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the [[Kyoto School]].]]
In [[Sri Lanka]], Buddhist modernists such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864-1933) and the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott]] sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala also argued that Buddhism included a strong social element, interpreting it as liberal, altruistic and democratic. [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] wrote the classic modern account of Buddhist epistemology (''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'', 1963) and his student [[David Kalupahana]] wrote on the history of Buddhist thought and psychology. Other important Sri Lankan Buddhist thinkers include [[Katukurunde Nanananda Thera|Ven Ñāṇananda]] (''Concept and Reality''), [[Walpola Rahula]], [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa]] (''Buddhist Ethics'', 1987), Gunapala Dharmasiri (''A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God'', 1988), [[P. D. Premasiri]] and [[R. G. de S. Wettimuny]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Hoffman, Contemporary Buddhist philosophy: A biographical essay, Asian Philosophy, Vol. 2 No. 1 1992, Pp.79-100, http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/hoffman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century China, the modernist [[Taixu]] (1890-1947) advocated a reform and revival of Buddhism. His promoted an idea of a Buddhist [[Pure Land]], not as a metaphysical place in Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world which could be achieved through a "Buddhism for Human Life" (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was free of supernatural beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bingenheimer&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingenheimer |first=Marcus |editor1-last=Hsu |editor1-first=Mutsu |editor2-last=Chen |editor2-first=Jinhua |editor3-last=Meeks |editor3-first=Lori |title=Development and Practice of Humanitarian Buddhism: Interdisciplinary Perspectives |year=2007|publisher=Tzuchi University Press |location=Hua-lien (Taiwan) |isbn=978-986-7625-08-3 |pages=141–161 |chapter=Some Remarks on the Usage of Renjian Fojiao 人間佛教 and the Contribution of Venerable Yinshun to Chinese Buddhist Modernism|url=http://mbingenheimer.net/publications/bingenheimer.yinshunRenjianFojiao.2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taixu also wrote on the connections between modern science and Buddhism, ultimately holding that “scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it”.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Taixu, [[Yin Shun]] (1906–2005) advocated a form of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] grounded in concern for humanitarian issues and his students and followers have been influential in promoting [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in [[Taiwan]]. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi ([[Yogachara]]), by [[Yang Rensan]] (1837-1911), [[Ouyang Jinwu]] (1871-1943) and [[Liang Shuming]] (1893–1988).&lt;ref&gt;Yih-Hsien Yu, Modern Chinese Philosophy, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tibetan Buddhism's most influential modernist thinkers is [[Gendün Chöphel]]  (1903–1951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr. “was arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Felix [reviewer], "The Madman’s Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendün Chöpel by Donald S. Lopez Jr.", https://www.lionsroar.com/a-modern-man-in-old-tibet/&lt;/ref&gt; Gendün Chöphel traveled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as ''Adornment for Nagarjuna’s Thought''. Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was [[Chögyam Trungpa]], whose [[Shambhala Training]] was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of "secular enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chogyam. (1984) "Shambhala: Sacred Path of the Warrior", pp 25-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southeast Asia]], thinkers such as [[Buddhadasa]], [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] have promoted a philosophy of socially [[Engaged Buddhism]] and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to economic ethics ([[Buddhist economics]]) have been explored in the works of [[E. F. Schumacher]],&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Schumacher, "Buddhist economics" (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]], [[Neville Karunatilake]] and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in [[Myanmar]], where it was developed by monks such as [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].

Japanese Buddhist philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the [[Kyoto School]] which included [[Kitaro Nishida]], [[Keiji Nishitani]], [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Masao Abe]]. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is [[Critical Buddhism]], which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as [[Buddha nature]] and [[Hongaku|original enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Bingenheimer /&gt; In [[Nichiren Buddhism]], the work of [[Daisaku Ikeda]] has also been popular.

The Japanese Zen Buddhist [[D.T. Suzuki]] (1870–1966) was instrumental in bringing [[Zen Buddhism]] to the West and his [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki's worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by [[Romanticism]] and [[Transcendentalism]], which promoted a spiritual freedom as "a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 122&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is [[Gary Snyder]]. The American Theravada Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] has critiqued 'Buddhist Romanticism' in his writings.

Western Buddhist monastics and priests such as [[Nanavira Thera]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Nyanaponika Thera]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], [[Taigen Dan Leighton]], [[Matthieu Ricard]] have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as [[Alan Wallace]], [[James H. Austin]], [[Mark Epstein]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]] have worked and written on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, James H. Zen and the Brain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;14th Dalai Lama, the Universe in a single atom&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of [[Joanna Macy]]. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to [[Secular Buddhism|secularize Buddhism]], as seen in the works of [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]].

In the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of [[Charles A. Moore]] who founded the journal [[Philosophy East and West]]. Contemporary Western Academics such as [[Mark Siderits]], [[Jan Westerhoff]], [[Jonardon Ganeri]], [[Miri Albahari]], [[Owen Flanagan]], [[Damien Keown]], [[Tom Tillemans]], [[David Loy]], [[Evan Thompson]] and [[Jay Garfield]] have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through [[Western philosophy]].

== Comparison with other philosophies ==
{{main article|Buddhism and Western Philosophy}}
[[Baruch Spinoza]], though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered "by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting." The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is [[Nirvana]]. [[David Hume]], after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's [[Bundle theory]] is a very similar concept to the Buddhist ''[[skandhas]]'', though his skepticism about causation lead him to opposite conclusions in other areas. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of [[asceticism]] and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire.

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s "[[language-game]]" closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or [[papañca]] is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist ''[[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. [[Heidegger]]'s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some{{who|date=April 2012}} to be similar to Buddhism today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol1/god_is_dead.html God Is Dead: What Next&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the [[Middle Way]] in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all philosophies are considered non-essential views ([[View (Buddhism)|ditthis]]) and not to be clung to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity''(Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Bally''' ({{IPA-fr|bɑji|lang}}; 4 February 1865, [[Geneva]] – 10 April 1947, Geneva) was a Swiss [[linguistics|linguist]] from the [[Geneva School]]. He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], from [[Switzerland]]. His parents were Jean Gabriel, a teacher, and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. Bally was married three times: first to Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a [[mental institution]] in 1915, and finally with Alice Bellicot. In addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' (co-edited by [[Albert Sechehaye]]), Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics.

From 1883 to 1885 he studied classical languages and [[literature]] in [[Geneva]]. He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. He also worked as [[Privatdozent|PD]] at the university from 1893 to 1913. From 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative [[Indo-European studies]] which he took over from [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].

Besides his works about [[Subject (grammar)|subjecthood]] in the [[French language]] he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes. He was active in [[interlinguistics]], serving as a consultant to the [[International Auxiliary Language Association|research association]] that presented [[Interlingua]] in 1951. Today Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic [[Stylistics (linguistics)|theories of style]] and much honored for his theories of [[phraseology]].&lt;ref&gt;Amacker (1995: 240)&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of modern stylistics he dealt with the expressive function of signs.

==History==
[[Emmenin]], which was an extract of the urine of pregnant women, was the predecessor of Premarin, and [[Progynon]] was a very similar competing product. Both of these products contained conjugated estrogens similarly to Premarin, but the estrogens were human estrogens as opposed to equine estrogens and the composition differed.

===Health effects===
Research starting in 1975 showed substantially increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=New England Journal of Medicine| title=Increased risk of endometrial carcinoma among users of conjugated estrogens |date=4 December 1975 | author=Ziel HK, Finkle WD | volume = 293 | issue=23 | pages=1167–1170 | pmid=171569 | doi=10.1056/NEJM197512042932303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Exogenous estrogen and endometrial carcinoma: case-control and incidence study |date=15 March 1977  |vauthors=McDonald TW, etal | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 127 |issue=6  | pages = 572–580 | pmid=190887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1976 the drug has carried a label warning about the risk.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/business/13drug.html| title=Menopause, as Brought to You by Big Pharma | author=Natasha Singer and Duff Wilson | date=12 December 2009 | publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]], a large-scale [[clinical trial]] of menopausal HRT showed that long-term use of estrogen and a progestin may increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[heart attack]]s, [[blood clot]]s, and breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Brunner&gt;{{cite journal| title=Effects of conjugated equine estrogen on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trial | author=Brunner RL et al; Womens Health Initiative Investigators | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine| volume = 165 | pages = 1976–1986 | pmid=16186467 | date=26 September 2005 | url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/165/17/1976 | issue=17 | doi=10.1001/archinte.165.17.1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these results, Wyeth experienced a significant decline in its sales of Premarin, Prempro (CEEs and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]]), and related products, from over $2 billion in 2002 to just over $1 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Earnings Results for the 2006 Fourth Quarter and Full Year |publisher=Wyeth |url=http://www.wyeth.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/wyeth_xml/home/news/announcements/1170158273391.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
This drug has been the subject of litigation; more than 13,000 people have sued Wyeth between 2002 and 2009. Wyeth and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn prevailed in the vast majority of hormone therapy cases previously set for trial through a combination of rulings by judges, verdicts by juries, and dismissals by plaintiffs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pfizer Statement on Prempro |publisher=Indy News Channel |url=http://www.theindychannel.com/health/21716786/detail.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223141331/http://www.theindychannel.com/health/21716786/detail.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |date=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the company’s losses, two of the jury verdicts were reversed post-trial and others are being challenged on appeal. Wyeth also won five summary judgments on Prempro cases and had 15 cases voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs. The company won dismissals in another 3,000 cases.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 2010"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Bloomberg |title=Pfizer wins trial over claim Prempro caused cancer |date=February 24, 2010 |author=Jef Feeley }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Mary Daniel, in a trial in Philadelphia, was awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages as well as undisclosed punitive damages. As of 2010, Wyeth had won the last four of five cases, most recently in Virginia, finding that they were not responsible for the breast cancer of plaintiff Georgia Torkie-Tork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pfizer properly warned about Prempro risks, jury finds |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-03/pfizer-properly-warned-about-prempro-health-risks-jury-finds.html |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyeth has been quoted as saying "many risk factors associated with breast cancer have been identified, but science cannot establish what role any particular risk factor or combination play in any individual woman's breast cancer." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal Intelligencer: Philadelphia jury returns defense verdict in HRT case, Amaris Elliott Engel |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202444500915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyeth's counsel in the case also noted that in the WHI trial, 99.62% of women took the drug and "did not get breast cancer."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 2010"/&gt;

===Animal welfare===
[[Animal welfare]] groups claim that animal husbandry and urine collection methods used in the production of CEEs cause undue stress and suffering to the [[mare (horse)|mare]]s involved. Animal activists have made claims of abuses ranging from inadequate stall size, long periods of confinement, cumbersome urine collection, and continuous breeding cycles. After reaching advanced age, many of the mares are adopted for recreation use, while some are sent to feed lots for slaughter. Despite the controversy, the USDA called the CEEs HRT industry a model of self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3995076/ns/dateline_nbc/t/hrt-horses/#.VXHYoUYbLpo The HRT horses (NBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek historic writings, '''Damon and Pythias'''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|m|ən|,_|ˈ|p|ɪ|θ|i|ə|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Phintias''';&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|n|t|i|ə|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Δάμων}} (gen.: Δάμωνος), Πυθίας, Φιντίας) is a legend illustrating the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ideal of friendship.  Pythias is accused of and charged with plotting against the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. Pythias requests of Dionysius to be allowed to settle his affairs on the condition that his friend, Damon, be held hostage and, should he, Pythias, not return, be executed in his stead. Eventually, Pythias does return, and the amazed Dionysius, impressed by the love and trust in their friendship, frees him and Damon.

== Greek legend ==
[[File:Damon and Pythias..gif|thumb|Damon and Pythias]]
As told by [[Aristoxenus]], and after him [[Cicero]] (''De Offic.'' 3.45), [[Diodorus Siculus]] (10.4), and others, Pythias and his friend Damon, both followers of the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], traveled to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] during the reign of the tyrannical [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius I]] (r. 405&amp;ndash;367 BC). Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.

Accepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell.  Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released.

Dionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution—but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.

Apologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. 

So astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.

Another version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test—a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Kitty |title=Pythagoras His Lives and the Legacy of a Rational Universe |publisher=Walker |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works based on the legend==
[[File:Damon and Pythias (1914) - 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Still from the film ''Damon and Pythias'' (1914)]]
*In 1564, the material was made into a [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by the English poet [[Richard Edwardes]] (''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'').
*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the [[German language|German]] ballad ''[[Die Bürgschaft]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_B%C3%BCrgschaft Die Bürgschaft – Wikisource]. De.wikisource.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1799 by [[Friedrich Schiller]], based on the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' version. (In this work, Damon is sentenced to death, not Pythias.)
*In 1821, the Irish poet [[John Banim]] wrote a play based on the legend (''Damon and Pythias''). Familiarity with this play led [[Justus H. Rathbone]] to found the fraternal order [[Knights of Pythias]].
*In 1915, the book ''[[The Story of Damon and Pythias]]'' by [[Albert Payson Terhune]] was published. It was "adapted and illustrated from the photo-play conceived and produced by [[Universal Studios|The Universal Film Manufacturing Company]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terhune|first1=Albert Payson|title=The Story of Damon and Pythias|date=1915|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the 1914 film starring [[William Worthington (actor)|William Worthington]] and [[Herbert Rawlinson]]. This book, like the German ballad, casts Damon as the condemned and the one who must return in time to save Pythias.
*The short story "[[Pythias]]" by [[Frederik Pohl]], published in 1955, entwines the mythic elements with modern political and psychokenetic concerns.
*The film ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957) featured characters "Mike Damon" ([[Darren McGavin]], but imagined for [[Dean Martin]]) and "Sidney Pythias" ([[Jerry Lewis]]). As released, the film only vaguely resembled the legend – Pythias avoids jail – but it originated as a testament to the [[Martin &amp; Lewis]] friendship.
*In a 1959 ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' episode, Beaver's father relates the Damon and Pythias story and Beaver donates his homework to friend Larry to prove their friendship.  Larry confesses moments before Beaver loses a week of recesses.
*The 1962 MGM film ''[[Damon and Pythias (film)|Damon and Pythias]]'' remained true to the ancient story; it starred [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] as Damon and Don Burnett as Pythias.
*In Japan, the short story "[[Run, Melos!]]" by [[Osamu Dazai]] and a nursery tale by [[Miekichi Suzuki]] were based on the legend, and in 1992, Toei Company, Ltd. adapted it into an [[anime]].
*The Dreamworks animated film "[[Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas]]" (2003) features the title character going on a journey to find a treasure, while his best friend remains behind in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] to be executed in his place should he fail to return; he comes back and both are saved.
*The story was rather faithfully reproduced in an episode of the animated series [[Mythic Warriors: Guardians of Legend]].

==Idiomatic use==
"Damon and Pythias" came to be an idiomatic expression for "true friendship." Thus, [[Denis Diderot]]'s [[short story]], "The Two Friends from Bourbonne" (1770), begins "There used to be two men here who might be called the Damon and Pythias of Bourbonne."  

The canines [[Bummer and Lazarus]] were eulogized as "the Damon and Pythias of San Francisco" upon Bummer's death in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8n39p5k3/?layout=metadata
| title      = Bummer and Lazarus/The Damon and Pythias of San Francisco

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[novella]] "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", Henry Jekyll's two oldest friends, Dr. Lanyon and Mr. Utterson (a lawyer), have the following exchange while discussing Dr. Jekyll's apparent self-imposed isolation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...said Utterson. “I thought you had a common bond of interest.”

“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me.  He began to go wrong, wrong in the mind… Such unscientific balderdash,” said the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”

This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.  “They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the Damon-and-Pythias idiom would seem to indicate that, whether the difference was on a point of science or something else, it was not "only" some trivial difference.

Chapter Two (entitled "Damon and Pythias") of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s 1869 novel [[Sentimental Education]] tells of the friendship of Frederick Moreau and Charles Deslauriers.

The 1889 novel ''[[A Marriage Below Zero]]'' by Alfred J. Cohen (pen name: Alan Dale) has a young gay couple continually referring to themselves as Damon and Pythias. Soon the upscale social world that they try pass in begins to refer to them with the same term, but as derogatory codeword for 'gay couple.'

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]] addresses his close friend Horatio as "O Damon dear."

In the novel ''[[Little Men]]'' by [[Louisa M. Alcott]] (1871), Chapter 14 is entitled 'Damon and Pythias.' This is a reference to two of the characters, Nat and Dan. Early in the book, Nat is responsible for introducing Dan to the school which is the setting of the novel. Later, when Nat is falsely accused of theft, Dan stands by him and then later takes responsibility for the theft himself, saying that he could bear the mistrust and anger of the other boys more easily than his weaker friend. In fact, neither boy is guilty, and they are later cleared of involvement.

Two clerks arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct in [[Charles Dickens]]'s story "Making a Night of It" (in ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'') allude to Damon and Pythias.

In ''[[A Bell for Adano (novel)|A Bell for Adano]]'', by [[John Hersey]], Captain Purvis's and Mayor Joppolo's friendship is compared to the friendship of Damon and Pythias because they dated sisters.

In 1895, [[Jack London]] used Damon and Pythias as the nicknames of the two main characters in "Who Believes in Ghosts!" 

During World War II, P-51 fighter pilots Major Dominic Salvatore "Don" Gentile (December 6, 1920 – January 28, 1951) and his wingman Captain John Trevor Godfrey (1922–1958) both of the 4th Fighter Group were referred to as "Damon and Pythias" This remarkable team destroyed over 50 German aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Books: Great American Fighter Pilots of World War II by Robert D. Loomis, page 180, Landmark books, copyright 1961, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 61-7780&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 episode of the TV series ''[[Highlander: The Series|Highlander]]'' entitled "A Modern Prometheus," a character portraying Lord Byron mentions Damon and Pythias before he jumps with another man to their "death."

In the 1940 movie ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', Tracy Lord ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) remarks that C. K. Dexter Haven ([[Cary Grant]]) and George Kittredge ([[John Howard (American actor)|John Howard]]) are just like Damon and Pythias.

In the 1950 [[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]] movie ''[[Blonde Dynamite]]'', the boys establish a male escort service out of their foil Louie's ice cream parlor while they have conveniently sent him to Coney Island on vacation; Slip Mahoney (Leo Gorcey) tells the other boys to "Let Damon and Pythias fight it out!"—meaning to let Sach (Huntz Hall) and Whitey (Billy Benedict) fight to see which would be included in a group date with a bevy of femmes fatale.

In the 1971 [[PG Wodehouse]] novel ''[[Much Obliged, Jeeves]]'', [[Bertie Wooster]] tells his Aunt Dahlia that at Oxford, his friendship with Ginger Winship was comparable to that of Damon and Pythias.

In Episode 8, season 1 of ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', a character describes his friendship for the murder victim by saying that people referred to them as "Damon and what's-his-name."

'''Dok Hyon Sunim''' ({{lang-ko|덕현 스님}}) is a [[Sunim|Korean Zen monk]] ordained in [[Jogye order]] and the foremost [[wikt:disciple|disciple]] of [[Bopjong|Bop Jong Sunim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btn.co.kr/news/news.asp?DPID=57334 "Bop Jong Sunim's students mournig their teacher"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133000/http://www.btn.co.kr/news/news.asp?DPID=57334 |date=July 22, 2011 }}, ''[[Buddhist TV network]]'', South Korea, 14 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sunim]] spent more than 16 years in seclusion intensely practicing [[Zen]] [[meditation]] and currently acts as the [[abbot]] of Kilsangsa temple in Seoul, taking care of Bop Jong Sunim's teaching and disciples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2010/03/15/0200000000AKR20100315124152005.HTML "Kilsangsa abbot's public announcement"], ''[[Yonhap News]]'', South Korea, 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Dok Hyon Sunim was born on 25 December 1963. He grew up in a rural area of Korean south in [[Jeollanam-do province]].&lt;br /&gt;
Sunim met [[Buddhism]] in the 1980s while studying at the university. At that time [[South Korea]] was under a strong military government control. Many students, scholars and generally all educated people were concerned about their country and tried to fight the government to achieve justice, democracy and prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;
After graduating in the university, Sunim entered military service. For two years he was fulfilling his duties as a soldier and than supported himself as a worker at various construction sites. While working, he had many doubts about life, so started to practice [[Buddhism]] and finally decided to become a monk.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1989 entered [[Songgwangsa]] temple at Jogye mountain.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1990 obtained novice monk [[precepts]] and became disciple of venerable master [[Bop Jong]] Sunim ([[:ko:법정 (승려)|법정 스님]]), who was at that time practicing at Puril [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] above Songgwangsa. While attending his teacher, he entered Songgwangsa Kangwon [[seminary]].&lt;br /&gt;
Between the years 1992 to 2008 Sunim practiced Zen meditation in various Zen [[zendo|meditation halls]], hermitages and other secluded places.&lt;br /&gt;
Since March 2009 Sunim acts as an abbot of Kilsangsa temple in Seoul.&lt;br/&gt;
From March 2010 Sunim also serves as a successor of venerable Bop Jong Sunim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btn.co.kr/news/news.asp?DPID=57406 "Ceremony for deceased Bop Jong Sunim"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133011/http://www.btn.co.kr/news/news.asp?DPID=57406 |date=July 22, 2011 }}, ''[[Buddhist TV network]]'', South Korea, 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Draize Test''' is an acute [[toxicity test]] devised in 1944 by [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) [[toxicologists]] John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects.&lt;ref name="RDS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carbone |first=Larry |date=17 June 2004 |title=What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195161960.do |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press  |page=63 |isbn=978-0-19-516196-0}}[Used as a source for "conscious and restrained."]&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of [[erythema]] and [[edema]] in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye. The test subject is commonly an [[albino]] rabbit, though other species are used too, [[animal testing on dogs|including dogs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbone 2004, p. 24, with an image, fig 2.1, of two restrained rabbits and one dog undergoing Draize testing, citing ''The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin.  Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a "wash out" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.&lt;ref name=NAVS&gt;[http://www.navs.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ain_pt_animal_tests Animals in Product Testing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516043819/http://www.navs.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ain_pt_animal_tests |date=May 16, 2006 }}, National Anti-Vivisection Society, retrieved 29 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tests are controversial. They are viewed as cruel as well as unscientific by critics because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the [[scientific community]] as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/newsletters/v5n2/5n2wilco.htm Validation of In Vitro Methods: Regulatory Issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221063215/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/newsletters/v5n2/5n2wilco.htm |date=February 21, 2006 }}", Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter, Summer 1994, Vol. 5, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that [[anaesthetic]]s are administered and lower doses of the test substances used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://altweb.jhsph.edu/faqs.htm#16 Alternatives to Animal Testing Web Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209092736/http://altweb.jhsph.edu/faqs.htm#16 |date=February 9, 2006 }}, retrieved 29 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects ''[[in vitro]]'' are not currently used in a Draize test,&lt;ref&gt;[http://3r-training.tierversuch.ch/en/module_3r/draize_test_replacement/eye_irritation Eye irritation caused by chemicals], 3R Research Foundation, retrieved 29 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.

== Background ==

John Henry Draize (1900–1992) obtained a BSc in chemistry then a PhD in pharmacology, studying [[hyperthyroidism]]. He then joined the [[University of Wyoming]] and investigated plants poisonous to cattle, other livestock, and people. The U.S. Army recruited Draize in 1935 to investigate the effects of [[mustard gas]] and other chemical agents.

In 1938, after a number of reports of [[coal tar]] in [[mascara]] leading to blindness, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], placing [[cosmetics]] under regulatory control.&lt;ref name=Wilhelmus&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilhelmus KR |title=The Draize eye test |journal=Surv Ophthalmol |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=493–515 |year=2001 |pmid=11425356 |doi= 10.1016/S0039-6257(01)00211-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Draize joined the FDA, and was soon promoted to head of the Dermal and Ocular Toxicity Branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products. This work culminated in a report by Draize, his laboratory assistant, Geoffrey Woodard, and division chief, Herbert Calvery, describing how to assess acute, intermediate, and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin, penis, and eyes of rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Draize J.H. |author2=Woodard G. |author3=Calvery H.O. | year = 1944 | title = Methods for the study of irritation and toxicity of substances applied topically to the skin and mucous membranes | url = | journal = J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 377–390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this report, the techniques were used by the FDA to evaluate the safety of substances such as [[insecticide]]s and [[sunscreen]]s and later adopted to screen many other compounds. By Draize's retirement in 1963, and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique, irritancy procedures were commonly known as "the Draize test" &lt;ref name=Kay&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kay J.H. |author2=Calandra J.C. | year = 1962 | title = Interpretation of eye irritation tests | url = | journal = J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 281–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish the target organ, the tests are now often referred to as "the Draize eye test" and "the Draize skin test".

==Reliability==
In 1971, before the implementation in 1981 of the modern Draize protocol, [[Toxicology|toxicologists]] Carrol Weil and Robert Scala of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories. The laboratories returned significantly different evaluations, from non-irritating to severely irritating, for the same substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weil CS, Scala RA |title=Study of intra- and interlaboratory variability in the result of rabbit eye and skin irritation tests |journal=Toxicol.

* Misidentify a serious irritant as a mild irritant: 10.3%-38.7%

==Descriptions of the test==

===Anti-testing===
According to the American [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]], solutions of products are applied directly into the animals' eyes, which can cause "intense burning, itching and pain." Clips are placed on the rabbits' eyelids to hold them open during the test period, which can last several days, during which time the rabbits are placed in restraining stocks. The chemicals often leave the eyes "ulcerated and bleeding." In the Draize test for skin irritancy, the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded (several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape), then covered with plastic sheeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navs.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ain_pt_animal_tests Animals in product testing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516043819/http://www.navs.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ain_pt_animal_tests |date=May 16, 2006 }}, NAVS, accessed June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-testing===
According to the British [[Research Defence Society]], the Draize eye test is now a "very mild test," in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation.&lt;ref name="RDS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', written to refute an article saying that the Draize test had not changed much since the 1940s, [[Andrew Huxley]] wrote: "A substance expected from its chemical nature to be seriously painful must not be tested in this way; the test is permissible only if the substance has already been shown not to cause pain when applied to skin, and ''in vitro'' pre-screening tests are recommended, such as a test on an isolated and perfused eye. Permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huxley A |title=Testing is necessary on animals as well as in vitro |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7073 |page=138 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16407930 |doi=10.1038/439138b |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between the rabbit eye and the human eyes==

Kirk Wilhelmus, professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at [[Baylor College of Medicine]], conducted a comprehensive review of the Draize eye test in 2001. He also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans. However, he noted "that eyes of rabbits are generally more susceptible to irritating substances than the eyes of humans" making them a conservative [[animal model|model]] of the human eye. Wilhelmus concluded "The Draize eye test ... has assuredly prevented harm" to humans, but predicts it will be "supplanted as ''in vitro'' and clinical alternatives emerge for assessing irritancy of the ocular surface" &lt;ref name="Wilhelmus"/&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Industry and regulatory bodies responsible for public health are actively assessing animal-free tests to reduce the requirement for Draize testing. Before 2009 the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) had not validated any alternative methods for testing eye or skin irritation potential.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, 1987. Eye irritation testing. OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals. Test guideline 405, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OECD, 1992. Acute skin irritation and corrosive testing.

Positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies, such as the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] and US [[Department of Health and Human Services]], without testing on live animals, but negative results (no irritation) required further ''in vivo'' testing.&lt;ref name=Indans/&gt; Regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation, using alternatives to reduce Draize testing of substances with the most severe effects.&lt;ref name=Indans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/ocutox/ivocutox.htm |title=NICEATM-ICCVAM - In Vitro Ocular Test Methods - Overview |website= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224201649/http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/ocutox/ivocutox.htm |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==

===UK===
In Britain, the [[Home Office]] publishes guideline for eye irritancy tests, with the aim of reducing suffering to the animals. In its 2006 guidelines, it "strongly encourages" ''in vitro'' screening of all compounds before testing on animals, and mandates the use of validated alternatives when available. It requires that the test solution's "physical and chemical properties are not such that a severe adverse reaction could be predicted"; therefore "known [[corrosive]] substances or those with a high [[oxidation]] or reduction potential must not be tested." &lt;ref name=HO&gt;[http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/publications/guidance/hoguidance-eye-irritation-tests?view=Html Eye Irritation Tests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621035637/http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/publications/guidance/hoguidance-eye-irritation-tests?view=Html |date=June 21, 2007 }}, UK Home Office, retrieved 29 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially, and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye. If a rabbit shows signs of "severe pain" or distress it must be immediately killed, the study terminated and the compound may not be tested on other animals. In tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely, a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit. In the UK, any departure from these guidelines requires prior approval from the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=HO/&gt;

'''Enrique Domingo Dussel Ambrosini''' (born December 24, 1934) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] academic, [[philosopher]], historian, and theologian. He served as the interim rector of the [[Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México]] from 2013 to 2014.

==Biography==
Enrique Dussel was born on December 24, 1934 in [[La Paz, Mendoza|La Paz]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;Burton, Mark; Osorio, Jorge Mario Flores (2011-01-01). "Introducing Dussel: the philosophy of liberation and a really social psychology". Psychology in Society (41): 20–39. ISSN&amp;nbsp;1015-6046.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Home"&gt;Dussel, Enrique. "HOME - Enrique Dussel-Philosopher". enriquedussel.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[National University of Cuyo|Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]] in Mendoza from 1953 to 1957, receiving an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, after which he travelled to [[Europe]] to continue his studies. He then received a Doctorate from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], a Doctorate in History from the Sorbonne in [[Paris]], and an undergraduate degree in Theology obtained through studies in [[Paris]] and [[Münster]].&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt; Between 1959 and 1961 he lived in [[Israel]] learning [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and working manual jobs at a cooperative led by French Jesuit Paul Gauthier.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt; He returned to Argentina in 1969 and became influenced by [[Dependency theory|Dependency Theory]] and the writings of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], both of which were to become major influences on his thinking. In the events leading up to the military dictatorship in Argentina of 1976-1983, he was increasingly the target of violence, including death threats, the bombing of his house, and sacking from the university.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Home" /&gt; He escaped to [[Mexico]] in 1975  as a political exile, where he continued his work as a Professor of Philosophy at the Iztapalapa campus of the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] (Autonomous Metropolitan University, UAM) and in a teaching position at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM).

Dussel received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Fribourg]] in 1981, the [[University of San Andrés]] in 1995, the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 2012, the [[Universidad Santo Tomás]] in 2015, the [[National University of San Martín]] in 2015, and the [[University of Chile]] in 2017. He has produced an expansive body of work numbering some forty books on a range of subjects including the philosophy of liberation, ethics, political economy, theology, history and modernity/postmodernity. Much of his work is so far only limitedly available in English, and some contend that his work has not received the broader attention it warrants.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt; 

Additionally, he has been visiting professor for one semester at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], [[Notre Dame University]], [[California State University, Los Angeles]], [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] (New York), [[Loyola University Chicago]], [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Duke University]], [[Harvard University]], and others. In March 2013 he was named the interim rector of the [[Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México|Autonomous University of Mexico City]] for a period of one year.

Dussel has maintained dialogue with philosophers such as [[Karl-Otto Apel]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Richard Rorty]] and [[Emmanuel Lévinas]] &lt;ref&gt;Mendieta, Eduardo (1993), [http://168.96.200.17/ar/libros/dussel/apelin/fore.pdf "Editor's Introduction"] to [http://168.96.200.17/ar/libros/dussel/apelin/apelin.html ''The Underside of Modernity''] (online version)&lt;/ref&gt; Author of more than 50 books, his thoughts cover many themes including: [[theology]], [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], and [[ontology]].  He has been a critic of [[postmodernity]], preferring instead the term "[[transmodernity]]."

==Philosophy of liberation==
Enrique Dussel is one of the primary figures along with others such as Rodolfo Kusch, [[Arturo Andrés Roig|Arturo Roig]], and [[Leopoldo Zea Aguilar|Leopoldo Zea]], in the philosophical movement referred to as the Philosophy of Liberation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mendieta, Eduardo (2016-01-01). Zalta, Edward N., ed. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 ed.). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical content is heterogenous but arises from and responds to the particular historical/socio-political context of Latin America as part of a global periphery (see [[Dependency theory|Dependency Theory]]). The movement originated in Argentina in the early 1970s but during the period of [[Peronism|military dictatorship]] it dispersed across Latin America as many intellectuals were forced into exile. Subsequently, the Philosophy of Liberation has been highly influential both in Latin America and beyond.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The philosophy of liberation seeks to critique structures of colonialism, imperialism, globalization, racism, and sexism, from the particular experience of exploitation and alienation of the global periphery. It poses a direct challenge to the discourses of Euro-American philosophy, and emphasizes the socio-political responsibilities of Latin American philosophy towards the project of historical liberation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Philosophy of history==
This work consists of edited versions of six lectures given by Dussel in 1972. Intended to sketch ideas later developed in a second volume entitled ''Ethics and the Theology of Liberation'', the text gives a wide-ranging account, focused on the history of the church and its role in Latin America, with the overarching goal of elaborating a distinctly Latin American Theology, centered around a liberatory politics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korth|first=Eugene H.|date=1978|title=Review of History and the Theology of Liberation. A Latin American Perspective|jstor=25020262|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=64|issue=1|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dussel is concerned primarily with history, particularly in constructing a sense of the history of Latin America, and a sense of participation in a historical process towards liberation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His account reaches back to human origins, and includes topics ranging from [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] belief systems and worldviews to the origins of Christianity, to the [[Byzantine Empire]], to the role of the church in Spanish conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vernon|first=Ivan R.|date=1978|title=Review of History and the Theology of Liberation: A Latin American Perspective|jstor=23914847|journal=Journal of Church and State|volume=20|issue=3|pages=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the book covers the 20th century, addressing the political upheavals of the 1960s, the violence and oppression endured under military regimes, the response of the church, and the question of violent and non-violent resistance in Christian thinking. Dussel also explores the compatibility of socialism with Christian doctrine, and the possibility of a uniquely Latin American socialism. The single thread which runs most prominently through each section is the question of resistance to oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kilgore|first=W. J.|date=1976|title=Review of History and the Theology of Liberation: A Latin American Perspective|jstor=2514222|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=56|issue=4|pages=669–670|doi=10.2307/2514222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dussel explores through exegesis the Christian obligation to overcome the sin of oppression through commitment to selfless action towards the goal of historical liberation.

'''Ernst Akiba/Akiva Simon''' ({{lang-he|עקיבא ארְנְסְט סימון}}, 'aqibhah Ernst Simon; March 15, 1900 in [[Berlin]] – August 18, 1988 in [[Jerusalem]]) was a German-Jewish educator and religious philosopher. 
==Biography==
Along with [[Martin Buber]], he founded in the 1920s one of the earliest Israeli peace groups, [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]], which advocated for a binational state including Jews and Arabs. From 1930 to 1933 he taught at the [[Hebrew Reali School]] Haifa, headed by [[Arthur Biram]]. In 1942, he was one of the founders of the binationalist [[Ihud]] party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''Extrinsic finality''' is a principle of the [[philosophy]] of [[teleology]] that holds that a being has a final cause or purpose external to that being itself, in contrast to an [[intrinsic finality]], or self-contained purpose.
One example is the view that [[mineral]]s are "designed" to be used by [[plant]]s that are in turn "designed" to be used by [[animal]]s.

Over-emphasizing extrinsic finality is often criticized as leading to the anthropic attribution of every event to a divine purpose, or superstition. For instance, "If I hadn't been at the store today, I wouldn't have found that $100 on the ground. God must have intended for me to go to the store so I would find that money." or "We won the game today because of my lucky socks." Such abuses were criticized by [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;"De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum," III, iv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], &lt;ref&gt;"Principia Philosophiæ", I, 28; III, 2, 3; "Meditationes", III, IV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethica, I, prop. 36 app.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François-Rodolphe de Weiss''' ('''von Weiss''', also '''von Weiß''', surname at birth '''Wyss''') (1751–1818) was a Swiss political and military leader, writer and philosopher, a follower of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Yverdon]], son of François Rodolphe, seigneur de Daillens, and Henriette Russillon. He entered the French military service in 1766, and the Prussian in 1777. In 1785 he became a member of the Grand Conseil at [[Berne]].&lt;ref name="HLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F15919.php|title=''Weiss, François Rodolphe de'', Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A supporter of the ideas of the [[French Revolution]], de Weiss was sent to Paris as an envoy in 1792, and maintained a peace between France and the Swiss confederation.&lt;ref name="HLS"/&gt; In 1794 he attributed the Revolution to ideas emanating from [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Whatmore|title=Against War and Empire: Geneva, Britain, and France in the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aisGQGlkPKMC&amp;pg=PA102|date=31 July 2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17557-8|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 the Bernese [[bailiwick]] at [[Lucens Castle]] was ended by a popular uprising, with Weiss defending the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chateaudelucens.ch/history/|title=History, Château de Lucens|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss then went into exile, in Germany. He died by suicide at [[Coppet]] on 21 July 1818.&lt;ref name="HLS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">The '''HKA Test''', named after [[Richard R. Hudson]], [[Martin Kreitman]], and [[Montserrat Aguadé]], is a statistical test used in genetics to evaluate the predictions of the [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|Neutral Theory of molecular evolution]]. By comparing the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] within each species and the [[Divergence (biology)|divergence]] observed between two species at two or more loci, the test can determine whether the observed difference is likely due to neutral evolution or rather due to adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name = "Hudson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=RR|author2=Kreitman, M |author3=Aguadé, M |title=A test of neutral molecular evolution based on nucleotide data|journal=Genetics|date=May 1987|volume=116|issue=1|pages=153–9|pmid=3110004|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/116/1/153.abstract|pmc=1203113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in 1987, the HKA test is a precursor to the [[McDonald-Kreitman test]], which was derived in 1991.  The HKA test is best used to look for [[balancing selection]], recent [[selective sweeps]] or other variation-reducing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreitman|first=Martin|title=M D                            S P                            A H|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=1 September 2000|volume=1|issue=1|pages=539–559|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.1.1.539|pmid=11701640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutral Evolution==
Neutral Evolution Theory, first proposed by Kimura in a 1968 paper, and later fully defined and published in 1983, is the basis for many statistical tests that detect selection at the molecular level. Kimura noted that there was much too high of a rate of mutation within the genome (i.e. high polymorphism) to be strictly under directional evolution. Furthermore, functionally less important regions of the genome evolve at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimura|first=Motoo|title=The Neutral theory of molecular evolution|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=0521317932|edition=1st pbk. ed., repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimura then postulated that most of the modifications to the genome are neutral or nearly neutral, and evolve by random genetic drift. Therefore, under the neutral model, polymorphism within a species and divergence between related species at homologous sites will be highly correlated. The Neutral Evolution theory has become the null model against which tests for selection are based, and divergence from this model can be explained by directional or selective evolution.

==Formulae==

The rate of mutation within a population can be estimated using the Watterson estimator formula: θ=4Ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ, where Ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size and μ is the mutation rate (substitutions per site per unit of time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watterson|first=G.A.|title=On the number of segregating sites in genetical models without recombination|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 April 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=256–276|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(75)90020-9|pmid=1145509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson et al. proposed applying these variables to a chi-squared, goodness-of-fit test.

The test statistic proposed by Hudson et al., Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is:
:&lt;math&gt;X^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^L(S_i^A-\widehat{E}(S_i^A))^2}{\widehat{V}ar(S_i^A)}&lt;/math&gt;

This states that, for each locus (''L'') (for which there must be at least two) the sum of the difference in number of observed polymorphic sites in sample A minus the estimate of expected polymorphism squared, all of which is divided by the variance. Similarly, this formula is then applied to Sample B (from another species) and then can be applied to the divergence between two sample species. The sum of these three variables is the test statistic (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If the polymorphism within species A, and B, and the divergence between them are all independent, then the test statistic should fall approximately onto a chi-squared distribution.&lt;ref name ="Hudson" /&gt;

For a simple explanation, let D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = divergence between species, or the number of fixed differences in locus one. Similarly D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = divergence in locus two. Let P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of polymorphic sites in loci one and two, respectively (a measure of polymorphism within species). If there is no directional evolution, then D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Example==

For these examples, the distance between two species’ loci is determined by measuring the number of substitutions per site when comparing the two species. We can then calculate the rate of mutation (changes to the DNA sequence pre unit of time) if we know the time since the two species diverged from the common ancestor.

'''A test that suggests neutral evolution:'''
Suppose that you have data from two loci (1 and 2) in two species (A and B). Locus 1 shows high divergence and high polymorphism in both species. Locus 2 shows low divergence and low polymorphism. This can be explained by a neutral difference in the rate of mutations in each loci.

[[File:HKA test example.neutral.png|thumb|Example of Neutral Evolution - No Selection|framed|center]]

'''A test that suggests selection:'''
Again suppose you have data as in the last example, only this time locus 2 has equal divergence to locus 1 and yet lower polymorphism in species B. In this case the rate of mutation in each loci is equal, so this can only be explained by a reduction in the effective population size Ne of species B, which is inferred as an act of selection.

The '''Hegel Society of Great Britain''' ('''HSGB''') is an English-speaking forum for scholars and students interested in the writings of the philosopher [[Hegel|GWF Hegel]] (1770–1831). Such scholastic interest may extend to Hegel's predecessors, contemporaries, followers and critics.

The HSGB was founded in 1979, has over 200 members, and holds an annual conference. Its bi-annual journal is the ''[[Hegel Bulletin]]'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hegel Bulletin|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=HGL|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|A '''Capping Phrase'''|着語/箸語|jakugo}}, or {{Nihongo||''agyo''|下語}} of a [[kōan]] is a proof of solution of the case riddle, but not the solution itself. In [[Zen Buddhism]], kōan is used both as a meditation device and as an expression of {{Nihongo|Enlightenment|悟り/覚り|satori}} &amp;ndash; a radical experiential insight into the nature of things and the self alike. A capping phrase is supposedly an articulation of such enlightening experience, most of the time in verse. According to Victor Sōgen Hori the use of jakugo dates to the [[Song dynasty]] (AD 960 - 1270) and was developed from classical Chinese "literary games".

V. Sōgen Hori describes the process of the kōan training as follows:
"Rinzai monasteries in Japan vary in the way they conduct kōan practice, but in the Myōshin-ji–Daitoku-ji branch, when a monk has passed a kōan the Zen teacher will instruct him to bring a “capping phrase” ... The monk selects a verse or phrase that expresses the insight he has had while meditating on the kōan. He searches for this capping phrase in one of the several Zen phrase books that have been especially compiled for this purpose. If the monk continues into advanced stages of the Rinzai Zen kōan curriculum, he will receive further literary assignments: the writing of explanations in Japanese, called ''kakiwake'' 書き分け, and the composition of Chinese-style poetry, called ''nenrō''　拈弄 ... The research and writing required to complete ''kakiwake'' and ''nenrō'' writing assignments can consume considerable amounts of time during the later stages of a monk’s stay in the monastery." (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4.)

'''Jeff Malpas''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|FAHA}} (born 1958) is an Australian philosopher, currently Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Tasmania]] in Hobart, [[Tasmania]]. Known for his work across the analytic and continental traditions, Malpas has also been at the forefront of contemporary philosophical research on the concept of place. Malpas is also active in commenting on issues of contemporary ethics and politics in the Tasmanian and Australian media.

== Work and thought ==

Malpas is one of a handful of contemporary philosophers who have addressed the nature and philosophical significance of the concept of place. While Malpas draws on phenomenological and hermeneutic resources, his work in what he has termed ‘philosophical topography’ is also heavily indebted to analytic approaches in philosophy of mind and language. Malpas’ work is distinctive in its detailed conceptual analysis of topographical and spatial notions, for the methodological implications that it associates with the focus on place, and for its topographical analysis of self and identity (Malpas argues for an ‘externalist’ conception of self and mind, according to which human lives are indissolubly linked to the places in which those lives are lived). Malpas’s topographical approach has been developed in two volumes, ''Place and Experience'' (1999) and ''Heidegger’s Topology'' (2006) – the latter providing an analysis of the thought of German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] that is centred on the ideas of place and ‘topology’ (Heidegger himself talks of his thinking as a ‘topology of being’).

Malpas has devoted considerable attention to the idea of the transcendental, particularly as it connects with hermeneutic themes, with special emphasis on notions of ground and limit. He sees the transcendental as providing an important point of connection between philosophers such as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], while the focus on the transcendental also connects with Malpas’s methodological development of the idea of philosophical topography.

Inasmuch as it draws heavily on both the analytic and continental traditions, so Malpas’s work can also be seen as providing something of a bridge between them. His readings of Heidegger and Gadamer are characterised by an emphasis on argumentative reconstruction and clarity of exposition, while his interpretation and development of Davidson’s thought emphasises the broader philosophical and meta-philosophical elements of the Davidsonian position (and so places greater emphasis on Davidson’s later writings as providing the framework for reading Davidson’s work as a whole).

==Awards and recognition==
In November 2018 Malpas was elected Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/2018/11/19/welcoming-28-newly-elected-fellows/|title=Welcoming our 28 newly elected Fellows - Australian Academy of the Humanities|website=www.humanities.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Eduard Erdmann''' (13 June 1805 – 12 June 1892) was a German religious pastor, historian of  philosophy, and philosopher of religion, of which he wrote on the [[wiktionary:mediation|mediation]] of faith and knowledge. He was known to be a follower of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he studied under August Carlblom, and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] whom he considered as mentor. He also studied the works of [[Karl Daub]] and was to become known as a [[Right Hegelians|right-wing]] member of [[Hegelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bitter, "Erdmann: Appropriation and Criticism, Error and Understanding" from ''Kierkegaard and his German Contemporaries'' Tome II: Theology, Ed. Jon Stewart, Ashgate Publishing Limited (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Erdmann was born on 13 June 1805 in Wolmar, [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]], where his father was a pastor. His was a cousin of Julius Walter. He studied [[theology]] at [[University of Tartu|Dorpat (Tartu)]] and afterwards at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he fell under the influence of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and was known never to miss his lectures. Then, from 1829 to 1832 he was a minister of religion in his native town of Wolmar.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Chisholm (ed.), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Cambridge University Press, [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35398/pg35398.txt 11th ed. Vol.9] (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he resigned from his position as pastor to devote himself to education and philosophy, but continued to minister throughout his life. He obtained a doctoral degree in from the [[University of Kiel]] with the treatise, ''Quidnam sit discrimen philosophiam inter et theologiam'' (What is the Distinction between Philosophy and Theology?), written in  1830, in which he argued that philosophy and religion converge to a common truth, even though they differ in form of approach. In 1834 he began writing his ''[[Habilitation]]'' thesis to qualify in Berlin. This would eventually become the first volume of ''Versuch einer wissenschaftlichen Darstellung der Geschichte der neuern Philosophie'' (Attempt at a Scientific Presentation of the History of Modern Philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bitter 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 he was professor-extraordinary at [[University of Halle|Halle]], became full professor in 1839, and remained there until his death. He died on June 12, 1892 in Halle.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Chisholm 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

He published many philosophical text-books and treatises, and a number of sermons; but his chief claim to remembrance rests on his elaborate ''Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie'' (Outline the History of Philosophy, 2 vols, 1866), the 4th edition of which has been translated into English. Erdmann's special merit is that he does not rest content with being a mere summarizer of opinions, but tries to exhibit the history of human thought as a continuous and ever-developing effort to solve the great speculative problems with which man has been confronted in all ages. His chief other works were: ''Leib und Seele'' (Body and Soul, 1837), ''Grundriss der Psychologie'' (Outline of Psychology, 1840), ''Grundriss der Logik und Metaphysik'' (Outline of Logic and Metaphysics, 1841), and ''Psychologische Briefe'' (Psychological Letters, 1851).&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Chisholm 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdmann had many readers, students and followers, and influenced many intellectuals of his time. Some of these include Niels Thulstrup, his student [[Albrecht Ritschl]], his colleague [[Martin Kähler]], and members the Hegelian school, such as [[Kuno Fischer]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]]. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] studied and was inspired in his early studies by Erdmann's works, in particular his ''Vorlesungen über Glauben und Wissen als Einleitung in die Dogmatic und Religionphilosophie'' (Lectures on Faith and Knowledge as an Introduction to Dogma the Philosophy of Religion). Although Kierkegaard integrated much of Erdmann's work into his own, the only work in which Erdmann was cited by him was his dissertation ''[[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bitter 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary on Erdmann==
[[John Dewey]] wrote in the ''[[Andover Review]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The combination of qualities necessary to produce a work of the scope and grade of Erdmann's is rare. ...Erdmann wrote his book [''A History of Philosophy: Ancient and Mediaeval Philosophy''], not as a reference book... but as a genuine history of philosophy, tracing in a genetic way the development of thought in its treatment of philosophic problems. Its purpose is to develop philosophic intelligence rather than to furnish information. ...Erdmann unites a minute and exhaustive knowledge of philosophic sources at first hand, equalled over the entire field of philosophy probably by no other one man... To the student who wishes... a somewhat detailed knowledge of the evolution of thought, and of what this and the other writers have contributed to it, Erdmann is indispensable; there is no substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Erdmann, ''A History of Philosophy: Ancient and mediaeval philosophy'' MacMillan and Co. 3rd. ed. (1893): "Notices of the Press"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Balcombe''' (born 28 February 1959) is an [[Ethology|ethologist]] and author. He currently serves as Director of Animal Sentience with the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy, and Department Chair for Animal Studies with Humane Society University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesocietyuniversity.org/academics/sce/webinars/business_of_humane_education_webinar.aspx Humane Society University]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt;  He lectures internationally on animal behavior and the [[human-animal relationship]]. He is Associate Editor of the journal Animal Sentience.

==Early life and education==

Balcombe was born in [[Hornchurch|Hornchurch, England]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Randerson|first=James|title=Jonathan Balcombe: 'Stop being beastly to hens'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/apr/25/jonathan-balcombe-animal-feelings|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2013|location=London|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in New Zealand and Canada before settling in the United States in 1987.&lt;ref name="The Press Enterprise" /&gt;

Balcombe earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [[biology]] in 1983 from [[Faculty of Environmental Studies|York University]] in Toronto, then a Master of Science in biology from [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa in 1987. In 1991, he completed a Ph.D in [[ethology]] (animal behavior) at the [[East Tennessee University|University of Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duin|first=Julia|title=Humane Society University in D.C. is a pioneer in the growing animal studies movement|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-13/lifestyle/35452419_1_animal-rescue-animal-behavior-animal-abuse|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he studied mother-pup vocal communication in the [[Mexican Free-tailed Bat|Mexican free-tailed bat]].&lt;ref name="The Press Enterprise"&gt;{{cite web|title=REDLANDS: University hosts 'Animals, Society' lecture series|url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20120919-redlands-university-hosts-animals-society-lecture-series.ece|publisher=The Press Enterprise|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|title=Bats like to hang out with their friends, too|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41492997/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/bats-hang-out-their-friends-too/#.UeBDbXr7RBw|publisher=NBC|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Balcombe has worked for several animal protection organizations, including [[The Humane Society of the United States]], [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]], and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]. He also worked as a research coordinator and grant writer for Immersion Medical, a for-profit company that makes virtual reality training simulators for minimally-invasive surgery.&lt;ref name=Immersion&gt;{{cite web|last=Balcombe|first=Jonathan|title=Dissection: The Scientific Case|url=http://www.animalsandsociety.org/files/Balcombe,%20Jonathan,%20Dissection%20The%20Scientific%20Case%20for%20Alternatives,%20JAAWS%204-2,%202001.pdf|work=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Balcombe was hired to teach a course in animal behavior for Humane Society University. Two years later, he assumed the role of Department Chair for Animal Studies. He developed and taught a course in Animal Sentience, and commissioned the development of courses in Evolution, Food Choice and Animal Protection, and Gender and Animals.

==Writing==

Balcombe's first book, ''The Use of Animals in Higher Education: Problems, Alternatives, and Recommendations'', was published by Humane Society Press in 2000. His trade book, ''Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good'', was released by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 2006. The book details Balcombe's positions on the [[sentience]] of animals, and the existence of pleasure seeking behavior, in contrast with the behavioralist mainstream, which rejects [[anthropomorphism]] of animals.&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Nicola|title=Pleasurable Kingdom|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/pleasurable-kingdom/2007/08/06/1186252588627.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=6 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deutschlandradio called the book a "convincing and a fun read."&lt;ref name=Deutschlandradio&gt;{{cite web|last=Lange|first=Michael|title=Vergnügen als Evolutionsvorteil|url=http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/kritik/722719/|work=Radiofeuilleton: Kritik|publisher=Deutschlandradio|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Balcombe published ''Second Nature: The Inner Lives of Animals'', in which he surveys recent scientific discoveries about animal [[cognition]], [[emotion]], and [[virtue]], and aims to "protest against what he sees as an unbroken tradition of human cruelty and indifference."&lt;ref name=Scotman&gt;{{cite web|title=Book review: Second Nature: The Inner Lives of Animals|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/features/book-review-second-nature-the-inner-lives-of-animals-1-474944|work=lifestyle.scotsman.com|publisher=Scotsman|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Exultant Ark]]: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure'' was released in 2011 by the University of California Press. Using images of contented animals in their natural environment, Balcombe "proves that animals aren’t always engaged in a battle for survival but will frequently do things for nothing more than the feeling of satisfaction."&lt;ref name="The Ecologist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Robert|title=The Exultant Ark: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/1110526/the_exultant_ark_a_pictorial_tour_of_animal_pleasure.html|publisher=The Ecologist|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balcombe disputes the mainstream scientific community's belief that the animal kingdom is an unforgiving struggle for survival. The book briefly broke into the top 100 on Amazon.com following favorable reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]].''&lt;ref name="The New York Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Callahan|first=Maureen|title=Birds do it, Bees do it|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/birds_do_it_bees_do_it_gmtX6T7bitrT3LBNcCJTkN|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bouton|first=Katherine|title=The Joy of a Sun Bath, a Snuggle, a Bite of Pâté|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/science/19scibooks.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balcombe's 2016 book, ''What A Fish Knows'', combines science and story-telling to examine the inner lives of the world's most diverse group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Balcombe |first=Jonathan |date=May 15, 2016 |title=Fishes Have Feelings, Too |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/fishes-have-feelings-too.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |access-date=May 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''What A Fish Knows'' has a release date of June 7, 2016, from Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

Balcombe has published over 50 scholarly articles and book chapters on various topics, including animal behavior, animal research, [[Vivisection|animal dissection]], medical simulation, and [[veganism]].&lt;ref name="The Press Enterprise" /&gt; His essay titled "After Meat" appears in the 2016 book "Impact of Meat Consumption on Health and Environmental Sustainability," edited by Dora Marinova and Talia Raphaely.

== Advocacy ==
Balcombe uses a variety of platforms to advocate for a sea-change in the human-animal relationship. In addition to his books and journal papers, he is a regular speaker at conferences, campuses, public schools and other venues. He is interviewed often in the media, and he has written blogs for ''[[Psychology Today]]'', One Green Planet, Secretary of Innovation, and [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]]. He is a manuscript reviewer for scholarly journals such as [[Animal Behaviour (journal)|''Animal Behaviour'']], the ''Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science'', and the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]''.

Balcombe expressed his views on the use of [[battery hens]] in [[Industrial agriculture (animals)|industrial agriculture]] during a New Zealand conference. Balcombe stated that our moral obligation to the hens is greater due to their ability to suffer, saying "it's not about how their intelligence compares to ours, it's about how much they can feel pain, suffering, joy and pleasure."&lt;ref name="The New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chickens feel joy too, says expert|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10763963|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balcombe commented on a Tufts University report about the decline of [[vivisection]]. He maintains that reliable tests require better care for the animals involved.&lt;ref name="The New York Times- mice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilts|first=Phillip J.|title=Use of Research Animals Falls 50% Since 1968|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/03/us/use-of-research-animals-falls-50-since-1968.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 July 2013|date=3 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He referenced a 1990 study on lab mice that revealed that inconsistencies in test results can arise based on the stress level of each rat.&lt;ref name="The Humane Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind Closed Doors: Animals Suffer in University Research|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2011/05-06/behind_closed_doors_.html|publisher=The Humane Society|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balcombe also has served as an expert witness for undercover investigations by several organizations, most notably by the organization [[Mercy for Animals]] documenting cruelty to pigs, cattle, turkeys, and fish. In his 2011 response to an exposé by the animal protection organization Mercy for Animals of animal abuse on a pig farm, Balcombe described the farm's conditions as "an unremitting hell on earth," adding that "these intelligent animals endure awful physical and psychological suffering."&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last=Bora|first=Kukil|title=Hidden Cruelty: Video Footage Exposes Animal Abuse in U.S. Pork Factory [VIDEO]|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/hidden-cruelty-video-footage-exposes-animal-abuse-us-pork-factory-video-295523|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greener Ideal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Madison|title=Ryan Gosling &amp; other celebrities speak out against Walmart's pork|url=http://www.greenerideal.com/science/0824-ryan-gosling-celebrities-against-walmart-pork/|publisher=Greener Ideal|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kvár Házsongárd Apáczai.jpg|thumb|150px|The tomb of Apáczai in [[Cluj-Napoca]]'s [[Hajongard cemetery]]]]
'''János Apáczai Csere''' (June 10, 1625 &amp;ndash; December 31, 1659) was a [[Transylvania]]n [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]] and [[mathematician]], famous for his work ''The Hungarian Encyclopedia'', the first textbook to be written in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].&lt;ref name="p"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Textbooks as means of scientific communication: The Hungarian case|first=Gábor|last=Palló|url=http://www.phil-inst.hu/tudrend/PalloAeginart.htm|title=3rd STEP Meeting on Scientific and Technological Textbooks in the European Periphery|location=Aegina, Greece|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526092649/http://www.phil-inst.hu/tudrend/PalloAeginart.htm|archivedate=2011-05-26|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' calls him "the leading Protestant scholar and writer" of 17th-century Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29282/Janos-Apaczai-Csere János Apáczai Csere], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 2009-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Apața]] (today in [[Braşov County]], [[Romania]]) on June 10, 1625; the "Apáczai" in his name is an indication of his birthplace.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; The Csere family into which he was born were of the minor nobility,&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; but his parents died when he was young and he was brought up an orphan.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Apaczai|title=János Apáczai Csere}}&lt;/ref&gt; After college studies in [[Alba Iulia|Gyulafehérvár]] ([[Alba Iulia]]), one of Csere's teachers there, [[Johann Heinrich Bisterfeld]], persuaded the local bishop, István Katona, to fund a scholarship for Apáczai to continue his education in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; He began these studies at the [[University of Franeker]] and later went to [[Leiden University]] and [[Utrecht University]];&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; in 1651 he earned a doctorate in theology from the [[University of Harderwijk]].&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; He married a Dutch woman, Aletta van der Maet, in the same year, but returned with her to Gyulafehérvár in 1652 at the request of Prince [[George II Rákóczi]].&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; At this time, Bisterfeld was still head of the school in Gyulafehérvár, but on his death in 1655 Apáczai fell out of favor and lost his position;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; in 1656 he was sent instead to what is now [[Cluj-Napoca]] to become head of the Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca) School there.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; He died in 1659 at the age of 34.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

==The Hungarian Encyclopedia==
Apáczai wrote his encyclopedia while he was in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]],&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; and it was in Utrecht that it was published, in 1655 (with the year of 1653 printed on the frontispiece), after he had returned to Transylvania.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; The first part of the encyclopedia consisted of a translation of the philosophy of [[Descartes]], and the second and third covered [[logic]] following the earlier treatments of [[Petrus Ramus]] and his student [[Amesius]]. The fourth part concerned [[arithmetic]], and the fifth part [[geometry]], again based on the work of Ramus. The sixth part covered [[astronomy]], and was notable for including controversial [[heliocentric]] theories of [[cosmology]]. The remaining parts of the encyclopedia concerned [[natural history]], technology, history, social institutions, and theology. Apáczai's work fell into disfavor and neglect in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after the Hungarian [[Counter-Reformation]] led to a return of Catholicism in that country. However, in 1803, a second edition was published, and it was republished again as recently as 1977 by Kriterion. Due to this work, Apáczai is now considered a national cultural hero.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

'''Kasr al-asnam al-jahiliyyah fi dhamm al-mutasawwifin''' (''Demolition of the Idols of Ignorance in Blaming those who Pretend to Sufism'') (A.27; C.16; D.P.28). The word "mutasawwifin" referred to here is not used according to its usual meaning of one who follows Sufism but means one who pretends tofollow it. In this treatise, [[Mulla Sadra]] criticizes the excesses of those in his day who, pretending to be Sufis, disregarded the Shari'ah and its teachings.&lt;ref&gt;( Nasr Sayyed Hosein, Sadr aI-Din Shirazi and his Transcendent Theosophy,Background, Life and Works, p. 42, 1978 Tehran)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
This book is one of the [[Mulla Sadra|Molla Sadra]]’s works and writings, in Arabic. As the name of this treatise shows, had been written about the rejecting of false “Sufism”(tasavoof) and blaming the ignorant and hypocrite “Sufis”(Motesawefän). The content of the book, contrary to its new name, is old, and in it, the new word or subject that has not been related in Sadra’s former works are not seen. The basis of the Sadra’s action in this treatise is the criticism of false Sufis that have long precedente.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Author==
Muhamrnad ibn Ibrahim ibn Yahya Oawarni Shirazi, entitled Sadr al-Din and also Mulla Sadra (in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent simply Sadra) as well as Sadr al-muta'allihin, "foremost among the theosophers", or called simply Akhund by his disciples, was born in [[Shiraz]] in 979-980/1571-72 into an influential and well known family, his father having been the governor of the province of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]]. The date of his birth has not been specified in any of the traditional sources devoted to him 1and in fact it was discovered only a few years ago when'Allamah Sayyid [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]], a foremost contemporary sage or hakim of [[Iran]], was correcting the new edition of the [[Asfar]] and preparing it for publication. On the margin of a manuscript copied in 1197/1703 but based on acopy autographed by [[Mulla Sadra]] and with certain marginal notes by the author himself, [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]] discovered the following sentence in the section devoted to the question of the unity of the intellect and the intelligible: "1 received this inspiration at the time of sunrise of Friday the seventh of Jumadi al-ula of the year 1037 A.H. [corresponding to January 14, 1628] when already 58 lunar years had passed from the life
of the author."? Since then other sources have confirmed this information. But because it is not possible to know whether the58years is a period of between 57 and 58 years or 58 complete years, one cannot determine the exact date of his birth beyond setting it between the years 979/1571 and 980/1572.&lt;ref&gt;.( Nasr Sayyed Hosein, Sadr aI-Din Shirazi and hisTranscendent Theosophy,Background, Life and Works, p.31, 1978 Tehran)&lt;/ref&gt; He was wealthy and influential and with great effort trained his son. Mullah Sadra’s life can be divided into three periods:
#- The periods of seminarian, studentship, discussion, studying of the old books and viewpoints of philosophers in Shiraz and Isfahan. In this period, he studied viewpoint of philosophers, kaläm, "Aristotelian" (mash-shäi) and Illuminative (eshräghi) philosophers.
#- The stage of "self-discipline" (tahzibe nafs), "asceticism" (riyazat) and "mystical disclosure" (mokashefeh) in "kahak" village (near the [[Qom]]) that finally led to "unveiling of Lordly truths" (kashfe haghäyegh rabäni) and "theological sciences".
#- The stage of writing and teaching in [[Shiraz]] in the school that [[Allahverdy Khan]], the governor of "Fars", built it. During this period, [[Mulla Sadra]] almost wrote all his works. [[Mulla Sadra]] caused the "Divine Wisdom" (hekmate ellähi) and Islamic Philosophy enters into the new stage. He, in what is called "supreme knowledge" (elme a’lä) or universal science or "prime philosophy" or "Divine Wisdom" (hekmate elähi), [and it is the only part that really is "philosophy" and called "Real philosophy"], overshadowed the former philosopher position, changed the principles and first foundations of this science and strengthened it on a steadfast principle. Mullah Sadra, till end of his life, composed and instructed, and in this times, seven times walked to “Mecca” that in returning from the seventh journey, died in "Basra" in 1640 A.D. (1050A.H).

== Life and career ==
Hawley was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://katherinehawley.org/about/|title=About|date=2015-02-27|newspaper=Katherine Hawley|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did her undergraduate degree in Physics and Philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and lived in [[France]] for a short while afterwards. She then  went on to receive her M.Phil and Ph.D. in the Department of [[History and philosophy of science|History and Philosophy of Science]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] under the supervision of [[Peter Lipton]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prior to becoming a Senior Lecturer at the University of St Andrews in 1999, Hawley had been Henry Sidgwick Research Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; , where she had taught a variety of subjects, ''inter alia'', political philosophy, critical thinking, epistemology, formal logic, and metaphysics&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. She currently lives in [[Anstruther]] in [[Fife]] . She served as an Editorial Chair of [[The Philosophical Quarterly]] (2005-2010), in addition to being a Deputy (1999-2001) and an Associate Editor (2011-2012) of the [[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Work ==
In ''How Things Persist'' (2002), Hawley defends a stage-theory of persistence that combines the [[four-dimensionalism]] of [[Perdurantism|perdurantists]] with the [[Endurantism|endurantist]] account of predication. [[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]] praised the book for offering a new formulation of endurance theory as “the claim that ordinary objects are such that (i) they exist at more than one time and (ii) statements about what parts they have must be made relative to some time or other” (Hawley, p.&amp;nbsp;30, cited in Dyke, 2013).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyke|first=Heather|date=2003-01-10|title=Review of How Things Persist|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23240-how-things-persist/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dyke (2013),&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this characterisation captures the fundamental notion that ordinary objects exist at more than one time without being temporally extended in addition to simplifying cross-comparisons with the perdurance theory, which accepts (i) but rejects (ii).

Recently, Hawley's research interests shifted from persistence, [[Mereology|parthood]] and [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] to (un)trustworthiness and competence in ethics and epistemology. She cites the metametaphysical turn in [[analytic philosophy]] coupled with her deflationary intuitions about the possibility of methodology of metaphysics as a reason for moving away from metaphysics to ethics and epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politicalphilosopher.net/2015/06/26/featured-philosop-her-katherine-hawley/|title=Featured Philosop-her: Katherine Hawley|last=Krishnamurthy|first=Meena|date=2015-06-26|website=Philosopher|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Earl Wilber II''' (born January 31, 1949) is an American writer on [[transpersonal psychology]] and his own [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Forman, ''A guide to integral psychotherapy: complexity, integration, and spirituality in practice,'' [[SUNY Press]] 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic philosophy which suggests the synthesis of all human knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro" /&gt;

==Biography==
Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] student at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]], ''What Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America'', Bantam, 1996, {{ISBN|0-553-37492-3}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; He became inspired, like many of his generation, by Eastern literature, particularly the [[Tao Te Ching]]. He left Duke and enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska at Lincoln]], but after a few years dropped out of university to devote all his time to studying his own curriculum and writing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|title=Ken Wilber – Teachers – Spirituality &amp; Practice|work=spiritualityandpractice.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131218/http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber stated in 2011 that he has long suffered from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], possibly caused by [[RNase]] enzyme deficiency disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilber |first=Ken |title=Ken Wilber Writes About His Horrific, Near-Fatal Illness |url=http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |accessdate=26 May 2011 |newspaper=New Heaven New Earth |date=December 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724141023/http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2292/language/en-US/Ken-Wilber-Writes-About-His-Horrific-Near-Fatal-Illness.aspx |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=RNase Enzyme Deficiency Disease: Wilber's statement about his health|url=http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|work=IntegralWorld.net|publisher=October 22, 2002|accessdate=26 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605120119/http://www.integralworld.net/redd.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_spectrum_of_consciousness.html?id=Wvw9pzzp1C0C | title = The Spectrum of Consciousness | isbn = 9780835606950 | author1 = Wilber | first1 = Ken | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than twenty publishers it was finally accepted in 1977 by [[Quest Books]], and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing. He also helped to launch the journal ''ReVision'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 New Science Library published his anthology ''The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes'',&lt;ref&gt;The Holographic Paradigm and other paradoxes, 1982, {{ISBN|0-87773-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of essays and interviews, including one by [[David Bohm]]. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how [[holography]] and the [[holographic paradigm]] relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983 Wilber married Terry "Treya" Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book ''Grace and Grit''.

In 1987 Wilber moved to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and oversaw the work of the [[Integral Institute]]. Wilber now lives in [[Denver]], Colorado.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Subsequently, Wilber wrote ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]'' (1995), the first volume of his ''Kosmos Trilogy''. ''A Brief History of Everything'' (1996) was the popularised summary of ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'' in interview format. ''The Eye of Spirit'' (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal ''ReVision'' on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as ''One Taste'', a term for [[Cosmic consciousness|unitary consciousness]]. Over the next two years his publisher, [[Shambhala Publications]], released eight re-edited volumes of his ''Collected Works''. In 1999, he finished ''Integral Psychology'' and wrote ''[[A Theory of Everything]]'' (2000). In ''A Theory of Everything'' Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as [[Spiral Dynamics]]. His novel, ''[[Boomeritis]]'' (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the [[egotism]] of the [[baby boomers|baby boom generation]].

In 2012 Wilber joined the [[Advisory board|Advisory Board]] of [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]] which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.&lt;ref name="About Simpol-UK"&gt;About Simpol-UK: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 uk.simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– About Simpol-UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729182456/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endorsements"&gt;Endorsements: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 Simpol.org&amp;nbsp;– Endorsements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729191229/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 |date=2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL), pronounced "ah-qwul", is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro"&gt;Rentschler, Matt. [http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf "AQAL Glossary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228172258/http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf |date=2017-12-28 }} "AQAL: Journal of Integral Theory and Practice," Fall 2006, Vol. 1, No. 3. Retrieved on Dec. 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which do not fit into these four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiandt | first1 = K. | last2 = Forman | first2 = J. | last3 = Erickson Megel | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2003 | title = Integral nursing: an emerging framework for engaging the evolution of the profession | url = http://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(03)00080-0/abstract | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 130–137 | doi=10.1016/s0029-6554(03)00080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. "Lines" of development are various domains which may progress unevenly through different stages .{{refn|group=note|This interpretation is at odds with [[structural stage theory]], which posits an overall follow-up of stages, instead of variations over several domains.}} "States" are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a temporal experience of a higher developmental stage.{{refn|group=note|This too is at odds with structural stage theory, but in line with Wilber's philosophical idealism, which sees the phenomenal world as a concretisation, or immanation, of a "higher," transcendental reality, which can be "realized" in "religious experience."}} "Types" is a rest-category, for phenomena which do not fit in the other four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;"Integral Psychology" In: Weiner, Irving B. &amp; Craighead, W. Edward (ed.), ''The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology'', Vol. 2, 4. ed., Wiley 2010, pp. 830 ff. {{ISBN|978-0-470-17026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Excerpt C: The Ways We Are In This Together | work=Ken Wilber Online | url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm | accessdate=December 26, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223205255/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm/ | archivedate=December 23, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model's apex is formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories&amp;nbsp;— quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types&amp;nbsp;– describe the relative truth of the [[two truths doctrine]] of [[Buddhism]]. According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", exists absolutely.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Madhyamaka]] two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every-"thing" is empty, [[sunyata]] of an unchanging "essence". It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and ''do'' posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.}}

==Other ideas==

===Mysticism and the great chain of being===
One of Wilber's main interests is in mapping what he calls the "neo-perennial philosophy", an integration of some of the views of mysticism typified by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]''  with an account of cosmic [[evolution]] akin to that of the Indian mystic [[Sri Aurobindo]]. He rejects most of the tenets of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]] and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or [[yuga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"I have not identified myself with the perennial philosophy in over fifteen years ... Many of the enduring perennial philosophers—such as [[Nagarjuna]]—were already using postmetaphysical methods, which is why their insights are still quite valid. But the vast majority of perennial philosophers were caught in metaphysical, not critical, thought, which is why I reject their methods almost entirely, and accept their conclusions only to the extent they can be reconstructed"{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322225146/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm |archivedate=2006-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he embraces a more traditionally [[Western world|Western]] notion of the [[great chain of being]]. As in the work of [[Jean Gebser]], this great chain (or "nest") is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber "... the 'Great Nest' is actually just a vast [[Morphic field|morphogenetic field]] of potentials ..." In agreement with Mahayana Buddhism, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], he believes that reality is ultimately a [[nondual]] union of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] and [[substantial form|form]], with form being innately subject to development over time.

===Theory of truth===
{{See also|Esoteric_Buddhism#Two_Truths_Doctrine|l1=Two Truths}}

Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a transcendental reality which is [[Perennial philosophy|perennial]], being the same throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption.{{refn|group=note|The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. See also [[Mysticism|Perennialism versus constructionism]].}} Wilber juxtaposites this generalisation to plain materialism, presenting this as the main paradigma of regular science.&lt;ref name="mystics" /&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "Are the mystics and sages insane? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with the All, in a timeless and eternal and infinite fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine fools. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace of the entire Kosmos—a [[cosmic consciousness|Kosmic consciousness]] that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the [[scientific materialism]] story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"&lt;ref name="mystics"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', p.42–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or "quadrant", has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wilber  | first = Ken  | title = The Eye of Spirit | publisher = [[Shambhala]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1998  | pages = 12–18  | isbn = 1-57062-345-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre/trans fallacy===
Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls "pre-rational" and "trans-rational" stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber's view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm Introduction to the third volume of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615012815/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/ |date=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wilber claims that Freud and Jung commit this fallacy. [[Freud]] considered mystical realization to be a [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to [[infantile]] oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that [[Jung]] commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken. ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality''. Shambhala Publications, 2000, pp 211 f. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The introduction to Volume 1 of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber |work=Ken Wilber Online |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319023750/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm/ |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilber on science===
Wilber describes the current state of the "hard" sciences as limited to "narrow science", which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the [[wikt:sensorimotor|sensorimotor]] (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:&lt;ref name="RothbergKelly1998-p12"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Rothberg|author2=Sean M. Kelly|author3=Sean Kelly|title=Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1GUlPmlPD0C&amp;pg=PA12|date=1 February 1998|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0766-7|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2005-p2-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lew Howard|title=Introducing Ken Wilber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svCgg2VVR5oC&amp;pg=PA2|date=17 May 2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4634-8193-3|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* specifying an experiment,
* performing the experiment and observing the results, and
* checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.
He has presented these as "three strands of valid knowledge" in Part III of his book ''[[The Marriage of Sense and Soul]]''.&lt;ref name="Wilber2011-p187"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber|title=The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQGmVyPN6rUC&amp;pg=PT187|date=3 August 2011|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79956-2|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Wilber calls "broad science" would include evidence from [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and from the [[symbol]]ic, [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], and other realms of [[consciousness]]. Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of [[meditation|meditators]] and [[spiritual practice|spiritual practitioners]]. Wilber's own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using [[electroencephalogram]] machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls "integral science".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

According to Wilber's theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of [[reality]] than any of the particular [[exoteric]] religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Wilber has referred to [[Stuart Kauffman]], [[Ilya Prigogine]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and others in order to articulate his [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] and [[Teleology|teleological]] understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "I am not alone in seeing that chance and natural selection by themselves are not enough to account for the emergence that we see in evolution. Stuart Kaufman{{sic}} and many others have criticized mere change and natural selection as not adequate to account for this emergence (he sees the necessity of adding self-organization). Of course I understand that natural selection is not acting on mere randomness or chance—because natural selection saves previous selections, and this reduces dramatically the probability that higher, adequate forms will emerge. But even that is not enough, in my opinion, to account for the remarkable emergence of some of the extraordinarily complex forms that nature has produced. After all, from the big bang and dirt to the poems of William Shakespeare is quite a distance, and many philosophers of science agree that mere chance and selection are just not adequate to account for these remarkable emergences. The universe is slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes, and these processes—as Prigogine was the first to elaborate—escape present-level turmoil by jumping to higher levels of self-organization, and I see that "pressure" as operating throughout the physiosphere, the biosphere, and the noosphere. And that is what I metaphorically mean when I use the example of a wing (or elsewhere, the example of an eyeball) to indicate the remarkableness of increasing emergence. But I don't mean that as a specific model or actual example of how biological emergence works! Natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again that just isn't enough to account for creative emergence (or what Whitehead called "the creative advance into novelty," which, according to Whitehead, is the fundamental nature of this manifest universe)."&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''[http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 Re: Some Criticisms of My Understanding of Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907151307/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 |date=2011-09-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Current work===
In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the [[Integral Institute]], Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Integral Spirituality? |work=Integral Spiritual Center |url=http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%20Spirituality.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125133004/http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%2BSpirituality.pdf |archivedate=November 25, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (1.3 MB [[portable document format|PDF]] file)&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is entitled "What is Integral Spirituality?", and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published "Integral Spirituality", in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and  the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

"Integral post-metaphysics" is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world's [[spirituality|spiritual]]-[[religion|religious]] traditions in a way that accounts for the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[post-modern]] criticisms of those traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of [[consciousness]] developed by Wilber and [[Allan Combs]]. It is a grid with sequential [[states of consciousness]] on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or [[Overlapping hierarchy|levels]], of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top). This lattice illustrates how each structure of consciousness interprets experiences of different states of consciousness, including mystical states, in different ways.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Since then, Wilber has drawn back from public life, due to a severe illness.

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting [[Marc Gafni]]. Gafni was accused in the media of sexually assaulting a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|title='I Was 13 When Marc Gafni's Abuse Began'|author=|date=|website=forward.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204000533/https://forward.com/opinion/329620/i-was-13-when-marc-gafnis-abuse-began/|archivedate=4 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilber has in fact publicly supported Gafni on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206165122/https://www.integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle |archivedate=2016-02-06 |df= }}?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|title=+kenwilber.com - blog|author=|date=|website=www.kenwilber.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028230143/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition begun by a group of Rabbis has called for Wilber to publicly dissociate from Gafni.

Wilber is on the advisory board of Mariana Bozesan's AQAL Capital GmbH,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aqalcapital.com/advisory-board/ken-wilber/|title=Ken Wilber – AQAL Capital|website=aqalcapital.com|access-date=2016-03-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160331182445/http://aqalcapital.com/advisory-board/ken-wilber/|archivedate=2016-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munich]]-based company specialising in integral [[Impact Investing|impact investing]] using a model based on Wilber's [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|Integral Theory]].

==Influences on Wilber==
Wilber's philosophy has been influenced by [[Madhyamaka]] [[Buddhism]], particularly as articulated in the philosophy of [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Kosmos According to Ken Wilber: A Dialogue with Robin Kornman | date=September 1996 | work=Shambhala Sun | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | accessdate=2006-06-14 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813160309/http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2059 | archivedate=2006-08-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including [[Dainin Katagiri]], [[Taizan Maezumi]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]] [[Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Penor Rinpoche]] and [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]]. [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Ramana Maharshi]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]] can be mentioned as further influences.  Wilber has on several occasions singled out [[Adi Da]]'s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |title=The Case of Adi Da |accessdate= |work=Ken Wilber Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213072728/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |archive-date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adidawilber.com/ |title=Adi Da and The Case of Ken Wilber |accessdate= |quote=I mention Master Da (along with Christ, Krishna) as being the Divine Person as World Event. - Ken Wilber, Up From Eden, 1981 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124109/http://www.adidawilber.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'', Wilber refers extensively to [[Plotinus]]' philosophy, which he sees as nondual. While Wilber has practised [[Buddhist]] meditation methods, he does not identify himself as a Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;# ''Kosmic Consciousness'' (12 hour audio interview on ten CDs), 2003, {{ISBN|1-59179-124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing movement that considers Wilber as following a long tradition of western psychologists that have liberally appropriated and repackaged Eastern, especially Hindu, thought.

According to Frank Visser, Wilber's conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to [[E. F. Schumacher]]'s conception of four fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 194&lt;/ref&gt; Visser finds Wilber's conception of levels, as well as Wilber's critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in [[Huston Smith]]'s ''Forgotten Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 78&lt;/ref&gt; Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber's theory are based on the philosophy of [[Sri Aurobindo]] as well as other theorists including [[Adi Da]].&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Wilber has been categorized as [[New Age]] due to his emphasis on a [[transpersonal]] view&lt;ref&gt;[[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, pp.70 (''"Ken Wilber ... defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'"'').&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, as a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education'', Dordrecht: Springer 2006, p.93. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4803-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' has called him "the Hegel of Eastern spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053719/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59030-151-7 |date=2014-04-30 }} "The Simple Feeling of Being: Visionary, Spiritual and Poetic Writings"],  publishersweekly.com, June 4, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber is credited with broadening the appeal of a "perennial philosophy" to a much wider audience.

[[Steve McIntosh]] praises Wilber's work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish "philosophy" from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', Paragon House, St Paul Minnesota, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55778-867-2}} pp.227f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bache]] is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber's work, but calls Wilber's writing style glib.&lt;ref&gt;Notes to Chapter 6 of ''Dark Night Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind'' SUNY Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Stanislav Grof]] has praised Wilber's knowledge and work in the highest terms;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Ken has produced an extraordinary work of highly creative synthesis of data drawn from a vast variety of areas and disciplines ... His knowledge of the literature is truly encyclopedic, his analytical mind systematic and incisive, and the clarity of his logic remarkable. The impressive scope, comprehensive nature, and intellectual rigor of Ken's work have helped to make it a widely acclaimed and highly influential theory of transpersonal psychology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanislav Grof, [http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm "Ken Wilber's Spectrum Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209054241/http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm |date=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Grof has criticized the omission of the [[Pre- and perinatal psychology|pre- and peri-natal domains]] from Wilber's spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber's neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Grof, ''Beyond the Brain'', 131–137&lt;/ref&gt; Grof has described Wilber's writings as having an "often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded ''[[ad personam]]'' attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf Grof, "A Brief History of Transpersonal Psychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716130649/http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber's response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin of Dacia''' (Martinus Dacus, Martinus de Dacia, Martin de Dacie, Morten Mogensen, 1220-1304) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] scholar, master of arts and theology at the [[University of Paris]] around 1250–88. He authored ''Modi significandi'', an influential treatise on grammar. He held a [[prebendary]] as [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Ribe Cathedral]] in the [[Roman Catholic bishopric of Ribe|Ribe diocese]]. Later he became [[University of Paris#The rector|Rector of the University of Paris]].

In the dispute between [[Jens Grand]], [[Archbishop of Lund]], and King [[Eric VI Menved]] Martin arranged a royal rapprochement to Pope [[Boniface VIII]] in 1302, resulting in a settlement of the dispute.

==Name==
The rendering of his name into Medieval Latin as ''Martinus de Dacia'' stems from the fact that, during the Middle Ages, the toponym ''[[Denmark|Dania]]'', meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with ''[[Dacia (disambiguation)|Dacia]]''.

'''Miranda Fricker''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 12 March 1966) is an [[England|English]] [[philosopher]] who is currently Presidential Professor of Philosophy at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]]. She is also a Research Professor of Philosophy part-time at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/fricker&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==

She received her [[DPhil]] from the [[University of Oxford]] before taking up a Jacobsen Research Fellowship and later a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of London. Until 2012 she was Reader in Philosophy and Head of the Philosophy Department at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/fricker&lt;/ref&gt; Her research interests include [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], and [[feminist philosophy]]. She was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-announces-new-president-and-elects-66-new-fellows|title=British Academy announces new President and elects 66 new Fellows|last=|first=|date=15 Jul 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

Fricker is most well known for her exploration of "epistemic injustice," the act of wronging someone "in their capacity as a knower." In her 2007 book ''Epistemic Injustice'', Fricker argues that in addition to social or political injustices faced by women (and minority groups), there can be ''epistemic'' injustices as well. She identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice.

Testimonial injustice consists in prejudices that cause one to "give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199570522|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: "a kind of injustice in which someone is ''wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199570522|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermeneutical injustice is the kind of injustice experienced by groups who, because due to prejudice they have been less able to participate in the practices that generate new concepts (e.g. writing popular books and newspaper articles), lack the shared social resources to make sense of their experiences. One consequence of such injustice is that such individuals might be less inclined to believe their own testimony. For example, Fricker describes a woman attending a meeting in the late 1960s at which post-partum depression was discussed; in this case, the shared social resource - a linguistic label and sharing of experiences - enabled an understanding of a condition she had experienced and was previously blamed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199570522|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to writing ''Epistemic Injustice,'' Fricker co-edited ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'' (2000) with [[Jennifer Hornsby]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42986">'''Morality and religion''' is the relationship between [[religion|religious]] views and [[morals]]. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Gems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Zoroastrianism#Principal beliefs|Zoroastrianism's]] "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with [[secular]] value frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], and [[utilitarianism]].

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-07-803824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, "at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt;

[[Value judgment]]s can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as [[Christianity]], may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|edition= | authorlink = Simon Blackburn|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the [[Divine Command Theory]].&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, [http://www.lankaweb.com/dhamma/view12.html 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality'], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and [[social norm]]s in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Saint George, [http://www.prisoners.com/relcrime.html "Religion's Effects On  Crime Rates"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an [[Divine law|absolute lawgiver]] as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.

== Relationship between religion and morality ==
Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]]) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title = Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition = Second|editor1-first =  Peggy|editor1-last = Morgan|editor2-first = Clive A. | editor2-last = Lawton|year = 2007|publisher = Columbia University Press|location = |isbn = 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages = 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last =  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher = Random House|location = New York|isbn = 0-553-21365-2 |page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Gaukroger]]: "It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality."&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"&gt;{{cite book |title = Objectivity: A Very Short Introduction|edition = |last = Gaukroger|first = Stephen|year = 2012|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-960669-6|page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, [[Pierre Bayle]] asserted that religion "is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality".&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"/&gt; Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress | first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie | first2 = (ed) John | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press | edition = | year = 1986 | location = Philadelphia | page = 400 | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, "Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law." They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: those which enhance the well-being of others—that warrant our praise—and those that harm or diminish the well-being of others—and thus warrant our criticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition = |last1 = Paul|first1 = Richard|last2 = Elder|first2 = Linda|year = 2006|publisher = Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location = United States|isbn = 0-944583-17-2|pages = np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

# religious practices like "torturing unbelievers or burning them alive" potentially being labeled "ethical"
# the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of [[sin]]

They further note that various documents, such as the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] lay out "transcultural" and "trans-religious" ethical concepts and principles—such as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation—which require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are "ethically wrong".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armin Geertz suggests that "the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious frameworks ==
Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]]. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|title= New Marriage and Divorce Statistics Released|author= Barna Group|date= 31 March 2008|publisher= Barna Group|accessdate= 19 November 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219120231/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|archivedate= 19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Dixon, "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| pages = 115| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Dixon states, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"/&gt;

== Religion and social dimensions ==

The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences.  The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=R|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H|title=Religion and morality.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2015|volume=141|issue=2|pages=447–73|doi=10.1037/a0038455|pmid=25528346|pmc=4345965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=Does religious belief promote prosociality? A critical examination.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=876–906|doi=10.1037/a0028251|pmid=22925142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members.  Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group.  The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=The complex and elusive nature of religious prosociality: reply to Myers (2012) and Saroglou (2012).|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=918–23|doi=10.1037/a0029278|pmid=22925145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach? A Meta-Analytic Review of Religious Racism|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=16 December 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=126–139|doi=10.1177/1088868309352179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Rodney|last2=Smith|first2=Buster G.|title=Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/religious-attendance-relates-generosity-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett|title=Worldwide, Highly Religious More Likely to Help Others|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111013/worldwide-highly-religious-more-likely-help-others.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

The overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear.

A 2005 study by [[Gregory S.

Modern research in [[Relationship between criminology and sociology of education|criminology]] also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in: Doris C. Chu (2007). Religiosity and Desistance From Drug Use. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 2007; 34; 661 originally published online Mar 7, 2007; {{doi|10.1177/0093854806293485}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some studies establishing this connection.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, C. J.,&amp; Wright, B. R. (2001). "If you love me, keep my commandments":A meta-analysis of the effect of religion on crime. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,38,3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches [[Ron Sider]] accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World?'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by [[The Barna Group]] showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Georgia State University]] study published in the academic journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might "encourage" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html | title=New Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes | publisher=www.slate.com | accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research concluded that "many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/17/1/49.short?rss=1&amp;amp%3bssource=mfr | title=With God on my side: The paradoxical relationship between religious belief and criminality among hardcore street offenders |author1=Volkan Topalli |author2=Timothy Brezina |author3=Mindy Bernhardt | journal=Theoretical Criminology |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of religious values ==
Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides examples such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the [[Old Testament]] God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn notes morally suspect themes {{which|date=February 2017}} in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said, "There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects |edition= |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location= New York |isbn=978-0-671-20323-8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Copan |first=Paul |url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertrand Russell, "Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. "No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|pages= 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell further states that, "The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, "in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of secular value frameworks, such as [[consequentialism]],  [[freethought]], [[humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions.

Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. [[Bernard Williams]] argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Morality|authorlink1=Bernard Williams|last= Williams|first= Bernard|year= 1972|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-521-45729-7|pages= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Religious aspects of Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The God Delusion]] |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston, New York |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages= 262–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"/&gt;

In the [[Book of Revelation]], Christ describes himself thrice as "[[the Alpha and the Omega]], the beginning and the end."

==Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's theory==

[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, 1947]]

===Etymology===

[[Teilhard de Chardin]] was a paleontologist and Roman Catholic priest in the Jesuit order. In [[France]] in the 1920s, he began incorporating his theories of the universe into lectures that placed [[Catholicism]] and [[evolution]] in the same conversation. Because of these lectures, he was suspected by the [[Holy Office]] of denying the doctrine of [[original sin]]. This caused Teilhard to be exiled to [[China]] and banned from publication by Church authorities. It was not until one year after his death, in 1955, that his writings were published for the world to read. His book, ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'', has been dissected by astrophysicists and cosmologists to be a theological or philosophical [[theory]] that cannot be scientifically proven. Teilhard, who was not a [[cosmologist]], opens his books with the statement: 
{{quote|... if this book is to be properly understood, it must be read not as a work on metaphysics, still less as a sort of theological essay, but purely and a simply as a scientific treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Pierre|last1=Teilhard de Chardin|author-link1=Pierre Teilhard de Chardin |translator-last1=Wall|translator-first1=Bernard|title=The Phenomenon of Man|date=2008|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Thought|location=New York|isbn=0061632651|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Evolution===

[[Evolution]] does not end with mankind: 
Earth's [[biosphere]] evolved before humans existed. Teilhard describes evolution as earth's "hominization" in which one-cell [[organisms]] develop into metazoans, or animals, but some of the members of this classification develop organisms with complex [[nervous systems]]. This group has the capability to acquire [[intelligence]]. When ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' inhabited Earth through evolution, a [[noosphere]], the cognitive layer of existence, was created. As evolution continues, the noosphere gains coherence. Teilhard refers to this process as "planetization". Eventually, the noosphere gains total dominance over the biosphere and reaches a point of complete independence from tangential energy forming a metaphysical being, coined the Omega Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Frank J.|title=The physics of immortality: modern cosmology, God, and the resurrection of the dead|date=1994|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0385467990|page=113|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===

[[Energy]] exists in two basic modes:
# [[Tangential]] Energy: energy that can be measured by [[physics]].
# Radial Energy: spiritual energy which accumulates into a higher state as time progresses.

Teilhard's misunderstanding of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] to not allow the evolution of energy into higher orders was the motivation for identifying a new realm of spiritual energy. He defines Radial Energy as becoming more concentrated and available as it is a critical element in man's evolution. The theory applies to all forms of matter, concluding that everything with existence has some sort of life. Modern scientists criticize this [[vitalism]] ideology as unscientific. In regard to Teilhard's ''The Phenomenon of Man'', [[Peter Medawar]] wrote, "Teilhard's radial, spiritual, or psychic energy may be equated to 'information' or 'information content' in the sense that has been made reasonably precise by communication engineers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medawar|first1=Sir Peter|title=The Phenomenon of Man|url=http://bactra.org/Medawar/phenomenon-of-man.html|website=bactra.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal properties===

Teilhard's theory is maintained by four formal properties:
# Humans will escape the [[heat death of the universe]]. Scientifically, this means that intelligence cannot survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Frank J.|title=The physics of immortality : modern cosmology, God, and the resurrection of the dead|date=1994|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0385467990|page=111|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorizes that radial energy is non-compliant with entropy, it escapes the collapses of forces at world's end.
# The Omega Point does not exist within the timeline of the universe, it occurs at the exact edge of the end of time. From that point, all sequence of existence is sucked into its being.
# The Omega Point can be understood as a volume shaped as a cone in which each section taken from the base to its summit decreases until it diminishes into a final point.
# The volume described in the Third Property must be understood as an entity with finite boundaries. Teilhard explains: 
{{quote|
"...what would have become of humanity, if, by some remote chance, it had been free to spread indefinitely on an unlimited surface, that is to say left only to the devices of its internal affinities? Something unimaginable.... Perhaps even nothing at all, when we think of the extreme important of the role played in its development by the forces of compression." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wall]|first1=Pierre Teilhard de Chardin ; with an introduction by Sir Julian Huxley ; [English translation by Bernard|title=The phenomenon of man|date=2008|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Thought|location=New York|isbn=0061632651|page=239|edition= 1st Harper Perennial Modern Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Forces of compression===

Teilhard calls the contributing universal [[energy]] that generates the Omega Point "forces of compression". Unlike the scientific definition, which incorporates [[gravity]] and [[mass]], Teilhard's forces of compression sources from communication and contact between human beings. This value is limitless and directly correlated with entropy. It suggests that as humans continue to interact, [[consciousness]] evolves and grows. For the theory to occur, humans must also be bound to the finite earth. Creation of this boundary forces the world's convergence upon itself which he theorizes to result in time ending in communion with the Omega Point-God. This portion of Teilhard's thinking shows his lack of expectation for humans to engage in space travel and transcend past the borders of the [[planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Frank J.|title=The physics of immortality : modern cosmology, God, and the resurrection of the dead|date=1994|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0385467990|page=115|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Omega Point cosmology ==
{{Main|Frank J. Tipler#The Omega Point cosmology}}

[[File:Omega-Point-Multiverse.png|thumb|Frank J. Tipler's multiverse theory]]

Mathematical physicist [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler]] generalizes&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "The omega point as eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's questions for scientists." [[Zygon (journal)]] 24.2 (1989): 217–253. "Needless to say, the terminology is Teilhard de Chardin's..."&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard's term ''Omega Point'' to describe what he maintains is the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] required by the [[laws of physics]]: roughly, Tipler argues that quantum mechanics is inconsistent unless the future of every point in spacetime contains an intelligent observer to collapse the wavefunction, and that the only way for this to happen is if the Universe is closed (that is, it will collapse to a single point) and yet contains observers with a "God-like" ability to perform an unbounded series of observations in finite time. However, scientists such as [[Lawrence Krauss]] have stated that Tipler's reasoning is erroneous on multiple levels, possibly to the point of being nonsensical pseudoscience.&lt;ref name = "ellis1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link = George Francis Rayner Ellis | first = George Francis Rayner | last = Ellis |date = 1994 | title = Piety in the Sky | url = http://impleri.net/files/ellis.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  |page = 115 | issue = 6493 | volume = 371 | bibcode = 1994Natur.371..115E |doi = 10.1038/371115a0 | quote=It is a masterpiece of pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krauss|first1=Lawrence|title=More dangerous than nonsense|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=May 2007|pages=53|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)61199-3|quote=I am tempted to describe Tipler's new book as nonsense—but that would be unfair to the concept of nonsense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Strange Case of Frank Jennings Tipler|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_strange_case_of_frank_jennings_tipler|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=2008|quote=I began to wonder if the book could be a subtle, hilarious hoax. Sadly, it is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological controversy==

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's life (1881–1955) falls directly in between [[Vatican Council I]] (1869) and [[Vatican Council 2]] (1965), a time period where increasing global acceptance of evolution was forming a disconnect between modern humanity and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion without evidence|date=October 2018}}. His time came shortly after [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', a time when the intersection between the claims of scientific theories and the claims of traditional theological teachings became an enormous focus of the Vatican's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trennert-Helwig|first1=Mathias|title=The Church as the Axis of Convergence in Teilhard's Theology and Life|journal=Zygon|date=March 1995|volume=30|pages=73–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XII]] stated his concern on the [[theory of evolution]], albeit without condemning it:
{{quote|
"If such a doctrine were to be spread, what will become of the unchangeable Catholic dogmas, what of the unity and the stability of the Creed?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=6 "Si talis opinio amplectanda esse videatur, quidfiet de numquam immutandis catholias dogmatibus, quid de fidei unitale et stabuliat|journal=L'Osservatore Romano|date=19 September 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Teilhard's theory was a personal attempt in creating a new [[Christianity]] in which [[science]] and [[theology]] coexist{{Citation needed|reason=Cite writings from de Chardin supporting this  assertion rather than merely an attempt to include scientific discoveries into existing Catholic theology.|date=October 2018}}. The outcome was that his theory of the Omega Point was not perfectly scientific as examined by physicists, and not perfectly Christian either. By 1962, [[The Society of Jesus]] had strayed from Spanish Jesuit Priest [[Francisco Suarez]]'s philosophies on Man in favor of "Teilhardian evolutionary cosmogenesis". Teilhard's Christ is the "Cosmic Christ" or the "Omega" of revelation. He is an emanation of God which is made of matter, and experienced the nature of evolution by being born into this world and dying. His resurrection from the dead was not to heaven, but to the noosphere, the area of convergence of all spirituality and spiritual beings, where Christ will be waiting at the end of time. When the earth reaches its Omega Point, everything that exists will become one with divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teilhard de Chardin|first1=Pierre|title=Science and Christ|date=1 January 1968|publisher=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teilhard reaffirms the role of the Church in the following letter to Auguste Valensin. It is important to note that he defines evolution as a scientific phenomenon set in motion by God – that science and the divine are interconnected and acting through one another:
{{quote|
"I believe in the Church, mediatrix between God and the world[.] ... The Church, the reflectively christified portion of the world, the Church, the principal focus of inter-human affinities through super-charity, the Church, the central axis of universal convergence and the precise point of contact between the universe and Omega Point. ... The Catholic Church, however, must not simply seek to affirm its primacy and authority but quite simply to present the world with the Universal Christ, Christ in human-cosmic dimension, as animator of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teilhard de Chardin|first1=Pierre|title=My Fundamental Vision|date=1948|volume=XI|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Accelerating expansion of the universe ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
In 1998, a value measured from observations of Type 1a supernovae seemed to indicate that what was once assumed to be temporary cosmological expansion was actually accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-15165371 BBC News. 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent acceleration has caused many to dismiss Tipler's Omega Point out of hand, since the necessity of a final big crunch singularity is key to the Omega Point's workability. However, Tipler himself believes that the Omega Point is still workable and has explained on multiple occasions why a big crunch/ final singularity is still required under many current universal models.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A with Frank Tipler http://turingchurch.com/2012/09/26/interview-with-frank-j-tipler-nov-2002/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Audio interview with Frank Tipler- White Gardenia interview with Frank Tipler, December 2015

===Technological singularity===
The [[technological singularity]] is the hypothetical advent of [[artificial general intelligence]] theoretically capable of recursive self-improvement, resulting in a runaway effect to an [[intelligence explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. "The singularity: A philosophical analysis." Journal of Consciousness Studies 17.9-10 (2010): 7-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Steinhart, a proponent of "Christian transhumanism", argues there is significant overlap of ideas between the secular singularity and Teilhard's religious Omega Point.&lt;ref name=singularity /&gt; Steinhart quotes [[Ray Kurzweil]], one of the most prominent singularitarians, who stated that "evolution moves inexorably toward our conception of God, albeit never reaching this ideal."&lt;ref name=singularity /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=[[The Singularity is Near]]|year=2005|publisher=Viking Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-670-03384-3}}, pg 476; see also 375, 389-390&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Kurzweil, Teilhard predicts a period of rapid technological change that results in a merger of humanity and technology. He believes that this marks the birth of the [[noosphere]] and the emergence of the "spirit of the Earth," but the Teilhardian Singularity comes later. Unlike Kurzweil, Teilhard's singularity is marked by the evolution of human intelligence reaching a critical point in which humans ascend from "transhuman" to "posthuman". He identifies this with the Christian [[Second Coming|parousia]].&lt;ref name="singularity"/&gt;

===The Omega Point in popular culture===
The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dali]] was fascinated by Teilhard de Chardin and the Omega Point theory. His 1959 painting ''[[The Ecumenical Council (painting)|The Ecumenical Council]]'' is said to represent the "interconnectedness" of the Omega Point.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Victoria Educational Resource.
http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/resources/vce_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

**''A posteriori'' knowledge or justification &amp;ndash; knowledge dependent on [[experience]] or [[empirical evidence]], as with most aspects of [[science]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal knowledge]].
* [[Descriptive knowledge]] &amp;ndash; also called declarative knowledge or propositional knowledge, it is the type of knowledge that is, by its very nature, expressed in declarative sentences or indicative propositions (e.g., "Albert is fat", or "It is raining"). This is distinguished from what is commonly known as "know-how" or procedural knowledge (the knowledge of how, and especially how best, to perform some task), and "knowing of", or knowledge by acquaintance (the knowledge of something's existence).  
* [[Experience]] &amp;ndash; knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Empirical evidence]] &amp;ndash; also referred to as empirical data, empirical knowledge, and sense experience, it is a collective term for the knowledge or source of knowledge acquired by means of the senses, particularly by observation and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickett|2006|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Immanuel Kant, it is common in philosophy to call the knowledge thus gained ''a posteriori'' knowledge. This is contrasted with ''a priori'' knowledge, the knowledge accessible from pure reason alone.
** [[Experiential knowledge]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Explicit knowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge that can be readily articulated, codified, accessed and verbalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helie|first1=Sebastien|last2=Sun|first2=Ron|title=Incubation, Insight, and Creative Problem Solving: A Unified Theory and a Connectionist Model|journal=Psychology Review|date=2010|volume=117|issue=3|pages=994–1024|doi=10.1037/a0019532|pmid=20658861}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be easily transmitted to others. Most forms of explicit knowledge can be stored in certain media. The information contained in encyclopedias and textbooks are good examples of explicit knowledge.
* [[Extelligence]] &amp;ndash; term coined by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 1997 book Figments of Reality. They define it as the cultural capital that is available to us in the form of external media (e.g. tribal legends, folklore, nursery rhymes, books, videotapes, CD-ROMs, etc.).
* [[Knowledge by acquaintance]] &amp;ndash; according to Bertrand Russell, knowledge by acquaintance is obtained through a direct causal (experience-based) interaction between a person and the object that person is perceiving. Sense-data from that object are the only things that people can ever become acquainted with; they can never truly KNOW the physical object itself. The distinction between "knowledge by acquaintance" and "knowledge by description" was promoted by Russell (notably in his 1905 paper On Denoting). Russell was extremely critical of the [[equivocal]] nature of the word "know", and believed that the equivocation arose from a failure to distinguish between the two fundamentally different types of knowledge.
* [[Libre knowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge released in such a way that users are free to read, listen to, watch, or otherwise experience it; to learn from or with it; to copy, adapt and use it for any purpose; and to share the work (unchanged or modified). Whilst shared tacit knowledge is regarded as implicitly libre, (explicit) libre knowledge is defined as a generalisation of the [[libre software]] definition.
* [[Procedural knowledge]] &amp;ndash; also known as imperative knowledge, it is the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task. Commonly referred to as "knowing-how" and opposed to "knowing-that" ([[descriptive knowledge]]).
* [[Tacit knowledge]] &amp;ndash;  kind of knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. For example, that London is in the United Kingdom is a piece of explicit knowledge that can be written down, transmitted, and understood by a recipient. However, the ability to speak a language, knead dough, play a musical instrument or design and use complex equipment requires all sorts of knowledge that is not always known explicitly, even by expert practitioners, and which is difficult or impossible to explicitly transfer to other users.

=== By scope ===

* [[Common knowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge that is known by everyone or nearly everyone, usually with reference to the community in which the term is used.
* [[Customer knowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge for, about, or from customers.
* [[Domain knowledge]] &amp;ndash; valid knowledge used to refer to an area of human endeavour, an autonomous computer activity, or other specialized discipline.
* [[General knowledge]] &amp;ndash; "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media" and encompassing a wide subject range.&lt;ref name="Lynn2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Richard |author2=Irwing, P. |author3=Cammock, T.|title=Sex differences in general knowledge|journal=Intelligence|year=2002|volume=30|pages=27–39|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289601000642|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition excludes highly specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium. General knowledge is an important component of [[crystallized intelligence]] and is strongly associated with [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]], and with [[openness to experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bates | first1 = T.

* [[Metaknowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge about knowledge. [[Bibliography|Bibliographies]] are a form of metaknowledge. Patterns within scientific literature is another.
* [[Mutual knowledge]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] &amp;ndash; information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question "What am I like?".
* [[Traditional knowledge]] &amp;ndash; knowledge systems embedded in the cultural traditions of regional, indigenous, or local communities. Traditional knowledge includes types of knowledge about traditional technologies of subsistence (e.g. tools and techniques for hunting or agriculture), midwifery, ethnobotany and ecological knowledge, traditional medicine, celestial navigation, ethnoastronomy, the climate, and others. These kinds of knowledge, crucial for subsistence and survival, are generally based on accumulations of empirical observation and on interaction with the environment.

However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.
* [[Body of knowledge]] (BOK) &amp;ndash; specialized term in knowledge representation meaning the complete set of concepts, terms and activities that make up a professional domain, as defined by the relevant learned society or professional association.
* [[Curriculum|Curriculi]] &amp;ndash; plural of curriculum, which means the totality of student experiments that occur in the educational process.{{sfn|Kelly|2009|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leading Curriculum Development|first=Jon |last=Wiles | year=2008| ref=harv |isbn=9781412961417| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX--P1YUgI0C&amp;pg=PA2&amp; |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of planned student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals. Curricula may be tightly standardized, or may include a high level of instructor or learner autonomy.{{sfn|Adams|2003|pp=33–34}}  Many countries have national curricula in primary and secondary education, such as the United Kingdom's National Curriculum.
* [[Encyclopedia]]s &amp;ndash; type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |title=Encyclopedia. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803182506/http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |archivedate=2007-08-03}} Glossary of Library Terms.

'''Panchikarana''' is the [[Vedantic]] theory of how matter came into existent originating from the primordial five subtle elements.

==Overview==
Panchikarana is the method and process of the subtle matter (or the prior stage of matter) to transform itself into gross matter. Intelligence is the subtle manifestation of [[consciousness]] and matter its gross manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=15|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara]] wrote a treatise on this theory, titled – ''Panchikaranam'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Panchikaranam|author=Adi Sankara|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9usYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Panchikarana&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tz3qUKVawZCRBZXQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was elaborated by his disciple [[Mandan Mishra|Sureshvaracharya]], and later on commented upon in 2400 slokas by Ramananda Saraswati, disciple of Ramabhadra, and in 160 slokas by Ananda Giri, disciple of Suddhananda Yati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Contribution Towards an Index to the Bibliography of Indian..|author=Fitzedward Hall|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m44-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC7qUJrcJMbHkQXI3IHIAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Panchikarana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Shankarabhagavatapada Panchikaranam|publisher=Mahesh Research Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfJCygAACAAJ&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tz3qUKVawZCRBZXQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBTgK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] teaches the ''Doctrine of Trivirtkarana'' from which developed the ''Vedantic Theory of Panchikarana'' with regard to the creation of the transformed evolutes of the original elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyRKQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=AConstructive+Survey+of+Upanishadic+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LVvqUIqcIcvNlAXAiYDIBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is also found narrated to [[Narada]] in the ''Srimad Devi Bhagavatam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Devi Bhagavatam:Books One through twelve|author=Swami Vijnananda|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwlHAYJR5KcC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC7qUJrcJMbHkQXI3IHIAg&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Panchikarana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panchikarana is based on the assumed quintuplication of the basic/primordial five subtle elements, the ''Panchbhootas''. The Vedic seers believed that the ''Panchbhootas'' firstly divided themselves in two parts one part of which was further divided into four parts, which 1/8th parts of each subtle element then combined with other halves. It was also assumed that this process of division and combination goes on till the gross elements are produced as a continuous unending process. They believed that at the very beginning of creation ''Mahat'', on account of disturbance of the three gunas, gave rise to [[Ahamkara]] from which were produced in their subtle states [[Akasa]], [[Vayu]], [[Agni]], ''Apah'' and [[Prithvi]].(seven stages). Primary creation took place in three parts, a) Creation of Mahat, 2) Creation of ''Tanmatras'' (''Bhoota sarga'') and 3) Creation of [[Indriya]]s (''Vaikarika sarga''). For purpose of creation [[Brahman]] divided itself into [[Prakrti]], the combination of three gunas, the word also meaning before creation or primary factor/female form for creation, and representing matter, and [[Purusa]] (spirit), the male factor that has no ''[[tanmatras]]'' (subtle elements) attached to it. They also believed that the process of ''[[Srishti]]'' ("creation"), ''Stithi'' ("sustenance") and ''Samhara'' ("dissolution") continues without any change or interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Science &amp; Veda Sastras|author=Chennai S. Balasubramanian|publisher=Sura Books|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vcVeFAMWpsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC7qUJrcJMbHkQXI3IHIAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Panchikarana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panchikarana involves one half of the original subtle element to be mixed up with 1/8th part each of the other original subtle elements to produce the gross element of the subtle element contributing its own one half. When gross elements are produced then consciousness enters into these elements as their presiding deities, then comes the feeling of egoism (I-ness) identifying with the body. Gross elements solidify and assume forms as per their fundamental qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol.27, Part 1|author=Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12kSkNpBx-sC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Panchikarana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IC7qUJrcJMbHkQXI3IHIAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Panchikarana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2784">A '''performative contradiction''' ({{lang-de|performativer Widerspruch}}) arises when the [[proposition]]al content of a statement contradicts the [[presupposition]]s of asserting it. An example of a performative contradiction is the statement "I am dead" because the very act of proposing it presupposes the actor is alive.

== Usage in philosophy ==
[[Solipsism]] is often held to be a performative contradiction if stated. If not stated it is usually considered an example of the normative application of ''[[Silence procedure|qui tacet consentire videtur]] carborundum'' (He who remains silent vigorously consents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Man For All Seasons |first=Robert |last=Bolt }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jürgen Habermas]] and related philosophers point out that statements spoken during justificatory argumentation carry additional presuppositions and so certain statements are performative contradictions in this context. Habermas claims that [[post-modernism]]'s [[epistemological relativism]] suffers from a performative contradiction. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] claims in his theory of [[argumentation ethics]] that arguing for any political position other than [[free-market anarchism]] results in a performative contradiction.&lt;ref name="hanshoppe2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann  |title=The Ultimate Justification of Private Property |journal=Liberty |date=September 1988 |volume=1|page=20 |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/hoppe_ult_just_liberty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] more rigorously fleshed out the notion of performative contradiction in analyzing [[Descartes]]' famous ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' argument, concluding that ''cogito ergo sum'' relies on performance rather than logical inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cogito, Ergo Sum: Inference or Performance? |first=Jaakko |last=Hintikka |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=71 |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=3–32 |jstor=2183678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rani Pokhari''' ({{lang-ne|रानी पोखरी}}) meaning queen's pond, originally known as '''Nhu Pukhu''' ({{lang-new|न्हू पुखू}}) meaning new pond, is a historic artificial pond located in the heart of [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moste.gov.np/Rani_pokhari |title= Historical and Environmental Study of Rani Pokhari |last= Tribhuvan University Teachers' Association |first= |date= June 2012 |publisher= Government of Nepal, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology |page=4 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square-shaped tank dates from the 17th century, and was built on the eastern side of the then city limits. It lies just outside a former city gate. The pond is one of Kathmandu's most famous landmarks and is known for its religious and aesthetic significance. Its dimensions are 180m by 140m. It was damaged by the earthquake of 2015 AD at Nepal and is currently under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amatya|first=Saphalya |year=2003 |title=Water &amp; Culture |url=http://www.jvs-nwp.org.np/sites/default/files/Number%20%2033.pdf|page=25 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Rani Pokhari Temple.jpg|Wide view of Ranipokhari|250px|thumb]]
Rani Pokhari was built in 1670 AD by King [[Pratap Malla]], one of the most illustrious monarchs of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla dynasty]] that ruled [[Nepal]] for more than 600 years. Pratap Malla had the tank constructed to console his queen who was distraught with grief after their son was trampled to death by an elephant. He had water collected from various holy places and river confluences in [[Nepal]] and [[India]] like [[Gosaikunda]], [[Muktinath]], [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]] and poured into the pond to sanctify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chitrakar |first=Anil  |date=30 July 2010 |title=Infant Mortality|url=http://ecs.com.np/heritage-tale/infant-mortality |newspaper=ECS NEPAL |location=Kathmandu |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Majestic Rani Pokhari |url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=63939 |newspaper=Republica |location=Kathmandu|date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple dedicated to Matrikeshwor Mahadev, a form of the Hindu deity [[Shiva]], stands at the center of the pond. It is reached from the street by a causeway. A large stone statue of an elephant bearing the images of Pratap Malla and his two sons Chakravartendra Malla and Mahipatendra Malla is situated on the tank's southern embankment. The pond is recharged by water flowing in through an underground channel.

There are four smaller temples situated at the four corners of the pond: [[Bhairava]] temples in the northwest and northeast, Mahalaxmi Temple in the southeast and [[Ganesha|Ganesh]] Temple in the southwest. The temples on the eastern side now lie within the compounds of [[Tri Chandra College]] and a police station which has undermined their cultural importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moste.gov.np/Rani_pokhari |title= Historical and Environmental Study of Rani Pokhari |last= Tribhuvan University Teachers' Association |first= |date= June 2012 |publisher= Government of Nepal, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology |pages=4–5 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Regmi |first=DR |date=1966 |title=Medieval Nepal: A history of the three kingdoms, 1520 AD to 1768 AD |publisher=Firma K.

[[File:Ranipokhari during chhath festival.jpg|Ranipokhari during Chhath festival|250px|thumb]]
Rani Pokhari is fenced with iron bars and opened once a year during Bhai Tika, the fifth and final day of the [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], and [[Chhath]] festival.
The world's largest '''Chhath''' festival takes place every year in RaniPokhari.
Rani is also dedicated to (Nepalese Maithil) Women who go into the cold water and pray to the Sun God.

==Rani Pokhari inscription==
The famed Rani Pokhari inscription of King Pratap Malla installed here is a stone slab with writings in three languages: [[Sanskrit]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Nepal Bhasa]]. It is dated [[Nepal Sambat]] 790 (1670 AD) and describes the construction of Rani Pokhari and its religious significance. It also mentions five [[Rajopadhyaya|Brahmin]]s, five [[Pradhan]]s (Chief-ministers) and five [[Khas]] [[Magar people|Magars]] as being witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moste.gov.np/Rani_pokhari |title= Historical and Environmental Study of Rani Pokhari |last= Tribhuvan University Teachers' Association |first= |date= June 2012 |publisher= Government of Nepal, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology |pages=4–5 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western references==
Among the earliest references to Rani Pokhari is an account by Italian Jesuit [[Ippolito Desideri]] who visited Kathmandu in 1721 when Nepal was ruled by the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] kings. He was travelling from [[Tibet]] to [[India]], and has mentioned in his travelogue seeing a large pond outside the main city gate with flights of steps and banks sloping down to the water. The father has also written that there was a tall column at the center resting on a magnificent pedestal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Desideri |first=Ippolito  |editor-first=Filippo |editor-last=De Filippi |title=An Account of Tibet: The Travels of Ippolito Desideri 1712-1727 AES reprint |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=HEx9Xg78YNoC&amp;q=two+miles#v=onepage&amp;q=large%20pond&amp;f=false |publisher=Asian Educational Services |date=1995 |page=317|chapter=The Kingdom of Nepal |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Englishman William Kirkpatrick, who visited Kathmandu in 1793, has written that there was a quadrangular reservoir of water situated near the northeastern part of the city. He also noted the existence of many temples on the sides of Rani Pokhari, some of which were of considerable height and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kirkpatrick |first= William |date=1811 |title=An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul, Being the Substance of Observations Made During a Mission to that Country, in the Year 1793 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=PLkWAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |page=159 |publisher= W. Miller |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous structures==
Rani Pokhari is surrounded by historical buildings and famous structures. The clock tower [[Ghanta Ghar (Nepal)|Ghantaghar]] is situated across the road on the eastern side of the pond. The original clock tower, which had a more elaborate architecture, was destroyed during the [[1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake|Great earthquake of 1934]]. The present clock tower was built after the earthquake. It stands on the premises of [[Tri Chandra College]], the first college in the country which was established in 1918 AD.

On the western side of Rani Pokhari stands another historical building, [[Durbar High School]], built in 1854 AD. It is the first school in Nepal providing education along with modern lines. In the beginning, Durbar High School only admitted the children of the ruling classes. It was opened to the general public in 1902 AD.

[[Tundikhel]], a parade ground and ceremonial grass field and a Kathmandu landmark, formerly extended from the southern side of Rani Pokhari. A section next to the pond was fenced off and converted into a public park and flower garden in the mid-1960s.

The meaning of a '''spiritual retreat''' can be different for different religious communities. Spiritual retreats are an integral part of many Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and Sufi (Islamic) communities.

In Hinduism and Buddhism, meditative retreats are seen by some as an intimate way of deepening powers of concentration and insight.

Retreats are also popular in [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, and were established in today's form by [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]] (1491-1556), in his [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]. Ignatius was later to be made patron saint of spiritual retreats by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1922. Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] partake in and organize spiritual retreats each year.

Meditative retreats are an important practice in [[Sufism]], the mystical path of [[Islam]]. The Sufi teacher [[Ibn Arabi]]'s book ''Journey to the Lord of Power (Risālat al-Anwār)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journey to the Lord of Power: A Sufi Manual on Retreat|last=Ibn Arabi|first= |authorlink=Ibn Arabi|others=Rabia Terry Harris (trans.)|year=1981|publisher=Inner Traditions|location=|isbn=978-0-89281-018-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a guide to the inner journey that was published over 700 years ago.

==Buddhism==
[[File:Young monk in meditation cell, Yerpa, Tibet. 1993.jpg|thumb|left|Young monk in meditation retreat, [[Yerpa]], [[Tibet]] in 1993]]
A retreat can either be a time of [[solitude]] or a [[community]] experience. Some retreats are held in [[silence]], and on others there may be a great deal of conversation, depending on the understanding and accepted practices of the host facility and/or the participant(s). Retreats are often conducted at rural or remote locations, either privately, or at a retreat centre such as a [[monastery]]. Some retreats for advanced practitioners may be undertaken in [[dark retreat|darkness]], a form of retreat that is common as an advanced [[Dzogchen]] practice in the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Spiritual retreats allow time for [[Human self-reflection|reflection]], [[Prayer in Buddhism|prayer]], or [[meditation]]. They are considered essential in [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padmaloka.org.uk/calendar/being-on-retreat ''What is a retreat?'' at Padmaloka.org]&lt;/ref&gt; having been a common practice since the [[Vassa]], or rainy season retreat, was established by the founder of Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha|Gotama Buddha]]. In [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] retreats are known as [[sesshin]].

==Christianity==
[[File:Palac w Wodzislawiu Slaskim Kokoszycach.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wodzisław Śląski]] "Retreat House" of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Katowice]]]]
The Christian retreat can be defined in the most simplest of terms as a definite time (from a few hours in length to a month) spent away from one's normal life for the purpose of reconnecting, usually in prayer, with God. Although the practice of leaving one's everyday life to connect on a deeper level with God, be that in the desert (as with the [[Desert Fathers]]), or in a monastery, is as old as Christianity itself, the practice of spending a specific time away with God is a more modern phenomenon, dating from the 1520s and [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]'s composition of the Spiritual Exercises.&lt;ref name="OMalley"&gt;O'Malley, J W 1993, 'The First Jesuits', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus fasting in the desert for forty days is used as a biblical justification of retreats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VCH5ZmnLO4AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=retreats+jesus+fasting+in+the+desert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zWxckQPIKm&amp;sig=ClvKJXBYz-jDmIJlgCrDJwp3Gao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1Q5rT8ylNqKKsQLWltGKBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=retreats%20jesus%20fasting%20in%20the%20desert&amp;f=false ''Desert Living'' 2009, page 52]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual retreats may have various themes that reinforce Christian values, principles, and scriptural understanding. They may be individual or involve a group. Retreats for Christian youth groups are common, as are getaways for [[Sunday school|Sunday School]] classes, men's and women's [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] groups, and [[Christian school]] [[field trip]]s. Common locations for Christian retreats include churches and retreat centers. Retreat centers typically offer overnight accommodations (such as in a cabin or [[dormitory]]), meals, activities, meeting rooms, and chapel space.

=== Roman Catholicism ===
[[File:Chapel of Manresa Jesuit Spirituality Renewal Centre, Pickering.JPG|thumb|220px|right|[[Manresa Jesuit Spiritual Renewal Centre|Manresa Retreat Centre]], [[Pickering, Ontario]]]]

In the 20th Century, three-day retreats were popularised by the [[Cursillo]] movement, based on Ignatian spirituality.

The retreat was popularised in Roman Catholicism by the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), whose founder, [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], as a [[layman]] began, in the 1520s, directing others in making (participating in) the exercises.&lt;ref name="OMalley"/&gt; Another form the Exercises came in, which became known as the nineteenth "Observation", 'allowed continuing one's ordinary occupations with the proviso of setting aside a few hours a day for this special purpose.'&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, J W 1993, 'The First Jesuits', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual exercises were intended for people wanting to live closer to God's will for their life.

Following the growth of the [[Cursillo]] movement in Spain, similar retreats have become popular, either using licensed Cursillo material or independent material loosely based on its concepts, leading to the development of the [[three day movement]].

==Sufi retreats or spiritual khalwa==

The translation of [[khalwa]] from [[Arabic]] is seclusion or separation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufi Retreats and Khalwa|url=http://www.findpeace.co.uk/sufi-retreats-and-khalwa/|publisher=The Bright Path|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has a different connotation in Sufi terminology. In Sufi terminology, khalwa is the act of total self-abandonment in desire for the Divine Presence. In complete seclusion, the Sufi continuously repeats the name of God as a highest form of [[dhikr]] (remembrance of God meditation). In his book, Journey to the Lord of Power, Muhiyid-Did ibn Arabi (1165-1240 A.D.) discussed the stages through which the Sufi passes in his [[khalwa]].

Ibn Arabi suggested: "The Sufi should shut his door against the world for forty days and occupy himself with remembrance of Allah, that is to keep repeating, "Allah, Allah..." Then, "Almighty God will spread before him the degrees of the kingdom as a test. First, He will discover the secrets of the mineral world. If he occupies himself with dthikr, He (God) will unveil to the secrets of the vegetable world, then the secrets of the animal world, then the infusion of the world of life-force into lives, then the "surface sign" (the light of the Divine Names, according to Abdul-Karim al-Jeeli, the book's translator), then the degrees of speculative sciences, then the world of formation and adornment and beauty, then the degrees of the qutb (the soul or pivot of the universe-see #16) Then he will be given the divine wisdom and the power of symbols and authority over the veil and the unveiling. The degree of the Divine Presence is made clear to him, the garden (of Eden) and Hell are revealed to him, then the original forms of the son of Adam, the Throne of Mercy. If it is appropriate, he will know his destination. Then he will reveal to him the Pen, the First Intellect (as it is called by Sufi philosophers), then the Mover of the Pen, the right hand of the Truth. (The "Truth" as defined by al-Jeeli is that by which everything is created, none other than God most High.){{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The practice of khalwah is regularly followed by the Sufis, with the permission and the supervision of a Sufi authority.

The Sufis base the assigning of forty days of [[khalwa]] period on the forty days Allah had appointed for Musa (Moses) as a fasting period before speaking to him, as mentioned in different chapters in the Qur'an. One of them is from surat al-Baqarah.

[[Khalwa]] is still practiced today amongst authorized Sheikhs, such as [[Mawlana Sheikh Nazim Al-Haqqani]], [[Lefka]], [[Cyprus]].

==Meditation==
[[Meditation]] courses or retreats, either in a group or solo, are a common part of many [[meditation]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giri.dhamma.org/qanda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gaiahouse.co.uk/retreats/group-retreat-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dharma.org/meditation-retreats/retreat-center/retreat-center-schedule/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/how-an-intensive-ten-day-meditation-retreat-could-transform-your-life-for-the-better-10461380.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/13/best-yoga-meditation-retreats-fitness-breaks-mind-body&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/best-meditation-retreats/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga==
{{globalize|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Chattai_yoga_asanas_goa_india.jpg|thumb|Class at a Yoga-retreat in India]]
In modern [[Yoga]] a retreat is often a recreational holiday, where everyday business is left for a few days (weekend-retreat) up to weeks. The goal is to let go of daily stress and problems by doing [[Asanas]] rather than pure meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kostiner|first1=Assaf|title=What is a Yoga Retreat?|url=https://www.retreatnetwork.com/what-is-a-yoga-retreat/|publisher=RN|accessdate=29 December 2014|quote=The main purpose of a yoga retreat is to help one break away from the mechanical life and move into a space that helps to discover and reestablish oneself by growing mentally as well as physically. It releases one’s limitations, fears and takes to a world of new possibilities. The most eye-catching part about yoga retreats is its easy accessibility for all as it doesn’t restrain people on the basis of body type or age. It relieves a person from the stressful life without following any stringent meditation course, but by following a few Yoga Asanas in routine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes retreats are offered as organised travels abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evan|first1=Molly|title=Guide to Yoga|date=11 April 2014|publisher=Bookpubber|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=cUFUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=yoga+retreat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2xWhVIfaDtTmuQTen4HQCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=yoga%20retreat&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuremberg Chronicle f 222v 3.jpg|thumb|A generic portrait of ''Richardus de media villa'', woodcut from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
'''Richard of Middleton''' ([[Medieval Latin]]: '''Richardus de Mediavilla''') (c.1249–c.1308) was a member of the [[Franciscan Order]], a [[theology|theologian]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Richard's origins are unclear: he was either  [[Norman people|Norman]] French (from Menneville or [[Moyenville (disambiguation)|Moyenneville]]) or English (from Middletown).&lt;ref&gt;Wéber&lt;/ref&gt; As a Bachelor of the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]] at the [[University of Paris]] in 1283, he played a part in the Franciscan commission examining [[Peter Olivi]].&lt;ref&gt;Amann (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[regent master]] of the Franciscan studium in Paris from 1284 to 1287, and, on 20 September 1295 in [[Metz]], he was elected Franciscan provincial master of France.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also subsequently tutor to [[Louis of Toulouse]], son of [[Charles II of Anjou]]. He died sometime between 1300 and 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Wéber&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology and Philosophy==
[[File:Bologna, riccardo da mediavilla, commentarium... sententiarum, 1250-75 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Commentarium...''', 1250-1275 ca., [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]
His extant theological output is mainly contained in his two commentaries on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], which he edited between 1285 and 1295, three sets of Quodlibetal [[Disputations]] and  some 45 disputed questions.&lt;ref&gt;Cross (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; His work is heavily influenced by his predecessors at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]], [[Henry of Ghent]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Although his philosophy owes much to the Franciscan school of thought, with regard to the plurality of forms in a single substance, for example, he also affirmed universal [[hylomorphism]], thus following [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, he did not shy away from synthesizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] thought into his own philosophical reasoning, in spite of the hostility surrounding the [[Averroes|Averroist]] doctrines that were [[Condemnations of 1210-1277|condemned]] at the University of Paris in 1270 and 1277. Along with other masters of theology, his quodlibetal disputations had resonance beyond the immediate milieu of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Wei (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1285, he was one of the masters who debated whether [[annuities]] were licit or illicit as a form of contract.&lt;ref&gt;Wei (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''''' is a 1959 book about the [[philosophy of science]] by [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rewrote his book in English from the 1934 [[German language|German]] original, titled ''Logik der Forschung. Zur Erkenntnistheorie der modernen Naturwissenschaft'', which literally translates as, "Logic of Research: On the Epistemology of Modern Natural Science"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |title=The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WHZ9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor=Hansen, Troels Eggers |others= Andreas Pickel, trans. |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wT8AAAAAMAAJ 1979] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=WHZ9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Logik+der+Forschung%22%22The+Logic+of+Research%22 485] |isbn=1-13562676-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Popper argues that science should adopt a methodology based on [[falsifiability]], because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a reproducible experiment or observation can refute one. According to Popper: "non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |year=2002 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=KZvXAAAAMAAJ 1959] |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0a5bLBbe_dMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=0-41527843-0 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=0a5bLBbe_dMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22non-reproducible+single+occurrences+are+of+no+significance+to+science.+Thus+a+few+stray+basic+statements+contradicting+a+theory+will+hardly+induce+us+to+reject+it+as+falsified.+We+shall+take+it+as+falsified+only+if+we+discover+a+reproducible+effect+which+refutes+the+theory%2 66]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Popper argues that science should adopt a methodology based on "an ''asymmetry'' between [[Formal verification|verifiability]] and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=0a5bLBbe_dMC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22is+based+upon+an+asymmetry+between+verifiability+and+falsifiability;+an+asymmetry+which+results+from+the+logical+form+of+universal+statements.%22%22For+these+are+never+derivable+from+singular+statements,+but+can+be+contradicted+by+singular+statements%22 19].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Confessions of a Philosopher''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1997, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] argued that critiques of Popper's work have provoked an "irrationalist drift", and that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science "can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies" in Popper's book.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan.

'''''The Souls of Black Folk''''' is a classic work of [[American literature]] by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. It is a seminal work in the [[history of sociology]], and a cornerstone of [[African-American literature|African-American literary history]].

The book, [[published]] in 1903, contains several essays on race, some of which the magazine ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' had previously published. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an [[African Americans|African American]] in the American society. Outside of its notable relevance in [[African-American history]], ''The Souls of Black Folk'' also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.

In ''The Souls of Black Folk'', Du Bois used the term "double consciousness", perhaps taken from Emerson ("The Transcendentalist" and "Fate"), applying it to the idea that black people must have two fields of vision at all times. They must be conscious of how they view themselves, as well as being conscious of how the world views them.

==Chapters==
Each chapter in ''The Souls of Black Folk'' begins with a pair of epigraphs: text from a poem, usually by a European poet, and the musical score of a [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]], which Du Bois describes in his [[foreword]] as "some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink=Brent Hayes Edwards |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xx }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia University]] English and [[comparative literature]] professor [[Brent Hayes Edwards]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is crucial to recognize that Du Bois ... chooses ''not'' to include the lyrics to the spirituals, which often serve to underline the arguments of the chapters: Booker T. Washington's idealism is echoed in the otherworldly salvation hoped for in "A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land", for example; likewise the determined call for education in "Of the Training of Black Men" is matched by the strident words of "March On".&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink=Brent Hayes Edwards |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edwards adds that Du Bois may have withheld the lyrics to mark a barrier for the reader, to suggest that black culture—life "within the veil"—remains inaccessible to white people.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;

In his The Forethought, Du Bois states, "Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses, - the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls."  He concludes with, "need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?"&lt;ref name="WEB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Du Bois|first1=W.E.B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|date=1903|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=9780140189988|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Of Our Spiritual Strivings" ===

Chapter I, "Of Our Spiritual Strivings", lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis for the book. It says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, the right to a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. Here, he also coined "[[double-consciousness]]", which he defined as a "sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/114/1.html Chap. I: Of Our Spiritual Strivings] at ''Bartleby.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One ever feels his twoness, - an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.  The History of the American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self.  He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first chapter also introduces Du Bois's famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities are so vastly different from those of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African-Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|year=1903|publisher=Bantam Classic|location=New York|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose before him, and he saw himself,-darkly as through a veil; and yet he saw in himself some faint revelation of his power, of his mission."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Dawn of Freedom" ===

The second chapter, "Of the Dawn of Freedom", covers the period of history from 1861 to 1872 and the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].  Du Bois also introduces the problem of the color-line.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,-the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Du Bois calls the Freedmen's Burueau, "one of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition."  Du Bois goes on to quote the bureau as "one of the great landmarks of political and social progress."  After a year's work, Du Bois states, "it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England school-ma'am."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|14,21–22}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of the free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education among all classes in the South."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Du Bois goes on to credit the creation of [[Fisk University]], [[Clark Atlanta University]], [[Howard University]], and [[Hampton University]]  and acknowledged the "apostles of human culture" [[Edmund Asa Ware]], [[Samuel C. Armstrong]], and [[Erastus Cravath]].  Yet the demise of the [[Freedman's Savings Bank]] he attributes to the loss of "all the faith in savings."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|28–29,32}}

Finally, Du Bois argued that, "if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|33}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of the war.  Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race feud."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others" ===

Chapters III and VI deal with education and progress. It is here that Du Bois argues against [[Booker T. Washington]]'s idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Washington.html|title=Educational Theory of Booker T. Washington|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community.

Du Bois refers to the [[Atlanta Compromise]] as the "most notable of Mr. Washington's career," and "the old attitude of adjustment and submission."  Du Bois claims Washington wants black people to give up three things, political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education.  That, if black people "concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South," this will lead to 1) The disenfranchisement of the Negro, 2) The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro, and 3) The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro."  By Washington focusing on "common-school and industrial training," he "depreciates institutions of higher learning," where "teachers, professional men, and leaders" are trained.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|37,43–46}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds, -so far as he, the South, or the Nation, does this,- we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|50}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Meaning of Progress" ===

In the fourth chapter, "Of the Meaning of Progress", Du Bois dwells upon a time when he was teaching in Tennessee and then, after leaving, goes back 10 years later to a town that suffered many unpleasant changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Souls of Black Folk|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780758331403|location=|pages=49–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Du Bois states, "My log schoolhouse was gone. In it place stood Progress; and Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|59}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk me thought that Tennessee-beyond the Veil- was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|51}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, Du Bois states, after meeting with the commissioner, "but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then I-alone."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|53}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|57}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Wings of Atalanta" &lt;!-- please don't "fix" the spelling; it's a reference to the character in Greek mythology, not Atlanta, Georgia --&gt; ===
The fifth chapter is a meditation on the necessity of widespread higher education in the South.

Du Bois compares Atlanta, the City of a Hundred Hills, to [[Atalanta]], and warns against the "greed of gold," or "interpreting the world in dollars."  The "Black World beyond the Veil", should not succumb "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness," to the ideal of wealth attainment in public schools.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|66-63}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|66–67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He admonishes us to "Teach workers to work, and Teach thinkers to think."  "The need of the South is knowledge and culture," states Du Bois.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|71–72}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,-not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|72}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Training of Black Men" ===
Du Bois discusses how "to solve the problem of training men for life,"  especially as it relates to the Negro, who "hang between them and a light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through."  Du Bois cites the progress of Southern education, consisting of army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau, from the end of the Civil War until 1876.  Then complete school systems were established including [[Normal school]]s and colleges, followed by the industrial revolution in the South from 1885 to 1895, and its industrial schools.  Yet, Du Bois asks, "Is Not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?"&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|75–79}}

Du Bois asserts "education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning," is the right of the black as well as the white.  He goes on to state, "If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself," and cites the 30,000 black teachers created in one generation who "wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible." 
Additionally, 2500 Negroes had received a bachelor's degree, of whom 53% became teachers or leaders of educational systems, 17% became clergymen, 17% mainly physicians, 6% merchants, farmers and artisans, and 4% in government service.  From 1875 to 1880, there were 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges and 143 from Southern Negro colleges.  In From 1895 to 1900, Northern colleges graduated 100 Negros and over 500 from Southern Negro colleges.  He concludes by stating that the "...inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|79–89}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and co-operation.  And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Black Belt" ===
Du Bois calls [[Albany, Georgia]], in [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty County]], the "heart of the Black Belt."  He goes on to say "Here are the remnants of the vast plantations."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|93–94,96}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Du Bois states, "How curious a land is this,- how full of untold story, of tragedy and laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, and big with future promise!"&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|100}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, Du Bois states, it is not far from "where [[Sam Hose]] was crucified," "to-day the centre of the Negro problem,-the centre of those nine million men who are America's dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade."  He goes on to state, "Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and vindictiveness there,-these are the extremes of the Negro problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|92,106}}

=== "Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece" ===
Speaking of the cotton fields from "Carolina to Texas", Du Bois claims an analogy between the "ancient and modern "Quest of the [[Golden Fleece]] in the Black Sea."  Continuing his discussion of Dougherty County, Du Bois explains of the 1500 Negro families around Albany in 1898, many families have 8-10 individuals in 1-2 room homes.  These families are plagued with "easy marriage and easy separation," a vestige of slavery, which the Negro church has done much to prevent "a broken household."  He claims most of the black population is "poor and ignorant," over 80%, though "fairly honest and well meaning."  "Two-thirds of them cannot read or write," and 80% of the men, women and children are farmers.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|111–118}}

Economically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois.  He goes on to describe the economic classes consist of the "submerged tenth" of [[sharecropping|croppers]], 40% are [[metayage|metayers]] or "tenant on shares" with a [[chattel mortgage]], 39% are semi-metayers and wage-laborers, while 5% are money-renters, and 6% [[freehold (law)|freeholders]].  Finally, du Bois states only 6% "have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship," leading to a "migration to town," the "buying of small homesteads near town."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|123,128,132}}

=== "Of the Sons of Master and Man" ===
In this chapter, Du Bois discusses "race-contact", specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise.  As for physical proximity,
Du Bois states there is an obvious "physical color-line" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country.  He goes on to state the need for "Negro leaders of character and intelligence" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation.  The power of the ballot is necessary, Du Bois states, as "in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected."  Du Bois goes on to claim that "the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves," and Negroes viewed its "courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks."   Regarding social contact, Du Bois states "there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other."  Finally,
Du Bois states, "the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|134–135,140–141,144–145,152}}

=== "Of the Faith of the Fathers" ===

In Chapter X, "Of the Faith of the Fathers", Du Bois describes the rise of the [[black church]] and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African-Americans.

Du Bois starts by recounting his first exposure to the Southern Negro [[revival meeting|revival]], and notes three things characterize this religion, the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy.  He states the Frenzy or Shouting is "when the Spirit of the Lord passed by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy."  He goes on to state the Negro church is the social center of Negro life.  Predominately Methodists or Baptists after Emancipation, when Emancipation finally, came Du Bois states, it seemed to the freedman a literal Coming of the Lord.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|154–157,164}}

=== "Of the Passing of the First-Born" ===

The final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. Chapter XI, "Of the Passing of the First-Born", tells the story of Du Bois's own son and his untimely death.

Du Bois comments, "Why was his hair tinted with gold?  An evil omen was golden hair in my life."  He goes on to state, "I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in its train.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|170,172}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Du Bois ends with, "Sleep, then, child, - sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet-above the Veil."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|175}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of Alexander Crummell" ===
In this chapter, the life of [[Alexander Crummell]] is a short biography of a black priest in the Episcopal Church.

Du Bois starts with "This is the history of a human heart," and notes that Crummell faced three temptations, the temptation of Hate, the temptation of Despair, and the temptation of Doubt, while crossing two vales, the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|176}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Du Bois ends with, "And now that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear memory I bring this little tribute."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|185}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Of the Coming of John" ===

The penultimate chapter, "Of the Coming of John", is a work of fiction. It is the story of John from Altamaha, Georgia, sent off to a well-off school only to return to his place, where "[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue" (Du Bois 170). The first John's return to the South has made him a foreigner in his own home. After attempting to teach a class for the local children that is deemed critical of  Johns's life is compared to that of a different John, the son of the wealthy Judge Henderson. John Henderson has become bored after his own return from college and begins to sexually assault the black John's sister Jennie when he sees her outside his home. John kills the white John and then bids his mother goodbye. In the final part of the story, with the implication that he is about to be lynched by a gathering mob, he "softly hum[s] the 'Song of the Bride{{'"}} in German,  (Du Bois 176).

=== "The Sorrow Songs" ===

Chapter XIV, "The Sorrow Songs", is about Negro music and makes reference to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. Du Bois mentions that the music was so powerful and meaningful, regardless of the people's appearance and teaching, "their hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power."&lt;ref name=WEB/&gt;{{rp|205}}  Du Bois concludes the chapter by bringing up inequality, race and discrimination. ''"Your country? How came it yours?..we were here".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/114/14.html|title=XIV. The Sorrow Songs. Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. The Souls of Black Folk|website=www.bartleby.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Bois heralds the "melody of the slave songs", or the negro spirituals, as the "articulate message of the slave to the world." They are the music, he contends, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but "of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|year=1903|publisher=Bantam Classic|location=New York|pages=116, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture—with its origins in slavery—unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church, increasingly obsessed with respectability and with Western aesthetic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Davarian L.|title=Chicago's New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Black Urban Life|year=2007|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what [[Alain Locke]] called the "modernization of the negro" (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals are—for Du Bois—where the souls of black folk past and present are found.

Du Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with [[Antonín Dvořák]] and contemporary black aestheticians, including [[Harry Burleigh]], [[Robert Nathaniel Dett]], [[Alain Locke]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Davarian L.|title=Chicago's New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Black Urban Life|year=2007|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways—particularly "The Sorrow Songs"—that one of the major complications of Du Bois's project and, later, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] (where Hurston and Locke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=Eric J.|title=To Wake the Nations: Race in the Making of American Literature|year=1993|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=468–470}}&lt;/ref&gt; debut their own retrievals) surfaces. For Du Bois's contention that the sorrow songs contain a notative excess, and untranscribable element Yolanda Pierce identifies as the "soul" of the sorrow songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce|first=Yolanda|title=The Soul of Du Bois's Black Folk|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~jweisenf/northstar/volume6/pierce.html|work=The North Star|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mappings of sound and signs that make up the languages of the white Western culture would prove insufficient to many black literary critics of the 1920s and beyond, and the debates over the abilities to retrieve and preserve black folkways find their roots in Du Bois's treatment of the sorrow songs and in his call for their rescue.

==Critical reception==
In ''Living Black History'', Du Bois's biographer [[Manning Marable]] observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Few books make history and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. ''The Souls of Black Folk'' occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. "Souls" justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the [[black middle class]]. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated [[pan-Africanism]] and colonial revolutions in the [[Third World]]. Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as '[[whiteness studies]]' a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Marable, ''Living Black History'', p.96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the time of its publication, the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' warned of ''The Souls of Black Folk'', "This book is dangerous for the Negro to read, for it will only incite discontent and fill his imagination with things that do not exist, or things that should not bear upon his mind."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Books Noted|last = |first = |date = June 1964|journal = Negro Digest|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' said, "A review of [the work of the Freedmen's Bureau] from the negro point of view, even the Northern negro's point of view, must have its value to any unprejudiced student—still more, perhaps, for the prejudiced who is yet willing to be a student."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/specials/dubois-souls.html |title=The Negro Question |date=April 25, 1903 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to the 1961 edition, writer Saunders Redding observed, "The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|boycott of the buses in Montgomery]] had many roots . . . but none more important than this little book of essays published more than half a century ago."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Literary reception ===
As [[Yale University|Yale]] professor [[Hazel Carby]] points out, it was impossible for black writers before the abolition of slavery in 1865 "even to imagine the option of returning to the South once black humanity and freedom had been gained in the North" and it was rarely found in later literature as well.&lt;ref name="Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16"&gt;Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While the narratives of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]] move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses "the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South.&lt;ref name="Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16"/&gt; Although the text "consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world" in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, "its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one."&lt;ref&gt;Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carby traces the ways in which Du Bois gendered his narrative of black folk, but also how Du Bois's conceptual framework is gendered as well. In ''The Souls of Black Folk'', according to Carby, it seems that Du Bois is most concerned with how race and nation intersect, and how such an intersection is based on particular masculine notions of progress. According to Carby, Du Bois "exposes and exploits the tension that exists between the internal egalitarianism of the nation and the relations of domination and subordination embodied in a racially encoded social hierarchy." So Du Bois makes a conceptual argument that racialization is actually compatible with the nation in so far as it creates unified races. However, this unified race is only possible through the gendered narrative that he constructs throughout ''Souls'', which renders black male intellectuals (himself) as the (only possible) leader(s) of the unified race. Carby explains that "in order to retain his credentials for leadership, Du Bois had to situate himself as both an exceptional and a representative individual.... The terms and conditions of his exceptionalism, Du Bois argues, have their source in his formation as a gendered intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Carby, Du Bois was concerned with "the reproduction of Race Men". In other words, "the figure of the intellectual and race leader is born of and engendered by other males."&lt;ref&gt;Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Du Bois calls attention to "queer meanings" that, according to Charles Nero, are inherent in ''Souls''. Nero, who employs Anne Herrmann's definition of queer, conceptualizes queerness as the "recognition on the part of others that one is not like others, a subject out of order, not in sequence, not working." Foundational to Nero's argument is the understanding that men have the authority to exchange women among one another in order to form a "homosocial contract". Nero analyzes Du Bois's discussion on the Teutonic and Submissive Man to conclude that such a contract would lead to a "round and full development" to produce a "great civilization". However, Nero is concerned with violence and the "rigid policing of sexual identity categories at the turn of the century" which ultimately made such a homosocial, biracial contract impossible.

Nero marks "Of the Coming of John" as a central chapter that demonstrates his queer reading of ''Souls''. Nero argues that John Jones's absence of masculinity is a sign of his queerness and that the killing of his "double" represents Du Bois's disillusionment that there can exist a biracial and homosocial society.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Nero, "Queering the Souls of Black Folk," Public Cultures 17, no. 2 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural and religious criticism ===
Given Du Bois's transdisciplinary training and pivotal point of historicizing much of what we can say about black religion and culture, it is no surprise that many in black religious and cultural studies have used Du Bois's concept of "double-consciousness" or other concepts from ''Souls'' in their interpretations of black culture and religion. Cheryl Sanders, a professor of Christian ethics at [[Howard University]] School of Divinity, in her scholarly work lists a who's who of Du Bois progeny, including [[Paul Gilroy]], [[C. Eric Lincoln]], Lawrence Mamiya, Peter Paris, Emilie Townes and [[Cornel West]], who take up themes or concepts found in ''Souls'' for their own work in religious and theological studies or cultural criticism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=125|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Victor Anderson, a philosophical theologian and cultural critic at [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]] and the author of ''Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism'', links concepts from ''Souls'' to much of the work in black religious studies.

In ''Beyond Ontological Blackness'', Anderson seeks to critique a trope of "black heroic genius" articulated within the logics of ontological blackness as a philosophy of racial consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism|last=Anderson|first=Victor|publisher=Continuum|year=1995|isbn=978-0826408655|location=New York|pages=13–14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the center of this conception is Du Bois. "W. E. B. Du Bois's double-consciousness depiction of black existence has come to epitomize the existential determinants of black self-consciousness. These alienated forms of black consciousness have been categorically defined in African-American cultural studies as: The Negro Problem, The Color Line, Black Experience, Black Power, The Veil of Blackness, Black Radicalism, and most recently, The Black Sacred Cosmos."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Anderson's critique of black heroic genius and a move towards black cultural fulfillment is an attempt to move beyond the categories deployed by Du Bois in ''Souls''.

Likewise, Sanders, who in interpreting black black holiness-Pentecostalism specifically, also critiques Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness. In Sanders's work, ''Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture'', Sanders deploys a dialectical understanding of exile, which she characterizes in black holiness-Pentecostal terms as "Being in the world, but not of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=5–6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Sanders wishes to contrast this from the double-consciousness dialect of Du Bois, at least as she understands it. For Sanders, "exilic dialectics" is "hoped to represent a progressive step beyond the 'double-consciousness' described by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1903, which persists as the dominant paradigm in African American religious and cultural thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=124|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing double-consciousness as "either-or" and exilic consciousness as between "both-and", Sanders contrasts that those who live in exile "can find equilibrium and fulfillment between extremes, whereas adherents to the latter either demand resolution or suffer greatly in the tension, as is the case with Du Bois's description of the agony of 'double-consciousness,' as 'two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.'"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Textual changes==
In 1953, ''The Souls of Black Folk'' was published in a special "Fiftieth Anniversary Jubilee Edition". In his introduction, Du Bois wrote that in the 50 years since its publication, he occasionally had the inclination to revise the book but ultimately decided to leave it as it was, "as a monument to what I thought and felt in 1903". While he stuck by his decision, he wrote, in the new edition he had made "less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase and then not to change my thoughts as previously set down but to avoid any possible misunderstanding today of what I meant to say yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W.

Historian and literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] and a team of readers performed a line-by-line comparison of the two editions during the 1980s and identified two more changes. All the changes are minor; the longest was to change "nephews and poor whites and the Jews" to "poor relations and foreign immigrants". In six of the nine changes, Du Bois changed references to Jews to refer to immigrants or foreigners. Two of the other changes also involved references to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink=Brent Hayes Edwards |chapter=Note on the Text |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Bois wrote to Aptheker in February 1953 about concerns he had with his references to Jews in the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have had a chance to read [''The Souls of Black Folk''] in part for the first time in years. I find in chapters VII, VII and IX, five incidental references to Jews. I recall that years ago, [[Jacob Schiff]] wrote me criticising these references and that I denied any thought of race or religious prejudice and promised to go over the passages in future editions. These editions succeeded each other without any consultation with me, and evidently the matter slipped out of my mind.&lt;br&gt;As I re-read these words today, I see that harm might come if they were allowed to stand as they are. First of all, I am not at all sure that the foreign exploiters to whom I referred ... were in fact Jews.... But even if they were, what I was condemning was the exploitation and not the race nor religion. And I did not, when writing, realize that by stressing the name of the group instead of what some members of the [group] may have done, I was unjustly maligning a people in exactly the same way my folk were then and are now falsely accused.&lt;br&gt;In view of this and because of the even greater danger of injustice now than then, I want in the event of re-publication [to] change those passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first=W. E. B. |last=Du Bois |recipient=[[Herbert Aptheker]] |date=February 27, 1953 |subject=''The Souls of Black Folk'' |ref= }}, cited in {{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink=Brent Hayes Edwards |chapter=Note on the Text |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a March 1953 letter to Blue Heron Press, Du Bois asked that the following paragraph be added to the end of "Of the Black Belt":
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the foregoing chapter, "Jews" have been mentioned five times, and the late Jacob Schiff once complained that this gave an impression of anti-Semitism. This at the time I stoutly denied; but as I read the passages again in the light of subsequent history, I see how I laid myself open to this possible misapprehension. What, of course, I meant to condemn was the exploitation of black labor and that it was in this country and at that time in part a matter of immigrant Jews, was incidental and not essential. My inner sympathy with the Jewish people was expressed better in the last paragraph of page 152. But this illustrates how easily one slips into unconscious condemnation of a whole group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |first=W. E.

The publisher did not add the paragraph, perhaps because Du Bois changed the text instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink=Brent Hayes Edwards |chapter=Note on the Text |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Thunder, Perfect Mind''''' is an exhortatory poem discovered among the [[Gnostic]] manuscripts at [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945.

For it is I who am acquaintance: and lack of acquaintance.&lt;br&gt;It is I who am reticence: and frankness.&lt;br&gt;I am shameless: I am ashamed.&lt;br&gt;I am strong: and I am afraid.&lt;br&gt;It is I who am war: and peace.

''The Thunder, Perfect Mind'' (the title may alternately be translated ''The Thunder, Perfect Intellect'') takes the form of an extended, riddling [[monologue]], in which an [[Immanence|immanent]] divine [[wiktionary:savior|saviour]] speaks a series of [[Paradox|paradoxical]] statements alternating between first-person assertions of identity and direct address to the audience. These paradoxical utterances echo [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] identity [[riddles]], a common poetic form in the [[Mediterranean]]. Moreover, it is a non-epistolic, non-narrative unmediated divine speech.&lt;ref name=McGuire&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/thunder.shtml  |title=The Thunder: Perfect Mind |editor=McGuire, Anne |work=[[Diotima (magazine)|Diotima]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some translations to the right from the same section of the poem. Line numbering is different in different translations.

==Dating==
As to dating, Anne McGuire writes: "''Thunder, Perfect Mind'' exists only in the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] version found at Nag Hammadi (NHC VI,2:13,1-21,32). The author, date, and place of composition are unknown, but a cultural milieu like that of second- or third-century [[Alexandrian period|Alexandria]] is plausible. In any case, it is clear that the text was originally composed in Greek well before 350 C.E., the approximate date of the Coptic manuscript."&lt;ref name=McGuire/&gt;

==Structure and language==
The work as a whole takes the form of a poem in parallel [[strophes]], and the author, it may be surmised, has drawn on a tradition of such poems in both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Jewish]] communities, in which a similarly female divinity ([[Isis]] or aspect of the divine [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] respectively) expounds her virtues unto an attentive audience, and exhorts them to strive to attain her. Patricia Cox Miller suggests that it is the "self-revelation of a powerful goddess" &lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cox Miller, "In Praise of Nonsense," in World Spirituality , Vol. 15: Classical Mediterranean Spirituality , ed. by A. Hilary Armstrong (New York: Crossroads/Continuum Press, 1986), pp.481-505&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of the genre may be found in [[Old Testament]]  and apocryphal literature such as Proverbs and Wisdom (Ecclesiasticus).

The riddles of the poem may presuppose a classical [[Gnostic]] myth, such as the one found in the [[Reality of the Rulers]], or in the [[Secret Book of John]].

The original language of the poem was Greek, though only a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] version survives in the [[Nag Hammadi library]]; the manuscript resides in the [[Cairo]] Coptic museum.

[[File:Tree of Life, Medieval.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|tree of life as represented in the Kabbalah]], containing the [[Sephirot]]h.]]
'''Western esotericism''', also called '''esotericism''', '''esoterism''', and sometimes the '''Western mystery tradition''',&lt;ref&gt;Brian Morris, ''Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term under which scholars have categorised a wide range of loosely related ideas and movements which have developed within [[Western society]]. These ideas and currents are united by the fact that they are largely distinct both from orthodox [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian religion]] and from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. Esotericism has pervaded various forms of [[Western philosophy]], [[Western religions|religion]], [[pseudoscience]], [[Western art history|art]], [[Western Literature|literature]], and [[Western culture#Music|music]], continuing to affect intellectual ideas and [[popular culture]].

&lt;!--The different definitions of esotericism--&gt;
The idea of grouping a wide range of Western traditions and philosophies together under the category that is now termed ''esotericism'' developed in Europe during the late seventeenth century. Various academics have debated how to define Western esotericism, with a number of different options proposed. One scholarly model adopts its definition of "esotericism" from certain esotericist schools of thought themselves, treating "esotericism" as a [[perennial philosophy|perennialist]] hidden, inner tradition. A second perspective sees esotericism as a category that encompasses movements which embrace an "enchanted" world-view in the face of increasing disenchantment. A third views Western esotericism as a category encompassing all of Western culture's "rejected knowledge" that is accepted neither by the scientific establishment nor by orthodox religious authorities.

&lt;!--A historical overview of different forms of esotericism--&gt;
The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during [[Late Antiquity]], where [[Hermetism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Neoplatonism]] developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. [[Renaissance]] Europe saw increasing interest in many of these older ideas, with various intellectuals combining "[[pagan]]" philosophies with the [[Kabbalah]] and Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like [[Christian theosophy]]. The seventeenth century saw the development of initiatory societies professing esoteric knowledge such as [[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Freemasonry]], while the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the eighteenth century led to the development of new forms of esoteric thought. The nineteenth century saw the emergence of new trends of esoteric thought that have come to be known as [[occultism]]. Prominent groups in this century included the [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. [[Modern Paganism]] developed within occultism, and includes religious movements such as [[Wicca]]. Esoteric ideas permeated the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and later cultural tendencies, from which emerged the [[New Age]] phenomenon in the 1970s.

&lt;!--The academic study of Western esotericism--&gt;
Although the idea that these varying movements could be categorised together under the rubric of "Western esotericism" developed in the late eighteenth century, these esoteric currents were largely ignored as a subject of academic enquiry. The [[academic study of Western esotericism]] only emerged in the late twentieth-century, pioneered by scholars like [[Frances Yates]] and [[Antoine Faivre]].
Esoteric ideas have meanwhile also exerted an influence in [[popular culture]], appearing in art, literature, film, and music.

 | quote = The adjective 'esoteric' first appeared in the second century CE, but the substantive is of relatively recent date: it seems to have been coined in German (''Esoterik'') in 1792, migrated to French scholarship (''l'estoterisme'') by 1828 and appeared in English in 1883. [...] In short, 'Western esotericism' is a modern scholarly construct, not an autonomous tradition that already existed out there and merely needed to be discovered by historians.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "esotericism" thus came into use in the wake of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and of its critique of [[Institutionalisation | institutionalised]] religion, during which time alternative religious groups{{For example?|date=November 2018}} began to disassociate themselves from the dominant [[Christianity]] in Western Europe.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=80}} During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the term "esotericism" came to commonly be seen{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as something which was distinct from Christianity, and which had formed a subculture that had been at odds with the Christian mainstream from at least the time of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p= 80}} The French occultist and ceremonial magician [[Eliphas Lévi]] (1810-1875) popularized the term in the 1850s, and Theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840-1921) introduced it into the English language in his book ''Esoteric Buddhism'' (1883).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=384}} Lévi also introduced the term ''l'occultisme'', a notion that he developed against the background of contemporary [[socialism | socialist]] and [[Catholicism | Catholic]] discourses.{{sfnm|1a1=Strube|1y=2016a|2a1=Strube|2y=2016b}} "Esotericism" and "occultism" were often employed{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as synonyms until later scholars distinguished the concepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=385}}

==Conceptual development==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote='Western esotericism' is not a natural term but an artificial category, applied retrospectively to a range of currents and ideas that were known by other names at least prior to the end of the eighteenth century. [This] means that, originally, not all those currents and ideas were necessarily seen as belonging together:... it is only as recently as the later seventeenth century that we find the first attempts at presenting them as one single, coherent field or domain, and at explaining what they have in common. In short, 'Western esotericism' is a modern scholarly construct, not an autonomous tradition that already existed out there and merely needed to be discovered by historians.|source=— The scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 2013.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=3}} }}

The concept of "Western esotericism" is a modern scholarly construct rather than a pre-existing, self-defined tradition of thought.{{sfnm|1a1=Von Stuckrad|1y=2005b|1p=88|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2007|2p=6|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=2013a|3p=3}} In the late seventeenth century, several European Christian thinkers presented the argument that certain traditions of Western philosophy and thought could be categorised together, thus establishing the category that is now called "Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=78}} The first to do so was [[:de: Ehregott Daniel Colberg]] (1659–1698), a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] who wrote ''[[Platonisch-Hermetisches Christianity]]'' (1690–91). A hostile critic of various currents of Western thought that had emerged since the [[Renaissance]]—among them [[Paracelsianism]], [[Weigelianism]], and [[Christian theosophy]]—in his book he labelled all of these traditions under the category of "Platonic–Hermetic Christianity", arguing that they were [[heresy|heretical]] to what he saw as true Christianity.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=107}} Despite his hostile attitude toward these traditions of thought, he was the first to connect these disparate philosophies and study them under one rubric, also recognising that these ideas linked back to earlier philosophies from [[late antiquity]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|pp=107–108}}

In Europe during the eighteenth century, amid the [[Age of Enlightenment]], these esoteric traditions came to be regularly categorised under the labels of "[[superstition]]", "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]", and "the occult", terms which were often used interchangeably.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=230}} [[Academia|The modern academy]], which was then in the process of developing, consistently rejected and ignored topics coming under "the occult" and thus research into them was largely left to enthusiasts outside of academia.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=221}} Indeed, according to historian of esotericism [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]] (born 1961), rejection of "occult" topics was seen as a "crucial identity marker" for any intellectuals seeking to affiliate themselves with the academy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=221}}

Scholars established this category in the late 18th century after identifying "structural similarities" between "the ideas and world views of a wide variety of thinkers and movements" which prior to this had not been placed in the same analytical grouping.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=3}} According to the scholar of esotericism [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], the term provided a "useful generic label" for "a large and complicated group of historical phenomena that had long been perceived as sharing an [[family resemblance|''air de famille'']]."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=385}}

Various academics have emphasised the idea that esotericism is a phenomenon unique to the [[Western world]]; as Faivre stated, an "empirical perspective" would hold that "esotericism is a Western notion".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=17}} As scholars such as Faivre and Hanegraaff have pointed out, there is no comparable category of "Eastern" or "Oriental" esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=14&amp;ndash;15}} The emphasis on ''Western'' esotericism was nevertheless primarily devised to distinguish the field from a ''universal'' esotericism.{{sfn|Asprem|2014|p=8}} Hanegraaff has characterised these as "recognisable world views and approaches to knowledge that have played an important although always controversial role in the history of Western culture."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=13}} Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan asserted that Western esotericism constituted "a third pillar of Western culture" alongside "doctrinal faith and rationality", being deemed heretical by the former and irrational by the latter.{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=7}} Scholars nevertheless recognise that various non-Western traditions have exerted "a profound influence" over Western esotericism, citing the prominent example of the [[Theosophical Society]]'s incorporation of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concepts into its doctrines.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=177}} Given these influences and the imprecise nature of the term "Western", the scholar of esotericism Kennet Granholm has argued that academics should cease referring to "''Western'' esotericism" altogether, instead simply favouring "esotericism" as a descriptor of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Granholm|2013a|pp=31&amp;ndash;32}} This attitude was endorsed by Egil Asprem.{{sfn|Asprem|2014|p=4}}

==Definition==

The historian of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]] noted that "never a precise term, [esotericism] has begun to overflow its boundaries on all sides",{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=3}} with both Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss stating that Western esotericism consists of "a vast spectrum of authors, trends, works of philosophy, religion, art, literature, and music".{{sfn|Faivre|Voss|1995|pp=48–49}}
There is broad agreement among scholars as to which currents of thought can be placed within a category of "esotericism", ranging from ancient [[Gnosticism]] and [[Hermetism]] through to [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Kabbalah]] and on to more recent phenomenon such as the [[New Age]] movement.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=79}} Nevertheless, "esotericism" itself remains a controversial term, with scholars specialising in the subject disagreeing as to how it can best be defined.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=79}}

===Esotericism as a universal, secret, inner tradition===
[[File:Universum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|A colored version of the 1888 [[Flammarion engraving]]]]

A definition adopted by some scholars has used "Western esotericism" in reference to "inner traditions" which are concerned with a "universal spiritual dimension of reality, as opposed to the merely external ('exoteric') religious institutions and dogmatic systems of established religions."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=10–12}} According to this approach, "Western esotericism" is viewed as just one variant of a worldwide "esotericism" which can be found at the heart of all world religions and cultures, reflecting a hidden esoteric reality.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=11}} This usage of the term "esotericism" is closest to the original meaning of the word as it was used in late antiquity, where it was applied to secret spiritual teachings which were reserved for a specific elite and hidden from the masses.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=10}} This definition was popularised in the published work of nineteenth-century esotericists like [[A. E. Waite]], who sought to combine their own mystical beliefs with a historical interpretation of esotericism.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=251}} It subsequently became a popular approach within several esoteric movements, most notably [[Martinism]] and [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013b|p=178}}

This definition—originally developed by esotericists themselves—became popular among French academics during the 1980s, exerting a strong influence over the scholars [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Henry Corbin]], and the early work of Faivre.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013b|p=178}} Within the academic field of [[religious studies]], those who study different religions in search of an inner, universal dimension to them all are termed "religionists".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=11}} Such religionist ideas also exerted an influence on more recent scholars like [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] and [[Arthur Versluis]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=11}}
Versluis for instance defined "Western esotericism" as "inner or hidden spiritual knowledge transmitted through Western European historical currents that in turn feed into North American and other non-European settings".{{sfn|Versluis|2007|p=1}} He added that these Western esoteric currents all shared a core characteristic, "a claim to gnosis, or direct [[Spiritual enlightenment|spiritual insight]] into cosmology or spiritual insight",{{sfn|Versluis|2007|p=1}} and accordingly he suggested that these currents could be referred to as "Western gnostic" just as much as "Western esoteric".{{sfn|Versluis|2007|p=2}}

There are various problems with this model for understanding Western esotericism.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=11}} The most significant is that it rests upon the conviction that there really is a "universal, hidden, esoteric dimension of reality" that objectively exists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=11}} The existence of this universal inner tradition has not been discovered through scientific or scholarly enquiry; this had led some{{who|date= November 2018}} to claim that it does not exist, although Hanegraaff thought it better to adopt a view based in methodological agnosticism by stating that "we simply do not know - and cannot know" if it exists or not. He noted that, even if such a true and absolute nature of reality really existed, it would only be accessible through 'esoteric' spiritual practices, and could not be discovered or measured by the 'exoteric' tools of scientific and scholarly enquiry.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=11&amp;ndash;12}} Hanegraaff also highlighted that an attitude which seeks to uncover an inner hidden core of all esoteric currents masks the fact that such groups often contain significant differences from one another, being rooted in their own historical and social contexts, and expressing ideas and agendas which are mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=12}} A third issue was that many of those currents widely recognised as esoteric never concealed their teachings, and in the twentieth century came to permeate popular culture, thus problematizing the claim that esotericism could be defined by its hidden and secretive nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=385|2a1=Von Stuckrad|2y=2005b|2p=81}} Moreover, Hanegraaff noted that when scholars adopt this definition, it shows that they subscribe to the religious doctrines which are espoused by the very groups that they are studying.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=385}}

===Esotericism as an enchanted world view===

[[File:RWS Tarot 01 Magician.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Magician (Tarot)|The Magician]], a [[tarot]] card displaying the Hermetic concept of "as above, so below." Faivre connected this concept to 'correspondences', his first defining characteristic of esotericism]]

Another approach to Western esotericism has treated it as a world view that embraces 'enchantment' in contrast to world views influenced by post-[[René Descartes|Cartesian]], post-[[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]], and [[Positivism|positivist science]] which have sought to '[[Disenchantment|dis-enchant]]' the world.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=5}} Esotericism is therefore understood as comprising those world views which eschew a belief in instrumental [[causality]] and instead adopt a belief that all parts of the universe are interrelated without a need for causal chains.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=5}} It therefore stands as a radical alternative to the disenchanted world views which have dominated Western culture since the [[scientific revolution]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=5}} and must therefore always be at odds with [[secularism|secular]] culture.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=7}}

An early exponent of this definition was the historian of Renaissance thought [[Frances Yates]] in her discussions of a "Hermetic Tradition", which she saw as an 'enchanted' alternative to established religion and rationalistic science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=6–7}} However, the primary exponent of this view was Faivre, who published a series of criteria for how to define "Western esotericism" in 1992.{{sfnm|1a1=Von Stuckrad|1y=2005a|1p=3|2a1=Bogdan|2y=2007|2p=10|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=2013a|3pp=3–4}} Faivre claimed that esotericism was "identifiable by the presence of six fundamental characteristics or components", four of which were "intrinsic" and thus vital to defining something as being esoteric, while the other two were "secondary" and thus not necessarily present in every form of esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=10|2a1=Von Stuckrad|2y=2005a|2p=4|3a1=Bergunder|3y=2010|3p=14|4a1=Hanegraaff|4y=2013a|4p=3}} He listed these characteristics as follows:

# "Correspondences": This is the idea that there are both real and symbolic correspondences existing between all things within the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=10|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=398|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=7}} As examples for this, Faivre pointed to the esoteric concept of the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], often presented as the dictum of "as above, so below", as well as the astrological idea that the actions of the planets have a direct corresponding influence on the behaviour of human beings.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|pp=10–11}}
# "Living Nature": Faivre argued that all esotericists envision the natural universe as being imbued with its own life force, and that as such they understand it as being "complex, plural, hierarchical".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=398|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=7}}
# "Imagination and Mediations": Faivre believed that all esotericists place great emphasis on both the human [[imagination]], and mediations – "such as rituals, symbolic images, mandalas, intermediary spirits" – and mantras as tools that provide access to worlds and levels of reality existing between the material world and the divine.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=398&amp;ndash;399|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=7}}
# "Experience of Transmutation": Faivre's fourth intrinsic characteristic of esotericism was the emphasis that esotericists place on fundamentally transforming themselves through their practice, for instance through the spiritual transformation that it alleged to accompany the attainment of [[gnosis]].{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=13|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=399&amp;ndash;340|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=7}}
# "Practice of Concordance": The first of Faivre's secondary characteristics of esotericism was the belief – held by many esotericists, such as those in the [[Traditionalist School]] – that there is a fundamental unifying principle or root from which all world religions and spiritual practices emerge. The common esoteric principle is that by attaining this unifying principle, the world's different beliefs can be brought together in unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=14|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=8}}
# "Transmission": Faivre's second secondary characteristic was the emphasis on the transmission of esoteric teachings and secrets from a master to their discipline, through a process of [[initiation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=14&amp;ndash;15|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005a|3p=4|4a1=Versluis|4y=2007|4p=8}}

Faivre's form of categorisation has been endorsed by scholars like Goodrick-Clarke,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|pp=7–10}} and by 2007 Bogdan could note that Faivre's had become "the standard definition" of Western esotericism in use among scholars.{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=10}} However, in 2013 the scholar Kennet Granholm stated only that Faivre's definition had been "the dominating paradigm for a long while" and that it "still exerts influence among scholars outside the study of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Granholm|2013b|p=8}} The advantage of Faivre's system is that it allows varying esoteric traditions to be compared "with one another in a systematic fashion".{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005a|p=4}} However, criticisms have also been expressed of Faivre's theory, pointing out its various weaknesses.{{sfnm|1a1=Von Stuckrad|1y=2005a|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=3}} Hanegraaff claimed that Faivre's approach entailed "reasoning by prototype" in that it relied upon already having a "best example" of what Western esotericism should look like, against which other phenomenon then had to be compared.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=4–5}} The scholar of esotericism [[:de: Kocku von Stuckrad]] (born 1966) noted that Faivre's taxonomy was based on his own areas of specialism &amp;ndash; Renaissance Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, and Protestant Theosophy &amp;ndash; and that it was thus not based on a wider understanding of esotericism as it has existed throughout history, from the ancient world to the contemporary period.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005a|p=5}} Accordingly, Von Stuckrad suggested that it was a good typology for understanding "Christian esotericism in the [[early modern period]]" but lacked utility beyond that.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=83}}

===Esotericism as claims to higher knowledge===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Somewhat crudely, esotericism can be described as a Western form of spirituality that stresses the importance of the individual effort to gain spiritual knowledge, or ''gnosis'', whereby man is confronted with the divine aspect of existence.|source=— Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan, 2007.{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=5}} }}

As an alternative to Faivre's framework, Von Stuckrad developed his own variant, although argued that this did not represent a "definition" but rather a "a framework of analysis" for scholarly usage.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=93}} He stated that "on the most general level of analysis", esotericism represented "the claim of higher knowledge", a claim to possessing "wisdom that is superior to other interpretations of cosmos and history" and which serves as a "master key for answering all questions of humankind".{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=88}} Accordingly, he believed that esoteric groups placed a great emphasis on secrecy, not because they were inherently rooted in elite groups but because the idea of concealed secrets that can be revealed was central to their discourse.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=89}} Examining the means of accessing higher knowledge, he highlighted two themes that he believed could be found within esotericism, that of mediation through contact with non-human entities, and individual experience.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|pp=91&amp;ndash;92}} Accordingly, for Von Stuckrad, esotericism could be best understood as "a structural element of Western culture" rather than as a selection of different schools of thought.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=80}}

===Esotericism as "rejected knowledge"===

An additional definition was proposed by Hanegraaff, and holds that "Western esotericism" is a category representing "the academy's dustbin of rejected knowledge."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=13}} In this respect, it contains all of the theories and world views that have been rejected by the mainstream intellectual community because they do not accord with "normative conceptions of religion, rationality and science".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=13}} His approach is rooted within the field of the [[history of ideas]], and stresses the role of change and transformation over time.{{sfn|Bergunder|2010|p=18}}

Goodrick-Clarke was critical of this approach, believing that it relegated Western esotericism to the position of "a casualty of positivist and materialist perspectives in the nineteenth-century" and thus reinforces the idea that Western esoteric traditions were of little historical importance.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=4}} Bogdan similarly expressed concern regarding Hanegraaff's definition, believing that it made the category of Western esotericism "all inclusive" and thus analytically useless.{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=15}}

==History==

===Late Antiquity===
[[File:HermesTrismegistusCauc.jpg|thumb|upright|A later illustration of Hermes Trismegistus]]
The origins of Western esotericism are in the Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean, then part of the [[Roman Empire]], during [[Late Antiquity]], a period encompassing the first centuries of the [[Common Era]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1pp=3, 15|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=18}} This was a milieu in which there was a mix of religious and intellectual traditions from Greece, Egypt, the Levant, Babylon, and Persia, and in which [[globalisation]], [[urbanisation]], and [[multiculturalism]] were bringing about socio-cultural change.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=13|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=18}}

One component of this was [[Hermetism]], an Egyptian Hellenistic school of thought that takes its name from the legendary Egyptian wise man, [[Hermes Trismegistus]].{{sfnm|1a1=Versluis|1y=2007|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=16–20|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=2013a|3p=19}} In the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, a number of texts appeared which were attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, including the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', ''[[Asclepius]]'', and ''[[The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=16–20|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=19}} Although it is still debated as to whether Hermetism was a purely literary phenomenon, or whether there were communities of practitioners who acted on these ideas, it has been established that these texts discuss the true nature of [[God]], emphasising that humans must transcend rational thought and worldly desires in order to find [[salvation]] and be reborn into a spiritual body of immaterial light, thereby achieving spiritual unity with divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=16–20|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=19}}

Another tradition of esoteric thought in Late Antiquity was [[Gnosticism]], which had a complex relationship with [[Christianity]]. Various Gnostic sects existed, and they broadly believed that the divine light had been imprisoned within the material world by a malevolent entity known as the [[Demiurge]], who was served by demonic helpers, the [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]]. It was the Gnostic belief that humans, who were imbued with the divine light, should seek to attain [[gnosis]] and thus escape from the world of matter and rejoin the divine source.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=53|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2pp=27–29|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=2013a|3pp=19–20}}

A third form of esotericism in Late Antiquity was [[Neoplatonism]], a school of thought influenced by the ideas of the philosopher [[Plato]]. Advocated by such figures as [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Iamblichus]], and [[Proclus]], Neoplatonism held that the human soul had fallen from its divine origins into the material world, but that it could progress, through a number of hierarchical spheres of being, to return to its divine origins once more.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=52|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2pp=20–27}} The later Neoplatonists performed [[theurgy]], a ritual practice attested in such sources as the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]''. Scholars are still unsure of precisely what theurgy involved, although it is known that it involved a practice designed to make gods appear, who could then raise the theurgist's mind to the reality of the divine.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2008|1p=25|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=20–21}}

===Middle Ages===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
After the [[fall of Rome]], [[alchemy]] and [[philosophy]] and other aspects of the tradition were largely preserved in the Arab and Near Eastern world and reintroduced into Western Europe by [[Jew]]s and by the cultural contact between [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s in [[Sicily]] and southern Italy. The 12th century saw the development of the [[Kabbalah]] in southern Italy and [[medieval Spain]].

The [[medieval period]] also saw the publication of [[grimoire]]s, which offered often elaborate formulas for [[theurgy]] and [[thaumaturgy]]. Many of the grimoires seem to have kabbalistic influence. Figures in alchemy from this period seem to also have authored or used grimoires.

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
During the [[Renaissance]], a number of European thinkers began to synthesize "[[pagan]]" (that is, not Christian) philosophies, which were then being made available through Arabic translations, with Christian thought and the Jewish [[kabbalah]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=25}} The earliest of these individuals was the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] philosopher [[Plethon]] (1355/60–1452?), who argued that the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' represented an example of a superior religion of ancient humanity which had been passed down by the [[Platonists]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=26}}

Plethon's ideas interested the ruler of Florence, [[Cosimo de Medici]], who employed Florentine thinker [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) to translate Plato's works into Latin. Ficino went on to translate and publish the works of various Platonic figures, arguing that their philosophies were compatible with Christianity, and allowing for the emergence of a wider movement in Renaissance Platonism, or Platonic Orientalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=58|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=26–27}} Ficino also translated part of the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', although the rest would be translated by his contemporary, [[Lodovico Lazzarelli]] (1447–1500).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=27}}

Another core figure in this intellectual milieu was [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494), who achieved notability in 1486 by inviting scholars from across Europe to come and debate the 900 theses that {{clarify|text=he had written with him.|reason=Antecedents unclear. Please identify "he" and "him" and then cite a reference supporting your conclusions. |date=September 2017}} Pico della Mirandola argued that all of these philosophies reflected a grand universal wisdom, however [[Pope Innocent VIII]] condemned these actions, criticising him for attempting to mix pagan and Jewish ideas with Christianity.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=27–28}}

Pico della Mirandola's increased interest in Jewish kabbalah led to his development of a distinct form of [[Christian Kabbalah]]. His work was built on by the German [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) who authored a prominent text on the subject, ''[[De Arte Cabbalistica]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=28–29}} Christian Kabbalah was expanded in the work of the German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535/36), who used it as a framework through which to explore the philosophical and scientific traditions of [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] in his work ''[[De occulta philosophia libri tres]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=29}} The work of Agrippa and other esoteric philosophers had been based in a pre-Copernican worldview, but following the arguments of [[Copernicus]], a more accurate understanding of the cosmos was established. Copernicus' theories were adopted into esoteric strains of thought by [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600), whose ideas would be deemed [[heresy]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], eventually resulting in his public execution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=30}}

[[File:Square compasses.svg|thumb|upright|The Masonic [[Square and Compasses]].]]
A distinct strain of esoteric thought developed in Germany, where it came to be known as ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''; although influenced by traditions from [[Late Antiquity]] and Medieval Kabbalah, it only acknowledged two main sources of authority: [[Biblical scripture]] and the [[Nature (philosophy)|natural world]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=31}} The primary exponent of this approach was [[Paracelsus]] (1493/94–1541), who took inspiration from alchemy and [[folk magic]] to argue against the mainstream medical establishment of his time which, as in Antiquity, still based its approach on the ideas of the second-century physician and philosopher, [[Galen]], a Greek in the Roman Empire. Instead, Paracelsus urged doctors to learn medicine through an observation of the natural world, although in later work he also began to focus on overtly religious questions. His work would gain significant support in both areas over the following centuries.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=61&amp;ndash;63|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=30–31}}

One of those influenced by Paracelsus was the German cobbler [[Jacob Böhme]] (1575–1624), who sparked the [[Christian theosophy]] movement through his attempts to solve the [[problem of evil]]. Böhme argued that God had been created out of an unfathomable mystery, the ''Ungrud'', and that God himself composed of a wrathful core, surrounded by the forces of light and love.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=63&amp;ndash;64|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=32}} Although condemned by Germany's [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] authorities, Böhme's ideas spread and formed the basis for a number of small religious communities, such as [[Johann Georg Gichtel]]'s [[Angelic Brethren]] in [[Amsterdam]], and [[John Pordage]] and [[Jane Leade]]'s [[Philadelphian Society]] in England.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=32–33}}

From 1614 to 1616, the three ''[[Rosicrucian Manifestos]]'' were published in Germany; these texts purported to represent a secret, initiatory brotherhood which had been founded centuries before by a German adept named [[Christian Rosenkreutz]]. There is no evidence that Rosenkreutz was a genuine historical figure, nor that a [[Rosicrucian Order]] had ever existed up to that point. Instead, the [[manifestos]] are likely literary creations of Lutheran theologian [[Johann Valentin Andreae]] (1586–1654). However, they inspired much public interest, with various individuals coming to describe themselves as "Rosicrucian" and claiming that they had access to secret, esoteric knowledge as a result.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=64&amp;ndash;66|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=33–34}}

A real initiatory brotherhood was established in late 16th-century Scotland through the transformation of Medieval stonemason guilds to include non-craftsman: [[Freemasonry]]. Soon spreading into other parts of Europe, in England it largely rejected its esoteric character and embraced humanism and rationalism, while in France it embraced new esoteric concepts, particularly those from Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=35–36}}

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===
[[Image:Hypnotisk seans av Richard Bergh 1887.jpg|thumb|right|''Hypnotic séance''. Painting by Swedish artist [[Richard Bergh]], 1887]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] witnessed a process of increasing secularisation of European governments and an embrace of modern science and rationality within intellectual circles. In turn, a "modernist occult" emerged that reflected varied ways in which esoteric thinkers came to terms with these developments.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=36}} One of the most prominent esotericists of this period was the Swedish naturalist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772), who attempted to reconcile science and religion after experiencing a vision of [[Jesus Christ]]. His writings focused on his visionary travels to heaven and hell and his communications with angels, claiming that the visible, materialist world parallels an invisible spiritual world, with correspondences between the two that do not reflect causal relations. Following his death, followers would found the Swedenborgian [[The New Church|New Church]], although his writings would influence a far wider array of esoteric philosophies.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=72|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=37}} Another major figure within the esoteric movement of this period was the German physician [[Franz Anton Mesmer]] (1734–1814), who developed the theory of [[Animal Magnetism]], which later came to be known more commonly as "Mesmerism". Mesmer claimed that a universal life force permeated everything, including the human body, and that illnesses were caused by a disturbance or block in this force's flow; he developed techniques which he claimed cleansed such blockages and restored the patient to full health.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=76&amp;ndash;77|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=37–38}} One of Mesmer's followers, the [[Marquis de Puységur]], discovered that mesmeric treatment could induce a state of [[somnambulism|somnumbulic]] trance in which they claimed to enter visionary states and communicate with spirit beings.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=38}}

These somnumbulic trance-states would heavily influence the esoteric religion of [[Spiritualism]], which emerged from the United States in the 1840s and spread throughout North American and Europe. Spiritualism was based on the concept that individuals could communicate with spirits of the deceased during [[séances]].{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=87|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=38}} Although most forms of Spiritualism had little theoretical depth, being largely practical affairs, full theological worldviews based on the movement would be articulated by [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910) and [[Allan Kardec]] (1804–1869).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=38}} Scientific interest in the claims of Spiritualism resulted in the development of the field of [[psychical research]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=38}} Somnambulism also exerted a strong influence on the early disciplines of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]; esoteric ideas purvey the work of many early figures in this field, most notably [[Carl Gustav Jung]], although with the rise of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behaviourism]] in the 20th century, these disciplines distanced themselves from esotericism.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=38–39}} Also influenced by artificial somnambulism was the religion of [[New Thought]], founded by the American Mesmerist [[Phineas P. Quimby]] (1802–1866) and which revolved around the concept of "[[mind over matter]]", believing that illness and other negative conditions could be cured through the power of belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=39}}

[[File:Pentagram (Levi).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pentagram of Eliphas Levi]]
In Europe, a movement usually termed "[[occultism]]" emerged as various figures attempted to find a "third way" between Christianity and positivist science while building on the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance traditions of esoteric thought.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=39}} In France, following the social upheaval of the [[1789 Revolution]], various figures emerged in this occultist milieu who were heavily influenced by traditional Catholicism, the most notable of whom were [[Eliphas Lévi]] (1810–1875) and [[Papus]] (1865–1916).{{sfnm|1a1=Strube|1y=2016a|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|pp=39–40}} Also significant was [[René Guénon]] (1886–1951), whose concern with tradition led him to develop an occult viewpoint termed [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]]; it espoused the idea of an original, universal tradition, and thus a rejection of [[modernity]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=40}} His Traditionalist ideas would have a strong influence on later esotericists like [[Julius Evola]] (1898–1974) and [[Frithjof Schuon]] (1907–1998).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=40}}

In the Anglophone world, the burgeoning occult movement owed more to [[Libertine|Enlightenment libertines]], and thus was more often of an anti-Christian bent that saw wisdom as emanating from the pre-Christian pagan religions of Europe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=40}} Various Spiritualist mediums came to be disillusioned with the esoteric thought available, and sought inspiration in pre-Swedenborgian currents; the most prominent of these were [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] (1823–1899) and [[Helena Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), the latter of whom called for the revival of the "occult science" of the ancients, which could be found in both the East and West. Authoring the influential ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), she co-founded the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1pp=93&amp;ndash;94|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2pp=40–41}} Subsequent leaders of the Society, namely [[Annie Besant]] (1847–1933) and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] (1854–1934) interpreted modern theosophy as a form of ecumenical esoteric Christianity, resulting in their proclamation of Indian [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895–1986) as world messiah.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=41}} In rejection of this was the breakaway [[Anthroposophical Society]] founded by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=41}}

New esoteric understandings of magic also developed in the latter part of the 19th century. One of the pioneers of this was American [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] (1825–1875), who argued that sexual energy and psychoactive drugs could be used for magical purposes.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=41}} In England, the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], an initiatory order devoted to magic which based itself on an understanding of kabbalah, was founded in the latter years of the century.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=91|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=2013a|2p=41}} One of the most prominent members of that order was [[Aleister Crowley]] (1875–1947), who went on to proclaim the religion of [[Thelema]] and become a prominent member of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=41–42}} Some of their contemporaries developed esoteric schools of thought that did not entail magic, namely the Greco-Armenian teacher [[George Gurdjieff]] (1866–1949) and his Russian pupil [[P. D. Ouspensky]] (1878–1947).{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=42}}

Emergent occult and esoteric systems found increasing popularity in the early 20th century, especially in Western Europe. Occult lodges and secret societies flowered among European intellectuals of this era who had largely abandoned traditional forms of Christianity. The spreading of secret teachings and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices found enthusiastic adherents in the chaos of Germany during the interwar years. Notable writers such as [[Guido von List]] spread neo-pagan, nationalist ideas, based on [[Wotanism]] and the [[Kabbalah]]. Many influential and wealthy Germans were drawn to secret societies such as the [[Thule Society]]. Thule Society activist [[Karl Harrer]] was one of the founders of the [[German Workers' Party]],&lt;ref name=gilbhard&gt;Hermann Gilbhard: [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_44318 ''Thule-Gesellschaft''].&lt;/ref&gt; which later became the [[Nazi Party]]; some Nazi Party members like [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Rudolf Hess]] were listed as "guests" of the Thule Society, as was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s mentor [[Dietrich Eckart]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9hMP5ZMu6bIC&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'']. London: Tauris Parke Paperbacks 2005, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; After their rise to power, the Nazis persecuted occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VG7e-LnLhEcC&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'']. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press 2004, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; While many Nazi Party leaders like Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]] were hostile to occultism, [[Heinrich Himmler]] used [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] as a clairvoyant "and was regularly consulting for help in setting up the symbolic and ceremonial aspects of the SS" but not for important political decisions. By 1939, Wiligut was "forcibly retired from the SS" due to being institutionalised for insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VG7e-LnLhEcC&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'']. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press 2004, p. 215f.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the German hermetic magic order [[Fraternitas Saturni]] was founded on Easter 1928 and it is one of the oldest continuously running magical groups in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;|Wouter Hanegraaff: "The most important magical secret lodge of the 20th century in the German-speaking world."

The leaders of the lodge emigrated in order to avoid imprisonment, but in the course of the war [[Eugen Grosche]], one of their main leaders, was arrested for a year by the Nazi government.

===Later 20th century===
[[File:Horned God.JPG|upright|thumb|Sculpture of the [[Horned God]] of [[Wicca]] found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]]]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, esotericism came to be increasingly associated with the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|growing counter-culture in the West]], whose adherents understood themselves in participating in a spiritual revolution that would mark the [[Age of Aquarius]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=43}} By the 1980s, these currents of millenarian currents had come to be widely known as the [[New Age movement]], and it became increasingly commercialised as business entrepreneurs exploited a growth in the spiritual market.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=43}} Conversely, other forms of esoteric thought retained the anti-commercial and counter-cultural sentiment of the 1960s and 1970s, namely the [[Neoshamanism|techno-shamanic movement]] promoted by figures such as [[Terence McKenna]] and [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] which built on the work of anthropologist [[Carlos Castaneda]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=43}}

This trend was accompanied by the increased growth of [[modern Paganism]], a movement initially dominated by [[Wicca]], the religion propagated by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=44}} Wicca was adopted by members of the second-wave feminist movement, most notably [[Starhawk]], and developing into the [[Goddess movement]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=44}} Wicca also greatly influenced the development of Pagan [[neo-druidry]] and other forms of Celtic revivalism.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|p=44}} In response to Wicca there has also appeared literature and groups who label themselves followers of [[traditional witchcraft]] in opposition to the growing visibility of Wicca and these claim older roots than the system proposed by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cochrane and the Gardnerian Craft: Feuds, Secrets, and Mysteries in Contemporary British Witchcraft Ethan Doyle White. ''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies''. 2011. pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Other trends which emerged in western occultism in the later 20th century were [[satanism]] as exposed by groups such as the [[Church of Satan]] and [[Temple of Set]],&lt;ref&gt;"Satanism" at Wouter Hannegraaff (ed). ''Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism''. Brill. 2006. pg. 1035&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[chaos magic]]k through the [[Illuminates of Thanateros]] group.&lt;ref&gt;Nevill Drury.

Chaos magick and the legitimacy of innovation". Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm (eds). ''Contemporary esotericism''. Equinox Publishing. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In 2013, Asprem and Granholm highlighted that "contemporary esotericism is intimately, and increasingly, connected with popular culture and new media."{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013|p=6}}

Granholm noted that esoteric ideas and images could be found in many aspects of Western popular media, citing such examples as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Hellblazer]]'', and ''[[His Dark Materials]]''.{{sfn|Granholm|2013a|p=31}} Granholm has argued that there are problems with the field in that it draws a distinction between esotericism and non-esoteric elements of culture which draw upon esotericism; citing the example of [[extreme metal]], he noted that it was incredibly difficult to differentiate between those artists who were "properly occult" and those who simply utilised occult themes and aesthetics in "a superficial way".{{sfn|Granholm|2013b|pp=8–9}}

Writers interested in occult themes have adopted three different strategies for dealing with the subject: those who are knowledgeable on the subject including attractive images of the occult and occultists in their work, those who disguise occultism within "a web of intertextuality", and those who oppose it and seek to deconstruct it.{{sfn|Brînzeu|Szönyi|2011|p=185}}

==Academic study==
{{Main article|Academic study of Western esotericism}}

[[File:Warburg Institute from Woburn Square.jpg|thumb|London's Warburg Institute was one of the first centres to encourage the academic study of Western esotericism]]

The academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that – although it had been ignored by previous scholarship – the effect which pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought had exerted on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=4}} One of the key centres for this was the [[Warburg Institute]] in London, where scholars like [[Frances Yates]], [[Edgar Wind]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater effect on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|pp=4–5}} The work of Yates in particular, most notably her 1964 book ''[[Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition]]'', has been cited as "an important starting-point for modern scholarship on esotericism", succeeding "at one fell swoop in bringing scholarship onto a new track" by bringing wider awareness of the effect that esoteric ideas had on modern science.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005a|p=3}}

At the instigation of the scholar [[Henry Corbin]], in 1965 the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] in the [[Sorbonne]], Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was [[François Secret]], a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah, although he had little interest in developing the wider study of esotericism as a field of research.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=ix|2a1=Von Stuckrad|2y=2005a|2p=3|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005b|3p=81|4a1=Bergunder|4y=2010|4p=11}} In 1979 Faivre assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the "History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Von Stuckrad|2y=2005a|2p=3|3a1=Von Stuckrad|3y=2005b|3p=81|4a1=Bergunder|4y=2010|4p=12}} Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field,{{sfnm|1a1=Versluis|1y=2007|1p=6|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=5}} with his 1992 work ''L'ésotérisme'' having been cited as marking "the beginning of the study of Western esotericism as an academic field of research".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013b|p=179}} He remained in the chair until 2002, when he was succeeded by [[Jean-Pierre Brach]].{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005a|p=3}}

[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Prominent scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]]]]

Faivre noted that there were two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was that there was an engrained prejudice towards esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} The second was that esotericism is a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=ix|2a1=Versluis|2y=2007|2p=6}} As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it "participates in all these fields" it does not squarely fit into any of them.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013a|pp=1–2}} Elsewhere, he noted that there was "probably no other domain in the humanities that has been so seriously neglected" as Western esotericism.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013b|p=198}}

In 1980, the U.S.-based [[Hermetic Academy]] was founded by [[Robert A. McDermott]] as an outlet for American scholars interested in Western esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]] under the rubric of the "Esotericism and Perennialism Group".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented the fact that it had not done so in Germany.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}}

In 1999, the [[University of Amsterdam]] established a chair in the "History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents", which was occupied by Hanegraaff,{{sfnm|1a1=Von Stuckrad|1y=2005a|1p=3|2a1=Von Stuckrad|2y=2005b|2p=81|3a1=Bergunder|3y=2010|3p=12&amp;ndash;13}} while in 2005 the [[University of Exeter]] created a chair in "Western Esotericism", which was taken by Goodrick-Clarke, who headed the Exeter Center for the Study of Esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Von Stuckrad|1y=2005a|1p=3|2a1=Versluis|2y=2007|2p=7}} Thus, by 2008 there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, with Amsterdam and Exeter also offering [[master's degree]] programs in it.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=3}} Several conferences on the subject were held at the quintennial meetings of the [[International Association for the History of Religions]],{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=81}} while a peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Aries (journal)|Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism]]'' began publication in 2001.{{sfn|Von Stuckrad|2005b|p=81}} 2001 also saw the foundation of the North American [[Association for the Study of Esotericism]] (ASE), with the [[European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]] (ESSWE) being established shortly after.{{sfn|Versluis|2007|p=6}}
Within a few years, Michael Bergunder expressed the view that it had become an established field within religious studies,{{sfn|Bergunder|2010|p=9}} with Asprem and Granholm observing that scholars within other sub-disciplines of religious studies had begun to take an interest in the work of scholars of esotericism.{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013|p=1}}

Asprem and Granholm noted that the study of esotericism had been dominated by historians and thus lacked the perspective of [[social science|social scientists]] examining contemporary forms of esotericism, a situation that they were attempting to correct through building links with scholars operating in [[Pagan studies]] and the study of [[new religious movements]].{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}
On the basis of the fact that "English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism", in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that [[English studies]] also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.{{sfn|Brînzeu|Szönyi|2011|p=184}}

===Emic and etic divisions===

Hanegraaff follows a distinction between an “emic” and an “etic” approach to religious studies. The emic approach is that of the alchemist or theosopher as an alchemist or theosopher. The etic approach is that of the scholar as an historian, a researcher, with a critical look. An empirical study of esotericism needs “emic material and etic interpretation”:
{{quote|Emic denotes the believer’s point of view. On the part of the researcher, the reconstruction of this emic perspective requires an attitude of empathy which excludes personal biases as far as possible. Scholarly discourse about religion, on the other hand, is not emic but etic. Scholars may introduce their own terminology and make theoretical distinctions which are different from those of the believers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wouter J. Hanegraaff, ''New Age Religion and Western Culture. Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought'', Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Arthur Versluis]] proposes approaching esotericism through a “sympathetic empiricism”:
{{quote|Esotericism, given all its varied forms and its inherently multidimensional nature, cannot be conveyed without going beyond purely historical information: at minimum, the study of esotericism, and in particular mysticism, requires some degree of imaginative participation in what one is studying.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Versluis, “Methods in the Study of Esotericism, Part II: Mysticism and the Study of Esotericism”, in ''Esoterica'', Michigan State University, V, 2003, 27-40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many scholars of esotericism have come to be regarded as respected intellectual authorities by practitioners of various esoteric traditions.{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013b|p=44}}
Although many scholars of esotericism have sought to emphasise that "esotericism" is not a single object, practitioners who are reading this scholarship have begun to regard it and think of it as a singular object, with which they affiliate themselves.{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013b|pp=43–44}} Thus, Asprem and Granholm noted that the use of the term "esotericism" among scholars "significantly contributes to the reification of the category for the general audience – ''despite'' the explicated contrary intentions of most scholars in the field."{{sfn|Asprem|Granholm|2013b|p=45}}
