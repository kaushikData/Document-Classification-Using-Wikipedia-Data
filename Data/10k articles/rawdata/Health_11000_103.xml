'''Albert I''' (8 April 1875 &amp;ndash; 17 February 1934) reigned as the [[King of the Belgians]] from 1909 to 1934. This was an eventful period in the [[history of Belgium]], which included the period of [[Belgium in World War I|World War I]] (1914–1918), when 90 percent of [[Belgium]] was overrun, occupied, and ruled by the [[German Empire]]. Other crucial issues included the adoption of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ruling of the [[Belgian Congo]] as an overseas possession of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] along with the [[League of Nations]] [[mandated territory|mandate]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]], the reconstruction of Belgium following the war, and the first five years of the [[Great Depression]] (1929–1934). King Albert died in a mountaineering accident in eastern Belgium in 1934, at the age of 58, and he was succeeded by his son [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] ({{reign|1934|1951}}).

==Early life==
[[File:King Albert on one of the first trains of the Belgian Congo.jpg|thumb|King Albert touring the Belgian Congo|left]]
{{House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Belgium)}}
'''Albert Léopold Clément Marie Meinrad''' was born in [[Brussels]], he was the fifth child and second son of [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]], and his wife, [[Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Prince Philippe was the third (second surviving) son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] ({{reign|1831|1865}}), the first [[King of the Belgians]], and his wife, [[Louise-Marie of France]], and the younger brother of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] ({{reign|1865|1909}}). Princess Marie was a relative of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] ({{reign|1888|1918}}), and a member of the non-reigning, Catholic branch of the [[Hohenzollern]] family. Albert grew up in the [[Palace of the Count of Flanders]], initially as third in the line of succession to the Belgian throne as his reigning uncle Leopold II's son had already died. When, however, Albert's older brother, [[Prince Baudouin of Belgium]], who had been subsequently prepared for the throne, also died young, Albert, at the age of 16, unexpectedly became second in line (after his father) to the Belgian Crown.

Retiring and studious, Albert prepared himself strenuously for the task of kingship. In his youth, Albert was seriously concerned with the situation of the working classes in Belgium, and personally travelled around working class districts incognito, to observe the living conditions of the people.&lt;ref name="Bronne"&gt;Carlo Bronne. ''Albert 1er: le roi sans terre''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his accession to the throne in 1909, Albert undertook an extensive tour of the [[Belgian Congo]], which had been annexed by Belgium in 1908 (after having been previously owned by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] as his personal property), finding the country in poor condition. Upon his return to Belgium, he recommended reforms to protect the native population and to further technological progress in the colony.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Evelyn Graham. ''Albert, King of the Belgians''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Albert was married in [[Munich]] on 2 October 1900 to [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Bavarian Duchess Elisabeth Gabrielle Valérie Marie]], a [[Wittelsbach]] princess whom he had met at a family funeral. A daughter of Bavarian Duke [[Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria|Karl-Theodor]], and his second wife, the Infanta [[Maria Josepha of Portugal]], she was born at [[Possenhofen Castle]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], on 25 July 1876, and died on 23 November 1965. 

The civil wedding was conducted by [[Friedrich Krafft Graf von Crailsheim]] in the Throne Hall&lt;ref name="auto"&gt; Albert I;Museum Dynasticum N° .21: 2009/ n° 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the religious wedding was conducted by [[Franz Joseph von Stein|Cardinal von Stein]], assisted by [[Jakob von Türk]], Cofessionar of the King of Bavaria.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Based on the letters written during their engagement and marriage (cited extensively in the memoirs of their daughter, Marie-José) the young couple appear to have been deeply in love. The letters express a deep mutual affection based on a rare affinity of spirit.&lt;ref name="Regolo"&gt;Luciano Regolo. ''La regina incompresa: tutto il racconto della vita di Maria José di Savoia''.&lt;/ref&gt; They also make clear that Albert and Elisabeth continually supported and encouraged each other in their challenging roles as king and queen. The spouses shared an intense commitment to their country and family and a keen interest in human progress of all kinds. Together, they cultivated the friendship of prominent scientists, artists, mathematicians, musicians, and philosophers, turning their court at Laeken into a kind of cultural salon.&lt;ref name="Regolo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie-José"&gt;Marie-José, Queen, Consort of Umberto II, King of Italy. ''Albert et Elisabeth de Belgique, mes parents''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
Albert and Elisabeth had three children:
* '''[[Leopold III of Belgium|Léopold Philippe Charles Albert Meinrad Hubert Marie Miguel]]''', [[Duke of Brabant]], Prince of Belgium, who became later the fourth king of the Belgians as [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] (3 November 1901 &amp;ndash; 25 September 1983, at [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]]).
* '''[[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders|Charles Théodore Henri Antoine Meinrad]]''', Count of Flanders, Prince of Belgium, Prince Regent of Belgium (10 October 1903, in Brussels &amp;ndash; 1 June 1983, at [[Ostend]]).
*'''[[Marie José of Belgium|Marie-José Charlotte Sophie Amélie Henriette Gabrielle]]''', Princess of Belgium (4 August 1906, in [[Ostend]] &amp;ndash; 27 January 2001). She was married at [[Rome]], [[Italy]] on 8 January 1930 to Prince Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria, Prince of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piemonte]] (born 15 September 1904 and died on 18 March 1983 at [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]). He became [[Umberto II of Italy|King Umberto II]] (r. 1946) of [[Italy]].

==Accession==
[[File:Newspaper clipping Albert I King of the Belgians.png|thumb|left|Newspaper compilation in December 1909 shows Albert at top left after inspection of a mine. His wife and children are at bottom right.]]
Following the death of his uncle, [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], Albert succeeded to the Belgian throne in December 1909, since Albert's own father had already died in 1905. Previous Belgian kings had taken the royal accession oath only in French; Albert innovated by taking it in Dutch as well.&lt;ref name="Bronne"/&gt; He and his wife, Queen Elisabeth, were popular in Belgium due to their simple, unassuming lifestyle and their harmonious family life, which stood in marked contrast to the aloof, autocratic manner and the irregular private life of Leopold II. An important aspect of the early years of Albert's reign was his institution of many reforms in the administration of the [[Belgian Congo]], Belgium's only colonial possession.&lt;ref name="Keyes"&gt;Roger Keyes. ''Outrageous Fortune: The Tragedy of Leopold III of the Belgians''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:ID2043-0007-0-Brussel, Zavelkerk-PM 50929.jpg|thumb|King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth praying to Our lady of the Sablon, stained Glass]]
King Albert was a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Regolo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d'Ydewalle"&gt;Charles d'Ydewalle. ''Albert and the Belgians: Portrait of a King''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gérard"&gt;Jo Gérard. ''Albert 1er, insolite: 1934–1984''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stories illustrate his deep and tender piety. For instance, when his former tutor General De Grunne, in his old age, entered the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[Maredsous Abbey|Maredsous]] in Belgium, King Albert wrote a letter to him in which he spoke of the joy of giving oneself to God.&lt;ref name="d'Ydewalle"/&gt; He said: "May you spend many years at Maredsous in the supreme comfort of soul that is given to natures touched by grace, by faith in God's infinite power and confidence in His goodness."&lt;ref name="Gérard"/&gt; To another friend, a Chinese diplomat who became a Catholic monk, Albert wrote: "Consecrating oneself wholly to the service of Our Lord gives, to those touched by grace, the peace of soul which is the supreme happiness here below."&lt;ref name="Gérard"/&gt; Albert used to tell his children: "As you nourish your body, so you should nourish your soul."&lt;ref name="Regolo"/&gt; In an interesting meditation on what he viewed as the harm that would result if Christian ideals were abandoned in Belgium, he said: "Every time society has distanced itself from the Gospel, which preached humility, fraternity, and peace, the people have been unhappy, because the pagan civilisation of ancient Rome, which they wanted to replace it with, is based only on pride and the abuse of force" (Commemorative speech for the war dead of the [[Battle of the Yser]], given by Dom Marie-Albert, Abbot of [[Orval Abbey]], Belgium, in 1936).

==World War I==
[[File:King Albert I of Belgium on battle field.jpg|thumbnail|Albert wearing the uniform of a British infantry officer inspecting the front line with British and Belgian officers.]]
[[File:Uniform Albert I, Koning der Belgen.JPG|thumb|Uniform with war honours]]
At the start of [[World War I]], Albert refused to comply with Germany's request for safe passage for its troops through Belgium in order to attack France, which the Germans alleged was about to advance into Belgium en route to attacking Germany in support of Russia. In fact, the French Government had told its army commander not to go into Belgium before a [[German invasion of Belgium|German invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret MacMillan: The War that Ended the Peace (2013)p.585&lt;/ref&gt; The German invasion brought [[United Kingdom|Britain]] into the war as one of the guarantors of Belgian neutrality under the Treaty of 1839. King Albert, as prescribed by the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian constitution]], took personal command of the [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian Army]], and held the Germans off long enough for [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] to prepare for the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (6–9 September 1914). He led his army through the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Siege of Antwerp]] (28 September – 10 October 1914) and the [[Battle of the Yser]] (16–31 October 1914), when the Belgian Army was driven back to a last, tiny strip of Belgian territory near the North Sea. Here the Belgians, in collaboration with the armies of the [[Triple Entente]], took up a war of position, in the trenches behind the [[River Yser]], remaining there for the next four years. During this period, King Albert fought alongside his troops and shared their dangers, while his wife, Queen Elisabeth, worked as a nurse at the front. During his time on the front, rumours spread on both sides of the lines that the German soldiers never fired upon him out of respect for him being the highest ranked commander in harm's way, while others feared risking punishment by the Kaiser himself, who was his cousin. The King also allowed his 14-year-old son, [[Leopold III of Belgium|Prince Leopold]], to enlist in the Belgian Army as a private and fight in the ranks.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keyes"/&gt;

The war inflicted great suffering on Belgium, which was subjected to a harsh German occupation. The King, fearing the destructive results of the war for Belgium and Europe and appalled by the huge casualty rates, worked through secret diplomatic channels for a negotiated peace between Germany and the Entente based on the "no victors, no vanquished" concept. He considered that such a resolution to the conflict would best protect the interests of Belgium and the future peace and stability of Europe. Since, however, neither Germany nor the Entente were favourable to the idea, tending instead to seek total victory, Albert's attempts to further a negotiated peace were unsuccessful. At the end of the war, as commander of the [[Army Group Flanders]], consisting of Belgian, British and French divisions, Albert led the final offensive of the war that liberated occupied Belgium. King Albert, Queen Elisabeth, and their children then re-entered [[Brussels]] to a hero's welcome.

==Post-war years==
Upon his return to Brussels, King Albert made a speech in which he outlined the reforms he desired to see implemented in Belgium, including [[universal suffrage]] and the establishment of a Flemish University in [[Ghent]].

===Trip to the United States===
[[File:Le Roi à Isleta.jpg|thumb|The King and the Queen during their visit to Isleta pueblo in [[New Mexico]] in 1919, with the [[Governor of New Mexico]] and [[Anton Docher]]]]From 23 September through 13 November 1919, King Albert, Queen [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Elisabeth of Bavaria]], and their son [[Leopold III of Belgium|Prince Leopold]] made an official visit to the [[United States]]. During a visit of the historic [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[pueblo]] of [[Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico]], King Albert decorated [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Father]] [[Anton Docher]] with Knight in the [[Order of Leopold II]].&lt;ref&gt;Keleher and Chant. ''The Padre of Isleta''. Sunstone Press, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Docher offered the King a [[turquoise]] cross mounted in silver made by the Tiwas Indians.&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Keleher. ''The Indian sentinel''. 1920, vol. 2. pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Gance, ''Anton ou la trajectoire d'un père'', L'Harmattan, 2013, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten thousand people travelled to Isleta for this occasion. That same year he was elected an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. 
In New York the King received a [[Ticker tape parade]] in his honour. The visit, which was prepared by his private secretary [[Max-Léo Gérard]], was considered a success by the Belgian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Albert I;Museum Dynasticum N° .21: 2009/ n° 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of universal male suffrage===

In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war "Government of National Union" made up of members of the three main parties in Belgium, the [[Catholic]]s, the Liberals, and the Socialists.&lt;ref name="Bronne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keyes"/&gt; Albert I remembered the [[History of Belgium|Belgian general strike of 1913]], and the promise following that of a [[Constitution]]al reform for an actual ''[[one man, one vote]]'' universal suffrage.

On 18 April 1893, at the end of the [[Belgian general strike of 1893]], universal suffrage, approved by the [[Belgian Parliament]], gave plural votes to individual men based on their wealth, education, and age, but this was clearly not a universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Els Witte, Jan Craeybeckx, Alain Meynen ''Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards'', Academic and Scientific Publishers, Brussels, 2009, p. 278. {{ISBN|978-90-5487-517-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert attempted to mediate between the parties in favour of universal male suffrage and those opposed to it in order to bring about ''one man, one vote'' universal suffrage for men. He succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Charles d'Ydewalle, ''Albert and the Belgians: Portrait of a King'', Translated from the French, by Phyllis Megroz, London, 1935, p. 198 and the following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have named this the ''"conspiracy of Loppem"'' because the ''one man, one vote'' suffrage was effected without changing the [[Constitution of Belgium]].

===Paris Peace Conference===

[[File:ModernEgypt, Fouad I, DHP13402-1-32 01.jpg|thumb|King Albert (left) with his wife and [[King Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I of Egypt]], 1930]]
The Belgian Government sent the King to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in April 1919, where he met with the leaders of France, Britain and the United States. He had four strategic goals:
# to restore and expand the Belgian economy using cash reparations from Germany;
# to assure Belgium's security by the creation of a new buffer state on the left bank of the Rhine;
# to revise the obsolete treaty of 1839;
# to promote a 'rapprochement' between Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.

He strongly advised against a harsh, restrictive treaty against Germany to prevent future German aggression.&lt;ref name="Dujardin"&gt;Vincent Dujardin, Mark van den Wijngaert, et al. ''Léopold III''&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that the dethronement of the princes of Central Europe and, in particular, the dissolution of the [[Habsburg Empire]] would constitute a serious menace to peace and stability on the continent.&lt;ref name="d'Ydewalle"/&gt; The Allies considered Belgium to be the chief victim of the war, and it aroused enormous popular sympathy, but the King's advice played a small role in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret MacMillan, ''Paris 1919'' (2003) pp. 106, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Albert spent much of the remainder of his reign assisting in the post-war reconstruction of Belgium.

In 1920 Albert changed the family name from “[[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Belgium)|Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]” to “[[House of Belgium]]” (''van België'', in Dutch; ''de Belgique'' in French) as a result of strong anti-German sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belgium.be/sites/default/files/downloads/280410_monarchie_EN.pdf|title=The Belgian monarchy|website=Belgium|date=|accessdate=11 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011220130/https://www.belgium.be/sites/default/files/downloads/280410_monarchie_EN.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrored the British royal family's name-change to [[House of Windsor]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/272558033/House-of-Saxe-Coburg-and-Gotha|title=House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|website=Scribd|date=|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was a committed conservationist and in 1925, influenced by the ideas of [[Carl E. Akeley]], he founded Africa's first national park, now known as [[Virunga National Park]], in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. During this period, he was also the first reigning European monarch to visit the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Mark Adams|title=Against Extinction: The Story of Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJ38la9nQdEC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2004|publisher=Earthscan|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:2008 Belgium 12.5 Euro Albert I front.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2008 coinage|Albert I commemorative coin]]]]

A passionate [[alpinist]], King Albert I died in a mountaineering accident while climbing alone on the [[Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu]] at [[Marche-les-Dames]], in the [[Ardennes]] region of Belgium near [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. His death shocked the world and he was deeply mourned, both in Belgium and abroad. Because King Albert was an expert climber, some questioned the official version of his death and suggested that the King was murdered (or even committed suicide) somewhere else and that his body had never been at Marche-les-Dames, or that it was deposited there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Le roi tué|last = NOTERMAN|first = Jacques|publisher = Editions Jourdan le Clercq|year = 2004|isbn = 9782930359069|location = Brussels|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Elisabeth Van België - Een ongewone koningin|last = Raskin|first = Evrard|publisher = Hautekiet|year = 2005|isbn = 905240822X|location = Antwerp|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of those hypotheses with criminal motives were already investigated by the juridical authorities but the doubts have been increased ever since, today still being the subject of popular novels, books and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Le roi Albert: Histoire d'un mythe|last = Van Ypersele|first = Laurence|publisher = Broché|year = 2006|isbn = 978-2804021764|location = Charleroi|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, rumors of murder have been dismissed by most historians. There are two possible explanations for his death according to the official juridical investigations: the first was he leaned against a boulder at the top of the mountain, which became dislodged; or two, the pinnacle to which his rope was belayed had broken, causing him to fall about sixty feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Norman and Betty | last = Donaldson | title = How Did They Die? | year = 1980 | publisher = Greenwich House | isbn = 0-517-40302-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 DNA testing by geneticist Dr. [[Maarten Larmuseau]] and colleagues from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] on bloodstained leaves collected from Marche-les-Dames concluded that King Albert died at that location.&lt;ref&gt;New Historian, 24 July 2016, http://www.newhistorian.com/dna-tests-quash-king-albert-death-conspiracy-theory/6900/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725182425/http://www.newhistorian.com/dna-tests-quash-king-albert-death-conspiracy-theory/6900/ |date=25 July 2016 }} Retrieved 26 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the former kings Leopold I and Leopold II is King Albert interred in the Royal Crypt at the [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]] in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monarchie.be/nl/patrimonium/koninklijke-crypte-van-laken|title=Koninklijke Crypte van Laken|website=Monarchie|date=|accessdate=10 October 2018|language=Dutch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013944/https://www.monarchie.be/nl/patrimonium/koninklijke-crypte-van-laken|archive-date=11 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, prominent Belgian author [[Emile Cammaerts]] published a widely acclaimed biography of King Albert I, titled ''Albert of Belgium: Defender of Right''. In 1993, a close climbing companion of the King, [[Walter Amstutz]], founded the [[King Albert I Memorial Foundation]], an association based in [[Switzerland]] and dedicated to honouring distinguished individuals in the mountaineering world.

To celebrate 175 years of Belgian Dynasty and the 100th anniversary of his accession,&lt;ref name=EMB2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro-master.eu/Belgium/fr-com-2008.htm|title=Belgium commemorative euro coins – 2008|publisher=Euro Master – Online Euro Catalog|accessdate=29 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720161219/http://www.euro-master.eu/Belgium/fr-com-2008.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert I was selected as the main motif of a high-value collectors' coin: the Belgian 12.5 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2008 coinage|Albert I commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

|-
|On his birth, Albert was granted a coat of arms. These were those of the king, differenced by a label gules, with one crescent argent on the central point. When his father died in 1905, the crescent was removed. When he acceded as King, he gained the royal arms (Belgium with [[inescutcheon]] of the shield of Saxony), undifferenced. Finally, after the abolition of the monarchy in Germany and the subsequent loss of his Saxon titles, Albert had the inescutcheon removed in 1921.

Dr '''Alfred Charles Coles''' MD DSc MRCP [[FRSE]] (1866&amp;ndash;1944) was a British physician, microbiologist and academic author. He was described as "a master of the microscope".&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal: 14  October 1944, p.515&lt;/ref&gt; He made major advancements in the understanding of [[Hodgkin’s disease]] and in the blood parasites of both animals and man.&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal: 11 November 1944, p.646&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in [[Bournemouth]] the son of Alfred Case Coles a pharmacist.
He studied Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] graduating MD in 1893. He received a DSc in Public Health in 1903. He became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (London) in 1907. He worked as a physician at the Royal National Sanatorium from 1914 and as a Consultant at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Bournemouth.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1903. His proposers included Sir [[Thomas Richard Fraser]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]], [[Charles Hunter Stewart]] and [[James Buchanan Young]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Being beyond conscription age in the [[First World War]] he served as a volunteer in a military hospital at Mont Dore in France. This appears to have been independent of any regiment as the only Alfred C. Coles on record in the army does not co-relate to his function as a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives: war record cards: Coles, Alfred C.&lt;/ref&gt;

On retiral he continued in his studies plus was a keen ornithologist. He died at his home in Bournemouth on 26 September 1944.

'''Benoît Chamoux''' (19 February 1961 &amp;ndash; 6 October 1995) was a [[French people|French]] [[Mountaineering|Alpinist]], who claimed to have summited 13 of the [[Eight-thousanders]] in the [[Himalaya]]s.

Three of these climbs are disputed and are not formally recorded (Makalu in 1995, Cho Oyu in 1990 and Shishapangma in 1990). His official recorded number of ascents is 10.&lt;ref name="edw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/download.html?func=startdown&amp;id=141|title=Climbers with 10 to 14 MAIN 8000ers|publisher=8000ers.com (Eberhard Jurgalski)|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Keeper-Mountains-Elizabeth-Hawley-Story/dp/1927330157|title=Keeper of the Mountains: The Elizabeth Hawley Story|pages=189–195|publisher=Rocky Mountain Books|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Chamoux was born in [[La Roche-sur-Foron]] near [[Mont Blanc]] in the department of [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]]. He disappeared near the summit of his 14th Himalayan peak, [[Kangchenjunga]] (8586m) on 6 October 1995 with photographer Pierre Royer and their [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] Riku. Three of his [[eight-thousander]] ascents were to either their fore-summits or the plateau, and are disputed.

The non-profit "Foundation Benoît Chamoux" was created under the auspices of the Foundation of France with the mission to educate Sherpa children who have lost their fathers in mountain expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cortinovis|first1=Francesca|title=Oggi moriva Benoit Chamoux, un video per ricordarlo|url=https://www.montagna.tv/cms/98883/oggi-moriva-benoit-chamoux-un-video-per-ricordarlo/|website=montagna.tv|accessdate=5 September 2017|language=Italian|date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''''British Columbia v Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd''''', [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, 2005 SCC 49, is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] where the Court found that the provincial ''[[Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act]]'', which allowed the government to sue tobacco companies, was constitutionally valid.  [[Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.|Imperial Tobacco Canada]] is an indirect subsidiary of [[British American Tobacco]].

==Background==
The [[British Columbia]] government passed the Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act that granted the government power to sue tobacco manufacturers for [[duty of care|breach of duty]] to recover costs on the health care system for people suffering from tobacco related illnesses. The tobacco companies sued under the Act challenged its constitutional validity. 

On June 5, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] found that the Act violated the [[extraterritoriality|territorial limits]] of provincial law and was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal, in May 2004, overturned the decision on the basis that the [[pith and substance]], i.e. the dominant characteristic, of the law fell under the [[property and civil rights]] provision of the Constitution Act, 1867. The challenge against judicial independence, and rule of law were also dismissed.

On June 22, 2004, [[Imperial Tobacco Canada]] appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. On the same day, four other tobacco companies and the [[Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council]] also filed for appeal. On December 17, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and it upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on September 29, 2005.

Three issues were put to the Court:
# Is the Act [[ultra vires]] the province by reason of extraterritoriality?
# Is the Act constitutionally invalid as being inconsistent with [[judicial independence]]?
# Is the Act constitutionally invalid for violating the [[rule of law]]?

The Court answered "no" to all of these issues.

==Opinion of the Court==
The unanimous opinion was written by Major J.

===Extraterritoriality===
Similar to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, Major found that the pith and substance of the Act was within the authority of the province under section 92(13) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. The subject matter of the Act, compensation for health costs, and the effect, suing companies who harmed those in the province, all point at a valid provincial law. No other province has a greater relationship to the [[cause of action]]. The duty breached by the companies in the manufacturing and selling of tobacco has little significance, Major said, on the connection between the cause of action and the province.

===Judicial independence===
At no point during an action under the Act is the independence of the judiciary interfered with. The Court dismissed the suggestion that the shift in burden to the accused or the unconventional rules of procedure and evidence created by the Act have any effect on independence.

===Rule of law===
The tobacco companies had claimed that the retrospectivity and retroactivity of the Act violated the rule of law by creating an unfair trial. Further, they felt that legislation should neither target a particular sector nor confer special privileges on the government.

The rule of law, as protected by the Constitution, does not require that Acts ensure a fair civil trial or avoid giving the government advantages. 

The Supreme Court held that accepting this amorphous conception of the rule of law would render several provisions of the Charter redundant because they are more narrowly formulated.

==Significance==
The Court limited the four unwritten principles of the Constitution, which were outlined in ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]''.  It reaffirmed that a textual basis for review must be submitted because of the stability and predictability provided by a written constitution. 

"Because of this ruling, Canada became the first country outside the United States where governments can sue tobacco manufacturers to recover smoking-related healthcare costs; as much as $10 billion in costs was at stake in this B.C. case. Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan have since drafted or adopted legislation based on this B.C. model."&lt;ref&gt;Case comment at http://www.emp.ca/downloads/adminlaw/AdminLaw_04_c2_BritishColumbia.doc{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that possession is punishable by 12 months and $12,000 (summary) or 2 years and $20,000 (on indictment). Supplying, production, or importation are punishable by 3 years and $100,000 (summary) or 14 years and $200,000 (on indictment).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.dominica.gov.dm/laws/chapters/chap40-07.pdf |title = Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act, Chapter 40:07 |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the US government described Dominica as a minor cannabis producer but "increasingly exploited transit route", with some cannabis cultivated on the island but mostly consumed locally. In 1994 Dominican authorities seized 741&amp;nbsp;kg of cannabis and eradicated 48,855 plants.&lt;ref name="Company1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=DIANE Publishing Company|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0DlWjK3YCEC&amp;pg=PA195|date=1 August 1995|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2057-2|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report noted that Dominica had large-scale cannabis cultivation for both trafficking and local use, with an estimated 210 acres of cannabis cultivated annually.&lt;ref name="Brownfield2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William R.

The theory also puts forward the notion that ''natural'' categories are [[convex set|convex]] regions in conceptual spaces.&lt;ref name="ZenkerGärdenfors2015"/&gt;{{rp|5}} In that if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are elements of a category, and if &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is also likely to belong to the category. The notion of concept convexity allow the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category [[prototype theory|prototypes]]. In the more general formulations of the theory, concepts are defined in terms conceptual similarity to their prototypes.

These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[high cholesterol]].&lt;ref name="CDC2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/physicalactivity/physicalactivity.htm|title=N C H S - Health E Stats -  Physical Activity Among Adults: United States, 2000 and 2005|work=CDC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active transport (walking, bicycling, etc.) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassett DR, Pucher J, Buehler R, Thompson DL, Crouter SE|title=Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America, and Australia|journal=J Phys Act Health|volume=5|issue=6|pages=795–814|date=November 2008|pmid=19164816|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

==Causes of lack of exercise==
{{See also|Sedentary lifestyle|Lack of physical education}}
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization.  As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;

Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Young People|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_women/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Women|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_olderadults/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Older Adults|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 population study in south Brazil showed physical inactivity during leisure time to be more prevalent among females and those living with a partner; with a positive correlation associated with age and number of cigarettes smoked, and a negative correlation (decreased levels of physical inactivity) associated with years of formal education, body mass index, and increasing socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=Brazil2005/&gt;

Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the [[prevalence]] of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gortmaker SL, Must A, Sobol AM, Peterson K, Colditz GA, Dietz WH|title=Television viewing as a cause of increasing obesity among children in the United States, 1986–1990|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|volume=150|issue=4|pages=356–62|date=April 1996|pmid=8634729|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290022003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vioque J, Torres A, Quiles J|title=Time spent watching television, sleep duration and obesity in adults living in Valencia, Spain|journal=Int.

Emanuel|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause in the case of children is that physical activity in activities from self-propelled transport, to school physical education, and organized sports is declining in many countries.&lt;ref name="Kids2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L|title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=39|issue=12|pages=892–7; discussion 897|date=December 2005|pmid=16306494|pmc=1725088|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
[[Noncommunicable diseases]], partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest [[public health]] problem in most countries around the world.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;  Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Why "Move for Health"|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which makes inactivity one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9524|pages=1747–57|date=May 2006|pmid=16731270|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==

===Australia===
Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomkinson GR, Olds TS|title=Secular changes in aerobic fitness test performance of Australasian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=168–82|year=2007|pmid=17387257|doi=10.1159/0000101361|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts.  In Canada, 27.0% of [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] men are obese as opposed to 19.6% of active men.&lt;ref name="Tjepkema2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tjepkema M|chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight|title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=2005-07-06|location=Ottawa, Ontario|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean people are more fidgety than their obese counterparts; this relationship is maintained even if normal weight people eat more or the obese person loses weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levine JA, Lanningham-Foster LM, McCrady SK, Krizan AC, Olson LR, Kane PH, Jensen MD, Clark MM|title=Interindividual variation in posture allocation: Possible role in human obesity|journal=Science|year=2005|pages=584–6|volume=307|issue=5709|pmid=15681386|doi=10.1126/science.1106561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day.  As well, although 2/3 of families live close enough for their children to bike or walk to school, only 1/3 report actually walking to school and 80% report never having cycled to school.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Asia and China===
A study from China found [[urbanization]] reduced daily energy expenditure by about 300–400 kcal and going to work by car or bus reduced it by a further 200 kcal.&lt;ref name="James2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=James WP|title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic|journal=Obes Rev|volume=9|issue=s1|pages=6–13|date=March 2008|pmid=18307693|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s.  The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities.&lt;ref name="FAOChina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0442e/a0442e06.htm|title=The double burden of malnutrition Case studies from six developing countries|work=Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor.  This decreased to 51% in the year 2000.&lt;ref name=FAOChina/&gt;

Among Asian children between 1917 and 2003 little change has been seen in power and speed however endurance has decreased substantially in the last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macfarlane DJ, Tomkinson GR|title=Evolution and variability in fitness test performance of Asian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=143–67|year=2007|pmid=17387256|doi=10.1159/0000101358|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]] leisure-time physical activity has increased, while occupational and commuting physical activity has decreased from 1972 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Fin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borodulin K, Laatikainen T, Juolevi A, Jousilahti P|title=Thirty-year trends of physical activity in relation to age, calendar time and birth cohort in Finnish adults|journal=Eur J Public Health|volume=18|issue=3|pages=339–44|date=June 2008|pmid=17875578|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm092|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leisure-time physical activity increased from 66% (1972) to 77% (2002) in men and from 49% (1972)to 76% (2002) in women.  Physically demanding work decreased from 60% (1972) to 38% (2002) in men and from 47% (1972) to 25% (2002) in women.  Daily commuting activity decreased from 30% (1972) to 10% (2002) in men and from 34% (1972) to 22% (2002) in women.&lt;ref name=Fin2008/&gt;

===Netherlands===
As of 2007 [[walking]] and [[cycling]] as a means of transport In the [[Netherlands]] has been stable since 1994. The average Dutch citizen in the year 2007 walked {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} and cycled {{convert|908|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37338&amp;D1=2&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=6-7&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=a&amp;HDR=G1,T,G4,G2&amp;STB=G3,G5&amp;VW=T|title=statline.cbs.nl|work=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|accessdate=Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossFit has been a trend in The Netherlands since 2012. It is a unique training program that combines a [[physical exercise]] philosophy and a competitive fitness sport.  '''CrossFit''' workouts use elements from [[high-intensity interval training]], [[Olympic weightlifting]], [[plyometrics]], [[powerlifting]], [[gymnastics]] and other exercises. It is very successful around the world and has 13,000 members in affiliated [[Gym|gyms]].

Personal training is gaining more and more popularity in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. A '''personal trainer''' is a trainer certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback to clients. 

Obstacle training centrums are very popular in The Netherlands since companies like [[:nl:Unitedfit|UNITEDFIT]] have included the social aspect to training for an obstacle course. An '''obstacle course''' is a series of challenging physical obstacles an individual or a team need to complete while being timed. Obstacle courses can include [[running]], [[climbing]], [[jumping]], [[Crawling (human)|crawling]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], and [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] elements with the aim of testing speed and endurance. Sometimes a course involves [[Mind|mental]] tests.

===South America===
Over 60% of the population of [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]] do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity needed to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14662071|volume=14|issue=4|title=Rapid changes in lifestyle make increased physical activity a priority for the Americas|date=October 2003|vauthors=Jacoby E, Bull F, Neiman A|journal=Rev.

===Sweden===
A study of Swedish males found a significant decrease in total physical exercise even though recreational exercise has increased.  This was due to a decrease in work place exercise and physical exercise in transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norman A, Bellocco R, Vaida F, Wolk A|title=Age and temporal trends of total physical activity in Swedish men|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=35|issue=4|pages=617–22|date=April 2003|pmid=12673145|doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000058357.23080.F4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Leisure_inactivity_2007.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the trend in the proportion of the U.S. population which reported no leisure-time physical activity, 1988 - 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/physical/stats/leisure_time.htm|title=Physical Activity Statistics: No Leisure-Time Physical Activity Trend Chart &amp;#124; DNPAO &amp;#124; CDC|work=WHO|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Americans have become less [[Physical exercise|physically active]] overall between 1955 and 2005.&lt;ref name="America2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brownson RC, Boehmer TK, Luke DA|title=Declining rates of physical activity in the United States: what are the contributors?|journal=Annu Rev Public Health|volume=26|issue=1|pages=421–43|year=2005|pmid=15760296|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144437|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the rate of leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly there has been a decrease in work-related activity, human powered transportation, activity in the home, and increasing [[sedentary lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=America2005/&gt;  During 2000 and 2005 the number of adults who were never physically active increased from 9.4% to 10.3% while the number who were engaged in the highest level of physical activity decreased from 18.7% to 16.7%.  Pertaining to leisure-time physical activity, people involved in no activity increased from 38.5% to 40.0% while those who spent most of their day sitting increased from 36.8% to 39.9%.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

In 2000 the CDC estimated that more than 40% of the US population was sedentary, another 30% was active but not sufficiently and less than 30% had an adequate level of physical activity.&lt;ref name="Caballero"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caballero B|title=The global epidemic of obesity: An overview|journal=Epidemiol Rev|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–5|year=2007|pmid=17569676|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm012|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a trend toward decreased physical activity in part due to increasingly mechanized forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.  Obesity rates have increased in relation to expanding suburbs. This has been attributed to increased time spent commuting, leading to less exercise and less meal preparation at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lopez R|title=Urban sprawl and risk for being overweight or obese|journal=Am J Public Health|year=2004|pages=1574–9|volume=94|issue=9|pmid=15333317|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.9.1574|pmc=1448496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time between 1983 and 1990 the number of trips taken by foot decreased from 9% down to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French SA, Story M, Jeffery RW|title=Environmental influences on eating and physical activity|journal=Annu Rev Public Health|volume=22|issue=1|pages=309–35|year=2001|pmid=11274524|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.309|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School run|Driving one's children to school]] has become increasingly popular. In the USA the proportion of children who walk or bike to school declined between 1969 (42%) and 2001 (16%) resulting in less exercise.&lt;ref name="Caballero" /&gt;

'''First aid''' is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden [[illness]] or [[injury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=First aid manual: 9th edition|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978 1 4053 3537 9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) while awaiting an [[ambulance]], as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a [[laceration|cut]]. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training. [[Mental health first aid]] is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental  health.

There are many situations which may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an [[Automated External Defibrillator|automated external defibrillator]]), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. First aid, however, does not necessarily require any particular equipment or prior knowledge, and can involve improvisation with materials available at the time, often by untrained people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CPR Seattle|title=Duct tape for the win!

First aid can be performed on all mammals, although this article relates to the care of human patients.

==Early history and warfare==

Skills of what is now known as first aid have been recorded throughout history, especially in relation to [[warfare]], where the care of both [[injury|traumatic]] and medical cases is required in particularly large numbers. The [[bandage|bandaging]] of battle wounds is shown on [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] pottery from c. 500 BCE, whilst the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]] includes references to binding or dressing wounds.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The British Medical Journal|title=The earliest days of first aid|last=Pearn|first=John|year=1994|volume=309|pages=1718–1720|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6970/1718?hwoasp=authn%3A1410435630%3A43629789%3A1452198704%3A0%3A0%3ACcwwDY32APVggSjWijUy6w%3D%3D|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6970.1718|pmid=7820000|pmc=2542683|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002329/http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6970/1718?hwoasp=authn%3A1410435630%3A43629789%3A1452198704%3A0%3A0%3ACcwwDY32APVggSjWijUy6w%3D%3D|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous references to first aid performed within the [[Roman army]], with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JAMA Surgery|title=Blood in Our Streets: The Status and Evolution of Trauma Care Systems|last=Eastman|first=A Brent|year=1992|volume=127|issue=6|pages=677–681|url=http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=595395|doi=10.1001/archsurg.1992.01420060043008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195805/http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=595395|archivedate=2014-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern [[combat medic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=ADF Health|title=A history of first aid and its role in armed forces|last=Efstathis|first=Vlas|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_nov99/ADFHealthNov99_1_1_42-44.pdf|date=November 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130145638/http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_nov99/ADFHealthNov99_1_1_42-44.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in the 11th century CE, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name=medicinenet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52749|title=First Aid: From Witchdoctors &amp; Religious Knights to Modern Doctors|accessdate=March 23, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118055846/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52749|archivedate=January 18, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formalization of life saving treatments===
During the late 18th century, [[drowning]] as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in [[Amsterdam]], and in 1773, physician [[William Hawes]] began publicizing the power of [[artificial respiration]] as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned.  This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned, later the [[Royal Humane Society]], who did much to promote resuscitation.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, Vol. 193 No. 2586 (13–19 Jan 2007), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Price|title=Everyday Heroism: Victorian Constructions of the Heroic Civilian|publisher=Bloomsbury: London|year=2014|ISBN=978-1-4411066-5-0|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]]'s surgeon, [[Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey]], is credited with creating an ambulance corps (the ambulance volantes), which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle.

In 1859 [[Jean-Henri Dunant]] witnessed the aftermath of the [[Battle of Solferino]], and his work led to the formation of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], with a key stated aim of "aid to sick and  wounded soldiers in the field".&lt;ref name=medicinenet/&gt;  The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/en/What-we-do/First-aid/Event-first-aid-and-ambulance-support|title=Event first aid and ambulance support|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908033750/http://www.redcross.org.uk/en/What-we-do/First-aid/Event-first-aid-and-ambulance-support|archivedate=2014-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esmarch original.jpg|[[Esmarch bandage]] showing soldiers how to perform first aid|thumb]]

In 1870, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military surgeon [[Friedrich von Esmarch]] introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term "erste hilfe" (translating to 'first aid'), including training for soldiers in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the [[Esmarch bandage]] which he designed.&lt;ref name=early/&gt;  The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses.

In 1872, the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England]] changed its focus from hospice care, and set out to start a system of practical medical help, starting with making a grant towards the establishment of the UK's first [[ambulance]] service.  This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day [[St John Ambulance]]) "to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded".&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher NC. The St John Ambulance Association: its history and its past in the ambulance movement. London: St John Ambulance Association, 1929:12–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the UK, [[Peter Shepherd (British Army officer)|Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd]] had seen the advantages of von Esmarch's new teaching of first aid, and introduced an equivalent programme for the British Army, and so being the first user of "first aid for the injured" in English, disseminating information through a series of lectures.    Following this, in 1878, Shepherd and [[Francis Duncan|Colonel Francis Duncan]] took advantage of the newly charitable focus of St John,&lt;ref name=early/&gt; and established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians.  The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum.

First aid training began to spread through the [[British Empire]] through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sja.org.uk/history/victorian_britain.asp Industrial Revolution: St. John Ambulance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220111208/http://www.sja.org.uk/history/victorian_britain.asp |date=2007-02-20 }}, retrieved December 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized in three key points, sometimes known as 'the three Ps':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidents and first aid|publisher=NHS Direct|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=450|accessdate=2008-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503201513/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=450 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Preserve life ===
The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death.
=== Prevent further harm === 
Prevent further harm also sometimes called '''prevent the condition from worsening''', or '''danger of further injury''', this covers both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed becoming dangerous.
=== Promote recovery === 
First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound.

It is important to note that first aid is not medical treatment and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in best interest of an injured person.

==Key skills==
[[File:Tongue blocking airway.svg|right|thumb|300px|In case of tongue fallen backwards, blocking the airway, it is necessary to hyperextend the head and pull up the chin, so that the tongue lifts and clears the airway.]]

Certain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously. Particularly the "[[ABC (medicine)|ABC]]"s of first aid, which focus on critical life-saving intervention, must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries. &lt;!-- Before editing this section to change circulation to Compressions, please read the article at ABC (medicine) --&gt;ABC stands for ''Airway'', ''Breathing'', and ''Circulation''&lt;ref&gt;Resuscitation, Volume 41, Issue 1, June 1999, Pages 3-18, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300957299000349
&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;!-- Before editing this section to change Circulation to Compressions, please read the article at ABC (medicine) --&gt; The same [[mnemonic]] is used by all [[emergency medicine|emergency health professionals]]. Attention must first be brought to the [[airway]] to [[basic airway management|ensure it is clear]]. [[airway obstructions|Obstruction]] ([[choking]]) is a life-threatening emergency. Following evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of [[breath]]ing and provide [[rescue breathing]] if necessary. Assessment of [[Circulatory system|circulation]] is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but [[pulse]] checks may be done on less serious patients.

Some organizations add a fourth step of "D" for ''[[Bleeding|Deadly bleeding]]'' or ''[[Defibrillation]]'', while others consider this as part of the ''Circulation'' step simply referred as Disability. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider.  Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments or examination, as required if they possess the proper training (such as measuring pupil dilation)&lt;ref&gt;A systematic approach to the acutely ill patient, June 2005 https://web.archive.org/web/20050718074705/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/alsABCDE.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the "3Bs": ''Breathing'', ''Bleeding'', and ''Bones'' (or "4Bs": ''Breathing'', ''Bleeding'', ''Burns'', and ''Bones''). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both [[artificial respiration]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|chest compressions]] to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of [[cervical spine]] injuries when ensuring an open airway.

=== Preserving life ===
To save a person's life, you need to have an open airway so it makes a clear passage where air can go through the [[mouth]] or [[human nose|nose]] through the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] and down into the lungs, without obstruction. [[Conscious]] people will maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a [[Glasgow coma scale|GCS]] of less than 8) may be unable to maintain a patent airway, as the part of the brain which automatically controls breathing in normal situations may not be functioning.

If the patient was breathing, a first aider would normally then place them in the [[recovery position]], with the patient leant over on their side, which also has the effect of clearing the tongue from the [[pharynx]]. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.

The airway can also become blocked through a foreign object becoming lodged in the pharynx or larynx, commonly called [[choking]]. The first aider will be taught to deal with this through a combination of ‘back slaps’ and ‘[[abdominal thrusts]]’.

Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would assess to see if the patient is breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally, such as [[agonal breathing]], the first aider would undertake what is probably the most recognized first aid procedure—CPR, which involves breathing for the patient, and manually massaging the heart to promote blood flow around the body.

If the chocking person is an infant, the aide will give five strong blows in the infant’s upper back by placing the infant’s face down on his forearm. The aide will be taught not to provide first aid if the infant is able to cough or cry. Coughing and crying indicate the airway is open and the foreign object will likely to come out from the force the coughing or crying produce &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choking- infant under 1 year |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000048.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first responder also will be educated on how to perform CPR along with using Automatic External Defibrillation (AED) for a person who is having a sudden cardiac arrest.  Survival rate in people who had cardiac arrest outside of hospital is low. The lack of oxygen supply to the brain for five minutes will cause permanent brain damage, so quick action is very important to save the person’s life. AED is a device that examine a heartbeat and give shock to restart the heart. AEDs were developed to allow first responders to successfully deliver shocks after seeing diagrams and auditory instructions of the device&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nessel |first1=Edward |title=Treating Sudden Cardiac Arrest and the Use of Automated External Defibrillators in the Community Setting |journal=Acadamic |date=2012 |volume=25 |page=9 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=71947370&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aider is also likely to be trained in dealing with injuries such as [[wounds|cuts]], [[Abrasion (medical)|grazes]] or [[bone fracture]]. They may be able to deal with the situation in its entirety (a small adhesive bandage on a paper cut), or may be required to maintain the condition of something like a broken bone, until the next stage of definitive care (usually an [[ambulance]]) arrives.

==Training==
[[File:Suicide-prague.jpg|thumb|First aid scenario training in progress]]

Basic principles, such as knowing to use an adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs ''before'' an actual [[emergency]], and in many countries, emergency ambulance dispatchers may give basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way.

Training is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the [[Red Cross]] and [[St. John Ambulance]], or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes.

===types of first aid which require training===
There are several types of first aid (and first aider) which require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken.
* '''Aquatic/Marine first aid''' is usually practiced by professionals such as [[lifeguards]], professional [[mariner]]s or in [[diver rescue]], and covers the specific problems which may be faced after water-based rescue or delayed [[MedEvac]].
* '''[[Battlefield medicine|Battlefield first aid]]''' takes into account the specific needs of treating wounded [[combatants]] and [[non-combatants]] during [[armed conflict]].
* '''[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric]] first aid''' may be practiced by [[underwater diving]] professionals, who need to treat conditions such as [[decompression sickness]].
* '''[[Oxygen therapy|Oxygen]] first aid''' is the providing of oxygen to casualties who suffer from conditions resulting in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. It is also a standard first aid procedure for underwater diving incidents where gas bubble formation in the tissues is possible.
* '''[[Wilderness first aid]]''' is the provision of first aid under conditions where the arrival of emergency responders or the evacuation of an injured person may be delayed due to constraints of terrain, weather, and available persons or equipment. It may be necessary to care for an injured person for several hours or days.
* '''[[Mental health first aid]]''' is taught independently of physical first aid.  How to support someone experiencing a mental health problem or in a crisis situation.  Also how to identify  the first signs of someone developing mental ill health and guide people towards appropriate help.

==First aid services==
[[File:First aider in parade.jpg|First aider of the [[British Red Cross]] accompanies parade of morris dancers at the [[Knutsford]] Royal May Day 2012|thumb]]

Some people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather.  They may be designated as a '''first aider''', or use some other title.  This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance, or as paid employment with a medical contractor

People performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed.

==Symbols==
{{details|Emblems of the Red Cross#Use of the emblems}}
Although commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the [[Red Cross]]. According to the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international laws, the use of this and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Protection symbols vs. organizational emblems|similar symbols]] is reserved for official agencies of the '''[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent]]''', and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution.

The internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below.

Some organizations may make use of the [[Star of Life]], although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the [[Maltese Cross]], like the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] and [[St John Ambulance]]. Other symbols may also be used.

==Conditions that often require first aid==
''Also see [[medical emergency]].''
* [[Altitude sickness]], which can begin in susceptible people at altitudes as low as 5,000 feet, can cause potentially fatal [[High altitude cerebral edema|swelling of the brain]] or [[High altitude pulmonary edema|lungs]].&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments.

* [[Anaphylaxis]], a life-threatening condition in which the airway can become constricted and the patient may go into [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The reaction can be caused by a systemic allergic reaction to [[allergen]]s such as insect bites or peanuts. Anaphylaxis is initially treated with injection of [[epinephrine]].
* [[Battle]]field first aid—This protocol refers to treating shrapnel, gunshot wounds, burns, bone fractures, etc. as seen either in the ‘traditional’ battlefield setting or in an area subject to damage by large-scale weaponry, such as a [[bomb]] blast.
* [[Bone fracture]], a break in a bone initially treated by stabilizing the fracture with a [[splint (medical)|splint]].
* [[Burn (injury)|Burns]], which can result in damage to tissues and loss of body fluids through the burn site.
* [[Cardiac Arrest]], which will lead to death unless CPR preferably combined with an AED is started within minutes. There is often no time to wait for the emergency services to arrive as 92 percent of people suffering a sudden cardiac arrest die before reaching hospital according to the American Heart Association.
* [[Choking]], blockage of the airway which can quickly result in death due to lack of [[oxygen]] if the patient’s trachea is not cleared, for example by the [[Heimlich Maneuver]].
* [[Childbirth]].
* [[Cramp]]s in muscles due to lactic acid build up caused either by inadequate oxygenation of muscle or lack of water or salt.
* [[Diving disorders]], [[drowning]] or [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=Longphre&gt;{{cite journal |last=Longphre |first=John M. |author2=Petar J. DeNoble |author3=Richard E. Moon |author4=Richard D.

* Gender-specific conditions, such as [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[testicular torsion]].
* [[Myocardial infarction|Heart attack]], or inadequate blood flow to the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.
* Heat stroke, also known as sunstroke or [[hyperthermia]], which tends to occur during heavy exercise in high humidity, or with inadequate water, though it may occur spontaneously in some chronically ill persons. Sunstroke, especially when the victim has been unconscious, often causes major damage to body systems such as brain, kidney, liver, gastric tract. [[Coma|Unconsciousness for more than two hours]] usually leads to permanent disability. Emergency treatment involves rapid cooling of the patient.
* [[Hair tourniquet]] a condition where a hair or other thread becomes tied around a toe or finger tightly enough to cut off blood flow.
* [[Heat syncope]], another stage in the same process as heat stroke, occurs under similar conditions as heat stroke and is not distinguished from the latter by some authorities.
* Heavy bleeding, treated by applying pressure (manually and later with a [[pressure bandage]]) to the wound site and elevating the limb if possible.
* [[Hyperglycemia]] ([[diabetic coma]]) and [[Hypoglycemia]] ([[insulin shock]]).
* [[Hypothermia]], or Exposure, occurs when a person’s core body temperature falls below 33.7&amp;nbsp;°C (92.6&amp;nbsp;°F). First aid for a mildly hypothermic patient includes rewarming, which can be achieved by wrapping the affected person in a blanket, and providing warm drinks, such as soup, and high energy food, such as chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=British Red Cross|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/en/What-we-do/First-aid/Everyday-First-Aid/Hypothermia|title=Everyday First Aid – Hypothermia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129073614/http://www.redcross.org.uk/en/What-we-do/First-aid/Everyday-First-Aid/Hypothermia|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rewarming a severely hypothermic person could result in a fatal [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], an irregular heart rhythm.&lt;ref name=sterba&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sterba, JA |title=Field Management of Accidental Hypothermia during Diving |journal=[[US Naval Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report]] |volume=NEDU-1-90 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224238/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insect and animal [[bite (medicine)|bites]] and stings.
* [[Joint dislocation]].
* [[Poison]]ing, which can occur by injection, inhalation, absorption, or ingestion.
* [[Seizures]], or a malfunction in the electrical activity in the brain. Three types of seizures include a grand mal (which usually features convulsions as well as temporary respiratory abnormalities, change in skin complexion, etc.) and petit mal (which usually features twitching, rapid blinking, or fidgeting as well as altered consciousness and temporary respiratory abnormalities).
* [[Strain (injury)|Muscle strains]] and [[Sprain]]s, a temporary [[dislocation]] of a [[joint (anatomy)|joint]] that immediately reduces automatically but may result in ligament damage.
* [[Stroke]], a temporary loss of blood supply to the brain.
* [[Toothache]], which can result in severe pain and loss of the tooth but is rarely life-threatening, unless over time the infection spreads into the bone of the jaw and starts [[osteomyelitis]].
* [[Wound]]s and [[bleeding]], including [[laceration]]s, [[wound|incision]]s and [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]], [[Gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[Avulsion injury|avulsions]] and [[Pneumothorax|Sucking chest wounds]], treated with an [[occlusive dressing]] to let air out but not in.

Many accidents can happen at home, office, schools, laboratories etc. which require immediate attention before the patient is attended by the doctor.

===First aid kits===
A first aid kit consists of a strong, durable bag or transparent plastic box. They are commonly identified with a white cross on a green background. A first aid kit does not have to be bought ready-made. The advantage of ready-made first aid kits are that they have well organized compartments and familiar layouts.

===Contents===
There is no universally agreed upon list for the contents of a first aid kit.

'''The Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library''' is a library of [[psychoactive drug]]-related literature created in 1970 by [[Michael D. Horowitz]], [[Cynthia Palmer]], William Dailey, and Robert Barker, who merged their private libraries. It was named for [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]], author of the first full-length work of drug literature written by an American, ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]'' (1857).  It was the largest such library in the world and was based in [[San Francisco, California]]. The Ludlow Library became part of the Ludlow Santo Domingo Library in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2003. After the death of its owner, [[Julio Mario Santo Domingo, Jr.]], his family loaned the book collection to the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the music collection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

During the 1970s the library grew rapidly and operated out of San Francisco as an international resource for psychoactive drug research, and for the study of psychoactive drug use in contemporary and historical societies. The Ludlow Library flourished during a period of perhaps the most intense media interest ever focused on the personal, social, scientific and political aspects of drug experience. The Library helped hundreds of writers, filmmakers, and news media researchers collect accurate historical information on cannabis, the opiates, coca and cocaine, and psychedelics for their publications.

The library was curated by [[Michael R. Aldrich]], holder of the first Ph.D. ever granted from an American university in the mythology and folklore of cannabis (SUNY-Buffalo, 1970), and he and his wife Michelle Aldrich joined the co-founders as members of the Board of Directors in 1974. The Library's advisory Board of Trustees included a number of eminent researchers and writers, including [[Chauncey Leake]], [[Richard Evans Schultes]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Alexander Shulgin]], [[Andrew Weil]], [[Oscar Janiger]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Laura Huxley]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Weston LaBarre]], [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Tod H. Mikuriya]], and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]].

A '''gait trainer''' is a wheeled device that [[Assistive technology|assists]] a person who is unable to walk independently to learn or relearn to walk safely and efficiently as part of [[gait training]]. Gait trainers are intended for children or adults with physical disabilities, to provide the opportunity to improve [[walking]] ability. A gait trainer offers both unweighting support and postural alignment to enable gait practice. It functions as a support walker and provides more assistance for balance and weight-bearing, than does a traditional rollator walker, or a walker with platform attachments. It also provides opportunities to stand and to bear weight in a safe, supported position.

Various movement disorders can result in the inability to walk independently, necessitating the use of a gait trainer. Such motor disability may be due to a medical condition from childhood, such as [[cerebral palsy]], [[spina bifida]], or other [[developmental disabilities]]. Or, walking impairment may be due to a later injury or illness, such as a [[traumatic brain injury]], incomplete [[spinal cord injury]] or [[stroke]]. Regardless of the cause of [[disability]], the child or adult may learn to walk, or recover the ability to walk, through walking practice. Recent discoveries in the field of [[neuroplasticity]] indicate the human potential for improvement in motor skills through activity-based therapy, despite neural damage from condition or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadowsky |first1=Cristina L. |last2=McDonald |first2=John W. |title=Activity-based restorative therapies: Concepts and applications in spinal cord injury-related neurorehabilitation |journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=112–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19489091 |doi=10.1002/ddrr.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17012056&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dromerick |first1=A |last2=Lum |first2=P |last3=Hidler |first3=J |title=Activity-Based Therapies |journal=NeuroRx |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=428–38 |year=2006 |pmid=17012056 |doi=10.1016/j.nurx.2006.07.004 |pmc=3593413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although total independence in gait may not be achieved in every case, significant gains can be made in muscle strength and neuromotor control for walking, through locomotor training.&lt;ref name=pmid17012056/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrman |first1=A. L |last2=Bowden |first2=M. G |last3=Nair |first3=P.

== Pediatric use of gait trainers==
One of the first gait trainers for use by children with developmental disabilities was developed in the mid 1980s for use with the MOVE Curriculum, by a special education teacher in California, Linda Bidabe, in collaboration with others at the Blair Learning Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Bidabe |title=Mobility Opportunities Via Education: A curriculum written to serve children and adults with severe disabilities |edition=7th |year=2003 |location=Bakersfield |publisher=Kern County Superintendent of Schools |pages=3,259|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gilbert |last=Thomson |year=2005 |title=Children with Severe Disabilities and the MOVE Curriculum: Foundations of a Task-oriented Therapy Approach |publisher=East River Press |location=Chester, NY |isbn=0-9759183-0-3 |pages=255–256.|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, pediatric gait trainer design has evolved and been refined, and several manufacturers have developed quality gait trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstracts of Poster and Platform Presentations at the 2008 Combined Sections Meeting |journal=Pediatric Physical Therapy |volume=PAP |pages=90–123 |year=2008 |doi=10.1097/PEP.0b013e31816499a5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of gait trainers for adult rehabilitation==

In adult rehabilitation, gait training is traditionally performed initially within parallel bars as the most stable assistive device. As walking improves, a patient can progress to a walker, crutches, bilateral canes or a single cane. This gait training typically occurs during [[physical therapy]] sessions. The more recent development of body-weight support gait training, such as over a treadmill, can enable considerably more walking practice with less strain to the therapist, when compared to traditional gait training.

In adult rehabilitation, the use of body-weight support (BWS) systems enables patients to walk safely with less effort. Body-weight support systems enable walking practice over a treadmill. Or, they may enable walking over ground from a mobile device or ceiling track. Because of the support provided by the system, the strain to the therapist is reduced. This, along with the patient being adequately supported for balance and weight bearing assist, increases the duration of walking practice. This effective therapy increases potential for motor skill gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hesse |first1=S |last2=Bertelt |first2=C |last3=Jahnke |first3=MT |last4=Schaffrin |first4=A |last5=Baake |first5=P |last6=Malezic |first6=M |last7=Mauritz |first7=KH |title=Treadmill training with partial body weight support compared with physiotherapy in nonambulatory hemiparetic patients |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=976–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7762049 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7762049 |doi=10.1161/01.str.26.6.976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visintin |first1=Martha |last2=Barbeau |first2=Hugues |last3=Korner-Bitensky |first3=Nicol |last4=Mayo |first4=Nancy E. |title=A new approach to retrain gait in stroke patients through body weight support and treadmill stimulation |journal=Stroke |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1122–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9626282 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9626282 |doi=10.1161/01.str.29.6.1122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more opportunity for practice and repetitions of step-taking, the more likely is the patient to regain walking ability.

The use of over ground support walkers as an approach for gait training for the adult population is another recent development in adult rehabilitation. The value of over ground gait trainers is that these devices are typically more affordable than BWS systems, and they enable additional walking practice beyond the physical therapy session, whether in the institution or in the patient’s home or community environment. By using a gait trainer for over ground walking practice, the patient has support for balance and can now incorporate walking practice into his or her daily routine. For example, rather than remaining in a wheelchair between gait therapy sessions, an individual can use the over ground gait trainer for walking practice to and from the cafeteria within an institution, or while at a mall when out in the community.
Early research indicates that sufficient over ground locomotor training may result in equivalent or possibly greater improvements in walking capacity as compared to the body-weight support treadmill training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Field-Fote |first1=E. C. |last2=Roach |first2=K. E. |title=Influence of a Locomotor Training Approach on Walking Speed and Distance in People With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: A Randomized Clinical Trial |journal=Physical Therapy |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=48–60 |year=2010 |pmid=21051593 |pmc=3017322 |doi=10.2522/ptj.20090359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hesse |first1=S. |last2=Uhlenbrock |first2=D. |last3=Sarkodie-Gyan |first3=T. |title=Gait pattern of severely disabled hemiparetic subjects on a new controlled gait trainer as compared to assisted treadmill walking with partial body weight support |journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=401–10 |year=1999 |pmid=10498347 |doi=10.1191/026921599673896297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobkin |first1=B. |last2=Apple |first2=D |last3=Barbeau |first3=H |last4=Basso |first4=M |last5=Behrman |first5=A |last6=Deforge |first6=D |last7=Ditunno |first7=J |last8=Dudley |first8=G |last9=Elashoff |first9=R |title=Weight-supported treadmill vs over-ground training for walking after acute incomplete SCI |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=484–93 |year=2006 |pmid=16505299 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000202600.72018.39 |pmc=4102098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The over ground walking practice is a closer replication to the real-world task of walking. The voluntary effort of step initiation and forward progression is essential for walking over ground, and these devices enable the patient to learn how to generate and control these motor forces in a way that is not available on a treadmill.

'''The Foundation for Hospices in Sub-Saharan Africa''' (FHSSA) was established in 1999 as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[charitable organization]] by a group of internationally recognized hospice and HIV/AIDS care professionals.  FHSSA generates support for [[Africa]]n organizations that provide [[hospice]] and [[palliative care]] to those who are dying of HIV/AIDS and other serious diseases. It is now called Global Partners in Care.

== About ==
FHSSA was founded in 1999 to work with African partners to help address hospice and palliative care issues.  Collaborative efforts with the [[African Palliative Care Association]] (APCA) and the [[Hospice and Palliative Care Association of South Africa]] (HPCA) help build capacity throughout Africa, and focus on the needs of the dying, including families and children.

FHSSA emphasizes the importance of palliative care in the overall continuum of care for all those affected with life-threatening illness.  Pain and Symptom management, [[psychosocial]] care, spiritual support, and care for the entire family, including children, are all particularly important when someone is facing the end of life.

[[Tuberculosis]] is a significant problem, with an 18 percent mortality rate. Many patients have a multi-drug resistant strain and 83 percent are co-infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="msf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=4034&amp;cat=field-news |title=Swaziland: An MSF Doctors Explains HIV-TB Co-Infection |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières]] |accessdate=31 October 2009 |location=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170922/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=4034&amp;cat=field-news |archivedate=25 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are roughly 14,000 new TB cases diagnosed each year.&lt;ref name="hivtb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=4033&amp;cat=special-report |title=HIV-TB in Swaziland: A Deadly Co-Infection Epidemic |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières]] |accessdate=31 October 2009 |location=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621122506/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=4033&amp;cat=special-report |archivedate=21 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental illness==
Mental illness is also a significant public health problem in Eswatini. The population is made more vulnerable to mental illness due to the prevalence of HIV and AIDS, alcohol and cannabis abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.543.3720&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|author=Mhlongo, Gladys Thembinkosi |title=Drug Abuse by Adolescents in Swaziland|publisher=MSc Thesis, University of South Africa|date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual violence, and poverty. Additionally, not a lot of accurate information is widely known about mental illness in the country. Because of this, individuals with mental illness are also susceptible to stigma.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eswatini does not have an expansive mental health infrastructure. In fact, most healthcare is centralized in cities where approximately 20% of the population lives. There is one psychiatrist available for a population of roughly one million. The psychiatrist works at the National Psychiatric Referral Hospital in Manzini and sees all of the psychiatric patients in the country, including patients housed at the hospital, but also prisoners, children, and people who commute from rural villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healingthroughart.webflow.io/|title=HealingthroughArt|website=healingthroughart.webflow.io|access-date=17 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425203830/http://healingthroughart.webflow.io/|archive-date=25 April 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given Eswatini's situation, many health-related non-governmental organizations, university programs, and other organizations work in the country on research and service projects related to health.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====HIV/AIDS====
{{further|HIV/AIDS in Eswatini}}
[[File:Prevalence of HIV, total of population ages 15-49.pdf|thumb|upright=2|The percentage of the population with HIV is over 25%.]]
Eswatini is critically affected by the HIV and AIDS disease. As reported in the 2012 [[CIA World Factbook]], Swaziland had the highest HIV infection rate in the world (25.8% of all adults; more in other reports) and a [[life expectancy]] of 50 years. From another perspective, [[World Health Organization]] data in 2002 showed that 64% of all deaths in the country were caused by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Swaziland, Mortality Country Fact Sheet 2006 |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_afro_swz_swaziland.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805140020/http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_afro_swz_swaziland.pdf |archivedate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an estimated 7,000 people died from AIDS-related causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unaids.org/documents/20101123_GlobalReport_Annexes1_em.pdf |title=UNAIDS Report on the global AIDS epidemic 2010 Annex 1 – HIV and AIDs estimates and data, 2009 and 2001.

United Nations |format=PDF |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translates into an estimated 0.6% of the population dying from AIDS in a year. Chronic illnesses that are the most common causes of death in the developed world account only for a minute fraction of deaths in Eswatini; for example, heart disease, strokes, and cancer cause fewer than 5% of deaths in total, compared to 55% of all deaths yearly in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Causes of death in US, 2006 |publisher = CDC |url= https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_14.pdf |accessdate =22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Swaziland government acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an AIDS crisis, with 38.8% of tested pregnant women infected with HIV (see [[AIDS in Africa]]). The then Prime Minister [[Themba Dlamini]] declared a humanitarian crisis due to the combined effect of drought, [[land degradation]], increased poverty, and HIV/AIDS. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, Swaziland was close to achieving universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment, defined as 80% coverage or greater. Estimates of treatment coverage range from 70% to 80% of those infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf |title=UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Life expectancy fell from 61 years in 2000 to 32 years in 2009.&lt;ref name="unhcrAIDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49e6ef2dc.html|title=Swaziland: A culture that encourages HIV/AIDS|date=15 April 2009|publisher=[[Integrated Regional Information Networks]] (IRIN)|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public expenditure for HIV/AIDS was 4% of the GDP of the country, whereas private expenditure was 2.3%.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_SWZ.html |title=Human Development Report 2009 – Swaziland |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |accessdate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715092635/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_SWZ.html |archivedate=15 July 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=November 2010}}  Infant mortality was 57.19 per 1,000 in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=February 2014}} 47% of all deaths under 5 were caused by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

==Healthcare==
There were 16 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt;

In September 2018 as the government had not paid suppliers the health service ran out of food and medicine. [[Swazipharm]] could not buy drugs. in May 2017 US$18 million was said to be owed to drug companies. There were only 12 working public ambulances in the country in June 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swaziland: No Food for Hospital Patients As Broke Swaziland Government Leaves Supplier Bills Unpaid |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201809280147.html |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=All Africa |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">The '''Irish Institute of Medical Herbalists''' (IIMH) is the professional organization for medical [[herbalist]]s in [[Ireland]].  It was formally incorporated in 1990. The current criteria for membership of the IIMH is a BSc honours degree in [[herbal medicine]] which includes examinations in medicine and [[herbalism]] as well as supervised clinical practice. Members of the institute have the letters MIIMH after their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iimh.org Irish Institute of Medical Herbalists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IIMH developed the first BSc honours degree in herbal science in Ireland, in conjunction with [[Cork Institute of Technology]].  This is a four-year full-time undergraduate degree which forms part one of the necessary training for medical herbalists in Ireland.  Part two comprises a two-year master's degree programme in clinical herbal medicine which is currently being developed and was due to commence in 2009.

'''John Michael Bailey''' (born July 2, 1957) is an American [[psychologist]] and [[professor]] at [[Northwestern University]]. He is best known among scientists for his work on the [[etiology]] of [[sexual orientation]], from which he concluded that [[homosexuality]] is substantially inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Pillard RC, Neale MC, Agyei Y | year = 1993 | title = ).

According to the [[Web of Science]], Bailey's works have been cited nearly 2200 times and he has an [[h-index]] of 25.&lt;ref&gt;[[Web of Science]], accessed November 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and career==
Bailey was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Lubbock-Texas.html|title= Lubbock, Texas|publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate= May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Washington University]] in 1979 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1989, where he studied under [[behavioral genetics]] researcher [[Lee Willerman]].&lt;ref name="nwprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.northwestern.edu/psych/people/faculty/bailey/personal.html |title=Professional profile |publisher=Northwestern University |date=February 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104062400/http://www.psych.northwestern.edu/psych/people/faculty/bailey/personal.html |archivedate=January 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey became a professor at [[Northwestern University]] in 1989. In the 1990s, Bailey published several papers that suggested a heritable component for [[sexual orientation]]. In 2003 he published ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]''.

In October 2004, Bailey stepped down as chairman of the Psychology Department. Bailey continues to serve as a Northwestern professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Davis, Andrew|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=6810|title= Northwestern Sex Researcher Investigated, Results Unknown|publisher=WindyCity Times|date=December 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dreger|first=AD|title=The controversy surrounding "The man who would be queen": a case history of the politics of science, identity, and sex in the Internet age|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=June 2008|volume=37|issue=3|pages=366–421|pmid=18431641|doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1|pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and criticisms==

===Biology and sexual orientation===
Bailey is well known for research involving [[biology and sexual orientation]]. In the early 1990s Bailey and [[Richard Pillard]] coauthored a series of [[twin study|twin studies]] which examined the rate of [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of sexual identity among [[monozygotic]] twins (52% concordance), [[dizygotic]] twins of the same sex (22%), non-twin siblings of the same sex, and adoptive siblings of the same sex (11%).&lt;ref name="bailey91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Pillard RC |title=A genetic study of male sexual orientation |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=1089–96 |year=1991 |pmid=1845227 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810360053008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey93"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Benishay DS |title=Familial aggregation of female sexual orientation |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=150 |issue=2 |pages=272–7 |year=1993 |pmid=8422079 |doi=10.1176/ajp.150.2.272}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research by Bailey et al. on twins however found much lower concordance rates for [[monozygotic]] twins regarding homosexual orientation of only 20% for men and 24% for women pointing to a significant contribution of environmental factors in sexual orientation; Bailey suggests an explanation for the much lower concordance rate among [[monozygotic]] twins in this study as opposed to previous studies:  In those previous studies, twins deciding whether to participate in a study clearly related to homosexuality probably considered the sexual orientation of their co-twins before agreeing to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J. Michael; Dunne, Michael P; Martin, Nicholas G.Genetic and Environmental Influences on Sexual Orientation and Its Correlates in an Australian Twin Sample. J Pers Soc Psychol, Volume 78(3).March 2000.524–536. link  http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/Publications/Bailey%20et%20al.%20twins,2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
Another line of Bailey's research has concerned the ways that homosexuals are sex-atypical (or gender nonconforming) compared with heterosexuals, as well as the ways that homosexuals are sex-typical and gender conforming. For example, he published a meta-analysis showing that on average, homosexual men and women recall being much more gender nonconforming children, compared with heterosexual children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J. M. |author2=Zucker K. J. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: A conceptual analysis and quantitative review | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 43–55 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, he also showed that for many traits related to mating (such as interest in casual sex, and emphasis on a partner's physical attractiveness), homosexuals appear to be similar to heterosexuals of their own sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Gaulin S, Agyei Y, Gladue BA |title=Effects of gender and sexual orientation on evolutionarily relevant aspects of human mating psychology |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1081–93 |date=June 1994 |pmid=8046578 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.66.6.1081|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/66/6/1081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, he has researched the [[gaydar]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieger G, Linsenmeier JA, Gygax L, Bailey JM |title=Sexual orientation and childhood gender nonconformity: evidence from home videos |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=46–58 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18194004 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.46 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey has been interested in the evolutionary paradox of the persistence of homosexuality. "Male homosexuality is evolutionarily maladaptive," he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' which also noted that Bailey intended "that the phrase means only that genes favoring homosexuality cannot be favored by evolution if fewer such genes reach the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/health/10gene.html | work=The New York Times | title=Pas de Deux of Sexuality Is Written in the Genes | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | date=April 10, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article coauthored with Aaron Greenberg, he suggested that allowing parents to choose the sexual orientation of their children is morally acceptable, provided the means used to accomplished that goal are themselves morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | ref=harv| last1 = Greenberg | first1 = Aaron S. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = J. M. | author2-link=J.

===Sexual arousal===
A third line of research has examined [[sexual arousal]] patterns and their relation to sexual orientation in men and women. This research has focused on both genital and self-reported sexual arousal measures. For example, Bailey's lab showed that men's genital sexual arousal patterns closely tracked their sexual orientations, but women's did not.&lt;ref name=APAdifferences&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr03/differences.html |title=Study finds sex differences in relationship between arousal and orientation |publisher=American Psychological Association |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 this research produced a study which questioned whether male bisexuality exists in the way that it is sometimes described; the study was based on results of penile plethysmograph testing. The testing found that of men who identified themselves as bisexual, 75% were only aroused genitally by sexual imagery of men, and 25% were only aroused genitally by sexual imagery of women. They concluded: "Male bisexuality appears primarily to represent a style of interpreting or reporting sexual arousal rather than a distinct pattern of genital sexual arousal."&lt;ref name="rieger"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieger G, Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=Sexual arousal patterns of bisexual men |journal=Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=579–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16102058 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study received wide attention after a ''New York Times'' piece on the study.&lt;ref name="carey"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carey, Benedict | date=July 5, 2005 | title=Straight, Gay or Lying?

==''The Man Who Would Be Queen''==
{{Main|The Man Who Would Be Queen}}

Bailey's book ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender Bending and Transsexualism'' was published in 2003.&lt;ref name="jhp"&gt;Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Bailey reviewed evidence that male [[homosexuality]] is innate, a result of heredity and prenatal environment. He also reviewed the theory of [[Ray Blanchard]] that there are two unrelated forms of [[transsexualism]], one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a [[paraphilia]] known as [[autogynephilia]].  Written in a popular science style, the book summarized research supporting Bailey's opinions.

The book generated considerable controversy.  The most detailed investigation into that controversy was reported by [[Alice Dreger]],&lt;ref name = Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal

"These critics, rather than restrict themselves to the argument over the ideas, had charged Bailey with a whole host of serious crimes," but that "what they claimed about Bailey simply wasn't true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's middle finger: heretics, activists, and the search for justice in science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 }} pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A transgender woman that he described in the book filed a complaint with [[Northwestern University]] alleging that her many discussions with Bailey about his view of trans women and the book he was writing made her a non-consensual subject of [[IRB-regulated]] research by Bailey, and that during this time, she had consensual sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.

The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''Archives of Sexual Behavior.'' 2008, volume 37, 365–510. Some critical commentaries have been made available on-line by their authors: Deirdre McCloskey's [http://deirdremccloskey.org/docs/dreger.pdf Politics in Scholarly Drag: Dreger’s Assault on the Critics of Bailey], Julia Serano's [http://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano_DregerCommentary.pdf A Matter of Perspective: A Transsexual Woman-Centric Critique of Dreger’s ‘‘Scholarly History’’ of the Bailey Controversy].&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the transsexual community and sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable because of its implications for [[academic freedom]] and [[freedom of speech]].  In an interview with ''The New York Times'', Dreger said, "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself."&lt;ref name = Carey2007/&gt; While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and [[Andrea James]] posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest.&lt;ref name = NYTlegitimate&gt;{{cite news

The [[Maharashtra government]] in India has launched a water conservation scheme named '''Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan''' to make Maharashtra a [[drought]]-free state by 2019. The  programme aims to make 5000 villages free of [[water scarcity]] every year.

The key aim of Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan is to establish belief in a farmer that “every drop of rainwater is owned by me and it should percolate in my land”.

The flagship programme launched by Chief Minister [[Devendra Fadnavis]], Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan aims to bring water empowerment to 25,000 drought-affected villages in Maharashtra within next five years. The programme Jalyukt Shivar was initiated by [[Pankaja Munde]] .With the passing time, the scheme has been going strong with villages building infrastructure and making the programme one of the largest Government initiatives in terms of public participation.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtemaharashtra.gov.in/TEQIP/OasisModules_Files/Files/197.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
The Water Conservation Department of [[Maharashtra government]] conducted a logo competition on the Maharashtra MyGov Portal with an objective to widen its scope of public participation in flagship program. 

Mr Kishor Gaikwad received in [[Mumbai]] an awarde for best design by Hon. Chief Minister of [[Maharashtra]] [[Devendra Fadnavis]] on 4 January 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">The '''Jungian Type Index''' ('''JTI''') is an alternative to the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI). Introduced by Optimas in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conference.cfl.dk/participant/speakers |title=European Type Conference |accessdate=2008-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411230430/http://conference.cfl.dk/participant/speakers |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the JTI was developed over a 10-year period in Norway by psychologists Thor Ødegård and Hallvard E: Ringstad. The JTI was designed to help capture individuals' preferred usage of the psychological functions identified by [[Carl Jung]] in his book ''[[Psychological Types]]'', such as thinking vs feeling and sensing vs intuition. 

The JTI's questions and methodology for identifying the preferred functions differs from the MBTI. For example it eliminates word pairs, which can be troublesome to translate from English into other languages.{{Fact|date=September 2012}} In many languages, the sentence context frames the meaning of a word, while in English the words themselves may denote more meaning.

==Overview==
Similar to the MBTI, the JTI identifies 4 categories from which the 16 types are formed: Extraversion/Introversion, Intuiting/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, Perceiving/Judging. A personality type is reached through an examination or introspection about these categories. For example, an Intuiting, Thinking, Judging Extrovert would be classified as an [[ENTJ]]. However, further complexity lies below this surface-level classification. Each personality types has its associated [[Jungian cognitive functions]], which aim to further explain the ways in which each type perceives and interacts with reality. Each type has all 4 of the cognitive functions (Thinking, Feeling, Intuiting, and Sensing) arranged in a different order and with different levels of introversion/extroversion. Of the two middle letters of any type, one will be the primary function with which they interact with the world, and one will be the auxiliary. For example, an ENTJ's primary function is (extraverted) Thinking, and their secondary function is (introverted) Intuiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jungtype.com/Dynamics.htm|title=The Dynamics of Psychological Type|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Commercialization==
Though it is relatively unknown in the [[United States]], but it has won some market shares in Scandinavia although the original MBTI tool is still the most commonly used. In Norway and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decisiondynamics.se/  JTI Agency for Sweden] &lt;/ref&gt; the JTI is also gaining users, in conjunction with other tools that complement the JTI for career development and coaching.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} It also has distributors in the Netherlands, China, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cfl.dk/articles/leadership-tools/jti-jungian-type-index JTI - Jungian Type Index] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about type dynamics==
Some MBTI practitioners argue that the application of type dynamics (e.g. with inferred types like "Extraverted Sensing") to MBTI is a logical category error that has little empirical evidence backing it.  Instead, they argue the best evidence for Myers Briggs types comes when the types are viewed as separate categories that function independent from one another as dichotomous types.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.capt.org/research/article/JPT_Vol69_0109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''knockout moss''' is a [[Moss|moss plant]] in which one or more specific [[gene]]s  are deleted or inactivated ("[[Gene knockout|knocked out]]") by [[gene targeting]]. After deletion of a gene, the knockout moss has lost the trait encoded by this gene. Thus, the function of this gene can be inferred. This scientific approach is called [[reverse genetics]] as the scientist wants to unravel the function of a specific gene. In [[classical genetics]] the scientist starts with a [[phenotype]] of interest and searches for the gene that causes this phenotype. Knockout mosses are relevant for [[basic research]] in [[biology]] as well as in [[biotechnology]].

The targeted deletion or alteration of genes relies on the integration of a [[DNA]] strand at a specific and predictable position into the [[genome]] of the host cell. This DNA strand must be engineered in such a way that both ends are identical to this specific [[gene locus]]. This is a prerequisite for being efficiently integrated via [[homologous recombination]] (HR). Basically, a [[knockout mouse]] is engineered in the same way.
So far, this method of gene targeting in [[land plants]] has been carried out in the mosses ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' and ''[[Ceratodon purpureus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;F. Mittmann, S. Dienstbach, A. Weisert, C. Forreiter, 2009: Analysis of the phytochrome gene family in Ceratodon purpureus by gene targeting reveals the primary [[phytochrome]] responsible for [[phototropism]] and [[polarotropism]]. {{PMID|19330350}}. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/qv0132x17077g631/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; since in these [[Cryptogam|non-seed]] plant [[species]] the efficiency of HR is several orders of magnitude higher than in [[seed plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reski |first1=Ralf |title=Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis: the David and Goliath of reverse genetics |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=209–10 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(98)01257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knockout mosses are stored at and distributed by a specialized [[Biobank]], the [[International Moss Stock Center]].

==Method==
For altering moss genes in a targeted way, the DNA-construct needs to be incubated together with moss [[protoplast]]s and with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG). As mosses are [[Haploid#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] organisms, the regenerating moss filaments ([[protonemata]]) can be directly assayed for gene targeting within 6 weeks when utilizing [[PCR]]-methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhard |first1=Christina |last2=Schween |first2=Gabriele |last3=Reski |first3=Ralf |last4=Hohe |first4=Annette |last5=Egener |first5=Tanja |last6=Lucht |first6=Jan M. |last7=Holtorf |first7=Hauke |title=An improved and highly standardised transformation procedure allows efficient production of single and multiple targeted gene-knockouts in a moss, Physcomitrella patens |journal=Current Genetics |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=339–47 |year=2004 |pmid=14586556 |doi=10.1007/s00294-003-0458-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Chloroplast division===
The first scientific publication about identification of the function of a hitherto unknown gene utilizing knockout moss appeared 1998 and was authored by [[Ralf Reski]] and coworkers. They deleted the [[ftsZ]]-gene and thus functionally identified the first gene pivotal for the division of an [[organelle]] in any [[eukaryote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=44902 |last1=Strepp |first1=René |last2=Scholz |first2=Sirkka |last3=Kruse |first3=Sven |last4=Speth |first4=Volker |last5=Reski |first5=Ralf |title=Plant Nuclear Gene Knockout Reveals a Role in Plastid Division for the Homolog of the Bacterial Cell Division Protein FtsZ, an Ancestral Tubulin |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=4368–4373 |year=1998 |pmid=9539743 |pmc=22495 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.8.4368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein modifications===
By multiple [[gene knockout]] ''Physcomitrella'' plants were engineered, that lack the plant-specific [[glycosylation]] of proteins, an important post-translational modification. These knockout mosses are used to produce complex [[biopharmaceuticals]] in the field of [[molecular farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koprivova |first1=Anna |last2=Stemmer |first2=Christian |last3=Altmann |first3=Friedrich |last4=Hoffmann |first4=Axel |last5=Kopriva |first5=Stanislav |last6=Gorr |first6=Gilbert |last7=Reski |first7=Ralf |last8=Decker |first8=Eva L. |title=Targeted knockouts of Physcomitrella lacking plant-specific immunogenic N-glycans |journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=517–23 |year=2004 |pmid=17147624 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7652.2004.00100.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutant collection===
In cooperation with the chemical company [[BASF]] Ralf Reski and coworkers established a collection of knockout mosses that is used for gene identification.&lt;ref name="pmid12123528"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj0013 BASF and Freiburg University to collaborate on plant biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labial fusion''' is a medical condition of the [[female genital anatomy]] where the [[labia minora]] become fused together. It is generally a pediatric condition.&lt;ref name=nhsdirectwales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/l/article/labialfusion/|title=NHS Direct Wales - Encyclopedia: Labial fusion|publisher=NHS Direct Wales|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition is known by a number of names, including '''labial fusion''', '''labial adhesion''', '''labial synechiae''', '''labial agglutination''', '''labial adherence''', '''gynatresia''', '''vulvar fusion''', and '''vulvar synechiae'''.&lt;ref name=fleischer&gt;{{cite book|title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine|page=842|year=2010|first=Gary R.|last=Fleisher|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|first2=Stephen|last2=Ludwig|isbn = 9781605471594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Labial fusion is never present at birth, but rather acquired later in infancy, since it is caused by insufficient [[estrogen]] exposure and newborns have been exposed to maternal estrogen ''[[in utero]]''. It typically presents in infants at least 3 months old.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book|title=The 5-minute Obstetrics and Gynecology Consult|chapter=Imperforate hymen|pages=122–123|first=Jane E. D.|last=Broecker|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|year=2008|isbn=9780781769426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most presentations are asymptomatic and are discovered by a parent or during routine medical examination. In other cases, patients may present with associated symptoms of [[dysuria]], [[urinary frequency]], refusal to urinate, or post-void dribbling.&lt;ref name=fleischer/&gt;&lt;ref name=zitelli&gt;{{cite book|title=Zitelli and Davis' Atlas of Pediatric Physical Diagnosis|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2012|page=580|first=Basil J.|last=Zitelli|first2=Sara C.|last2=McIntire|first3=Andrew J.|last3=Nowalk|isbn=9780323091589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some patients present with [[vaginal discharge]] due to pooling of urine in the [[vulval vestibule]] or vagina.&lt;ref name=netter&gt;{{cite book|title=Netter's Obstetrics and Gynecology|page=202|year=2008|first=Roger Perry|last=Smith|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9781416056829}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Complications===
Labial fusion can lead to [[urinary tract infection]], [[vulvar vestibulitis]] and inflammation caused by chronic urine exposure. In severe cases, labial adhesions can cause complete obstruction of the [[urethra]], leading to [[anuria]] and [[urinary retention]].&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The primary contributing factor to labial fusion is low estrogen levels.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; A [[vulva]] with low estrogen exposure, such as that of a preadolescent, has delicate [[epithelium|epithelial lining]] and is therefore vulnerable to irritation. Conditions causing irritation, such as infection, inflammation and trauma, cause the edges of the labia minora to fuse together. The fusion typically begins at the posterior [[Frenulum of labia minora|frenulum]] of the labia minora and continues anteriorly.&lt;ref name=fleischer/&gt;&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

Most labial adhesions resolve spontaneously before puberty as estrogen levels increase and the [[vaginal epithelium]] becomes cornified.&lt;ref name=zitelli/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
The condition can be diagnosed based on inspection of the [[vulva]]. In patients with labial fusion, a flat plane of tissue with a dense central line of tissue is usually seen when the [[labia majora]] are retracted, while an anterior opening is usually present below the [[clitoris]].&lt;ref name=fleischer/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment is not usually necessary in asymptomatic cases, since most fusions will separate naturally over time, but may be required when symptoms are present.&lt;ref name=belman&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Pediatric Urology|pages=219–220|first=A. Barry|last=Belman|first2=Lowell R.|last2=King|first3=Stephen A.|last3=Kramer|year=2001|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9781901865639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burge&gt;{{cite book|title=Paediatric Surgery|last=Creighton|first=Sarah|chapter=Paediatric and adolescent gynaecology|pages=555–556|edition=2nd|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2005|isbn=9780340809105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard method of treatment for labial fusion is the application of topical estrogen cream onto the areas of adhesion, which is effective in 90% of patients.&lt;ref name=fleischer/&gt; In severe cases where the labia minora are entirely fused, causing urinary outflow obstruction or vaginal obstruction, the labia should be separated surgically.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; Recurrence after treatment is common&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Problems in Pediatric Urology|pages=175–176|chapter=Genitourinary Tumors|first=Laurence|last=Baskin|first2=Hubert S.|last2=Swana|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2008|isbn=9781405171854}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is thought to be prevented by good hygiene practices.&lt;ref name=zitelli/&gt; One study has shown that [[betamethasone]] may be more effective than estrogen cream in preventing recurrence, with fewer side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188%2808%2900284-2/abstract|title=Success of Treatment Modalities for Labial Fusion: A Retrospective Evaluation of Topical and Surgical Treatments|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|date=August 2009|volume=22|issue=4|first=Lazarus |last=Mayoglou|first2=Lori |last2=Dulabon|first3=Nieves |last3=Martin-Alguacil|first4=Donald |last4=Pfaff|first5=Justine|last5=Schober|pages=247–250|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2008.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Labial fusion is not uncommon in infants and young girls.&lt;ref name=nhsdirectwales/&gt; It is most common in infants between the ages of 13 and 23 months, and has an incidence of 3.3% in this age group.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; It is estimated that labial fusion occurs in 1.8% of all prepubertal girls.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; It is rare in adult women, particularly in reproductive age, but is occasionally found in postpartum and postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

==History==
The first LifeSpring hospital was started on 10 December 2005 in [[Moula-Ali]], on the outskirts on [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], India, as a pilot project within Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust (HLFPPT) of [[Hindustan Latex Limited]], now [[HLL Lifecare Limited]] (HLL) for low-cost healthcare.&lt;ref name="bu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2005/12/16/stories/2005121600151100.htm|title=Hindustan Latex targets Rs 1,000-cr turnover|date=16 December 2005|work=Business Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, it was formed as into a private limited company with 50-50 joint venture between [[Acumen Fund]], a U. S.-based nonprofit global venture philanthropy fund and HLL. The project was headed by Anant Kumar, who was till then the business head of Social Franchising in HLFPPT, who later became LifeSpring's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifespring.in/our-team.html |title=Our Team |publisher=LifeSpring website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162634/http://www.lifespring.in/our-team.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifespring.in/current-investors.html|title=Current Investors|publisher=LifeSpring website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162656/http://www.lifespring.in/current-investors.html|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; HLL is a [[public-sector undertaking]] under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]], [[Government of India]], while New York-based Acumen, was established in 2001, with seed capital from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[Cisco Systems]] Foundation and three individual philanthropists.

The hospital established a model of building a chain of small-sized (25-bed) hospitals specializing in standard maternity services thus provide low-cost services in high-density area populated by low-income groups. It also provides paediatric care, including immunizations, and offers diagnostic services, pharmacy and healthcare education to the local communities.&lt;ref name="acu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acumenfund.org/investment/lifespring.html|title=LifeSpring Hospitals|publisher=''[[Acumen Fund]]'' website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222172527/http://www.acumenfund.org/investment/lifespring.html|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/lifespring-hospitals-bringing-maternity-care-poor-mothers-india/story?id=12459083|title=LifeSpring Hospitals: Bringing Maternity Care to Poor Mothers in India| date=23 December 2010|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13496367?story_id=13496367|title=Health care in India : Lessons from a frugal innovator|date=16 April 2009|work=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] to track customers in real time and runs a web-based patient database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessworld.in/index.php/Information-Technology/Waiting-For-The-Rain.html |title=INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Cost saving is the key reason for firms adopting cloud computing |date=25 July 2009 |publisher=Business World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803212831/http://www.businessworld.in/index.php/Information-Technology/Waiting-For-The-Rain.html |archivedate= 3 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Anant Kumar was part of the roundtable of "entrepreneurs with innovative models", at the Trident Hotel, Mumbai, during the November 2010, visit of US President, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Obama-talks-business-with-industry-heads/articleshow/6881925.cms|title=Obama talks business with industry heads|date=7 November 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Anant Kumar was the CEO of LifeSpring till January 2013.

Later, Mr Sushmit Mitra took over as CEO. Under him, Lifespring established one hospital in Vizag and has grown from around 350 deliveries per month to about 550 deliveries per month. He was the CEO till June 2017.

Currently, LifeSpring Hospitals offers its services through 11 branches and 8 extension centers. Of these, 10 branches and 8 extension centers are in Hyderabad, India and one branch is in Visakhapatnam. Lifespring delivered around 20,000 healthy babies in the last 3 years. Since inception Lifespring has delivered a total of 50,000 healthy babies. Annually, LifeSpring Hospitals deliver about 6% babies born in the city of Hyderabad.

'''Michael Francis "Mick" Parker''' (10 March 1973 &amp;ndash; 4 June 2009) was an Australian mountaineer and graphic designer. He climbed extensively in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakorum]] and summited five of the fourteen [[eight-thousander]]s. After ascending [[Makalu]] in 2009, he fell ill due to dissipated [[pulmonary oedema|pulmonary]] and [[cerebral oedema]] and subsequently died in [[Kathmandu]] on 4 June, aged 36.

==Early life==
Mick Parker was born in [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], to Gail and Bruce Parker. He attended Donburn Primary School and [[Wesley College (Victoria)|Wesley College]], where he took up [[cross country running]] and [[rock climbing]], before leaving school to study graphic arts at [[Box Hill Senior Secondary College]].&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/unconventional-climber-of-selfless-bravery-20090612-c67z.html|title=Unconventional climber of selfless bravery|first=Gerry|last=Carman|date=13 June 2009|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing career==
Parker's passion for climbing began in 1996 when he took an [[ice climbing]] course in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; In 2003 he climbed [[Cho Oyu]]'s northwest face from [[Tibet]] after an unsuccessful attempt on [[Kangchenjunga]].&lt;ref name=him&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan Dreaming: Australian Mountaineering in the Great Ranges of Asia, 1922&amp;ndash;1990|last=Steffen|first=Will|publisher=ANU E Press|year=2010|location=Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He summited [[Broad Peak]] for the first time in [[Pakistan]] in 2004 (he made a second unsuccessful attempt in 2006).&lt;ref name=age/&gt; In 2005, he made attempts to climb [[Mount Everest]] and [[K2]], but failed in both. On K2, he chose to give up his chance of reaching the summit in order to bring an endangered Irish climber to safety and escort him back to base camp; on Everest, he was forced to retreat because of poor weather.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; In 2007, Parker joined the Australian Army Alpine Association—for whom he led numerous expeditions—on their attempt to climb [[Gasherbrum I]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; After leaving the rest of the team who decided to turn around, he continued climbing alone and reached the summit on 29 July, becoming the second Australian to have climbed the mountain.&lt;ref name=him/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/climber-dies-in-nepal/story-e6frf7jo-1225729910741|work=[[Herald Sun]]|title=Climber dies in Nepal|first=Matt|last=Johnston|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a solo attempt on [[Dhaulagiri I]] in 2007, but abandoned the expedition after falling into a crevasse.&lt;ref name=him/&gt; In 2008, Parker made his second attempt on [[Manaslu]] in Nepal, reaching the summit on 14 May.&lt;ref name=him/&gt; Later that year, he returned to Dhaulagiri but was unsuccessful again.&lt;ref name=him/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Parker climbed [[Makalu]] with Roland Hunter in 2009, summiting on 21 May.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/aussie-climber-dies-after-scaling-himalayan-peak-20090609-c1e8.html|title=Aussie climber dies after scaling Himalayan peak|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 June 2009|first=Arjun|last=Ramachandran|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from dissipated [[pulmonary oedema|pulmonary]] and [[cerebral oedema]], he fell unconscious several times on the return journey from Makalu to [[Kathmandu]] and ultimately died in Kathmandu on 4 June, aged 36.&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=16053#.UzgC-oXI12E|title= The bright side of Everest |work=[[Nepali Times]]|date=25 June 2009|first=Billi|last=Bierling|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father travelled to Nepal to retrieve Parker's body and bring it back to Melbourne, where Parker was buried in Lilydale Memorial Park.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; In 2010, Parker's family donated a collection of his climbing equipment to an exhibit at the [[National Sports Museum]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsm.org.au/Whats%20On/Latest%20News/2010/July/Mick%20Parker%20exhibition.aspx|title=Mountaineer honoured in new exhibition|date=16 July 2010|publisher=[[National Sports Museum]]|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of his death, Parker had attempted to climb nine of the [[eight-thousander|fourteen mountains over 8,000 metres high]], and had summited five—Cho Oyu, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I, Manaslu, and Makalu&lt;ref name=age/&gt;—all without the assistance of [[Sherpa people|Sherpa guides]] or [[bottled oxygen]].&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

[[File:BarrioAdentro.jpg|thumb|Official logo since 2004]]
'''Mission ''Barrio Adentro''''' (English: '''''Into the Neighborhood'' Mission''') is a [[Bolivarianism|Bolivarian]] national [[social welfare]] program established under late [[Venezuelan president]] [[Hugo Chávez]]. The program seeks to provide comprehensive [[publicly funded health care]], [[Dentistry|dental care]], and [[Sports medicine|sports training]] to [[Poverty|poor]] and marginalized communities in [[Venezuela]]. ''Barrio Adentro'' features the construction of thousands of iconic two-storey medical clinics—''consultorios'' or doctor’s offices—as well as staffing with resident certified medical professionals. ''Barrio Adentro'' constitutes an attempt to deliver a ''[[de facto]]'' form of [[universal healthcare]], seeking to guarantee access to quality and cradle-to-grave medical attention for all Venezuelan [[citizens]].

The Latin American branch of the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] both praised the program in its early years.&lt;ref name="WHO_2005"&gt;{{Harv|World Health Organization|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF_2005"&gt;{{Harv|UNICEF|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO statistics, infant mortality fell from 23 to 20 in males and 19 to 17 in females per 1,000 births between 2003 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_1_en.pdf | title=[[The World Health Report]] 2004 |chapter=Statistical Annex | publisher=[[WHO]] | accessdate=May 10, 2018 | pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.who.int/whr/2006/annex/06_annex1_en.pdf | title=[[The World Health Report]] 2006 |chapter=annex table 1 | publisher=[[WHO]] | accessdate=May 10, 2018 | pages=176-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of a planned 8,500 Barrio Adentro I centers, 2,708 had been built by May 2007, using an investment of around US$126 million, with a further 3,284 under construction.&lt;ref name=jones08&gt;Jones, Rachel (2008), ''[[The Lancet]]'', "Hugo Chávez's health-care programme misses its goals", Volume 371, Issue 9629, 14–20 June 2008, p. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the staff included 31,439 professionals, technical personnel, and health technicians, of which 15,356 were Cuban doctors and 1,234 Venezuelan doctors.&lt;ref name=paho2006&gt;Pan American Health Organization, [http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PUB/BA_ENG_TRANS.pdf "Mission Barrio Adentro: The right to health and social inclusion in Venezuela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032937/http://www1.paho.org/English/DD/PUB/BA_ENG_TRANS.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, Caracas, Venezuela. July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the government celebrated 11 years of the mission, announcing that over 10,000 clinics were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=En 11 años Misión Barrio Adentro ha fortalecido la salud pública del país (+Fotos+Video)|url=http://www.vtv.gob.ve/articulos/2014/04/09/en-11-anos-mision-barrio-adentro-ha-fortalecido-la-salud-publica-del-pais-8474.html|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=VTV|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Caracas, Mission Barrio Adentro I and II centers in 32 parishes were the subject of constant complaints about performance even after being funded Bs 1.492 million by the government. Councilman Alejandro Vivas stated that "instead of having positive results, what is observed is the discontent of the citizens for a performance that leaves much to be desired".&lt;ref name=MBAeu&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabildo Metropolitano evaluará funcionamiento de Barrio Adentro|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/caracas/140506/cabildo-metropolitano-evaluara-funcionamiento-de-barrio-adentro|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2014, it was estimated that 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments were abandoned in Venezuela,&lt;ref name=LPdec2014&gt;{{cite news|title=El 80% de los módulos de Barrio Adentro del país está cerrado|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/12/08/el-80-de-los-modulos-de-barrio-adentro-del-pais-esta-cerrado/|accessdate=8 December 2014|agency=[[La Patilla]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of Cuban medical personnel leaving the country.&lt;ref name="COA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Venezuela Is Running Short of Everything|url=http://www.as-coa.org/articles/update-venezuela-running-short-everything|website=[[Americas Society]] / [[Council of the Americas]]|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2015, the Bolivarian government reported that of all Venezuelans admitted to public health facilities that year, one-in-three patients died.&lt;ref name="NBC1in3"&gt;{{cite news|title=In deteriorating Venezuela, a kid's scraped knee can be life or death|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-health-crisis-means-kid-s-scraped-knee-can-be-n659211|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later in October 2016, it was reported by the Miami Herald that hundreds of doctors were being recalled by Cuba, allegedly due to a lack of payments by Venezuela.&lt;ref name=MHjan2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumping medicine, faking patients: Cuban doctors describe a system that breeds fraud|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article129125864.html|website=[[Miami Herald]]|publisher=Jim Wyss|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bolivarian Missions}}

==Background==
The Barrio Adentro program was developed against a background of a public health sector crumbling under long-term financial pressure. As part of the neoliberalisation programme of the early 1990s under President [[Rafael Caldera]], a Venezuela struggling with inflation and a low oil price (oil being its primary export) was forced into spending cuts and [[privatisation]] in a number of sectors, including healthcare. A 1989 decentralisation law contributed to the trend; from 1993, state governors could request the transfer of public healthcare in their state to their control, and the inability to cope with the new responsibility encouraged cuts and privatisation. Cost recovery became increasingly prevalent through "voluntary" contributions from users.&lt;ref name=alvaradoaetal08&gt;Carlos H. Alvaradoa, María E. Martínez, Sarai Vivas-Martínez, Nuramy J. Gutiérrez, Wolfram Metzger (2008), "Social Change and Health Policy in Venezuela", ''Social Medicine'', Volume 3, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the problems with the healthcare system, over the course of the decade, health problems caused by poverty (infectious and deficiency diseases) increased. By 1999, 67.7% of the Venezuelan population was living in poverty, from 44.4% in 1990.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

In 1999, following the election of Hugo Chávez, the Ministry of Health planned to develop a new National Public Health System, with a particular focus on health promotion, disease prevention, community participation, and the strengthening of the [[primary health care]] infrastructure. The 2000/1 annual report by [[PROVEA]] highlighted a number of positive features of the new approach, including a wider availability of health services through progressive elimination of users’ fees.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

==Origins==
The Barrio Adentro program is an example of Latin American [[social medicine]] (LASM), which became prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. Amongst others in Latin America, both [[Salvador Allende]] in Chile in the early 1970s and [[Tabaré Vázquez]] in Uruguay from 2005 have implemented LASM principles.&lt;ref name=briggsAJPH09&gt;Briggs, Charles, and Mantini-Briggs, Clara (2009), ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', "Confronting Health Disparities: Latin American Social Medicine in Venezuela", I(3)&lt;/ref&gt; LASM's roots can be traced back to 19th-century European social medicine (particularly the work of [[social medicine]] pioneer [[Rudolf Virchow]]), which was exported to Latin America in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt;

LASM emphasises a collective and [[holism|holistic]] approach to healthcare, rather than merely treating the particular symptoms of one individual. Thus the importance of health promotion and disease prevention is stressed—informed by the political-economic and [[social determinants of health]]—over a merely reactive treatment of health problems as they occur.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt; LASM incorporates the concept of [[primary health care]] (as defined by the 1978 [[Alma Ata Declaration]]), of which the "simplified healthcare" adopted in rural Venezuela in the 1960s and 1970s was one form.&lt;ref&gt;Hall JJ, Taylor R. (2003), ''Medical Journal of Australia'', [http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_01_060103/hal10723_fm.pdf "Health for all beyond 2000: the demise of the Alma-Ata Declaration and primary health care in developing countries"], 178(1):17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benyoussef A, Christian B. Health care in developing countries. ''[[Soc Sci Med]]'' 1977; 11: 399–408.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2006, Barrio Adentro was described by the Director of the [[PAHO]] as "the culmination of 25 years of experience in Latin America and the rest of the world in transforming health systems through the primary health care strategy."&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;

When Hugo Chávez became President in 1999, he sought to implement LASM principles, beginning with their incorporation into the new [[1999 Venezuelan Constitution]], in articles 83–85 of Title III. These articles enshrine free and high quality healthcare as a human right guaranteed to all Venezuelan citizens.&lt;ref name="1999constitutionES"/&gt; Notably, Article 84 of Title III follows LASM principles in declaring health promotion and disease prevention a priority; it also describes the healthcare system as "decentralised and participative" and declares that the community has "the right and the duty" to be involved in policy decisions regarding the public health system. In addition, Article 85 mandates that the government provide adequate funding for the public healthcare system, while Article 84 explicitly proscribes its [[privatization]].&lt;ref name=1999constitutionES&gt;{{Citation

 | accessdate = 30 January 2006
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial attempts to transform the Ministry of Health to LASM principles, in the 1999–2003 period, met with little success. The [[Venezuelan Medical Federation]] was aligned with the [[Punto Fijo Pact|Punto Fijo]] parties, and many of its members in private health care opposed the new emphasis on the public sector. At the same time that the new policies failed to make much ground within the healthcare system, the traditional top-down way in which the policies were developed and carried out prevented a strong connection with the concerns of the poor.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt;

The origins of a different approach for carrying out LASM lay in the [[Libertador Municipality (Venezuelan Capital District)|Libertador municipality]] of [[Caracas]],&lt;ref&gt;Although some less direct precursors can be identified, such as the 1997 takeover in [[23 de Enero]] of a clinic which had refused treatment to some poisoned children.[http://clas.berkeley.edu/Events/spring2007/02-05-07-briggs/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2003 (under a pro-Chávez mayor, [[Freddy Bernal]]) set up an [[Institute for Endogenous Development]] (IED), broadly intended to improve living conditions through the active participation of the local population. Following a series of discussions between IED and local residents, a proposal was formulated to set up a "Plan Barrio Adentro" using small local clinics to provide free healthcare "inside the neighbourhood" where previously there was none, and to involve residents in the management of the scheme. Bernal then issued a call for doctors, but the Venezuelan Medical Federation put pressure on its members not to apply.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; Of the 50 Venezuelan doctors who did apply, 30 left on hearing that they would need to live in the barrios; the remaining 20 were specialists and therefore employed in specialist centers and not required to work in the primary health care centers in the barrios.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;  Faced with a lack of willing doctors, Bernal recalled the Cuban doctors who had provided emergency aid following the [[Vargas tragedy|1999 mud slides]], and discussion with the Cuban Embassy in February 2003 ultimately led to a contingent of 58 Cuban doctors starting the program in April 2003.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt; In the interim, three Cuban physicians spent a month visiting the barrios, examining the homes and clinic spaces offered by the community.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; By May 2003, another 100 Cuban doctors arrived, and were sent to other parts of Libertador and to other municipalities in and around Caracas.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; Besides diagnosis and treatment, including the provision of free prescription drugs, the doctors carried out a health census of the barrios, which provided a complete health survey of the Caracas barrios for the first time.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;

Despite some obstacles (including a refusal by public hospitals to accept referrals for diagnosis and treatment, only gradually and partially overcome during 2003), "Plan Barrio Adentro" became very popular with its constituents.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;  By December 2003, "Plan Barrio Adentro"—having seen over 9 million patient consultations and 4 million health interventions&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;—was so popular that it was attracting national attention, and President Chávez transformed it into a national program, named "Mission Barrio Adentro" (MBA). It became the first of a series of popular "missions" bypassing existing public institutions.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt;

===Barrio Adentro I===
"The key aspect of these centers is that they are located within the neighborhood and in the marginalized zones of the large cities,"&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; although some facilities were located in higher income areas.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt; "Placement of Barrio Adentro health posts within those neighborhoods that had been most excluded was undertaken at the request of the neighborhood health committees and taking into consideration preexisting health care facilities."&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

A key part of the national Barrio Adentro scheme, as it was in the original local plan, is the participation of the local community. This takes place through health committees, chosen in an assembly of citizens and typically around 10 people. By 2006, some 8,951 health committees had been registered, one for each primary care post.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; (The total was already 6,241 in 2004.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;) A total of 41,639 community health assemblies were held in the first quarter of 2006, with the participation of 1,423,815 people.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;

The issue of participation goes beyond mere management. As one academic study put it, "the observed role of positive, egalitarian clinical interactions between Cuban physicians and Venezuelan patients and other residents suggests that doctor–patient interactions model power relations between communities and institutions and affect local perceptions and participation." It concluded that developing more positive and egalitarian physician/patient and professional/community relationships "may be one of the easiest, most effective ways" the medical profession can contribute to overcoming health disparities.&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt;

Each primary care post covered 250 to 300 families.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; By 2003, primary medical care coverage was achieved for 70% of the Venezuelan population for whom primary care was previously unavailable, representing over 18 million people. By 2007, 3,717 primary care posts had been built and equipped, and a total of 8,633 posts were operational (including those still located in community centers and homes). There were also 4,800 dentists. In 1998, Venezuela had only 1,628 staffed primary care posts, and 800 dentists. Between 1998 and 2007, this represented an increase of 530% and 600%, respectively.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

In addition to the new infrastructure, there were also new outreach programmes. For example, in addition to the drug module for the popular medical dispensaries (which provided free access to 106 essential medicines designed to cover the needs at this level of care), a family drug module was launched in 2005. This programme reached 40 selected municipalities in 17 states, and every three months delivered drugs and vitamin supplements tailored to the family's needs. Hundreds of thousands of infants, children, and pregnant and elderly women have benefited.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; Over 150,000 health promoters from local communities were trained in 2004–2006 to spread messages relating to ways of improving health.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;

===Barrio Adentro II===
After the Barrio Adentro's primary care network went nationwide in 2004, moves to expand beyond primary care soon followed. What became known as "Barrio Adentro I" focused on primary health care. "Barrio Adentro II" focused on secondary care, in three main areas: Comprehensive Diagnosis Centers (for more advanced diagnosis), Comprehensive Rehabilitation Centers (for people with disabilities, another social deficit uncovered by Barrio Adentro I—there were only 78 public sector centers in 1998), and Advanced Technology Centers (for more advanced treatment). Plans were made for 600 each of the first two facilities (each serving a population of approximately 40,000 to 50,000) and 35 of the latter (with at least one in each state).&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

As of 2007, Barrio Adentro II involved 417 Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers (of 600 planned), 576 Comprehensive Rehabilitation Centers (of 600 planned), and 22 Advanced Technology Centers (of 35 planned). Key modern technology is split between CDCs and ATCs (by 2007 CDCs had 13 of the 19 public sector MRI machines, ATCs 15 of the 26 CT scanners). In 1998, there was only one MRI machine and five CT scanners in the public sector.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;

===Barrio Adentro III and IV===
Barrio Adentro III provides care for those cases which cannot be resolved at the two lower levels—major illnesses, palliative and specialist care. Care is available 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;  Barrio Adentro IV is responsible for the most complicated and specialized medical and surgical needs. These are national and referral facilities where teaching and research is carried out.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt;  On 16 November 2006, the Chávez government introduced this phase of the Barrio Adentro project, with a planned 16 hospitals to be built around the country, especially in poor areas.&lt;ref&gt;''Mather, Steven'' (''Venezuela analysis'' 17 Nov 2006) [http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news.php?newsno=2139 Venezuela’s Legislature Passes Disability Rights Law] Retrieved 18 Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Dr. Gilberto Rodríguez Ochoa Latin American Children’s Cardiology Hospital, inaugurated in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;ABN, 20 August 2007, [http://www.abn.info.ve/go_news5.php?articulo=100984 President Chávez highlights the need to make a people’s debate about constitutional reform]&lt;/ref&gt; is the most notable example,&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt; being one of the largest centers of its kind in the world, with 142 hospital beds and 33 intensive care beds.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt;

===Creation of related Missions===
As the work of the first primary health care Barrio Adentro proceeded, censuses began to reveal "the depth of the social deficits accumulated in these communities."&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; The response was to expand into a number of new areas, creating new missions. Thus under [[Mission Mercal|Misión Alimentación]], efforts are made to ensure that the vulnerable (children, elderly, etc.) receive at least two meals a day. [[Misión Robinson]] was created to address illiteracy, which in turn led to [[Operación Milagro|Misión Milagro]] to deal with the revealed deficit of ophthalmological care for eye disease.

==Analysis==
From 1998 to 2007, the infant mortality rate fell from 21.3 to 13 per 1,000 registered births.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; Between 2003 and 2007, 4,659 new comprehensive level I and II health care centers were built and equipped. Services in these centers is provided free of charge.&lt;ref name="alvaradoaetal08"/&gt; However, Jorge Díaz-Polanco, a sociologist of the Center for Development Studies (CENDES), stated that despite an increase of investment, the maternal mortality rate increased and in 2009, the rate was 70 deaths per 100,000, the highest since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ECadentro&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arenas|first1=Vanessa|title=Díaz Polanco: Tasa de mortalidad materna aumentó durante Misión Barrio Adentro|url=http://www.efectococuyo.com/efecto-cocuyo/diaz-polanco-tasa-de-mortalidad-materna-aumento-durante-mision-barrio-adentro/|accessdate=29 March 2015|agency=[[Efecto Cocuyo]]|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 and 2005, Barrio Adentro provided 150 million consultations, four times as many as the conventional outpatient network; 40% of these were home visits.&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; "In surveys conducted by the Venezuelan government's National Statistics Institute (INE) in Caracas, 97 percent of the respondents said that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their general medical consultations, and 98 percent said they had little or no difficulty gaining access to health care, while 88.5 percent said that they had some or considerable difficulty gaining access to health care prior to Barrio Adentro."&lt;ref name="paho2006"/&gt; However, in Caracas, Mission Barrio Adentro I and II centers in 32 parishes were the subject of constant complaints about performance even after being funded Bs 1.492 million by the government. Councilman Alejandro Vivas stated that "instead of having positive results, what is observed is the discontent of the citizens for a performance that leaves much to be desired".&lt;ref name=MBAeu/&gt; One academic study noted that the successes of the Barrio Adentro program in 2003 and 2004 may have "crucially inﬂuenced" Chávez's 59% to 41% victory in the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004]].&lt;ref name="briggsAJPH09"/&gt;

By 2017, it was reported by ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' that though the program had "saved lives",  it was "also clear the program is less effective than the administration would like the world to believe", with reports of exaggerated and fraudulent data being reported by Cuban medical personnel who had previously worked under the mission.&lt;ref name=MHjan2017/&gt;

===Abandonment===
In July 2007, Douglas León Natera, chairman of The Venezuelan Medical Federation, reported that up to 70% of the modules of Barrio Adentro have been either abandoned or were left unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Matheus, Ricardo. [http://www.2001.com.ve/registro_noticias.asp?registro=81599&amp;sw=1 Abandonados 70% de módulos de BA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004706/http://www.2001.com.ve/registro_noticias.asp?registro=81599&amp;sw=1 |date=27 September 2007 }} ''[[Diario 2001]]'' (29 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the Venezuelan government accused elected opposition officials of trying to impede or close existing Missions. In 2006 Chávez accused the governor of Zulia state of impeding Barrio Adentro there.&lt;ref name=eluniversal110806&gt;''El Universal'' (11 Aug 2006) [http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/09/09/pol_art_09106A.shtml Acusó a Gobernación del Zulia de "sabotear" Barrio Adentro] Retrieved 9 Sep 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to investigative journalist Patricia Marcano, in 2010 the Venezuelan government promised to start 357 clinics but only 148 were completed. In 2012, 298 clinics were promised, while 175 were made and in 2013, 62 were promised, but only 35 were constructed.&lt;ref name=ECadentro/&gt;

In December 2014, it was estimated that 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments were abandoned with reports of some structures being filled with trash or being unintentional shelter for the homeless.&lt;ref name=LPdec2014/&gt; The majority of Cuban medical personnel has also left Venezuela.&lt;ref name="COA"/&gt;

===Defections===
In August 2006, the United States under [[George W. Bush]] created the Cuban Medical Professional Parole program, specifically targeting Cuban medical personnel and encouraging them to defect when they are working in a country outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=brouwer09&gt;''[[Monthly Review]]'', January 2009, [http://www.monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php The Cuban Revolutionary Doctor: The Ultimate Weapon of Solidarity]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 paper published in [[The Lancet]] medical journal, "growing numbers of Cuban doctors sent overseas to work are defecting to the USA".&lt;ref name="defect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Cubanos desertores atrapados en Bogotá" ''El Universal'' 3 Feb 2007 [http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2007/02/03/pol_art_166219.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors working abroad are reported to be monitored by "minders" and subject to curfew.&lt;ref name="defect"&gt;{{Citation|title=Cuban doctors working abroad defect to the USA|publisher=The Lancet, Volume 369, Issue 9569|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, seven Cuban doctors who defected to the US introduced an indictment against the governments of Cuba and Venezuela and the oil company [[PDVSA]] for what they considered was a conspiracy to force them to work under conditions of "modern slaves" as payment for the Cuban government debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticias24.com/actualidad/noticia/144581/siete-medicos-cubanos-demandan-a-cuba-y-venezuela-por-esclavitud-moderna/|title=Siete médicos cubanos demandan a Cuba y Venezuela por “esclavitud moderna” |website=Noticias24.com |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was reported by Miami NGO, Solidarity Without Borders, that at least 700 Cuban medical personnel had left Venezuela in the past year and that up to hundreds of Cuban personnel had asked for advice on how to escape from Venezuela weekly.&lt;ref name=ABCnov2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vinogradoff|first1=Ludmila|title=16 November 2014|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/20141112/abci-medicos-cubanos-desertores-en-masa-venezuela-201411111936.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|agency=ABC (Spanish)|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarity Without Borders also stated that Cuban personnel cannot refuse to work, cannot express complaints and suffer with blackmail from threats against their family in Cuba.&lt;ref name=ABCnov2014/&gt;

==Controversy==
===Licensure===
The Venezuelan Medical Federation, the largest association of [[medical doctors]] in Venezuela, lobbied vigorously against the use of Cuban doctors in ''Mission Barrio Adentro'', and was in a legal dispute with the Chávez administration over the legitimacy of the Cuban doctors' licensure and practice. In 2003, they obtained a court order preventing Cuban doctors from practicing in Venezuela, on the basis that they were not properly licensed according to the Venezuelan system; a compromise was reached enabling them to continue working in Barrio Adentro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/09/11/ccs_art_11277B.shtml "Sobre Plan Barrio Adentro: Rangel Avalos reitera desacato a decisión de Corte"] ''El Universal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/11/12/pol_art_12108C.shtml "Sala Constitucional se negó a pronunciarse sobre ejercicio de médicos cubanos: Gobierno deberá llevar caso Barrio Adentro a otra instancia"] ''El Universal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2003/08/23/ccs_art_23272BB.shtml "Desacato al amparo acarreará sanciones jurídicas"] ''El Universal''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irregularities in funding===
In 2014, the Comptroller General of the Republic "found serious irregularities in the process of repair, modernization and extension of eight national referral hospitals". In 2006, the Venezuelan government funded companies without reasons and without certain regulations. The Comptroller said that the project was "marked by weakness and improvisations" and that "[t]his authorization does not imply commitment to the Foundation or the MPPS (Ministry of Health)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alonso|first=Juan|title=Contraloría detectó vicios en obras de Barrio Adentro III|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140419/contraloria-detecto-vicios-en-obras-de-barrio-adentro-iii|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumping of medicine and faking of reports===
In 2017, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' reported that groups of Cuban health care workers who had defected from the program stated that due to the daily quotas of patients, they would often feel pressured to fake paperwork and throw away medicine, since regular audits of their supplies meant they needed them to match their patient count. If Cuban medical personnel did not meet their quotas, they were threatened with having their pay cut or being sent back to Cuba.&lt;ref name=MHjan2017/&gt;

{{Bolivarian Missions}}
[[Image:Mision Identidad.png|left|89px]]
'''Mission Identidad''' is one of the [[Bolivarian Missions]] (a series of anti-poverty and social welfare programs) implemented by [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]]. This program provides Venezuelan national identity cards to facilitate access to the social services provided by the other Missions. 

Misión Identidad mainly seeks to ease the process of obtaining an ID card. Venezuela has had a national system of ID cards since the 1940s, and these ID documents need to be renewed every 10 years. Foreigners living in the country also need to possess an ID; this foreigner's ID would be equivalent to the U.S. alien registration card (or [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]]). In Venezuela, under this Mission, it is absolutely forbidden to ask any money for this document, and foreigners who comply with all the legal requirements can legally obtain one. Possession of this document is required before one can vote in Venezuelan elections.

==Controversy==
In a study by the [[Center for a Secure Free Society]] (SFS), at least 173 people from the [[Middle East]] were caught with Venezuelan documentation. The SFS believes that the documentation was provided by the Venezuelan government through Mission Identidad, stating that 70% of the people came from Iran, Lebanon and Syria "and had some connection with Hezbollah". The majority allegedly had Venezuelan passports, IDs, visas and in some cases, even Venezuelan [[birth certificate]]s. One of the key figures of the Venezuelan government noted in the SFS report was the Lebanese born former Minister of the Interior, [[Tarek El Aissami]], who allegedly "developed a sophisticated financial network and multi-level networks as a criminal-terrorist pipeline to bring Islamic militants to Venezuela and neighboring countries, and to send illicit funds from Latin America to the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela, el principal nexo de Hezbollah para su ingreso a América del Norte|url=http://www.infobae.com/2014/09/10/1593759-venezuela-el-principal-nexo-hezbollah-su-ingreso-america-del-norte|accessdate=12 September 2014|agency=Infobae|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maria Delgado|first1=Antonio|title=Venezuela, trampolin del Hezbola|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2014/09/10/1839178/venezuela-trampolin-del-hezbola.html|accessdate=12 September 2014|agency=El Nuevo Herald|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tapia Reynolds|first1=Gioconda|title=Los fuertes vínculos entre Venezuela y Hezbolá|url=http://www.voanoticias.com/content/venezuela-hezbollah-terrorismo-tarek-el-aissami-nexos/2447720.html|accessdate=28 March 2015|agency=Voz de America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenic '''Nanwan Reservoir'''&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/191413.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is located within the borough of [[Xinyang]], Henan Province, China, situated on the [[Shihe river]], one of the largest branches of the [[Huai River]].  The dam was constructed between 1952 and 1955.  The dam has resulted in protection from floods, an increase in agriculture production, electricity production, and improved navigation that benefits tourism.The Nanwan Reservoir scenic spot has rich connotations of mountains and islands. It is known as "The First Lake In Zhongyuan". It is a national forest park and national irrigation works scenery zone.

== Specifications ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Nanwan Reservoir is a famous natural scenic spot.  Nanwan Reservoir and The Nanwan Reservoir national forest park comprise The Nanwan Reservoir Scenic Spot. There are 61 islands which are covered by forests interspersed in the Nanwan Reservoir.
Since developed and constructed as a national forest scenic spot since 1991, a total investment of 80 million yuan has been invested to Nanwan Reservoir. Now 4 main scenic areas of Nanwan Reservoir scenic spot has completed,they are the water scenic area, the western hills scenic area,the dam scenic area and the pier scenic area. 42 scenic attractions has been constructed, for example, dragon Pavilion, Bird Island, Summer Island and Monkey Island,etc.
The dam is 816 metres long, 38.3 metres tall, and 8 metres wide at the crest.
The reservoir holds 16.3 cubic kilometres of water, and drains an 1100 km2 area.  This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every ten years to once every 100 years.

== Impact ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Huai River.  Plenty of critical infrastructure is situated downstream of the dam, like Beijing-Guangzhou railway, Nanjing-Xi'an Railway, 107 State Road, 312 National Road, Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway, Beijing - Kowloon fiber optic cable, and Western Union fiber optic cable.
There are approximate 20 million tourists come to Nanwan Reservoir each year, bring 30 million yuan of tourism revenue to the local government. The basic tourism system of "dinner, housing, transportation, traveling, shopping and entertainment" has been established integradedly in Nanwan Reservoir scenic spot.

==Natural and Cultural Resources==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Nanwan Reservoir is famous of lush forest resources, the vast expansion of green water, many exotic islands and harbor, numerous exotic animals，beautiful and fascinating flowers and plants, long history, strong folk culture. It is a multi-function eco-tourism zone which gathers natural landscape, culture sight, economic education, forest health hygienical spot.
Hundreds of smart and lovely wild monkeys live in the Monkey Island, tourists like them much. Folk songs and dances performances and snakes technical performances on the Summer Island have unique local style. Wild boar, camels, lions, tigers and other animals lived in Baishou Gardon feast the visitors eyes.
Fish grown in Nanwan Reservoir are not only delicious but also rich in trace elements. The anti-cancer element "Se" in the fish of Nanwan Reservoir is 3-5 times more than the common fish. Especially the silver carp grown in Nanwan Reservoir which has rich DHA in its head is popular health treasures.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Upstream area of Nanwan Reservoir is the authentic origin of Xinyang Maojian, which is a precious kind of green tea. It was imperial tribute since Tang Dynasty

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Necrotizing fasciitis''' ('''NF'''), commonly known as '''flesh-eating disease''', is an [[infection]] that results in the [[necrosis|death]] of the body's [[soft tissue]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; Symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, [[fever]], and vomiting.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The most commonly affected areas are the [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and [[perineum]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or [[burn]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; Risk factors include [[immunodeficiency|poor immune function]] such as from [[diabetes]] or [[cancer]], [[obesity]], [[alcoholism]], [[intravenous drug use]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; It is not typically spread between people.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; [[Medical imaging]] is helpful to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Paz2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paz Maya|first1=S|last2=Dualde Beltrán|first2=D|last3=Lemercier|first3=P|last4=Leiva-Salinas|first4=C|title=Necrotizing fasciitis: an urgent diagnosis|journal=Skeletal Radiology|date=May 2014|volume=43|issue=5|pages=577–89|pmid=24469151|doi=10.1007/s00256-013-1813-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper [[wound care]] and [[handwashing]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Necrotizing Fasciitis: A Rare Disease, Especially for the Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/Features/NecrotizingFasciitis/|website=CDC|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=June 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809193909/http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/|archivedate=9 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually treated with [[debridement|surgery to remove the infected tissue]] and intravenous [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=Hak2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hakkarainen |first1=Timo W. |last2=Kopari |first2=Nicole M. |last3=Pham |first3=Tam N. |last4=Evans |first4=Heather L. |title=Necrotizing soft tissue infections: Review and current concepts in treatment, systems of care, and outcomes |journal=Current Problems in Surgery |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=344–62 |year=2014 |pmid=25069713 |pmc=4199388 |doi=10.1067/j.cpsurg.2014.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; Often, a combination of antibiotics is used, such as [[penicillin G]], [[clindamycin]], [[vancomycin]], and [[gentamicin]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; Delays in surgery are associated with a much higher risk of death.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; Despite high-quality treatment, the risk of death is between 25 and 35%.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- History and epidemiology --&gt;
Necrotizing fasciitis affects 0.4 to 1.0 person per 100,000 per year.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; Both sexes are affected equally.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; It becomes more common among older people and is rare in children.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; It has been described at least since the time of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; The term "necrotizing fasciitis" first came into use in 1952.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=B |title=Necrotizing fasciitis |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=416–31 |year=1952 |pmid=14915014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include fever, swelling, and complaint of excessive pain. The initial skin changes are similar to [[cellulitis]] or [[abscess]], thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. Hardening of the skin and soft tissue and swelling beyond the area of skin changes are commonly present in those with early necrotizing changes.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense.&lt;ref name="Trent 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trent |first1=Jennifer T. |last2=Kirsner |first2=Robert S. |year=2002 |title=Necrotizing fasciitis |journal=Wounds |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=284–92 |url=http://www.woundsresearch.com/article/945 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of [[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]], [[ecchymosis|bleeding into the skin]] which is present before skin [[necrosis]]&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; (skin turning from red to purple and black due to [[thrombosis]] of blood vessels),&lt;ref name="Trent 2002"/&gt; presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves).&lt;ref name="Trent 2002"/&gt; Rapid progression to [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as [[Fournier gangrene]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

However, those who are immunocompromised (have cancer, use [[corticosteroid]], on [[radiotherapy]], [[chemotherapy]], [[HIV/AIDS]], or prior organ or [[bone marrow]] transplantation) may not show normal symptoms. Immunocompromised persons also have two-fold higher risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

==Cause==

===Risk factors===
More than 70% of cases are recorded in people with at least one of these clinical situations: immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism/drug abuse/smoking, malignancies, and chronic systemic diseases. For reasons that are unclear, it occasionally occurs in people with an apparently normal general condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Pricop M, Urechescu H, Sîrbu A, Urtilă E |title= Fasceita necrozantă cervico-toracică: caz clinic și recenzie a literaturii de specialitate |trans-title= Necrotizing cervical fasciitis: clinical case and review of literature |language= ro |journal= Revista de chirurgie oro-maxilo-facială și implantologie [Journal of oro-maxillo-facial surgery and implantology] |issn= 2069-3850 |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–6 |date= Mar 2011 |url= http://www.revistaomf.ro/(1)Colectia-pe-ani/(15)Anul-2011/(16)Numarul-1-2011/(17)Fasceita-necrozanta-cervico-toracica-caz-clinic-si-recenzie-a-literaturii-de-specialitate |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160322050522/http://www.revistaomf.ro/(1)Colectia-pe-ani/(15)Anul-2011/(16)Numarul-1-2011/(17)Fasceita-necrozanta-cervico-toracica-caz-clinic-si-recenzie-a-literaturii-de-specialitate |archivedate= 2016-03-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Necrotizing fasciitis can occur at any part of the body, but it is more commonly seen at the extremities, [[perineum]], and [[genital]]s. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Trauma is the usual cause of the infection such as intravenous drug injection, insulin injection, animals and insect bites, catheter insertion over the skin, or a [[fistula]] connecting skin to the internal body organs. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. Spreading of infection through blood has been suggested for those with streptococcal pharyngitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals ([[Fournier gangrene]]), trauma, surgery, [[urinary tract infection]], stones, and [[Bartholin gland]] abscess are the usual causes.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

===Bacteria===
Types of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This classification system was first described by Giuliano and  his colleagues in 1977.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

'''Type I infection'''  - This is the most common type of infection which accounts for 70 to 80% of the cases. It is caused by a mixture of bacterial types, usually in abdominal or groin areas.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; This type of infection is usually caused by various species of [[Gram-positive]] cocci,(''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and [[enterococci]]), [[Gram-negative]] rods,  (''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''), and anaerobes, (''[[Bacteroides]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' species).&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; Populations of those affected are typically older with medical comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and immunodeficiency.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection.  ''Clostridium'' species involved are ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', ''[[Clostridium septicum]]'', and ''[[Clostridium sordellii]]'', which typically cause [[gas gangrene]] (also known as myonecrosis). ''Clostridium perfringens'' produces two deadly toxins: [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin|alpha-toxin]] and theta-toxin. Alpha-toxin causes excessive platelet aggregation which blocks blood vessels and deprives the vital organs of oxygen supply. This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. When alpha-toxin is absorbed by soft tissues, it can inhibit the [[Leukocyte extravasation|migration of white blood cells from blood vessels into the soft tissue]], thus impairing [[phagocyte]] function. The two toxins together can cause [[haemolysis|destruction of red blood cells in blood vessels]], damage to the integrity of the blood vessels, and suppression of heart function.

''Clostridium sordellii'' can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). TcsL and TcsH are both members of the [[Clostridial Cytotoxin family|large clostridial cytotoxin]] (LCC) family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=Glen P. |title=TcsL Is an Essential Virulence Factor in Clostridium sordellii ATCC 9714 |journal=Infection and Immunity |date=2011 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=1025–1032 |url=http://iai.asm.org/content/79/3/1025.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key ''Clostridium septicum'' virulence factor is a [[pore-forming toxin]] called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the ''Clostridium perfringens'' alpha-toxin. Myonecrotic infections caused by these clostridial species commonly occur in injecting [[heroin]] users. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with [[Serous fluid|serum]] (serosanguinous discharge). [[shock (circulatory)|Shock]] can progress rapidly after initial injury or infection, and once the state of shock is established, the chance of dying exceeds 50%. Another bacterium associated with similar rapid disease progression is [[group A streptococcal infection]] (mostly ''Streptococcus pyogenes''). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

'''Type II infection''' - This infection accounts for 20 to 30% of the cases, mainly involving the extremities.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaraniStrong2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarani |first1=Babak |last2=Strong |first2=Michelle |last3=Pascual |first3=Jose |last4=Schwab |first4=C. William |title=Necrotizing Fasciitis: Current Concepts and Review of the Literature |journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons |volume=208 |issue=2 |pages=279–88 |year=2009 |pmid=19228540 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.10.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mainly involves  ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' bacteria or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as [[toxic shock syndrome]]. ''Streptococcus'' species produce [[M protein (Streptococcus)|M protein]], which acts as [[superantigen]], thus stimulating a massive systemic immune response, which is not effective against the bacterial antigen, precipitating shock. Type II infection more commonly affects young, healthy adults with a history of injury.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

'''Type III infection''' - ''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'', a bacterium found in [[Seawater|saltwater]], is a rare cause of this infection, which occurs through a break in the skin. Disease progression can be as rapid as type II infection without any visible skin changes.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

'''Type IV infection''' - Some authors have described the type IV infection as fungal infection.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt;

Early diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a [[cellulitis|simple superficial skin infection]].&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=April |first1=MD |last2=Long |first2=B |title=What Is the Accuracy of Physical Examination, Imaging, and the LRINEC Score for the Diagnosis of Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection? |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |date=13 August 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.06.029 |pmid=30115465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold standard for diagnosis is a surgical exploration in a setting of high suspicion. When in doubt, a small incision can be made into the affected tissue, and if a finger easily separates the tissue along the [[fascia]]l plane, the diagnosis is confirmed and an extensive [[debridement]] should be performed.&lt;ref name=Hak2014 /&gt;

===Medical imaging===

Imaging has a limited role in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The time delay in performing imaging is a major concern. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] tissue) which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by the bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are more sensitive modalities than plain radiography. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough rule out necrotizing changes completely.&lt;ref name=Hak2014 /&gt; CT scan may show fascial thickening, edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation.&lt;ref name=Hak2014 /&gt; In MRI, when  fluid collection with deep fascia involvement occurs, thickening or enhancement with [[Contrast medium|contrast]] injection, necrotizing fasciitis should be strongly suspected. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis.&lt;ref name=Hak2014 /&gt; CT scan is able to detect about 80% of cases, while MRI may pick up slightly more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puvanendran|first1=R|last2=Huey|first2=JC|last3=Pasupathy|first3=S|title=Necrotizing fasciitis|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=October 2009|volume=55|issue=10|pages=981–7|pmid=19826154|pmc=2762295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring system===
A white blood cell count less than 15,000 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and serum sodium level greater than 135&amp;nbsp;mmol/l have a sensitivity of 90% in detecting the necrotizing soft tissue infection. It also has a 99% chance of [[Positive and negative predictive values|ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise]]. Various scoring systems are being developed to determine the likelihood of getting necrotizing fasciitis, but a scoring system developed by Wong and colleagues in 2004 is the most commonly used. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. It uses six laboratory values: [[C-reactive protein]], total [[white blood cell]] count, [[hemoglobin]], [[sodium]], [[creatinine]], and blood [[glucose]].&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; A score greater than or equal to 6 indicates that necrotizing fasciitis should be seriously considered.&lt;ref name="Wong 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong |first1=Chin-Ho |last2=Khin |first2=Lay-Wai |last3=Heng |first3=Kien-Seng |last4=Tan |first4=Kok-Chai |last5=Low |first5=Cheng-Ooi |title=The LRINEC (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis) score: A tool for distinguishing necrotizing fasciitis from other soft tissue infections |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1535–41 |year=2004 |pmid=15241098 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000129486.35458.7D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scoring criteria are:
*CRP (mg/L) ≥150: 4 points
*WBC count (×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
**&lt;15: 0 points
**15–25: 1 point
**&gt;25: 2 points
*Hemoglobin (g/dl)
**&gt;13.5: 0 points
**11–13.5: 1 point
**&lt;11: 2 points
*Sodium (mmol/l) &lt;135: 2 points
*Creatinine (umol/l) &gt;141: 2 points
*Glucose (mmol/l) &gt;10: 1 point&lt;ref name="Wong 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emergency-medicine-tutorials.org/Home/medical-3/infectious-diseases-1/bacterial/necrotising-fascitis/lrinec-scoring-system-for-necrotising-fascitis |title=LRINEC scoring system for necrotising fasciitis |website=EMT Emergency Medicine Tutorials |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914215239/http://www.emergency-medicine-tutorials.org/Home/medical-3/infectious-diseases-1/bacterial/necrotising-fascitis/lrinec-scoring-system-for-necrotising-fascitis |archivedate=2011-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the scoring system has not been validated. The values would be falsely positive if any other inflammatory conditions are present. Therefore, the values derived from this scoring system should be interpreted with caution.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; About 10% of patients with necrotizing fasciitis in the original study still had a LRINEC score &lt;6.&lt;ref name="Wong 2004"/&gt; A validation study showed that patients with a LRINEC score ≥6 have a higher rate of both death and amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Su |first1=Yi-Chun |last2=Chen |first2=Hung-Wen |last3=Hong |first3=Yu-Cheng |last4=Chen |first4=Chih-Tsung |last5=Hsiao |first5=Cheng-Ting |last6=Chen |first6=I-Chuan |title=Laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis score and the outcomes |journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |volume=78 |issue=11 |pages=968–72 |year=2008 |pmid=18959694 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2008.04713.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Necrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good [[wound care]] and handwashing.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt;

==Treatment==
Surgical [[debridement]] (cutting away affected tissue) is the mainstay of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. Tissue cultures (rather than wound swabs) are taken to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage, and antibiotics may be changed in light of results. Besides blood pressure control and hydration, support should be initiated for those with unstable vital signs and low urine output.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

===Surgery===
Aggressive wound debridement should be performed early, usually as soon as the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is made. Surgical incisions often extend beyond the areas of induration (the hardened tissue) to remove the damaged blood vessels that are responsible for the induration. However, cellulitic soft tissues are sometimes spared from debridement for later skin coverage of the wound. More than one operation may be used to remove additional necrotic tissue. In some cases when an extremity is affected by a NSTI, amputation may be the surgical treatment of choice. After the wound debridement, adequate dressings should be applied to prevent exposure of bones, [[tendon]]s, and [[cartilage]]s so that such structures do not dry out and to promote wound healing.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, [[colostomy]] may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean.&lt;ref name="Hak2014" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Antibiotics===
Traditionally, empiric antibiotics are initiated as soon as the diagnosis of NSTI has been made and then later changed to culture-guided antibiotic therapy. In the case of NSTIs, empiric antibiotics are broad-spectrum, covering gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hu2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=C|last2=Bosc|first2=R|last3=Sbidian|first3=E|last4=De Prost|first4=N|last5=Hughes|first5=C|last6=Jabre|first6=P|last7=Chosidow|first7=O|last8=Le Cleach|first8=L|date=31 May 2018|title=Interventions for necrotizing soft tissue infections in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD011680|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011680.pub2|pmid=29851032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While studies have compared moxifloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (a penicillin) and evaluated appropriate duration of treatment (varying from 7 to 21 days), no definitive conclusions on the efficacy of treatment, ideal duration of treatment, or the adverse effects could be made due to poor-quality evidence.&lt;ref name=Hu2018/&gt;

===Add on therapy===
- '''Hyperbaric oxygen''': While human and animal studies have shown that high oxygen tension in tissues helps to reduce edema, stimulate [[fibroblast]] growth, and increase the killing ability of white blood cells, inhibit bacterial toxin release, and increase antibiotic efficacy,&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; no high-quality trials have been shown to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with NSTIs.&lt;ref name=Hu2018/&gt;

- '''Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)''': No clear difference between using IVIG and placebo has been shown in the treatment of NSTIs, and one study showed serious adverse effects with IVIG use, including acute kidney injury, allergic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, thrombi, and transmissible agents.&lt;ref name=Hu2018/&gt;

- '''AB103''': One study assessed the efficacy of a new type of treatment that affects the immune response, called AB103. The study showed no difference in mortality with use of this therapy, but it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to low-quality evidence.&lt;ref name=Hu2018/&gt;

- '''Supportive therapy''': Supportive therapy, often including intravenous hydration, wound care, anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic events, pain control, et cetera should always be provided to patients when appropriate.

==Epidemiology==
Necrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt; About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis cases occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt; In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people.&lt;ref name=Paz2014/&gt;

Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have [[peripheral vascular disease]]. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] may increase the rates of necrotizing infections due to the modification of immune response in the body, because NSAIDs inhibit the [[cycloxygenase]] -1 and cycloxygenase-2 enzymes which are important in producing [[thromboxane]] and [[prostaglandin E2]]. Prostaglandin has been responsible for fever, inflammation, and pain. The inhibition of prostangladin E2 production reduces inflammatory response and leukocyte adhesion, and thus reduces immune response against bacterial invasion, giving rise to soft-tissue infection.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

==History==
In the fifth century BC, [[Hippocrates]] described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease which was the complication of streptococcal infection where those affected would have "[[erysipelas]] all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. Bones, flesh, and sinew (cord, tendon, or nerve) would fall off from the body and there were many deaths". The first English description for necrotizing soft-tissue infection was by British surgeon Leonard Gillespie and British physicians Gilbert Blaine and [[Thomas Trotter]] in the 18th century. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infection was known as phagedaenic (gnaw - biting or chewing which gradually make a hole or destroying it) ulcer, phagedena gangrenous, gangrenous ulcer, malignant ulcer, putrid ulcer, or hospital gangrene. Later,  "hospital gangrene" became more commonly used. In 1871, [[Confederate States Army]] surgeon Joseph Jones reported 2,642 cases of hospital gangrene with a mortality rate of 46%. In 1883, Dr [[Jean-Alfred Fournier]] described the necrotizing infection of the [[perineum]] and [[scrotum]] which termed as [[Fournier gangrene]] today. The term "necrotizing fasciitis" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Its definition has become broader, to include not only infection of [[fascia]], but also other soft-tissue infection.&lt;ref name=Hak2014/&gt;

'''James Neil Swallow''' (1931 – 29 April 2010) was a pioneering British dentist who developed treatments for adults and children with mental and physical disabilities. He co-authored a standard textbook on children's dentistry. In 1964, Swallow became senior lecturer in children's dentistry at the [[Cardiff Dental School]]. This was followed in 1975 by his appointment as professor of paediatric dentistry at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and then as professor of restorative dentistry at [[Belfast Dental School]] in 1978.

==Early life==
Swallow was born in [[Taunton]], England, in 1931. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery]] degree from the London Hospital in 1955.&lt;ref name="bdj"/&gt;

==Career==
Swallow founded clinics for children with disabilities at Dr Barnardo's Home and the London Hospital, during a period in which there was little interest in the [[oral health]] of disabled people.&lt;ref name="bdj"&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2010.625 "Obituary: James Neil Swallow".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301134708/https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2010.625 |date=2018-03-01 }} by SG, ''[[British Dental Journal]]'', Vol. 209, p. 53 (10 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently made night calls to construct feeding plates for new-born children with [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palates]].&lt;ref name=bdj/&gt;

Along with Geoffrey Slack and Phil Holloway, he authored ''Child Dental Health'' (1969) which for many years was a standard textbook on children's dentistry and well-remembered by dental students from his time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.902 "Phil Holloway"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301134711/https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.902 |date=2018-03-01 }} by I. Holloway, ''British Dental Journal'', Vol. 221, p. 696 (9 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he would visit the [[Bobath Centre|Bobaths]] at their centre in London for children with [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name="trib"&gt;[https://www.stephenhancocks.com/download.php?op=view_article&amp;article_id=351 "Tributes: James Neil Swallow BDS MDS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033234/https://www.stephenhancocks.com/download.php?op=view_article&amp;article_id=351 |date=2018-02-20 }}, Rob Hale, ''[[Journal of Disability and Oral Health]]'', Vol. 11 (2010), No. 2, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Swallow was awarded the A.A.E. Newth Prize by the [[Society of Medical Officers of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5g5qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=neil+swallow+dentist|title=The Dental School of the London Hospital Medical College, 1911–1991: The Story of the London's Dental School|last=Fish|first=S.

He moved to Cardiff in 1964, where he had been appointed as the first senior lecturer in children's dentistry at the then new [[Cardiff Dental School]]. He set up a course in [[Pediatric dentistry|paediatric dentistry]] and developed a dental service for children and adults with a disability. His MD thesis on the oral health of people with disability was published in 1967.&lt;ref name=trib/&gt; Swallow carried on treating children and adults with disabilities when he became professor of paediatric dentistry at the University of Amsterdam in 1975. In 1978, he was appointed professor of restorative dentistry at the [[Belfast Dental School]], where he remained until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3YgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=neil+swallow+dentist|title=The Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast: A History, 1797–1997|last=Clarke|first=Richard Samuel Jessop|date=1997|publisher=Blackstaff Press|year=|isbn=9780856406010|location=|pages=205|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301134708/https://books.google.com/books?id=D3YgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=neil+swallow+dentist|archivedate=2018-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned from Belfast, he started a dental practice at home with his second wife Barbara.&lt;ref name="bdj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

[[File:Bisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|[[Bisphenol A]] found in food and beverage packaging is an obesogen showing up in the bodies of about 95% of the human population.&lt;ref name = "Calafat_2005" /&gt;]]
'''Obesogens''' are foreign [[chemical compound]]s that disrupt normal [[human development (biology)|development]] and balance of [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], which in some cases, can lead to [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begley_2009"/&gt; Obesogens may be functionally defined as chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostasis]] and fat storage, change metabolic setpoints, disrupt energy balance or modify the regulation of [[appetite]] and [[satiety]] to promote fat accumulation and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner_2010"/&gt;

There are many different proposed mechanisms through which obesogens can interfere with the body's [[adipose tissue]] biology. These mechanisms include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors; dysregulation of [[sex steroid]] synthesis, action or breakdown; changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety; and reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Some of these proposed pathways include inappropriate modulation of [[nuclear receptor]] function which therefore allows the compounds to be classified as [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] that act to mimic hormones in the body, altering the normal homeostasis maintained by the endocrine system.&lt;ref name="Diamanti-Kandarakis_2009"/&gt;

Obesogens have been detected in the body both as a result of intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of [[pharmaceutical drugs]] such as [[diethylstilbestrol]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], and [[thiazolidinedione]] and as a result of unintentional exposure to environmental obesogens such as [[tributyltin]], [[bisphenol A]], [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|diethylhexylphthalate]], and [[perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The term obesogen was coined in 2006 by Felix Grün and Bruce Blumberg of the [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt; The topic of this proposed class of chemical compounds and how to counteract their effects is explored at length in the book ''[[The New American Diet]]''. Paula Baillie-Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/new-obesity Down To Earth: The new obesity]&lt;/ref&gt; a naturopath in the UK, hypothesized that obesogens make it difficult to [[weight loss|lose weight]] in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibarguchi.ca/teaching-CHEO/Baillie-Hamilton-Chems%20and%20obesity.pdf Chemical Toxins: A Hypothesis to Explain the Global Obesity Epidemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of action ==

There are many ways in which obesogenic drugs and chemicals can disrupt the body's adipose tissue biology. The three main mechanisms of action include
* alterations in the action of metabolic sensors in which obesogens mimic metabolic [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] acting to either block or upregulate [[hormone receptors]]
* dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis, in which they alter the ratio of sex hormones leading to changes in their control of lipid balance
* changes in the central integration of [[energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] including the regulation of appetite and satiety in the brain and the reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

=== Metabolic sensors ===

Obesogenic drugs and chemicals have been shown to target transcription regulators found in gene networks that function to control [[intracellular]] lipid homeostasis and proliferation and differentiation on adipocytes. The major group of regulators that is targeted is a group of nuclear hormone receptors known as [[peroxisome proliferator activated receptors]] (PPARα, δ, and γ). These hormone receptors sense a variety of metabolic ligands including lipophilic hormones, dietary fatty acids and their metabolites, and, depending on the varying levels of these ligands, control transcription of genes involved in balancing the changes in lipid balance in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; To become active and properly function as metabolic sensors and transcription regulators, the PPAR receptors must [[heterodimerize]] with another receptor known as the 9-cis [[retinoic acid receptor]] (RXR). The RXR receptor itself is the second major target of obesogens next to the PPAR receptors.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The PPARα receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of a lipid, promotes [[peroxisome]] proliferation leading to increased fatty acid β-oxidation.&lt;ref name="Ferré_2004"/&gt; Substances, such a [[xenobiotics]] that target and act as agonists of PPARα, typically act to reduce overall serum concentrations of lipids. In contrast, the PPARγ receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of fatty acids or their derivatives, promotes lipid biosynthesis and storage of lipids is favored over fatty acid oxidation. In addition, activation promotes differentiation of [[preadipocytes]] and the conversion of mesenchymal [[progenitor cells]] to preadipocytes in adipose tissues. Substances that target and act as agonists of PPARγ/RXR complex typically act to increase overall serum concentrations of lipids.&lt;ref name="Rosen_1999"/&gt;

Obesogens that target the PPARγ/RXR complex mimic the metabolic ligands and activate the receptor leading to upregulation of lipid accumulation which explains their obesogenic effects. However, in the case of obesogens that target the PPARα/RXR complex, which when stimulated reduces adipose mass and body weight, there are a few explanations as to how they promote obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The ligand binding pockets of PPARs are very large and unspecified, allowing for different [[isoforms]] of the receptor (PPARα, δ, and γ) to be activated by the same agonist ligands or their metabolites. In addition, fatty acid oxidation stimulated by [[PPARα]] requires continuous stimulation while only a single activation event of [[PPARγ]] is required to permanently increase adipocyte differentiation and number.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Therefore, it may be the case that metabolites of PPARα targeting obesogens are also activating PPARγ, providing the single activation event needed to potentially lead to a pro-adipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

A second explanation points to specific PPARα targeters that have been shown to additionally cause abnormal transcriptional regulation of testicular [[steroidogenesis]] when introduced during fetal development. This abnormal regulation leads to a decreased level of [[androgen]] in the body which, itself, is obesogenic.&lt;ref name="Parks_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarfelt_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braga-Basaria_2006"/&gt;

Finally, if PPARα activation occurs during critical periods of development, the resulting decrease in lipid concentration in the developing fetus is recognized by the fetal brain as undernourishment. In this case, the developing brain makes what will become permanent changes to the body's metabolic control, leading to long-term upregulation of lipid storage and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Levin_2006"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

Sex steroids normally play a significant role in lipid balance in the body. Aided by other peptide hormones such as [[growth hormone]], they act against the lipid accumulation mediated by insulin and cortisol by mobilizing lipid stores that are present. Exposure to obesogens often leads to a deficiency or change in the ratio between androgen and estrogen sex steroid levels, which modifies this method of lipid balance resulting in lowered growth hormone secretion, hypocortisolemia (low levels of circulating cortisol), and increased resistance to insulin effects.&lt;ref name="Bjorntorp_1997"/&gt;

This alteration in sex steroid levels due to obesogens can vary enormously according to both the sex of the exposed individual as well as the timing of the exposure.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; If the chemicals are introduced at critical windows of development, the vulnerability of an individual to their effects is much higher than if exposure occurs later in adulthood. It has been shown that obesogenic effects are apparent in female mice exposed to both phytoestrogens and DES during their neonatal periods of development, as they, though born with a lower birth weight, almost always developed obesity, high leptin levels, and altered glucose response pathways.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt; Both phytoestrogen and DES exposed male mice did not develop obesity and, rather, showed decreased body weights with increased exposure confirming the role of gender differences in exposure response.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Penza_2006"/&gt; Further studies have shown positive correlations for serum BPA levels with obese females in the human population, along with other xenoestrogen compounds suggesting the parallel roles that these effects may be having on humans.&lt;ref name="Takeuchi_2004"/&gt;

=== Central balance of energy ===

While hormone receptors tend to be the most obvious candidates for targets of obesogens, central mechanisms that balance and regulate the body's nutritional changes on a day-to-day basis as a whole cannot be overlooked. The [[HPA axis]] (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) is involved in controlling appetite and energy homeostasis circuits which are mediated by a large number of monoaminoergic, peptidergic (use of hormones as neurotransmitters), and [[endocannabinoid]] signals that come from the digestive tract, adipose tissues, and from within the brain. It is these types of signals that provide a likely target for obesogens that have shown to have weight altering effects:&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Neuroendocrine effects ====

Neurological disorders may enhance the susceptibility to develop the [[metabolic syndrome]] that includes obesity.&lt;ref name="Casey_2005"/&gt; Many neuropharmaceuticals used to alter behavioral pathways in patients with neurological disorders have shown to have metabolic altering side-effects leading to obesogenic phenotypes as well. These findings give evidence to conclude that an increase in lipid accumulation can result from the targeting of neurotransmitter receptors by foreign chemicals.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; (''See also:'' [[#Central integration of energy balance|section "Central integration of energy balance"]].)

==== Peptidergic hormones ====

Several peptidergic hormone pathways controlling appetite and energy balance —such as those involving [[ghrelin]], [[neuropeptide Y]], and [[agouti-related peptide]] — are particularly sensitive to changes in nuclear receptor signaling pathways and can therefore be easily altered by the introduction of [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Such an alteration can lead to induced feelings of hunger and decreased feelings of fullness causing an increase in food intake and inability to feel satisfied, both characteristic of obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Some xenoestrogens such as [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], [[nonylphenol]], and [[DEHP]] have all shown to act is this way, altering [[NPY]] expression and significantly shifting the feeding behaviors of exposed mice.&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004b"/&gt; In addition, [[organotin]]s such as trimethyltin (TMT) triethyltin (TET), and [[tributyltin]] (TBT) compounds can exert their effects through similar pathways. TBT can locally disrupt [[aromatase]] regulation in the [[hypothalamus]] causing the responses of the HPA axis to hormones to become abnormal. TMT works in a similar but unique way, inducing [[NPY]] and NPY2 receptor expression initially which later is counteracted by neuronal degeneration in lesions causing decrease in signaling ability.&lt;ref name="Ishikura_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadamatsu_1998"/&gt;

While an increase in food intake is often the case after exposure, weight gain involves the body's maintenance of its metabolic setpoint as well. Given this information, it is particularly important to note that exposure during development and initial programming of these setpoints can be extremely significant throughout the remainder of life.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Endocannabinoid signaling ====

A wide range of environmental organotins that mimic petidergic hormones in the HPA axis as mentioned before, additionally mimic lipid activators of the [[cannabinoid]] system and inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] activity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Endocannaboid levels are high in those suffering from obesity due to hyperactivity of cannaboid signalling pathways. It is these high levels that have been found to be closely associated with increased fat stores linking the lipid activator mimics to the actual disease.&lt;ref name="Engeli_2005"/&gt;

==== Programming of metabolic set points ====

Regions in the [[hypothalamus]] control the responses that establish an individuals metabolic setpoint and metabolic efficiency. These responses are adaptive in that they vary according to the individual's needs, always working to restore the metabolic setpoint through the increase or decrease of metabolic functions depending on varying energy needs. Since it is adapted, it is expected that it would be able to achieve equilibrium if the lipid balance was altered by hormones via the mechanisms mentioned above. However, since obesogenic phenotypes persist, it can be concluded that adaptive response components of the hypothalamus may be a target of obesogens as well.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

A person's body composition is very much predetermined before birth and changes rarely occur in adulthood. Adipocyte numbers increase during development and come to a plateau over time. After the plateau adipocytes become restricted to mostly [[hypertrophic]] growth and don't seem to change much in terms of cell number. This is demonstrated by the difficulty in altering [[somatotypes]] or more simply by the difficulty that goes along with trying to lose weight past a certain point.&lt;ref name="Janesick_2011"/&gt;

A particular study on [[PBDEs]], a commonly used chemical in flame retardants, made its role in altering the functions of the [[thyroid]] hormone axis apparent.&lt;ref name="Ellis-Hutchings_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuriyama_2007"/&gt; This finding leads to increased concern as neonatal thyroid status plays a large role in the integration of maternal environmental signals during development in the womb that is used for long-term body weight programming.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Pharmaceutical obesogens ==

Obesogens detection in the body and resulting obesogenic effects can result as side effects from intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs. These pharmaceutical obesogens can show their effects through a variety of targets.

=== Metabolic sensors ===

[[Thiazolidinediones]] (TZD), [[rosiglitazone]], and [[pioglitazone]] are all used to treat [[diabetes]]. These drugs act as agonists of the PPAR-γ receptor leading to [[insulin]] sensitizing effects that can improve [[glycemic]] control and serum [[triglyceride]] levels.&lt;ref name="Goldberg_2007"/&gt; Despite the positive effects these chemicals can have in treating diabetes patients, administration also lead to unwanted PPAR-γ mediated side effects such as peripheral [[edema]] which can be followed by persistent weight gain if the drug is used over a long period of time. These side effects are particularly prominent in diabetes 2 patients, a disease that tends to result from an overabundance of adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Larsen_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubenstrunk_2007"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

[[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] is a synthetic estrogen that was once prescribed to women to decrease the risk of miscarriage until it was found to be causing abnormalities in exposed offspring. This same chemical has been shown to cause weight gain in female mice when exposed during neonatal development. While exposure didn't lead to an abnormal birth weight, significant weight gain occurred much later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;

=== Central integration of energy balance ===

[[SSRI]] (e.g. [[paroxetine]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[amitriptyline]]), [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[mirtazapine]]) and atypical [[antipsychotics]] (e.g. [[clozapine]]) are all neuropharmaceuticals that target neurotransmitter receptors that are involved with brain circuits that regulate behavior. Often the function of these receptors overlaps with metabolism regulation, such as that of the [[Histamine H1 receptor|H1 receptor]] which when activated decreases AMPK activity.&lt;ref name="Kim_2007"/&gt; As a result, the administration of these drugs can have side effects including increased lipid accumulation that can result in obesity.

=== Metabolic setpoints ===

The mechanisms behind SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics function allow them all to have potential roles in the alteration of metabolic setpoints. TZD, in particular has been linked to regulatory function in the HPT axis, however, no conclusive evidence has been determined thus far and further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Environmental obesogens ==

While obesogens can be introduced to the body intentionally via administration of obesogenic pharmaceuticals, exposure can also occur through chemical exposure to obesogens found in the environment such as organotins and xenobiotics.

=== Organotins ===

Particular members of the organotin class of [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), namely [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[Triphenyltin compounds|triphenyltin]] (TPT) are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors (RXR α,β, and γ) and PPARγ.&lt;ref name="Kanayama_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2006b"/&gt; This ability to target both receptors at the same time, is more effective than single receptor activation, as  adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex. This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental, long-term adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life.

[[Organotin chemistry|Organotins]] (tin-based chemicals), used in marine anti-fouling paints, wood catalysts, plasticizers, slimicides, in industrial water systems, and fungicides on food have recently been linked to obesogenic properties when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Nath_2008"/&gt; Human exposure to these major environmental sources most commonly occurs through ingestion of contaminated seafood, agricultural products, and drinking water as well as from exposure to leaching from plastics.&lt;ref name="Tsuda_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerin_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohno_2002"/&gt;

Although studies that have directly measured organotin levels in human tissue and blood are limited, it has been determined that vulnerability of a portion of the general population to organotin exposure at levels high enough to activate RXRs and PPARγ receptors is very probable. The high usage of organotins in both plastics and agricultural maintenance as well as the high affinity of the chemicals further confirms this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Liver samples from the late 1990s in Europe and Asia contained on average 6 and 84&amp;nbsp;ng/g wet wt respectively for total organotin levels, while later studies found levels of total organotins in US blood samples averaged around 21&amp;nbsp;ng/mL with TBT comprising around 8&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~ 27 nM).&lt;ref name="Kanaan_1999"/&gt; Even more recent analyses of European blood samples found the predominant species to be TPT rather than TBT at 0.09 and 0.67&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~0.5-2 nM). Only occasional trace amounts of TBT were found.&lt;ref name="Rantakokko_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lo_2003"/&gt; These results indicate that organtin exposure to humans, while found to be present among many different populations, can vary in terms of type of organatin and level of exposure from region to region.

=== Other xenobiotics ===

Other common [[xenobiotics]] found in the environment have been shown to have PPAR activity, posing even further threats to dysregulated metabolic balance. [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] from [[polycarbonate]] plastics, [[phthalate]] plasticizers used to soften PVC plastics, and various perfluoroalkyll compounds (PFCs) that are widely used surfactants and surface repellents in consumer products are all potentially obesogenic when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Phthalates and PFCs in particular have been found to function as agonists for one or more of the PPARs &lt;ref name="Bell_1982"/&gt; Additionally, metabolites of DHEP such as MEHP also activate PPARγ leading to a proadipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

==Public health implications==

Although research on endocrine disruptors or "obesogens" is still emerging, the public health implications so far have mainly surrounded obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Obesity has [[Epidemiology of obesity|become a global epidemic]], increasing for all population groups. From 1980 to 2008, the rates of obesity have doubled for adults and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|tripled for children]].&lt;ref name="urlObesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/facts.html | title = Obesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. alone, it has been estimated that almost 100 million individuals in are obese&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults--The Evidence Report. National Institutes of Health | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 6 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 51S–209S | date = Sep 1998 | pmid = 9813653 | doi =  | url = http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional thinking suggested that diet and exercise alone were the main contributors to obesity; however, current experimental evidence shows that obesogens might be part of the cause.

The chronic burden of obesity doesn't stop with weight gain. It can also lead to potentially debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes, and certain environmental exposures, or obesogens, have been directly linked to Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt; An estimated 25.8 million people, or 8.3% of the population in the US, have diabetes, and the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176%, from 1980 through 2010.&lt;ref name="urlCDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/factsheet11.htm | title = CDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease and economic burden of diabetes, which is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States costing approximately $174 billion annually, is being addressed by organizations such as Healthy People 2020 which has diabetes listed as one of their 42 objectives.&lt;ref name="urlwww.cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figage.htm | title = Crude and Age-Adjusted Percentage of Civilian, Noninstitutionalized Population with Diagnosed Diabetes, United States, 1980–2010 | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | work = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, diabetes is a major obstacle to overcome especially when obesogens might be the uncontrolled, unsuspected cause.

=== Potential obesogens in everyday life ===
Obesogens can be found everywhere, from water bottles to microwaveable popcorn, and from nonstick pans to shower curtains. People interact with them on a daily basis, both intentionally and unintentionally, at work, school and home. They are an unnecessary and mostly preventable potential hazard to health, which can have a large impact on how individuals gain and lose weight.

[[Bisphenol-A]] (BPA) is an industrial chemical and organic compound that has been used in the production of plastics and resins for over a half-century. It is used in products such as toys, medical devices, plastic food and beverage containers, shower curtains, dental sealants and compounds, and register receipts.&lt;ref name="pmid20517192"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeratsky K | title = What are the health concerns about BPA? | journal = Mayo Clinic Women's Healthsource | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 8 | date = Jul 2010 | pmid = 20517192 | doi =  | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bpa/AN01955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  BPA has been shown to seep into food sources from containers or into the body just by handling products made from it. Certain researchers suggest that BPA actually decreases the fat cell count in the body, but at the same time increasing the size of the ones remaining; therefore, no difference in weight is shown, and an individual is even likely to gain more.&lt;ref name="pmid22249005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vom Saal FS, Nagel SC, Coe BL, Angle BM, Taylor JA | title = The estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) and obesity | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 354 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 74–84 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22249005 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.001 | pmc=3306519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is found in many food products on grocery store shelves: by 2004, for example, it accounted for 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages sold in the United States, and was the only caloric sweetener used in soft drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bray | first = GA |author2=Nielsen SJ |author3=Popkin BM | title = Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–543 |  url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/4/537 | pmid = 15051594 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a food and drink sweetener and is an obesogen. Acting on insulin and leptin in the body, HFCS potentially increases appetite and fat production.&lt;ref name="pmid22034869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanhope KL | title = Role of fructose-containing sugars in the epidemics of obesity and metabolic syndrome | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 329–43 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22034869 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-042010-113026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicotine]] is the chemical found in tobacco products and certain insecticides. As an obesogen, nicotine mostly acts on prenatal development after [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking]] occurs. A strong association has been made between maternal smoking and childhood overweight/obesity, with nicotine as the single causal agent.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;

[[Arsenic]] is a [[metalloid]] (''i.e.'', an element with some metallic properties) found in and on most naturally occurring substances on Earth. It can be found in the soil, ground water, air, and in small concentrations in food. Arsenic has many applications such as in the production of insecticides, herbicides, pesticides and electronic devices.&lt;ref name="epa_arsenic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/teach/chem_summ/Arsenic_summary.pdf | title = Inorganic Arsenic | author = | date = 2007-08-01 | format = pdf | work = TEACH Chemical Summary | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | pages = 20  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21864395"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Razo LM, García-Vargas GG, Valenzuela OL, Castellanos EH, Sánchez-Peña LC, Currier JM, Drobná Z, Loomis D, Stýblo M | title = Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased prevalence of diabetes: a cross-sectional study in the Zimapán and Lagunera regions in Mexico | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 10 | issue =  | pages = 73 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21864395 | pmc = 3169452 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-10-73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of diabetes has been linked to arsenic exposure from drinking water and occupational contact.

[[Pesticides]] are substances used to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate pests, and they have been used throughout all of recorded history. Some pesticides persist for short periods of time and some for long periods of time which are considered [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs). Several cross-sectional studies have shown pesticides as obesogens, linking them to obesity, diabetes and other morbidities.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22372998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lind L, Lind PM | title = Can persistent organic pollutants and plastic-associated chemicals cause cardiovascular disease? | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 271 | issue = 6 | pages = 537–53 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22372998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02536.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical drugs are also potentially obesogens. From 2005-2008, 11% of Americans aged 12 and over took antidepressant medications.&lt;ref name="pmid22617183"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pratt LA, Brody DJ, Gu Q | title = Antidepressant use in persons aged 12 and over: United States, 2005-2008 | journal = NCHS Data Brief | volume =  | issue = 76 | pages = 1–8 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22617183 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain antidepressants, known as [[SSRI|selectively serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), are potentially adding to the almost 100 million obese individuals in the U.S.&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"/&gt; A key function of SSRI antidepressants is to regulate serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) which can affect food intake and lipid accumulation leading to obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid22412882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen X, Margolis KJ, Gershon MD, Schwartz GJ, Sze JY | title = Reduced serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) function causes insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis independent of food intake | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e32511 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22412882 | pmc = 3297606 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organotins]] such as [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[triphenyltin]] (TPT) are [[endocrine disruptors]] that have been shown to increase triglyceride storage in [[adipocytes]]. Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s, other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish, fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments, industrial water systems and textiles. Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies.&lt;ref name="pmid16690801" /&gt;
	
[[Perfluorooctanoic acid|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)]] is a surfactant used for reduction of friction, and it is also used in nonstick cookware. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population.&lt;ref name="pmid22003309"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shankar A, Xiao J, Ducatman A | title = Perfluoroalkyl chemicals and elevated serum uric acid in US adults | journal = Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 3 | issue =  | pages = 251–8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22003309 | pmc = 3191115 | doi = 10.2147/CLEP.S21677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a potential endocrine disruptor.&lt;ref name="pmid21397692"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SS, Fenton SE, Hines EP | title = Endocrine disrupting properties of perfluorooctanoic acid | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 16–26 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 21397692 | pmc = 3335904 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="pmid19433254"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hines EP, White SS, Stanko JP, Gibbs-Flournoy EA, Lau C, Fenton SE | title = Phenotypic dichotomy following developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in female CD-1 mice: Low doses induce elevated serum leptin and insulin, and overweight in mid-life | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 304 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 97–105 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19433254 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2009.02.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future research==

Most of the environmental obesogens currently identified are either classified into the category of chemical mimics of metabolic hormones throughout the body or of neurotransmitters within the brain. Because they fall into these two categories, extensive opportunities for complex interactions and varied sites of action as well as multiple molecular targets are open for consideration. Changing dose ranges tend to result in varying phenotypes and timing of exposure, gender, and gender predisposition introduce even more levels of complexity in how these substances effect the human body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Because the mechanisms behind the different effects of obesogens are so complex and not well understood, the extent to which they play in the current obesity epidemic may be greater than once thought. [[Epigenetic]] changes due to obesogen exposure must also be considered as a possibility, as they open up the potential for misregulated metabolic functions to be passed on from generation to generation. Epigenetic processes via [[hypermethylation]] of regulatory regions could lead to overexpression of different proteins, and therefore, amplification of acquired environmental effects. Research will be required in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action these chemicals are involved in before the extent of the risk of exposure can be determined and methods of prevention and removal from the environment can be established.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Onshi-no tabako'''|恩賜のたばこ|Onshi-no tabako}} or {{Nihongo|'''Onshitabako'''|恩賜煙草|Onshitabako}} were the packets of cigarettes given out by the Japanese emperor. There were other kinds of special tobacco for relatives of the emperor and members of the Imperial Household. The production of the former came to an end in 1945. The production of Onshino Tabako finally ceased at the end of 2006, the last producer being the [[Japan Tobacco]] Company.

==History==
The exact origin of Onshino Tabako with the crest of the Imperial House of Japan, with the 16 petals of the [[chrysanthemum]], is unknown; what is known that Onshino Tabako had been in existence since the [[Meiji era]]. The Empress to the [[Emperor Meiji]] presented wounded soldiers at the 1877 [[Satsuma Rebellion]] with Onshino Tabako as gifts, according to formal records. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)]], the cigarettes were produced by Iwaya Shokai Company.&lt;ref&gt;JACAR　Ref. C060833600, Ministry of Self Defense, Institute of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACAR Ref. 06060996200, Ministry of Self Defense, Institute of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal Onshino Tabako system was started in 1933. During the war years it was included in the supplies of the army and navy, each order prepared by hand. The special cigarettes were even mentioned in a war song called "Sorano Yūshi" (''Brave Men of the Skies'') in 1939 which portrayed the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]]. On the packaging of Onshino Tabako was printed a character: 賜, meaning "gift from a noble man,"{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee|1982|p=181, 184}} and the chrysanthemum crest was on every cigarette. The taste of Onshino Tabako was reportedly the same as other cigarettes. According to some men who had tasted it, it was bitter, as opposed to sweet.{{sfn|Matsuzaki|2010}} It was not sold on the market, and was exclusively given to decorated persons, attendants at Imperial parties, visitors to and volunteers of [[Imperial House of Japan]], and security men of the Imperial Household. 

On June 25, 1959, it was presented to every member of the [[Tokyo Giants]] and [[Osaka Tigers]], professional baseball teams which played before [[Hirohito]]. Because of recent health finds that confirm that tobacco smoking is dangerous to one's health, Onshino Tabako was discontinued at the end of 2006.{{sfn|Tobacco Research Center|2009|p=724-25}} In its place, Onshino [[Kompeitō]], a candy, is often presented. According to the records of the [[Japanese Diet|National Diet]], it{{Clarify|date=November 2013}} was the same as Asahi Cigarettes (30 yen per 20 cigarettes; in 2010, it was 20 yen.). There had been another kind of tobacco for the guests of the Imperial Household Agency and Imperial relatives, and it had the crest of chrysanthemum with 14 petals, as opposed to formal 16.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee|p=174, 186-189}}

== Terminology of Imperial Household-related tobacco ==
*The {{Nihongo|'''Goryō Tabako'''|御料たばこ|Goryō Tabako}} Goryō tobacco: tobacco for the Emperor, the Empress and the Empress Dowager. Its production started in 1873 by Sotoike Shozaburo (the name of the store was Yanagiya). The contract went to the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in 1904, which started the production of tobacco for Emperor Meiji the same year and for the Empress in the fiscal 1906 year. At first, the leaves of tobacco were those stored in traditional houses since the Kanbun era (1661 - 1672) and other eras to Kansei era (1789 - 1800); since 1908, excellent tobacco producers and places had been selected, and the leaves were dried and stored at least for several years. The leaves were [[Kokubu]] (the name of place), Izumi, [[Tarumizu]], [[Ibusuki]], Maru, Mizufu, [[Taino]] and Kirigasa leaves. The last was used to soften the taste. All were excellent leaves in color, dryness and preparation. 

:Goryō tobacco had been produced with extreme supervision and with alcohol disinfection. The workers had been severely checked for health and behaviour. Goryō tobacco for Emperor Meiji were turned into cigarettes, one sun (1.195&amp;nbsp;in), 0.7 sun and 0.6 sun in lengths, with the chrysanthemum mark only in the one sun cigarettes. Twenty cigarettes were included in a pack; one paulownia box contained 100 cigarettes. Goryo tobacco for Emperor Taisho contained not only one sun-length cigarettes but also cigars (Turkey, Havana, and Turkey-Havana cigars: a box contained 25 cigars). Goryo cigars were produced for the Empress Meiji. In 1908, they were 2 sun and 4 bu (2.86&amp;nbsp;in) and 7 sun 5 rin (0.895&amp;nbsp;in) diameter. The Empress Meiji was a smoker but never smoked in front of Emperor Meiji.{{sfn|Japan Monopoly Corporation|1964|p=622-25}}
 
*The {{Nihongo|'''Tokusei Tabako'''|特製たばこ|Tokusei  Tabako}} Specially manufactured tobacco: There were two kinds of special tobacco; one for the Board of the Crown Prince and the empress and houses of princes (relatives of the emperor) and the other for gifts of the Imperial Household Agency. The houses of princes included the Houses of [[Prince Arisugawa|Princes Arisugawa]], Kitashirakawa, Kayo, [[Prince Kuni|Kuni]] and others, and cigarettes were produced respectively for them. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the emperor came to an end in 1945 on the order of the General Headquarters of the allied forces. 

:The quality of this tobacco was excellent, being of the level of Fuji (name of cigarettes), in fiscal 1918, the production of it with the quality of Asahi and in the fiscal 1920, the production of the level of Shikishima. Since 1914, the chrysanthemum mark had been printed in the center of cigarettes in order to prevent the mark from being stepped on. In the war years, the production of gift tobacco increased, reaching a peak of 28,656,000 cigarettes in the fiscal 1944 year. Asian with conventional leaves were used, and cigars were also produced which contained Havana leaves. Most of the cigarettes were the special cigarettes, 100 cigarettes to a box, while the cigarettes for the Household Agency came in packs of 100, 50, 20, ten and five cigarettes. Twenty-five cigars were included in a small box.{{sfn|Japan Monopoly Corporation|p=622-25}}

==The package==
When they were first produced, the characters "Onshi / 恩賜" were printed in gold on the package, and  it was formally called ''Special Product No. 1.'' When the war situation grew darker, gold characters were replace with black one, and then trimmed to one character, 賜. This package remained thus during the postwar years.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee|p=181-89}}
[[File:Onshi-007.JPG|thumb|Imperial tobacco box of the latter period]]

In 1982, packages were made for ten, 20, 50 and 100 cigarettes. The tobacco for the Imperial Household Agency was called ''Special Tobacco No. 2'' and contained the chrysanthemum crest on a white background. Since 1968, the 14 petal chrysanthemum package, ''Special Tobacco No. 3'' was produced for the relatives of the emperor.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee}}

==History of Onshino Tabako==
Between 1883 and 1904, Yanagiya at [[Nipponbashi]] produced shredded tobacco and since 1894, cigarettes.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee|1982|p=178-189}} In 1894, the Iwaya Shokai was given permission to produce the Onshino Tabako which were given out to soldiers 
participating in the Sino-Japanese War.&lt;ref&gt;Eiji Oshita ''Eruneosu'' Eruneosu Shuppansha, 2001, p. 6, 62-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, its production went to the Tobacco Monopoly Agency. The production line of Iwaya Shokai went to the Tokyo First Tobacco Production Place, and in the same year, Imperial tobacco began to be produced not only exclusively for noblemen, such as Emperor Taisho and his relatives, but also for its original purposes. Imperial tobacco was made from special leaves of tobacco, while the Special tobacco for noblemen and gifts was made from the finest Fuji leaf or 不二; these were also produced with the utmost care manually. Emperor Taisho was a smoker and smoked his exclusively produced cigarettes, while Hirohito did not; the production of Imperial tobacco, however, continued. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the Emperor Hirohito was discontinued by the order of the General Headquarters of Japan of the allied forces in 1945. However, Onshino Tobako as gifts continued to be produced.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History}}

==Factories and production==

All Onshino Tabako were produced in several factories in the [[Tokyo Prefecture]]. Before 1945, no other persons were permitted to enter the production room, while workers were fastidiously checked for health. In 1973, six or seven veteran workers produced it, making all the tobacco and packaging it by hand.{{sfn|JT Research Center|2009|p=724-725}}

During the Pacific War, the yearly production amounted to 1 to 2 million cigarettes, and between 1945 and 1965, less than 100,000 cigarettes. Since 1968, cigarettes with filter tips began to be produced, about 300,000 cigarettes yearly.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee}}

==Onshino Cigars==
Not only cigarettes, but also cigars were produced which had a decorated ring chrysanthemum crest, with 25 to each small wooden box.{{sfn|Tobacco Research Center|2009|p=724-725}} The leaves were produced in [[Sumatra]] and [[Havana]]. The production of cigars started in 1939, while the exclusive cigars for Emperor Taisho started earlier in 1917. In 1945, 4,000 cigars were produced. This was peak production. Between 1945 and 1982, an average of 2,500 cigars were produced.{{sfn|JT Tokyo Factory History editing committee|p=178, 181, 184-85, 187-89}}

==In culture==

*It is said that the novelist [[Yukio Mishima]] smoked Onshino Tabako before committing [[harakiri]] in 1970.
*[[Yoshio Yoshida]], a [[Hanshin Tigers]] baseball player treasured his Onshino Tabako for more than 50 years.

'''Pica''' is a psychological disorder characterized by an [[appetite]] for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as ice ([[pagophagia]]); hair ([[trichophagia]]); paper (xylophagia);&lt;ref name="ncbi1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=An unusual case of xylophagia (paper-eating)|author=Mahesh Gowda, Bhavin M.

According to [[DSM-IV]] (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) criteria, for these actions to be considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age where eating such objects is considered [[Intellectual development|developmentally]] inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. It can lead to intoxication in children, which can result in an impairment of both physical and mental development.&lt;ref name=Blinder2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blinder|first=Barton, J.|author2=Salama, C.|title=An update on Pica: prevalence, contributing causes, and treatment|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=May 2008|volume=25|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and [[parasitosis]].&lt;ref name=Blinder2008 /&gt; Pica has been linked to other mental and emotional disorders. Stressors such as emotional trauma, maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, and a disorganized family structure are strongly linked to pica as a form of comfort.&lt;ref name=Singhi1981&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singhi|first=Sunit|author2=Singhi P.|author3=Adwani G.|title=Role of Psychosocial Stress in the Cause of Pica|journal=Clinical Pediatrics|date=December 1981|volume=20|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pica is most commonly seen in [[pregnancy|pregnant women]],&lt;ref name=Span04/&gt; small children, and those with [[developmental disabilities]] such as [[autism]].&lt;ref name=Rose00&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rose, E.

There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before [[tetraethyllead]] in petrol was phased out (in some countries) or before people stopped using contaminated oil (containing toxic [[PCBs]] or [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, there is also a much greater risk of [[bowel obstruction|gastro-intestinal obstruction]] or tearing in the [[stomach]]. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying [[parasitism|parasites]]. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs&lt;ref name=HSUS&gt;{{cite web|title=Pica: Why Pets Sometimes Eat Strange Objects|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/pica_eating_strange_objects.html|website=www.humanesociety.org|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=2 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cats{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

This pattern of eating should last at least one month to fit the diagnosis of pica.&lt;ref name="Pica"&gt;[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pica/overview.html Pica] New York Times Health Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications===
Complications may occur due to the substance consumed. For example, [[lead poisoning]] may result from the ingestion of paint or paint-soaked [[plaster]], [[hairball]]s may cause intestinal obstruction and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'' or ''[[Toxocara]]'' infections may follow ingestion of feces or dirt.&lt;ref name="Spitzer, Robert L 1986"&gt;Spitzer, Robert L.

==Causes==
According to the DSM 5, mineral deficiencies are occasionally associated with pica; however, biological abnormalities are rarely found in individuals with pica.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|series=DSM Library|location=|pages=|chapter=Feeding and Eating Disorders|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm10}}&lt;/ref&gt; People practicing forms of pica, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Geophagia|geophagy]],&amp;nbsp;[[pagophagy]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Amylophagia|amylophagy]], are more likely anemic, have low&amp;nbsp;[[hemoglobin]]&amp;nbsp;concentration in their blood, lower levels of red blood cells ([[hematocrit]]), or have lower plasma zinc levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miao|first=Diana|last2=Young|first2=Sera L.|last3=Golden|first3=Christopher D.|date=January 2015|title=A meta-analysis of pica and micronutrient status|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=84–93|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22598|issn=1520-6300|pmc=4270917|pmid=25156147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, practicing geophagy is more likely to be associated with anemia or low hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Practicing pagophagy and amylophagy were more highly associated with anemia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, being a child or pregnant woman practicing pica was associated with higher chance of being anemic or having low hemoglobin relative to the general population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recently, cases of pica have been tied to the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], and there is a move to consider OCD in the cause of pica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hergüner, S., Ozyildirim, I., &amp; Tanidir, C. | year = 2008 | title = Is Pica an eating disorder or an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder? | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 2010–1 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.09.011 | pmid = 18848964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, pica is currently recognized as a mental disorder by the widely used ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV). Sensory, physiological, cultural and psychosocial perspectives have also been used by some to explain the causation of pica.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It has been proposed that mental-health conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, can sometimes cause pica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gull WW | year = 1874 | title = Anorexia nervosa (apepsia hysterica, anorexia hysterica) | url = | journal = Trans. Clin. Soc. Lond. | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, pica can also be a cultural practice not associated with a deficiency or disorder. Ingestion of [[kaolin]] (white clay) among [[African-American]] women in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] shows the [[Geophagy#In humans|practice]] there to be a DSM-IV "[[culture-bound syndrome]]" and "not selectively associated with other psychopathology".&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Diagnosis==
There is no single test that confirms pica. However, because pica can occur in people who have lower than normal nutrient levels and poor nutrition (malnutrition), the health care provider should test blood levels of iron and zinc.
Hemoglobin can also be checked to test for [[anemia]]. Lead levels should always be checked in children who may have eaten paint or objects covered in lead-paint dust. The health care provider should test for infection if the person has been eating contaminated soil or animal waste.&lt;ref name="Pica"/&gt;

===DSM 5  ===
The [[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition]], posits four criteria that must be met for a person to be diagnosed with pica:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

#Person must have been eating non-nutritive non-foods for at least one month.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#This eating must be considered abnormal for the person's stage of development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Eating these substances cannot be associated with a cultural practice that is considered normal in the social context of the individual.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#For people who currently have a medical condition (e.g.: pregnancy) or a mental disorder (e.g.: autism spectrum disorder) the action of eating non-nutritive non-foods should only be considered pica if it is dangerous and requires extra medical investigation or treatment on top of what they are already receiving for their pre-existing condition.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
In individuals with [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], and certain physical disorders (such as [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]]), nonnutritive substances may be eaten. In such instances, pica should not be noted as an additional diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Spitzer, Robert L 1986"/&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment for pica may vary by patient and suspected cause (e.g., child, developmentally disabled, pregnant or psychogenic) and may emphasize [[psychosocial]], environmental and family-guidance approaches, (iron deficiency) may be treatable though iron supplement through dietary changes. An initial approach often involves screening for and, if necessary, treating any mineral deficiencies or other [[Comorbidity|comorbid conditions]].&lt;ref name=Rose00/&gt; For pica that appears to be of psychogenic cause, therapy and medication such as [[SSRIs]] have been used successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bhatia, M. S., &amp; Gupta, R. | date = 2007-05-11 | title = Pica responding to SSRI: An OCD spectrum disorder? | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry }} Online publication ahead of print. {{PMID|17853279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, previous reports have cautioned against the use of medication until all non-psychogenic causes have been ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fotoulaki, M., Panagopoulou, P., Efstratiou, I., &amp; Nousia-Arvanitakis, S. | year = 2007 | title = Pitfalls in the approach to pica | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 166 | issue = 6 | pages = 623–4 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-006-0282-1 | pmid = 17008997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back at the different causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica as a result of social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.&lt;ref name=Blinder2008 /&gt;

Behavior-based treatment options can be useful for developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals with pica. Behavioral treatments for pica have been shown to reduce pica severity by 80% in people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagopian|first=Louis P.|last2=Rooker|first2=Griffin W.|last3=Rolider|first3=Natalie U.|title=Identifying empirically supported treatments for pica in individuals with intellectual disabilities|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|volume=32|issue=6|pages=2114–2120|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.07.042|pmid=21862281|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may involve using [[positive reinforcement]] normal behavior. Many use aversion therapy, where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often treatment is similar to the treatment of obsessive compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases treatment is as simple as addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it. A recent study classified nine such classes of behavioral intervention:  Success with treatment is generally high and generally fades with age, but it varies depending on the cause of the disorder. Developmental causes tend to have a lower success rate.&lt;ref name=McAdam2004&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAdam|first=David B.|last2=Sherman|first2=James A.|last3=Sheldon|first3=Jan B.|last4=Napolitano|first4=Deborah A.|date=January 2004|title=Behavioral interventions to reduce the pica of persons with developmental disabilities|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45–72|doi=10.1177/0145445503259219|issn=0145-4455|pmid=14710707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment techniques include:&lt;ref name=Blinder2008 /&gt;

{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* Presentation of attention, food or toys, not contingent on pica being attempted
* Differential reinforcement, with positive reinforcement if pica is not attempted and consequences if pica is attempted
* Discrimination training between edible and inedible items, with negative consequences if pica is attempted
* Visual screening, with eyes covered for a short time after pica is attempted
* Aversive presentation, contingent on pica being attempted:
# oral taste (e.g., lemon)
#smell sensation (e.g., [[ammonia]])
#physical sensation (e.g., water mist in face)
* Physical restraint:
#Self-protection devices that prohibit placement of objects in the mouth
#Brief restraint contingent on pica being attempted
#Time-out contingent on pica being attempted
#Overcorrection, with attempted pica resulting in required washing of self, disposal of nonedible objects and chore-based punishment
#Negative practice (non-edible object held against patient's mouth without allowing ingestion)
}}

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of pica is difficult to establish because of differences in definition and the reluctance of patients to admit to abnormal cravings and ingestion,&lt;ref name=Blinder2008 /&gt; thus leading to the [[prevalence]] recordings of pica among at-risk groups being in the range of 8% and 65% depending on the study.&lt;ref name=Span04/&gt; Based on compiled self-report and interview data of pregnant and postpartum women, Pica is most prevalent geographically in Africa, with an estimated prevalence of 44.8%, followed by North and South America (23.0%) and Eurasia (17.5%).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fawcett|first=Emily J.|last2=Fawcett|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Mazmanian|first3=Dwight|date=June 2016|title=A meta-analysis of the worldwide prevalence of pica during pregnancy and the postpartum period|journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|volume=133|issue=3|pages=277–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.10.012|issn=1879-3479|pmid=26892693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Factors associated with Pica in this population were determined to be anemia and low levels of education, both of which are associated with low socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Two studies of adults with [[intellectual disability]] living in [[Psychiatric hospital|institutions]] found that 21.8%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ashworth, M., Hirdes, J.P., &amp; Martin, L. | year = 2009 | title = The social and recreational characteristics of adults with intellectual disability and pica living in institutions | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 512–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2008.07.010 | pmid = 18789647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 25.8%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Danford, D.E., &amp; Huber, A.M. | year = 1982 | title = Pica among mentally retarded adults | journal = American Journal of Mental Deficiency | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–6 | pmid = 7124824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of these groups suffered from pica.&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pica and Rumination Disorder in DSM-5|vauthors=Hartmann AS, Becker AE, Hamptom C, Bryant-Waugh R | journal=Psychiatric Annals |date=  November 2012 |volume= 42 |issue= 11 |pages= 426–30 |doi= 10.3928/00485713-20121105-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The condition currently known as Pica was first described by&amp;nbsp;[[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michalska|first=Aneta|last2=Szejko|first2=Natalia|last3=Jakubczyk|first3=Andrzej|last4=Wojnar|first4=Marcin|date=2016|title=Nonspecific eating disorders - a subjective review|journal=Psychiatria Polska|volume=50|issue=3|pages=497–507|doi=10.12740/PP/59217|issn=2391-5854|pmid=27556109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prior to the elimination of the category of “feeding disorders in infancy and early childhood”, which is where pica was classified, from the DSM 5, pica was primarily diagnosed in children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;However, since the removal of the category, psychiatrists have started to diagnose pica in people of all ages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term pica originates in the [[Latin]] word for ''[[magpie]]'' (Picave),&lt;ref&gt;PEDIATRICS Vol. 44 No. 4 October 1, 1969

In the southern United States in the 1800s, [[geophagia]] was a common practice among the slave population.&lt;ref name=Rose00 /&gt; Geophagia is a form of pica in which the person consumes earthly substances such as [[clay]], and is particularly prevalent to augment a mineral-deficient diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=geophagy|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/geophagy?show=0&amp;t=1320448115|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is the fact that Kaolin was consumed by west Africans enslaved in the South-eastern United States, particularly the Georgia belt, due to the anti-diarrheal qualities in the treatment of dysentery and other abdominal ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life Traces of the Georgia Coast:&amp;nbsp;Revealing the Unseen Lives of Plants and Animals|last=Martin|first=Anthony|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-253-00602-8|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The practice of consuming Kaolin rocks was thereafter studied scientifically, the results of which led to the subsequent pharmaceutical commercialization of Kaolinite, the clay mineral contained in Kaolin. Kaolinite became the active ingredient in drugs like Kaopectate and Pepto-Bismol, although the formulations have since found additional active ingredients to replace Kaolinite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/498381_3|title=Medscape Log In|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on [[eating disorder]]s from the 16th century to the 20th century suggests that during that time in history, pica was regarded more as a symptom of other disorders rather than its own specific disorder. Even today, what could be classified as pica behavior is a normative practice in some cultures as part of their beliefs, healing methods, or religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Rose00 /&gt;

==Other animals==
Unlike in humans, pica in dogs or cats may be a sign of [[Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]], especially when it involves eating substances such as tile [[grout]], [[concrete]] dust, and [[sand]]. Dogs exhibiting this form of pica should be tested for anemia with a [[Complete blood count|CBC]] or at least [[hematocrit]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Plunkett | first = Signe J. | year = 2000 | title = Emergency Procedures for the Small Animal Veterinarian | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | pages = 11 | isbn = 978-0-7020-2487-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Feldman | first = Bernard F. |author2=Joseph G.

'''SlimFast''' is a U.S.company headquartered in  [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida]] that markets an eponymous brand of shakes, bars, snacks, packaged meals, and other [[dietary supplement]] foods sold in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latin America, and the U.K. SlimFast promotes [[dieting|diets]] and [[weight loss]] plans featuring its food products.

== Effectiveness ==
There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of the diet, although it appears to function no better than behavioral counseling.&lt;ref name=effic&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gudzune KA, Doshi RS, Mehta AK, Chaudhry ZW, Jacobs DK, Vakil RM et al.| title=Efficacy of commercial weight-loss programs: an updated systematic review. | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2015 | volume= 162 | issue= 7 | pages= 501-12 | pmid=25844997 | doi=10.7326/M14-2238 | pmc=4446719 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=25844997  }}  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=26280443 Review in: Ann Intern Med. 2015 Aug 18;163(4):JC8] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SlimFast was started in 1977 as a product line of the Thompson Medical Company, founded in the 1940s by [[S. Daniel Abraham]]. Thompson Medical also sold the controversial weight loss dietary supplement [[Dexatrim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unilever.ca/ourbrands/foods/SlimFast.asp |title= Our Brands: Foods: SlimFast |website= [[Unilever]] Canada |accessdate= 2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fundingu-sf"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/SlimFast-Foods-Company-Company-History.html |title= History: SlimFast Foods Company |website= Funding Universe |accessdate= 2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Abraham took the brand private, and it was acquired by [[Unilever]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |issn= 0099-9660 |last1= Branch |first1= Shelly |last2= Beck |first2= Ernest |title= Unilever Buys Ben &amp; Jerry's, SlimFast for Over $2.5 Billion |work= Wall Street Journal |accessdate= 2015-04-19 |date= 2000-04-13 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955522850788928066}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Unilever sold SlimFast to Kainos Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |issn= 0099-9660 |last= Stynes |first= Tess |title= Unilever Sells Slim-Fast Brand to Kainos Capital |work= Wall Street Journal |accessdate= 2015-04-19 |date= 2014-07-10 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/unilever-sheds-slim-fast-brand-1405013326}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, KSF Acquisition invested with Kainos Capital in order to take responsibility for the SlimFast brand in the UK, Ireland and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial agreement signed with KSF Acquisition|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/rns/160113opti6516l|website=Proactiveinvestors|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Kainos Capital acquired SlimFast from Unilever and appointed new CEO Chris Tisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/business/west-palm-beach-based-ceo-tisi-plans-slim-fast-makeover/ffBbaZFsrxTVuX3JXmktXO/|title=West Palm Beach-based CEO Tisi plans Slim-Fast makeover|work=mypalmbeachpost|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
SlimFast's product lines span three distinctive eras: those of the original product line (shakes only), the [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carb]] product line introduced in response to the low-carb diet craze initiated by the [[Atkins diet|Atkins]] and [[South Beach Diet]]s, and the simplified "3-2-1" product line introduced in late 2009.

===Original (1987–2004)===
SlimFast was originally just a diet shake product line. It consisted of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shakes meant to replace breakfast and lunch. The company suggested customers eat a low-calorie dinner. Usually, dieters would pick a low-calorie frozen dinner brand such as [[Lean Cuisine]] or [[Weight Watchers]], as the SlimFast diet was a convenience product line that offered none of its own dinner products. Later, in the mid-1990s, SlimFast began offering meal bars that could be used as [[meal replacement]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Low-carb era (2004–2009)===
SlimFast struggled, as did many diet foods in 2002, with the rise of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s, and from 2002-2003 experienced a 21% drop in sales. The brand responded in 2004 with a line of items designed to compete in the low-carb market as well as introduced SlimFast Optima products, which were lower in sugar than the standard SlimFast products.

Between 2004 and 2009, five types of SlimFast products were available: Original, Optima, Low carb, High protein, and Easy-to-Digest.&lt;ref name="slim-fast"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slim-fast.com/products/products.asp?bhcp=1 |title= Our Plan |website= Slim-Fast.com |accessdate= 2007-05-28 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081635/http://www.slim-fast.com/products/products.asp?bhcp=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optima, the flagship brand, eventually replaced "original recipe" shakes. In addition to having less sugar than the original, SlimFast Optima shakes contain a protein and vegetable fat blend that is claimed to help with hunger control.&lt;ref name="sf-dietician"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slim-fast.com/atd/view_answer.asp?qid=34&amp;cid=9&amp;pn=0&amp;rec=10 |title= Slim·Fast - Product Questions: Ask the Dietitian |website= Slim-Fast |accessdate= 2007-05-28 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050305101003/http://www.slim-fast.com/atd/view_answer.asp?qid=34&amp;cid=9&amp;pn=0&amp;rec=10 |archivedate= 2005-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optima was available in the same forms as the original products:  meal bars, powders, shakes, and snack bars.

===Current (2009–present)===
In late 2009, SlimFast simplified its product line with the "3-2-1" diet plan. The plan emphasized three 100-[[calorie]] snacks, two 200-calorie meal replacements (shakes or meal bars), and one dinner. SlimFast's product line now only consists of 3-2-1 products and no longer includes the Optima, Original, Low-Carb, or Easy-to-Digest versions.

There are two categories of SlimFast products, and two sub-categories each:

*Shakes – Both can only be used as meal replacements (the "2" in the 3-2-1 plan means a dieter is allowed two a day; i.e., two shakes, two bars, or one bar and one shake, for a maximum of two "2" items a day).
**Ready-to-drink Shakes come in plastic bottles. It is essentially the shake mix mixed with [[skim milk]].
**Shake mix powder can be mixed with milk, water, or anything the dieter chooses to mix it with, but fat-free milk is recommended on the container. 
*Bars – Meal Replacements (item "2") and Snack Bars (item "3")
**Meal Replacements are 200 calories and are meant to be used in place of shakes (the "2" in the 3-2-1 plan described above). 
**Snack Bars are 100-calories and meant to be the "3" in the 3-2-1 plan, as a dieter can have 3 a day. Snack bars are not supplemented with vitamins and minerals.

A dieter could eat two snack bars as their meal replacement, since two snack bars have the same number of calories as one meal bar, although the meal bars are also meant to be rich in vitamins and minerals, whereas the snack bars are only measured by calorie count and not supplemented by vitamins.

SlimFast does not offer products in category "1", which is one "sensible" meal, which the US site suggests should be 500 calories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slimfast.com/how-it-works |title=HOW IT WORKS|website=SlimFast|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the UK site suggests 600 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slimfast.co.uk/plan/about-the-plan/default.aspx|title=About the Plan|website=SlimFast|location=UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817040151/http://www.slimfast.co.uk/plan/about-the-plan/default.aspx|archivedate=2011-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 recall==
On December 3, 2009, SlimFast [[product recall|recalled]] all of its canned products due to possible bacterial [[contamination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 3, 2009|website=SlimFast|title=Recall|url=http://www.slim-fast.com/recall.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company stated that it had halted production until the cause was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Slim Fast canned drinks recalled by Unilever |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/food/2009/12/05/2009-12-05_slim_fast_canned_drinks_recalled_by_unilever.html |work=NY Daily News |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No further problems or issues have been noted. In 2011, SlimFast stopped producing cans and has since used plastic bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/slim-fast-loses-cans-bottled-makeover|title=Slim-Fast loses cans in bottled makeover|website=Drugstore News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surface Water Simulation Modelling Programme''' (SWSMP) launched in 1986 by the Ministry of Water Resources of Bangladesh Government under the Master Planning Organization to develop a high level of analytical capabilities by use of state-of-the-art mathematical water modelling which was the genesis of what at present is known as the [[Institute of Water Modelling]] (IWM).&lt;ref name="unbx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Water Modelling|url=http://www.iwmbd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=5|website=iwmbd.org|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Surface_Water_Modelling_Centre|title=Surface Water Modelling Centre - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The 3000 Club''' is a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based charity which works with food banks in [[Arizona]] in order to reduce food waste. The 3000 Club's main program is known as Market on the Move,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tucson.com/business/local/the-club-opens-tucson-warehouse-with-thrift-shop/article_0c5e6caa-6348-57c6-80b5-61390c4f7cf5.html|title=The 3000 Club opens Tucson warehouse with thrift shop|last=Tucson|first=Angela Pittenger {{!}} This Is|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the organization provides other services for Arizona communities. Their mission statement is "Providing life saving fresh fruits and vegetables to impoverished families."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streamschurch.org/market-on-the-move.html|title=Market on the Move|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goals are aimed at improving the community, such as preventing 30,000,000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables from being wasted each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

Founder of the organization, Lon Taylor, found a need for funding the continuation of the [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] [[food bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/news/losing-bid-may-have-been-a-blessing/article_23ce52e3-ba6c-5cc6-b711-ae1ff851f88e.html|title=Losing bid may have been a blessing|last=Holley|first=Denise|work=Nogales International|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethel Luzario, an original member of the entrepreneurial community, joined the organization and expanded it to promote satellite food-banks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org/wordpress/|title=The 3000 Club {{!}}|website=the3000club.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, medical reclamation was added to the composition of the non-profit. This was initiated by a movement created by Lon and Ethel after their visit to the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A working partnership now exists between the Southwest Medical Aid in Tucson, Arizona and the 3000 Club.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This resulted in the redistribution of 2 million dollars in supplies in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2010, partnering with local churches and other non-profits, Market on the Move was created. As of October 2014, the 3000 Club is unaffiliated with the Nogales food bank.

== Market On the Move (MOM) ==
[[File:Market Picture.jpg|thumb|299x299px|Produce for sale]]
Market on the Move is the flagship enterprise of the 3000 Club. It consists of satellite sites throughout Arizona, including Tucson, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Wittenberg, Casa Grande, and Surprise. The venue will vary but usually exists in parking lots of churches, banks, schools, parks, and other well-trafficked areas. The premise of MOM is to distribute unused produce to those in need and to stop the produce from being dumped in a [[landfill]], specifically the Rio Rico landfill.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} This includes up to 60 lbs of food for a donation of $10, on a suggestion "pay what you can" basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/centsible-mom/market-on-the-move-returns-to-tucson/article_91c2aa5a-449d-58f0-b2f7-145ea52d8665.html|title=Market on the Move returns to Tucson}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOM encourages the participants to share this produce with friends, neighbors, family members and local organizations. This produce sharing also goes towards environmental concerns in that produce waste is one of the main causes of methane gas being released into the atmosphere. These pick-up sites are open Saturdays from 8am-11am and Wednesdays from 11am-1pm during the majority of the year. Signage guides visitors to the specific temporary set-up location. The rotating sites create a farmers market style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://the3000club.org/wordpress/marketonthemove/|title=The 3000 Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market provides primarily vegetables, although citrus (seasonally) and melons are occasionally available.

== MOMers Thrift Store ==

This permanent thrift store continues the mission of the 3000 Club in its commitment to reclaiming goods and providing easy access to those in need.  Items available and accepted as donations are: clothing, footwear, household appliances, electronics and computers, decorations, and garden tools, both electric and manual. The store is open 6 days a week, Monday-Friday: 8am-4pm, and Saturday: 6am-9am. They are located at Tucson Warehouse, 350 S. Toole Avenue, Tucson, Arizona, 85701&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org/wordpress/momers-thrift-store/|title=The 3000 Club: MOMers Thrift Store|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disaster Relief ==

The 3000 club accepts donations of any items such as clothing, household cleaning and utility items, dry and canned foods, and toiletries. These items go towards the aid of victims of any disasters, natural or otherwise, and to better prepare and collaborate with relief efforts.

The Salvation Army and Team Up for Tucson also offer donation opportunities locally.&lt;ref&gt;http://the3000club.org/wordpress/disaster-relief/&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Medical Aid Program ==

The American Medical Aid Program (The 3000 Club Medical Reclamation Project) has been working since 2008 to redistribute medical supplies and equipment to people in need. Supplies are distributed to people in local, national, and global communities. In addition, the program travels to other countries with a team of volunteers in order to provide medical service and supplies to populations in critical need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tmcaznews.com/2014/05/23/medical-aid-program-puts-tmcs-old-equipment-to-new-uses/|title=Medical Aid Program puts TMC's old equipment to new uses|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blanket Program ==

One of the 3000 Club's program is the "Blank Program". They focus on providing blankets to both [[Homeless veterans in the United States|homeless veterans]] and [[homeless shelter]]s. The 3000 club partners with numerous organizations to distribute donated blankets to the over 45,000 homeless veterans currently in America. The program includes an option of donating $3 to supply a blanket to those in need. In donating a blanket the organization stresses the importance of it being more than just a material good that provides warmth and comfort, but one that creates a livable sleeping arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org/wordpress/blanket-program/|title=The 3000 Club's Blanket Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer Refurbishing Program ==
The 3000 Club also refurbishes donated computers, appliances, and other goods in order to reduce waste and provide affordable electronics for the Tucson Community. Students from 5th through 12th grade may qualify for reduced prices on the program's goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org/wordpress/computer-refurbishing/|title=Computer Refurbishing {{!}} The 3000 Club|website=the3000club.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13820">'''The Gothenburg Study of Children with DAMP''' was a study of six-year-old children in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] that began in 1977. The purpose was to find out what proportion of the children had '''[[Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception]] (DAMP)''', formerly known as '''[[Minimal Brain Disorder]] (MBD)''', and to follow the development of that group over the years. The results and discussions have been published in four dissertations and approximately 30 scientific papers.

==The study==
The first phase of the study was designed mainly by [[Christopher Gillberg]] and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers in all areas of Gothenburg were asked to answer a questionnaire with a series of yes and no questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (The questionnaire was based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.

The researchers received questionnaires for more than 3400 children. which constituted around 72% of the total population. 340 children (10%) were identified, based on the questionnaires, as having problems that could indicate MBD. Out of this group of 340, all the children that seemed to have the most severe problems and a random sample of the others were selected for a detailed examination.

In the Gothenburg study, a questionnaire for preschool teachers was used from which children with some potential psychiatric problems were classified into either a high-index or a low-index group. In the final investigation, there were 22 children (14 boys and 8 girls) in the high-index group and 60 children (52 boys and 8 girls) in the low-index group.&lt;ref name=Rydelius2000&gt;Rydelius, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These were compared with a randomly selected control group. The control group ultimately consisted of 59 children (29 boys and 30 girls).&lt;ref name=Rydelius2000/&gt; Of the total of 141 children, 42 (33 boys and 9 girls) were diagnosed as having MBD/DAMP; of the 42, 40 were in the index group (18 in the high-index group) and 2 in the control group.&lt;ref name=Rydelius2000/&gt; All the children were initially age 6–7 (born 1971) and were from [[Gothenburg]], Sweden.&lt;ref name=Rydelius2000/&gt; The children were later investigated at ages 10, 13, 16, and 22.&lt;ref&gt;Gillberg, 2003, p.906&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations and destruction==
Leif Elinder, a Swedish [[pediatrician]] and Eva Kärfve, a sociologist at the [[Lund University|University of Lund]], had for a number of years written numerous articles and a book where they rejected most of [[neuropsychiatry]], and specifically most research carried out by the Gillberg group. In Kärfve's book (Kärfve, 2000) she suggested that the purpose of the DAMP diagnosis was "to achieve no other permanent change than segregation".&lt;ref name=Gornall&gt;Gornall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Eva Kärfve and Leif Elinder wrote letters to [[Gothenburg University]] where they accused Gillberg and Rasmussen of [[scientific misconduct]]. The specific accusation was that they had added participants to the control group for the final follow-up study at age 22. The accusations were investigated by the Ethics Council at the University of Gothenburg and dismissed as baseless. (The only supposed "evidence" of wrongdoing provided by Elinder and Kärfve was that the drop-out rate in the follow-up study was low.){{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In February 2002 Eva Kärfve demanded access (as a private person) to all the records from the Gothenburg study.&lt;ref name=Gornall/&gt;

In April 2002 Leif Elinder wrote Gothenburg University, demanding the University make an investigation whether "good ethical standard of research" had been followed.&lt;ref name= Gornall/&gt;

In July 2002 Leif Elinder demanded access to records from the Gothenburg study.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the decision by the Swedish Justitieombudsman 2003-06-10, number 3591-2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Kärfve and Elinder were not satisfied with this dismissal and continued to demand access to the medical records. In their letters, they did not refer to allegations of scientific misconduct but to the necessity to investigate the basis for medical practice in Sweden.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Eva Kärve and Leif Elinder were denied access by Gothenburg University.&lt;ref&gt;The application by Leif Elinder was denied in a decision by Gothenburg University 2002-08-30 (decision number H5 1493-02); The application by Eva Kärfve was denied in a decision by Gothenburg University 2002-09-10 (decision number H5 901/02)&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this denial of access was that the material contained highly sensitive data, that the participants had been promised full confidentiality, that Elinder and Kärfve would use the material as private citizens, and that the participants were strongly against giving them access.

Elinder and Kärfve then took the matter to court, where it was decided that they would be allowed full access to the research material.&lt;ref name=BMJ2005&gt;White, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Kammarrätten (an administrative court in Sweden) decided 2003-02-06 that Elinder and Kärfve would be allowed access under the conditions in Swedish secrecy laws. Kammarrätten decided that the University would decide the conditions which would protect the interests of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Decision by Kammarrätten i Göteborg 2003-02-06 about Eva Kärfve's application (Decision nr 5741-2002) [http://www.kammarratten.goteborg.se/docs/domar_2003/5741-02.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; Decision by Kammarrätten i Göteborg 2003-02-06 about Leif Elinder's application (Decision nr 6208-2002) {{cite web|url=http://www.kammarratten.goteborg.se/docs/domar_2003/6208-02%20dom.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105131010/http://www.kammarratten.goteborg.se/docs/domar_2003/6208-02%20dom.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Gothenburg decided 2003-04-07 the conditions which Eva Kärfve had to follow to gain access to the material. After an appeal of Eva Kärfve, Kammarrätten decided 2003-08-11 the exact conditions which Eva Kärfve needed to follow to gain access to the material.&lt;ref&gt;Decision by Kammarrätten i Göteborg 2003-08-11 about Eva Kärve's application (Decision nr 3396-03) {{cite web|url=http://www.kammarratten.goteborg.se/docs/domar_2003/3396-03%20dom.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105125311/http://www.kammarratten.goteborg.se/docs/domar_2003/3396-03%20dom.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers and the University tried to use all legal possibilities to avoid giving out the medical records which constituted 22 shelf meters (about 100,000 pages, video and sound recordings).&lt;ref name=DMW&gt;Wärngård, 17 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004 when it appeared that the University would be forced to hand the material over, three of Gillberg's coworkers decided to destroy most of the research material. In June 2005 Gillberg and the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of Gothenburg University were convicted for not handing the material over to Kärfve and Elinder. Gillberg received a suspended sentence and a fine; the Rector received a fine.&lt;ref name=BMJ2005/&gt; In March 2006 the three coworkers were convicted for destroying the data. Each of the three received a suspended sentence and a fine: Peder Rasmussen, Carina Gillberg (wife of Christopher Gillberg), and Kerstin Lamberg.&lt;ref name=DMW/&gt;

Lamberg is vice-chairman of the Autism (Patients) Society (''Riksföreningen Autism'').&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Autism Society and the Attention (Patients) Society (''Riksförbundet Attention'') have remained strong supporters of Gillberg.&lt;ref&gt;''Riksföreningen Autism'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Riksförbundet Attention'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other criticisms==
In 2005, Per-Anders Rydelius, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the [[Karolinska Institute]], and Rolf Zetterstrom, past chief editor of ''[[Acta Paediatrica]]'', have been critical of some research based on the Gothenburg study. In the Swedish trade journal ''Dagens Medicin''&lt;ref&gt;Rydelius &amp; Zetterström, 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; they argued that the Gillberg group, in order to prove their hypothesis, repeatedly changed diagnoses and information in their material: "Accessible articles (from the Gillberg group) reveal that those studied have been managed in an unscientific way - a conclusion which does not need strengthening by what could have been found in the destroyed research material". (Another problem is the boy:girl ratios in the study;&lt;ref name=Rydelius2000/&gt; the ratio in the control group is 1:1, whereas the ratio in the index groups is 4:1.)

==Reactions==
The major Swedish newspapers have had tens of stories on the controversy: [[Dagens Nyheter]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Christopher+Gillberg%22+%28K%C3%A4rfve+OR+Elinder%29+site%3Awww.dn.se&amp;btnG=Search Dagens Nyheter stories]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Svenska Dagbladet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Christopher+Gillberg%22+%28K%C3%A4rfve+OR+Elinder%29+site%3Awww.svd.se&amp;btnG=Search Svenska Dagbladet stories]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Göteborgs-Posten]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Christopher+Gillberg%22+%28K%C3%A4rfve+OR+Elinder%29+site%3Awww.gp.se&amp;btnG=Search Göteborgs-Posten stories]&lt;/ref&gt; etc. There was also a one-hour program about [[Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception|DAMP]] on Swedish TV that discussed the controversy over Gillberg's Gothenburg study at length.&lt;ref name=Bagge&gt;Bagge, Peter (5 July 2005), "Forskarstrid: DAMP ifrågasätts från fler än ett håll", Sveriges Television. (Summary of televised show, in Swedish.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, the newspaper [[Dagsavisen]] ran a series of critical stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=site%3Adagsavisen.no+%22Christopher+Gillberg%22&amp;btnG=Search Dagsavisen stories]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The OrganWise Guys''' (OWG) was created in 1993 in [[Duluth, GA]] to teach young children about the importance of making healthy choices in their lives through learning about their [[internal organ]]s. The goal of OWG programming is to educate children and adults about nutrition and healthy living, and to prevent [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller School Researchers Publish Findings on Obesity Prevention Internvetion|url=http://med.miami.edu/news/researchers-publish-findings-on-obesity-prevention-intervention/|accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- no it isn't. The goal would be to make children healthy. The path to that goal is what you say. See Thoreux, since you're American, it is not the destination but the path. See Frost, for that matter, the road less travelled by. And that makes all the difference. SimonTrew, 3 June 201 about lunchtime. --&gt;

==Concept==

Rather than learning about organs through textbooks, OWG uses fictional animated characters and puppets to teach children about their bodies in an age appropriate manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Getsinger|first=Annie|title=OrganWise Guys deliver inside information on the body and making healthy choices|url=http://herald-review.com/lifestyles/organwise-guys-deliver-inside-information-on-the-body-and-making/article_eeee8725-e58d-5586-87dd-f59ae9301936.html|accessdate=2010-12-21|newspaper=Herald Review|date=11/3/2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OWG's messages rely on the theme of empowerment, encouraging children to understand the importance of their health at a young age. The main "rules" of the OWG Club are to: eat a low fat and high fiber diet, drink lots of water, and get plenty of exercise. Characters like the Kidney Brothers discuss the importance of drinking water to keep the blood clean, and Peter Pancreas explains how he controls sugar levels in the body by making insulin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wise Guys' Wise Advice: Eat and Live Healthy|url=http://organwiseguys.com/documents/aboutus_articles/OWG%20USA%20Today%20Sept2010.pdf|accessdate=December 2010|newspaper=USA Today - The Magazine of the American Scene|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OWG school-based nutrition and healthy living education curricula is matched to the Common Core State Standards Initiative for grades pre K-5.

==Research==
The Healthier Options for Public Schoolchildren (2004-2009), a [[quasi-experimental]] study in elementary schools, was designed to test the efficacy of 1) changes to meals served to children at school, 2) nutrition and healthy lifestyle curricula linked to the core subject requirements, monthly food-based social marketing and education, and daily physical activity (including OWG), and 3) other school-based wellness activities such as school gardens. HOPS resulted in statistically significant improvements in program children's weight, [[blood pressure]], and waist circumference measures, as well as significantly higher average standardized test scores, as compared to outcomes of children in non-program schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollar|first=Danielle|author2=Sarah Messiah |author3=Gabriela Lopez-Mitnik |author4=T.

==Areas of Work==

OWG materials are used in early childcare centers, elementary schools, communities, summer camps, faith-based institutions, supermarkets, and clinics throughout the United States. From 2009-2012, a $2 million grant funded by The W.K Kellogg Foundation to the Mississippi Food Network provided funds to a [[land-grant university]] [[cooperative extension service]] to carry out OWG programming in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, and New Mexico. The concept of schools as "hubs" of obesity prevention was further developed through the work made possible by this grant, and this is the approach that OWG takes in its childhood obesity prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Childhood Obesity Prevention with The OrganWise Guys|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLb38X52bUE|accessdate=4/5/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollar|first=Danielle|title=Global View on Childhood Obesity: Current Status, Consequences and Prevention|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0123749956|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEN0_ZJkT7sC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;lpg=PA364&amp;dq=organwise+guys+HOPE2&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=organwise%20guys%20HOPE2&amp;f=false|edition=1|author2=Messiah SE |author3=Lopez-Mitnik G |author4=Almon M |author5=Hollar TL |author6=Lombardo M |editor=Debasis Bagchi|chapter=Combining Nutrition Education, Foodservice (Feeding Programs), and Physical Activity Obesity Prevention Interventions for Children: Significant Improvements in the Health and Academic Achievement of Young Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Nursing, Mandalay''' (also the '''Institute of Nursing, Mandalay'''; {{lang-my|သူနာပြု တက္ကသိုလ် (မန္တလေး)}}, {{IPA-my|θùnàpjṵ tɛʔkəθò (máɴdəlé)|pron}}) is a [[university]] of [[nursing]], located in [[Mandalay]], [[Myanmar]]. It is one of three universities in the nation that offers a four-year bachelor's degree program in nursing.&lt;ref name=nlm&gt;{{cite news | title=Prime Minister addresses opening of Myanmar Nurses Association Conference | url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/Feb04/enlm/Feb25_h5.html | date=2004-02-25 | accessdate=2008-12-06 | publisher=The New Light of Myanmar | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430161743/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2004/Feb04/enlm/Feb25_h5.html | archivedate=2005-04-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university also offers a master's degree program in nursing.&lt;ref name=moh&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | title=Health Statistics | publisher=Ministry of Health, Myanmar | accessdate=2008-12-06 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108035911/http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | archivedate=2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university, which admits only 100 students per year, is one of the more selective universities in the nation. Nursing is one of few professions in Myanmar that provides decent job opportunities—inside or outside the country. The [[University Entrance Examination]] matriculation marks required for admission in 2006 was 380 out 600, slightly below{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} what was required to go to medical school.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nursing programs attracting more students |url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-334/n015.htm |date=2006-09-18 |author=Khin Yadana |publisher=The Myanmar Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117023213/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-334/n015.htm |archivedate=November 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speciality diploma programs in dental, EENT, mental health, pediatrics, critical care, and orthopedics are offered only at the [[Yangon Institute of Nursing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12233">The '''unseen species problem''' is commonly referred to in ecology and deals with the estimation of the number of species represented in an ecosystem that were not observed by samples. It more specifically relates to how many new species would be discovered if more samples were taken in an ecosystem. The study of the unseen species problem was started in the early 1940s by Alexander Corbet. He spent 2 years in Malaya trapping butterflies, and was curious how many new species he would discover if he spent another 2 years trapping. Many different estimation methods have been developed to determine how many new species would be discovered given more samples. The unseen species problem also applies more broadly, as the estimators can be used to estimate any new elements of a set not previously found in samples. An example of this is determining how many words [[William Shakespeare]] knew based on all of his written works. The unseen species problem can be broken down mathematically as follows:

If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent samples are taken, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X^n \triangleq X_1, \ldots , X_n&lt;/math&gt;, and then if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; more independent samples were taken, the number of unseen species that will be discovered by the additional samples is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;U\triangleq U\left(X^n,X_{n+1}^{m+n}\right)\triangleq \left| \{ X_{n+1}^{m+n} \} \smallsetminus \{X^n\} \right|
&lt;/math&gt;with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X_{n+1}^{m+n} \triangleq X_{n+1},\ldots,X_{n+m}&lt;/math&gt; being the second set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; samples.

In the early 1940s [[Alexander Steven Corbet]] spent 2 years in Malaya trapping butterflies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orlitsky|first=Alon|last2=Suresh|first2=Ananda Theertha|last3=Wu|first3=Yihong|date=2016-11-22|title=Optimal prediction of the number of unseen species|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1607774113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=113|issue=47|pages=13283–13288|doi=10.1073/pnas.1607774113}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept track of how many species he observed, and how many members of each species were captured. For example, he captured only 2 members of 74 different species. When he returned to the United Kingdom, he approached statistician [[Ronald Fisher]], and asked how many new species of butterflies he could expect to catch if he went trapping for another two years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Orlitsky|first=Alon|last2=Suresh|first2=Ananda Theertha|last3=Wu|first3=Yihong|date=2015-11-23|title=Estimating the number of unseen species: A bird in the hand is worth log ''n'' in the bush|eprint=1511.07428|class=math.ST}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, Corbet was asking how many species he observed zero times.Fisher responded with a simple estimation: for an additional 2 years of trapping, Corbet could expect to capture 75 new species. He did this using a simple summation (data provided by Orlitsky&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Table 1 below in the Example section):&lt;math display="block"&gt; U=\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i \varphi_i = 118 - 74 + 44 - 24 + \cdots - 12 + 6 = 75 &lt;/math&gt;Here, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the number of individual species which were observed &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; times. Fisher's sum was later confirmed by Good–Toulmin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Estimators ==
To estimate the number of unseen species, let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;t\triangleq m/n&lt;/math&gt; be number of future samples (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the number of past samples (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), or &lt;math&gt;m = t n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; be the number of individual species observed &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; times (for example, if there were 74 species of butterflies with 2 observed members throughout the  samples, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2 = 74&lt;/math&gt;).

=== The Good–Toulmin estimator ===
The Good–Toulmin estimator was developed by I. J. Good and G. H. Toulmin in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GOOD|first=I. J.|last2=TOULMIN|first2=G. H.|date=1956|title=THE NUMBER OF NEW SPECIES, AND THE INCREASE IN POPULATION COVERAGE, WHEN A SAMPLE IS INCREASED|url=https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article/43/1-2/45/334874|journal=Biometrika|language=en|volume=43|issue=1–2|pages=45–63|doi=10.1093/biomet/43.1-2.45|issn=0006-3444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate of the unseen species based on the Good–Toulmin estimator is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt; U^{GT} \triangleq U^{GT}\left(X^n,t\right) \triangleq -\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(-t)^i\varphi_i &lt;/math&gt;The Good–Toulmin Estimator has been shown to be a good estimate for values of &lt;math display="inline"&gt; t\leq 1 &lt;/math&gt; (1). The Good–Toulmin estimator also approximates that&lt;math display="block"&gt; \operatorname{E}\left(U^{GT}-U\right)^2 \lesssim nt^2 &lt;/math&gt; This means that &lt;math display="inline"&gt; U^{GT} &lt;/math&gt; estimates &lt;math display="inline"&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; to within &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \sqrt{n}\cdot t &lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math display="inline"&gt; t\leq 1
 &lt;/math&gt;.&amp;nbsp; However, for &lt;math&gt; t&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, the Good–Toulmin estimator fails to capture accurate results. This is because, if &lt;math&gt; t&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; U^{GT} &lt;/math&gt; increases by &lt;math&gt; (-t)^i \varphi_i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, meaning that if &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; U^{GT} &lt;/math&gt; grows super-linearly in &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; can grow at most linearly with &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, when &lt;math&gt; t&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; U^{GT} &lt;/math&gt; grows faster than &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; and does not approximate the true value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To compensate for this, Efron and Thisted&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efron|first=Bradley|last2=Thisted|first2=Ronald|date=1976|title=Estimating the Number of Unsen Species: How Many Words Did Shakespeare Know?|jstor=2335721|journal=Biometrika|volume=63|issue=3|pages=435–447|doi=10.2307/2335721}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a truncated [[Euler transform]] can also be a usable estimate:&lt;math display="block"&gt;U^{ET}\triangleq \sum_{i=1}^n h_h^{ET}\cdot \varphi_i&lt;/math&gt;with&lt;math display="block"&gt;h_i^{ET}\triangleq -(-t)^i\cdot \Pr\left(\text{Bin}\left(k,\frac{1}{1+t}\right)\geq i\right)&lt;/math&gt;and&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Pr\left(\text{Bin}\left(k,\frac{1}{1+t}\right)\geq i\right) = 
\begin{cases} 
      \sum_{j=i}^k {k \choose j} \frac{t^{k-j}}{(1+t)^k} &amp; i\leq k, \\
      0 &amp; i &gt; k   \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the location chosen to truncate the Euler transform.

=== The smoothed Good–Toulmin estimator ===
Similar to the approach by Efron and Thisted, Alon Orlitsky developed the '''smooth Good–Toulmin''' estimator. Orlitsky realized that the Good–Toulmin estimator failed for  because of the exponential growth, and not its bias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, Orlitsky estimated the number of unseen species by truncating the series.&lt;math display="block"&gt;U^\ell \triangleq -\sum_{i=1}^\ell(-t)^i\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt;Orlitsky also noted that for distributions with &lt;math&gt;t&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the driving term in the summation estimate is the &lt;math&gt;\ell^{\text{th}}&lt;/math&gt; term, regardless of which value of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is chosen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To solve this, Orlitsky elected a random nonnegative integer &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, truncated the series at &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and then took the average over a distribution about &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The resulting estimator is&lt;math display="block"&gt;U^L=\operatorname{E}_L\left[-\sum_{i=1}^L (-t)^i \varphi_i\right]&lt;/math&gt;This method was chosen because the bias of &lt;math&gt;U^\ell&lt;/math&gt; shifts signs due to the &lt;math&gt;(-t)^i&lt;/math&gt; coefficient. Averaging over a distribution of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; therefore reduces the bias. This means that the estimator can be written as the linear combination of the prevalence:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;U^L=\operatorname{E}_L\left[ \sum_{i\geq 1} (-t)^i \varphi_i \mathbf{1}_{i\leq L} \right]
= -\sum_{i \geq 1} (-t)^i \P(L\geq i) \varphi_i&lt;/math&gt;Depending on the distribution of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; chosen, the results will vary. With this method, estimates can be made for &lt;math&gt;t\propto \ln n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Species discovery curve ===
The [[species discovery curve]] can also be used. This curve relates the number of species found in an area as a function of the time. These curves can also be created by using estimators (such as the Good–Toulmin estimator) and plotting the number of unseen species at each value for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bebber |first1=D. P |last2=Marriott |first2=F. H.C |last3=Gaston |first3=K. J |last4=Harris |first4=S. A |last5=Scotland |first5=R. W |title=Predicting unknown species numbers using discovery curves |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6373629 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=7 July 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1618 |pages=1651–1658 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0464|pmc=2169286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species discovery curve is always increasing, as there is never a sample that could decrease the number of discovered species. Furthermore, the species discovery curve is also decelerating; the more samples taken, the fewer unseen species are expected to be discovered. The species discovery curve will also never asymptote, as it is assumed that although the discovery rate might become infinitely slow, it will never actually stop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Two common models for a species discovery curve are the [[logarithm]]ic and the [[exponential function]].

=== Example – Corbet's butterflies ===
As an example, consider the data Corbet provided Fisher in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using the Good–Toulmin model, the number of unseen species is found using&lt;math display="block"&gt;U=\sum_{i=1}^N(-t)^i\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt;This can then be used to create a relationship between &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.
{| class="wikitable"

This relationship is shown in the plot below.
[[File:Unseen_Species_Example.png|thumb|Number of unseen species as a function of t, the ratio of new samples to previous samples.|center|500x500px]]From the plot, it is seen that at &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;, which was the value of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; that Corbet brought to Fisher, the resulting estimate of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is 75, matching what Fisher found. This plot also acts as a species discovery curve for this ecosystem, and defines how many new species will be discovered as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; increases (and more samples are taken).

== Other uses ==
There are numerous uses for the predictive algorithm. Knowing that the estimators are accurate, it allows scientists to extrapolate accurately the results of polling people by a factor of 2. They can predict the number of unique answers based on the number of people that have answered similarly. The method can also be used to determine the extent of someone's knowledge. A prime example is determining how many unique words Shakespeare knew based on the written works we have today.

=== Example – How many words did Shakespeare know? ===
Based on research done by Thisted and Efron, of Shakespeare's known works, there are 884,647 total words.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The research also found that there are at total of &lt;math&gt;N = 864&lt;/math&gt; different words that appear more than 100 times. Therefore, the total number of unique words was found to be 31,534.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Applying the Good–Toulmin model, if an equal number of works by Shakespeare were discovered, then it is estimated that &lt;math&gt;U^\text{words}\approx 11,460&lt;/math&gt; unique words would be found. The goal would be to derive &lt;math&gt;U^\text{words}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t=\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Thisted and Efron estimate that &lt;math&gt;U^\text{words}(t\rightarrow\infty)\approx 35,000&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that Shakespeare most likely knew almost twice as many words as he actually used in all of his writings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Våvatnet''' is a [[lake]] on the border of the municipalities of [[Snillfjord]] and [[Orkdal]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/S%C3%B8r-Tr%C3%B8ndelag/Snillfjord/V%C3%A5vatnet/|title=Våvatnet|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lake was [[dam]]med in 1910 and is used as the main [[reservoir]] for the municipality of [[Orkdal]].  The water flows into the lake [[Songsjøen]] and then into the lake [[Gagnåsvatnet]].

The lake is about {{convert|11|km}} south of the village of [[Krokstadøra]] and {{convert|15|km}} southeast of the village of [[Ytre Snillfjord]], both in [[Snillfjord]] municipality, and {{convert|10|km}} west of the village of [[Gjølme]] in [[Orkdal]] municipality.

In 1830 he began lecturing in Anatomy and Physiology at [[Aberdeen University]]. In 1839 he became the first Regius Professor of Surgery at [[Marischal College]].

In 1849 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposer was [[James Miller (surgeon)|James Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, when Marischal College reunited with [[Aberdeen University]], he became Professor of Surgery to Aberdeen, working alongside Prof [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]]  (Professor of Anatomy). also from 1860 he became the head surgeon of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

In 1875 [[Edinburgh University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD). His students included [[James Greig Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=5050979|year=1897|title=James Greig Smith|journal=Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Journal (1883)|volume=15|issue=56|pages=105–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in June 1882 and died soon after, at 253 Union Street in Aberdeen, on 21 November 1882.&lt;ref&gt;aberdeen Post Office Directory 1882&lt;/ref&gt;
