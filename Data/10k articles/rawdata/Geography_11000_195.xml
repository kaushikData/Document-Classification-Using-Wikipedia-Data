'''''Above and Below''''' is an [[Installation art|installation]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. It is on display at and owned by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork was inspired by [[underground water]] systems in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Maya Lin: Above and Below |url=http://www.artbabble.org/video/ima/maya-lin-above-and-below |medium= |trans_title= |publisher=ArtBabble |location= |accessdate=6 April 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMACollect"&gt;{{cite web|author=Indianapolis Museum of Art |year=2010 |title=Above and Below |work=Collections |publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/above-and-below-maya-ying-lin |accessdate=6 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325025753/http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/above-and-below-maya-ying-lin |archivedate=25 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

At {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2}} the sculpture hangs from the ceiling of the Museum's Fortune balcony which is accessible by the [[Indianapolis_Museum_of_Art#The_collections|Asian Art]] gallery.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Christopher Lloyd | year=2007 | title=Maya Lin sculpture installed at IMA | work= | publisher=Indy.com | url=http://www.indy.com/posts/maya-lin-sculpture-installed-at-ima | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of different thicknesses of black painted wire [[aluminum]] tubing strewn together in a flowing-like manner as if to depict a river hanging above the viewers head.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Above and Below | work=Portfolio | publisher=Walla Walla Foundry | url=http://www.wallawallafoundry.com/portfolio/lin/lin_info4.html | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Above and Below'' is visible from the 3rd floor galleries and the 4th floor windows.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

In 1990 the IMA moved their [[Asian art]] galleries to the third floor which featured a balcony overlooking the [[Indianapolis_Museum_of_Art#100_Acres:_Virginia_B._Fairbanks_Art_.26_Nature_Park|100 Acres Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park]]. The IMA's Jane Weldon Myers Curator of Asian Art [[Jim Robinson (art historian)|Jim Robinson]] sought to showcase Asian art on the balcony and immediately thought of Lin. The size of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}}. x {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[balcony]] caused curator and artist alike to struggle on what could be created for the space. At first Lin thought about creating an artwork for the [[floor]] of the balcony then she decided to create her installation for the ceiling which would unify the Asian Art and [[contemporary art]] galleries.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt; The sculpture was purchased with funds from William L. and Jane H. Fortune with Maya Lin overseeing the installation.&lt;ref name="IMACollect"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt; In 2008 a new stone floor was installed on the balcony, with stones selected by Lin.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"&gt;{{cite web | author=David Hoppe | year=2007 | title=Drawing in space | work=News | publisher=Nuvo Newsweekly | url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/drawing-in-space/Content?oid=1209492 | accessdate= 7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I don't think people really understand how intricate and beautiful some of these systems are."'' – Maya Lin"&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Design===
Maya Lin is known for her major installation works which incorporate [[terrain]] and [[topography]] – inspirations that assisted in the creation of ''Above and Below''. After years of struggling with the balcony space and lack of topographical landscaping in central Indiana, Lin received a suggestion from an assistant from Indiana stating that "there isn't that much above ground, but did you realize there are these incredibly long [[underground river]] systems?" Lin decided to create an underground river system out of [[wire]], despite telling the IMA she was creating a [[landscape]] of [[rubber]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"/&gt; Lin and her team researched the [[Bluespring Caverns]], the [[Lost River (Indiana)|Lost River]], and the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]].&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt; Lin visited the Caverns and worked with [[U.S. Geological Survey]] scientists who created an [[ultrasound]] map of the tributaries for the artist.&lt;ref name="Indy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"/&gt; The sculpture seeks to "recreate the experience and feeling" of the underwater landscapes through use of various thickness of wire. Three-fifths of the artwork depict the Bluespring Cavern with the last two sections depicting what is beneath the [[water level]] in the cave.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;

===Construction===
''Above and Below'' was fabricated at [[Walla Walla Foundry]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] utilizing the [[bathymetric]] data gathered from the [[river bottom]] and cavern ceiling. Lin's studio translated the data into a collection of [[contour curves]] and then sent them to the Foundry. The aluminum tubing was carefully bent to match the computer-generated templates created by the studio then hung within the Foundry. The artwork was then disassembled and shipped to the Indianapolis Art Museum and installed in the course of a [[freezing]] cold week on the outside balcony.&lt;ref name="WallaWallaF"/&gt; Lin has created other artwork installations which she describes as "drawing in space" including ''[[Where the Land Meets the Sea]]'' (2008) in the collection of the [[California Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Nuvo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Stephen West | year=2008 | title=Maya Lin's Sculpture Floats Like Wiry Cloud, Maps San Francisco | work=News | publisher=Bloomberg | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=muse&amp;sid=avoWXBGwS7mU | accessdate= 6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Art historians at the IMA have described the piece as being easily placed within the [[minimalist]] and [[postminimalist]] tradition due to artists of those movements bringing landscape and nature into the gallery through exploration of environments on a larger scale.&lt;ref name="ArtBabble1"/&gt;

The '''Aspen Movie Map''' was a revolutionary [[hypermedia]] system developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] by a team working with [[Andrew Lippman]] in 1978 with funding from [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]].

==Features==
The Aspen Movie Map enabled the user to take a virtual tour through the city of [[Aspen, Colorado]] (that is, a form of surrogate travel). It is an early example of a [[hypermedia]] system.

A gyroscopic stabilizer with four [[16 mm film|16mm]] stop-frame film cameras was mounted on top of a car with an encoder that triggered the cameras every ten feet. The distance was measured from an optical sensor attached to the hub of a bicycle wheel dragged behind the vehicle. The cameras were mounted in order to capture front, back, and side views as the car made its way through the city. Filming took place daily between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to minimize lighting discrepancies. The car was carefully driven down the center of every street in Aspen to enable registered [[match cut]]s.

The film was assembled into a collection of discontinuous scenes (one segment per view per city block) and then transferred to [[laserdisc]], the analog-video precursor to modern digital optical disc storage technologies such as [[DVD]]s. A database was made that correlated the layout of the video on the disc with the two-dimensional street plan. Thus linked, the user was able to choose an arbitrary path through the city; the only restrictions being the necessity to stay in the center of the street; move ten feet between steps; and view the street from one of the four [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] views.

The interaction was controlled through a dynamically-generated menu overlaid on top of the video image: speed and viewing angle were modified by the selection of the appropriate icon through a touch-screen interface, harbinger of the ubiquitous interactive-video kiosk. Commands were sent from the client process handling the user input and overlay graphics to a server that accessed the database and controlled the laserdisc players. Another interface feature was the ability to touch any building in the current field of view, and, in a manner similar to the [[Image map|ISMAP]] feature of web browsers, jump to a façade of that building. Selected building contained additional data: e.g., interior shots, historical images, menus of restaurants, video interviews of city officials, etc., allowing the user to take a virtual tour through those buildings.

[[File:QADAS.jpg|thumb|The facades of buildings were texture-mapped onto 3D models. The same 3D model was used to translate 2D screen coordinates into a database of buildings in order to provide hyperlinks to additional data.]]

In a later implementation, the [[metadata]], which was in large part automatically extracted from the animation database, was encoded as a digital signal in the analog video. The data encoded in each frame contained all the necessary information to enable a full-featured surrogate-travel experience.

Another feature of the system was a navigation map that was overlaid above the horizon in the top of the frame; the map both served to indicate the user's current position in the city (as well as a trace of streets previously explored) and to allow the user to jump to a two-dimensional city map, which allowed for an alternative way of moving through the city. Additional features of the map interface included the ability to jump back and forth between correlated aerial photographic and cartoon renderings with routes and landmarks highlighted; and to zoom in and out à la [[Charles Eames]]’s ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' film.

Aspen was filmed in early fall and winter. The user was able to ''[[in situ]]'' change seasons on demand while moving down the street or looking at a façade. A three-dimensional polygonal model of the city was also generated, using the Quick and Dirty Animation System ([[QADAS]]), which featured three-dimensional [[texture mapping|texture-mapping]] of the facades of landmark buildings, using an algorithm designed by [[Paul Heckbert]]. These computer-graphic images, also stored on the laserdisc, were also correlated to the video, enabling the user to view an abstract rendering of the city in real time.

==Credits==
MIT undergraduate [[Peter Clay]], with help from [[Bob Mohl]] and [[Michael Naimark]], filmed the hallways of MIT with a camera mounted on a cart. The film was transferred to a laserdisc as part of a collection of projects being done at the [[Architecture Machine Group]] (ArcMac).

The Aspen Movie Map was filmed in the fall of 1978, in winter 1979 and briefly again (with an active gyro stabilizer) in the fall of 1979. The first version was operational in early spring of 1979.

Many people were involved in the production, most notably: [[Nicholas Negroponte]], founder and director of the Architecture Machine Group, who found support for the project from the Cybernetics Technology Office of DARPA; Andrew Lippman, principal investigator; Bob Mohl, who designed the map overlay system and ran user studies of the efficacy of the system for his PhD thesis; [[Richard Leacock]] (Ricky), who headed the MIT Film/Video section and shot along with MS student Marek Zalewski the [[Cinéma vérité]] interviews placed behind the facades of key buildings; [[John Borden]], of Peace River Films in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who designed the stabilization rig; [[Kristina Hooper Woolsey]]  of UCSC; [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]]; [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], who matched the photos of Aspen in the silver-mining days from the historical society to the same scenes in Aspen in 1978 and who experimented with [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic imaging]] of the city (using a [[Volpe lens]]); [[Walter Bender]], who designed and built the interface, the client/server model, and the animation system; Steve Gregory; [[Stan Sasaki]], who built much of the electronics; [[Steve Yelick]], who worked on the laserdisc interface and anamorphic rendering; [[Eric "Smokehouse" Brown]], who built the metadata encoder/decoder; Paul Heckbert worked on the animation system; [[Mark Shirley]] and [[Paul Trevithick]], who also worked on the animation; [[Ken Carson]]; [[Howard Eglowstein]]; and [[Michael Naimark]], who was at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies and was responsible for the cinematography design and production.

The Ramtek 9000 series image display system was used for this project. Ramtek created a 32 bit interface to the Interdata for this purpose. Ramtek supplied image display systems which supplied square displays (256x256 or 512x512) as its competition did but also screen matches such as 320x240, 640x512 and 1280x1024. The original GE CAT Scanners all used the Ramtek 320x240 display. Some prices of the day may be on interest. A keyboard, joystick or trackball would each sell for around $1,200. A 19" CRT had a OEM price of around $5,000 and this would be purchased from Igagami in Japan. The production of a single CD master (around 13") was $300,000.

==Purpose and applications==
ARPA funding during the late 1970s was subject to the military application requirements of the  Mansfield Amendment introduced by [[Mike Mansfield]] (which had severely limited funding for [[hypertext]] researchers like [[Douglas Engelbart]]).

The Aspen Movie Map's military application was to solve the problem of quickly familiarizing soldiers with new territory.  The Department of Defense had been deeply impressed by the success of [[Operation Entebbe]] in 1976, where the Israeli commandos had quickly built a crude replica of the airport and practiced in it before attacking the real thing.  DOD hoped that the Movie Map would show the way to a future where computers could instantly create a three-dimensional simulation of a hostile environment at much lower cost and in less time (see [[virtual reality]]).

While the Movie Map has been referred to as an early example of [[interactive video]], it is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a pioneering example of [[interactive computing]]. Video, audio, still images and metadata were retrieved from a database and assembled on the fly by the computer (an Interdata minicomputer running the [[MagicSix]] operating system) redirecting its actions based upon user input; video was the principal, but not sole affordance of the interaction.

The '''Baltoscandian Confederation''' or '''Baltoscandia''' is a geopolitical [[concept]] of a [[Baltic states|Baltic]]–[[Scandinavia]]n [[Political union|union]] (consisting of [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCAND 344: The Baltic States  and Scandinavia,  Spring  2002|url=http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/pakstas_magaletta.htm|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was proposed by a Swedish professor [[Sten De Geer|Sten de Geer]] (1886–1933) in the journal ''[[Geografiska Annaler]]'' in 1928 and further developed by Professor {{ill|Kazys Pakštas|lt|Kazys Pakštas|ru|Пакштас, Казис}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://misijalietuva100.lt/en/what-is-baltoscandia/|title=What is Baltoscandia? {{!}} Misija Lietuva 100|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1893–1960), a Lithuanian scientist in the field of geography and geopolitics. 

==Development of the concept==
[[File:Euler Diagram for Baltoscandia.jpg|thumb|left|Euler diagram indicating Baltoscandia among other subregions of [[Northern Europe]]]]
Pakštas states in his book ''The Baltoscandian Confederation'' that the term Baltoscandia was first used by Sten de Geer in an article in "Geografiska Annaler" in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/pakstas_magaletta.htm SCAND 344: The Baltic States and Scandinavia,  Spring  2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Baltoscandia is described in several different dimensions: as a geographical and cultural, as an economic and  as  a political and military unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xxiamzius.lt/archyvas/priedai/horizontai/20030820/2-1.html  The Concept of Baltoscandia according to Kazys Pakstas before the war and now] (in Lithuanian)&lt;/ref&gt; Kazys Pakštas proposed that one of the ways for the small nations to withstand the influence coming from the large ones is to unite and to cooperate more closely among each other. As he mentions, unification is possible only among nations that are similar by their size, geographical environment, religion, also they have to respect and to tolerate each other.

As the foreign policy of Lithuania has shifted towards [[Northern Europe]] even more after [[Dalia Grybauskaitė]] came into post of the [[List of rulers of Lithuania#Republic of Lithuania (1990–present)|President of Lithuania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10317330/?Lithuania.looks.towards.Northern.Europe=2010-02-24_08-18 Lithuania looks towards Northern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; voices questioning the return of the Baltoscandian Confederation idea are on the rise in this country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veidas.lt/lt/leidinys.full/4b6be211a1bbe Back to Baltoscandia?] (in Lithuanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
For almost 20 years, the Academy of Baltoscandia (''Baltoskandijos akademija'') functioned in [[Panevėžys]], Lithuania. It was founded on 17 November 1991 as the institute of science researches which regularly organizes arrangements dealing with Baltic and Scandinavian cultural, historical and political contacts. Its main aims were to "develop versatile links of the lands and nations in the region of Baltoscandia and to integrate the culture of Lithuania into the cultural space of Baltoscandia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politicians have closed the Academy of Baltoscandia|url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/science/politikai-uzdare-baltoskandijos-akademija.d?id=25132557|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academy was liquidated at the end of 2009 because of funding-related problems. The funding was provided by the Panevėžys city municipality, but the functions of the academy did not meet the criteria of the functions of the mentioned municipality.

===Other terms===
The '''[[Nordic-Baltic Eight]]''' or "'''NB8'''", where 8 stands for the number of States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden).

[[File:Banana Islands (Sierra Leone).jpg|thumb|The Banana Islands]]

The '''Banana Islands''' are a group of [[islands]] that lie off the [[coast]] of [[Yawri Bay]], south west of the [[Freetown]] [[Peninsula]] in the [[Western Area]] of [[Sierra Leone]].  

Three islands make up the Banana Islands:  [[Dublin, Banana Islands|Dublin]] and [[Ricketts, Sierra Leone|Ricketts]] are linked by a stone [[causeway]]. The third [[Mes-Meheux]] is uninhabited. 

Dublin Island is known for its [[beaches]], while Ricketts Island is best known for its [[forests]]. 

Banana Islands are entirely surrounded by the Freetown [[peninsula]]; and the islands are only accessible by [[boat]], ferry and helicopter. The major industries in Banana Islands are [[fishing]] and [[tourism]].

==History==
===''Diemermeer''===
In 1747 the [[Diemermeer (1736)|''Diemermeer'']], an [[East Indiaman]] belonging to the [[Dutch East India Company]] was wrecked here.&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bishop|first1=Leigh|title=The Final Circle|url=http://www.divernet.com/other_diving_topics/archaeology/2733340/the_final_circle.html|website=Divernet|publisher=Diver Group|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Clevlands===
[[William Clevland (king)|William Clevland]] and a group of fellow sailors were ship wrecked on the Island, and Clevland took the opportunity to declare himself king. This claim was cemented by his marriage to his wife Ndamba, a [[Kissi people|Kissi]] woman. During the late 1700s disputes broke into deep violence between the Clevelands of Banana Islands and [[Stephen Caulker|the Caulkers]] on [[Plaintain Islands]]. This ended in the 1800s when finally the Caulkers succeeded in taking both sets of islands.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleveland Tombstone|url=http://www.sierraleoneheritage.org/sites/monuments/cleveland/|publisher=www.sierraleoneheritage.org|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ricketts and Dublin==
Dublin and Ricketts Islands have a combined population of about 900 people. The two Islands are connected by a spit of sand that is underwater at high tide. A stone bridge connects the path between the two islands' villages of Dublin and [[Ricketts, Sierra Leone|Ricketts]], located on the coast facing the Western Peninsula.&lt;ref name=country&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Leone Beaches|url=http://www.210countries.com/tag/banana-island/|publisher=www.210countries.com|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were visited in the 17th century and perhaps earlier by Portuguese sailors. They were settled in the late 18th and 19th centuries by freed slaves, mostly from the Americas. Their descendants make up most of the population of the islands today.

==Activities==
Shipwrecks lie off the coast and in one can be found cannons amongst the ruin and coral. On the northern tip of Dublin Island the ruins of an 1881 church as well as an old slave dock can be found. It is advised that visitors should pay their respects to the tribal chief before wandering around the islands.&lt;ref name=planet&gt;{{cite web|title=Banana Islands|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/sierra-leone/sights/island/banana-islands|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourist infrastructure exists only in the northern part of the island. “Daltons Banana Guest House” or the “Banana Island Chalets” can arrange transportation to the islands from Kent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">The '''Beudeker Collection''' is a collection of maps and views of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in the [[British Library]], created by the Dutch merchant [[Christoffel Beudeker]] (1675 or 1685 - 1756).&lt;ref name=bl&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/maps/beudcoll/beudekercols.html The Beudeker Collection.] British Library, 2011. Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/?/en/collecties/atlassen/over_de_atlassen The Atlas Beudeker.] [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]], 2011. Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The collection was originally acquired by the British Museum in 1861 before the British Library was created. The collection is based on [[Joan Blaeu|Joan Blaeu's]]  maps of towns of the Netherlands, ''Tooneel der Steden van de Vereenighde Nederlanden'' and the part of Blaeu's ''Atlas Major'' covering the Netherlands. Beudeker also collected many maps, portraits, drawings, views, and satirical prints dated between 1600 and 1756. Additional material added after Beudeker's death extended the collection up to 1815. The collection is in 24 volumes and includes work from important Dutch mapmakers, such as Blaeu, [[Abraham  Ortelius]], [[Visscher]], Schenk, [[Frederik de Wit]] and [[Hondius]].&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;

==Digitisation==
Parts of the collection have been digitised. The volume, ''Country houses and gardens of the Netherlands – part one'' (Shelfmark C.9.e.7) has been made available in the [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/virtualbooks/index.html# Turning the Pages] online exhibition and Volume 21 has been made available at the [http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/?/en/collecties/atlassen Memory of the Netherlands], a joint project with [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]], the National Library of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;

'''Bing Maps Platform''' (previously '''Microsoft Virtual Earth''') is a [[geospatial mapping]] platform produced by [[Microsoft]]. It allows developers to create applications that layer location-relevant data on top of licensed map imagery. The imagery includes samples taken by satellite sensors, aerial cameras (including 45 degree oblique "bird's eye" aerial imagery licensed from [[Pictometry International]]), Streetside imagery, 3D city models and terrain. 

Bing Maps Platform also provides a point-of-interest database including a search capability. Microsoft uses the Bing Maps Platform to power its [[Bing Maps]] product. 

Key features of the Bing Maps Platform include:
*Photo-based images with features such as Streetside and 45 degree oblique "bird’s eye" views (nominally including 4 views at 90 degree viewpoint increments) that present data in context while simplifying orientation and navigation. 
*The ability to overlay standard or custom data points and layers with different themes. 
*Building-level geocoding for more than 70 million addresses in the United States. 
*Developer support options available. 
*Set of APIs available upon which developers can build applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">[[File:Furth im wald ansicht.jpg|thumb|The Cham-Further valley near [[Furth im Wald]]]]

The '''Cham-Furth Depression''' ({{lang-de|Cham-Further Senke}}, {{lang-cz|Všerubská vrchovina}}) is a [[lowland]] in the [[Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest]] that separates the [[Upper Palatinate Forest]] from the [[Bavarian Forest]]. At the same time it connects the [[Upper Palatinate]] with [[Bohemia]].

The German part has an area of 281 km², a length of 40 kilometres and a width of five to ten kilometres. The Czech part covers 206 km². The valley runs in a west-southwest-east northeast direction. 

It is divided into the [[Cham (Upper Palatinate)|Cham]] basin in the west at a height of 360 to 400 metres, which extends from [[Roding, Germany|Roding]] roughly as far as [[Arnschwang]], and the smaller [[Furth im Wald|Furth]] depression in the east, which extends to Bohemia at heights of 400 to 500 metres. The Furth valley is bounded in the east by the [[European watershed]]. Its highest point is Kameňák (''Steinwald'', 751 m) near Svatá Kateřina (''St. Katharina'').

The geologically ancient depression is filled with [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene|alluvial]] [[sedimentary rock|sediments]] and drained by the rivers [[Chamb]] and [[Regen (river)|Regen]] and their tributaries. These rivers [[meander]] through the undulating, hilly region.

In the Cham Basin, [[gneiss]]es and [[granite]]s predominate. In the Furth valley [[melanocratic]] rock of the [[gabbro]]-[[amphibolite]] mass is dominant. The climate is warmer and drier than the surrounding mountains, but winters are relatively cold and often characterized by ''[[Böhm (wind)|böhm]]'' winds from the east.

The hilltops of the typically rural landscape are covered with islands of spruce and pine. While the Cham Basin has been inhabited almost continuously since the [[Stone Age]], the Furth valley was not fully developed until the [[High Middle Ages]]. [[Farming]] dominates, followed by [[grassland]] use.

The Cham-Furth Depression has always been an important communication route between Bavaria and Bohemia. Cham Castle, built around 976, guarded the eastern border of the Empire. Today the area is part of the [[Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park]].

[[File:UniRam.jpg|thumb|Open pressure compensated dripper]]
'''Drip irrigation''' is a type of [[micro-irrigation]]  system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing [[water]] to drip slowly to the [[root]]s of plants, either from above the [[soil]] surface or buried below the surface.  The goal is to place water directly into the [[rhizosphere|root zone]] and minimize [[evaporation]].  Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of [[valve]]s, [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s, [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]], and [[#Emitter|emitter]]s. Depending on how well designed, installed, maintained, and operated it is, a drip irrigation system can be more efficient than other types of irrigation systems, such as [[surface irrigation]] or sprinkler irrigation.

== History ==
[[File:VineyardDrip.JPG|thumb|Drip irrigation in Mexico vineyard, 2000]]

Primitive drip irrigation has been used since ancient times. Fan Sheng-Chih Shu ([[:zh:氾勝之書|氾勝之書]]), written in [[China]] during the first century [[BCE]], describes the use of buried, unglazed clay pots filled with water, sometimes referred to as [[Olla#Use in irrigation|Ollas]], as a means of irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:zh:氾勝之書]] 以三斗瓦甕埋著科中央，令甕口上與地平。盛水甕中，令滿。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bainbridge|first=David A|title=Buried clay pot irrigation: a little known but very efficient traditional method of irrigation|journal=Agricultural Water Management|date=June 2001|volume=48|issue=2|pages=79–88|doi=10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00119-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377400001190|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern drip irrigation began its development in [[Germany]] in 1860 when researchers began experimenting with subsurface irrigation using clay pipe to create combination irrigation and drainage systems.&lt;ref name="Goyal"&gt;{{cite book|last=R. Goyal|first=Megh|title=Management of drip/trickle or micro irrigation|year=2012|publisher=Apple Academic Press|location=Oakville, CA|isbn=978-1926895123|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c8TFYZd9cw4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Management+of+drip/trickle+or+micro+irrigation#v=onepage&amp;q=Management%20of%20drip%2Ftrickle%20or%20micro%20irrigation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was later expanded in the 1920s to include the application of perforated pipe systems. The usage of plastic to hold and distribute water in drip irrigation was later developed in [[Australia]] by Hannis Thill.&lt;ref name="irrigation.learnabout.info"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irrigation.learnabout.info/articles/138-drip-irrigation-system.htm|title=The History of the Drip Irrigation System and What is Available Now|website=www.irrigation.learnabout.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of a plastic emitter in drip irrigation was developed in [[Israel]] by [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[Simcha Blass]] and his son Yeshayahu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenguides.com/79735-history-drip-irrigation.html|title=The History of Drip Irrigation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of releasing water through tiny holes easily blocked by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using velocity to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 by Blass who partnered later (1964) with [[Hatzerim|Kibbutz Hatzerim]] to create an irrigation company called [[Netafim]]. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface drip irrigation emitter.&lt;ref name="Goyal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="irrigation.learnabout.info" /&gt;

In the United States, the first [[drip tape]], called ''Dew Hose'', was developed by Richard Chapin of Chapin Watermatics in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Drip irrigation tape|date=02/28/1989|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4807668.html|inventor-last=Roberts|inventor-first=James C.|issue=4807668|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patents.com/us-5387307.html|title=US Patent # 5,387,307.

After its first introduction in California in the late [[1960s]], only 5% of irrigated land utilized this system by 1988. By 2010, 40% of irrigated land in California utilized this system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/205320/files/Diffusion_of_Process_Innovation_AAEA2015.pdf|title=The Diffusion of Process Innovation: The Case of Drip Irrigation in California|last=Taylor, Zilberman|first=Rebecca, David|date=26 July 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern drip irrigation has arguably become the world's most valued innovation in [[agriculture]] since the invention in the 1930s of the [[impact sprinkler]], which offered the first practical alternative to [[surface irrigation]]. Drip irrigation may also use devices called micro-spray heads, which spray water in a small area, instead of dripping emitters. These are generally used on tree and vine crops with wider root zones. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) uses permanently or temporarily buried dripperline or drip tape located at or below the plant roots. It is becoming popular for row crop irrigation, especially in areas where [[water]] supplies are limited, or recycled water is used for irrigation. Careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions are needed to determine the most suitable drip irrigation system and components to be used in a specific installation.

== Components and operation ==

Components used in drip irrigation (listed in order from water source) include:

* [[Pump]] or pressurized water source
* Water filter(s) or filtration systems: sand separator, Fertigation systems (Venturi injector) and chemigation equipment (optional)
* Backwash controller ([[Backflow prevention device]])
* Pressure Control Valve ([[pressure regulator]])
* Distribution lines (main larger diameter pipe, maybe secondary smaller, pipe fittings)
* Hand-operated, electronic, or hydraulic control valves and safety valves
* Smaller diameter polyethylene tube (often called "laterals")
* Poly fittings and accessories (to make connections)
* Emitting devices at plants (emitter or dripper, micro spray head, inline dripper or inline drip tube)

In drip irrigation systems, pump and [[valve]]s may be manually or automatically operated by a [[controller (irrigation)|controller]].

Most large drip irrigation systems employ some type of [[water filter|filter]] to prevent clogging of the small emitter flow path by small waterborne particles. New technologies are now being offered that minimize clogging. Some residential systems are installed without additional filters since potable water is already filtered at the water treatment plant. Virtually all drip irrigation equipment manufacturers recommend that filters be employed and generally will not honor warranties unless this is done. Last line filters just before the final delivery pipe are strongly recommended in addition to any other filtration system due to fine particle settlement and accidental insertion of particles in the intermediate lines.

Drip and subsurface drip irrigation is used almost exclusively when using recycled municipal wastewater. Regulations typically do not permit spraying water through the air that has not been fully treated to potable water standards.

Because of the way the water is applied in a drip system, traditional surface applications of timed-release [[fertilizer]] are sometimes ineffective, so drip systems often mix liquid fertilizer with the irrigation water. This is called [[fertigation]]; fertigation and chemigation (application of [[pesticide]]s and other chemicals to periodically clean out the system, such as [[chlorine]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) use chemical injectors such as [[diaphragm pump]]s, [[piston pump]]s, or [[aspirator (pump)|aspirator]]s. The chemicals may be added constantly whenever the system is irrigating or at intervals. Fertilizer savings of up to 95% are being reported from recent university field tests using drip fertigation and slow water delivery as compared to timed-release and irrigation by micro spray heads.

Properly designed, installed, and managed, drip irrigation may help achieve [[water conservation]] by reducing [[evaporation]] and [[Groundwater recharge|deep drainage]] when compared to other types of irrigation such as flood or overhead sprinklers since water can be more precisely applied to the plant roots. In addition, drip can eliminate many diseases that are spread through water contact with the foliage. Finally, in regions where water supplies are severely limited, there may be no actual water savings, but rather simply an increase in production while using the same amount of water as before. In very [[desert|arid regions]] or on [[psamment|sandy soils]], the preferred method is to apply the irrigation water as slowly as possible.

[[Pulse drip irrigation|Pulsed irrigation]] is sometimes used to decrease the amount of water delivered to the plant at any one time, thus reducing runoff or deep percolation. Pulsed systems are typically expensive and require extensive maintenance. Therefore, the latest efforts by emitter manufacturers are focused on developing new technologies that deliver irrigation water at ultra-low flow rates, i.e. less than 1.0 liter per hour. Slow and even delivery further improves water use efficiency without incurring the expense and complexity of pulsed delivery equipment.

An emitting pipe is a type of drip irrigation tubing with emitters pre-installed at the factory with specific distance and flow per hour as per crop distance.

An emitter restricts water flow passage through it, thus creating head loss required (to the extent of atmospheric pressure) in order to emit water in the form of droplets. This head loss is achieved by friction/turbulence within the emitter.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

[[Image:Banana Drip Irrigation At Chinawal.jpg|thumb|right|Drip irrigation and spare drip irrigation tubes in banana farm at [[Chinawal]], India]]
[[File:Button dripper.JPG|thumb|Pot irrigation by On-line drippers]]
[[File:UNIRAM PLANTA.jpg|thumb|Pressure compensated integral dripper on soilless without  growing channels]]

The advantages of drip irrigation are:                      
* Fertilizer and nutrient loss is minimized due to a localized application and reduced leaching.
* Water application efficiency is high if managed correctly.
* Field leveling is not necessary.
* Fields with irregular shapes are easily accommodated.
* Recycled non-potable water can be safely used.
* Moisture within the root zone can be maintained at field capacity.
* Soil type plays a less important role in the frequency of irrigation.
* Soil erosion is lessened.
* Weed growth is lessened.
* Water distribution is highly uniform, controlled by the output of each nozzle.
* Labour cost is less than other irrigation methods.
* Variation in supply can be regulated by regulating the valves and drippers.
* [[Fertigation]] can easily be included with minimal waste of fertilizers.
* Foliage remains dry, reducing the risk of disease.
* Usually operated at lower pressure than other types of pressurized irrigation, reducing energy costs.
The disadvantages of drip irrigation are:

* Initial cost can be more than overhead systems.
* The sun can affect the tubes used for drip irrigation, shortening their lifespan. (See [[Polymer degradation]]);
*The risks of degrading plastic affecting the soil content and food crops. With many types of plastic, when the sun degrades the plastic, causing it to become brittle, the estrogenic chemicals (that is, chemicals replicating female hormones) which would cause the plastic to retain flexibility have been released into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Most Plastic Products Release Estrogenic Chemicals: A Potential Health Problem That Can Be Solved|first1=Chun Z.|last1=Yang|first2=Stuart I.|last2=Yaniger|first3=V. Craig|last3=Jordan|first4=Daniel J.|last4=Klein|first5=George D.|last5=Bittner|date=1 July 2011|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=119|issue=7|pages=989–996|doi=10.1289/ehp.1003220|pmid=21367689|pmc=3222987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* If the water is not properly filtered and the equipment not properly maintained, it can result in clogging or [[bioclogging]].
* For subsurface drip the irrigator cannot see the water that is applied. This may lead to the farmer either applying too much water (low efficiency) or an insufficient amount of water, this is particularly common for those with less experience with drip irrigation.
* Drip irrigation might be unsatisfactory if herbicides or top dressed fertilizers need sprinkler irrigation for activation.
* Drip tape causes extra cleanup costs after harvest. Users need to plan for drip tape winding, disposal, recycling or reuse.
* Waste of water, time and harvest, if not installed properly. These systems require careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions, and suitability of drip irrigation system and its components.
* In lighter soils subsurface drip may be unable to wet the soil surface for germination. Requires careful consideration of the installation depth.
* Most drip systems are designed for high efficiency, meaning little or no leaching fraction. Without sufficient leaching, salts applied with the irrigation water may build up in the root zone, usually at the edge of the wetting pattern. On the other hand, drip irrigation avoids the high capillary potential of traditional surface-applied irrigation, which can draw salt deposits up from deposits below.
* The PVC pipes often suffer from rodent damage, requiring replacement of the entire tube and increasing expenses.
* Drip irrigation systems cannot be used for damage control by night frosts (like in the case of sprinkler irrigation systems)

==Drip tape==
Drip tape is a type of thin-walled dripperline used in drip irrigation. The first drip tape was known as "Dew Hose".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/722/49/dew-hose-72249303.html|title=DEW-HOSE Trademark - Registration Number 0847046 - Serial Number 72249303 :: Justia Trademarks|website=trademarks.justia.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drip tape [[duct tape]] is made of [[polyethylene]] and is sold flat on reels. The wall thickness typically ranges from 4 to 25 [[Thou (unit of length)|mils]] (0.1–0.6&amp;nbsp;mm). Thicker walled tapes are commonly used for permanent subsurface drip irrigation and thinner walled tapes for temporary throw-away type systems in high-value crops.

Water exits the tape through emitters or drippers. The typical emitter spacing ranges from 6 to 24&amp;nbsp;inches (150–600&amp;nbsp;mm). In some products, the emitters are manufactured simultaneously with the tape and are actually formed as part of the product itself. In others, the emitters are manufactured separately and installed at the time of production.

Some product is not a tape, but a thin-walled dripperline, but in popular parlance, both types of products are called tapes. Typical tape diameters are 5/8", 7/8", and 1-3/8", with the larger diameters more commonly used on permanent installations with longer runs.

Drip tape is a recyclable material and can be [[plastic recycling#Applications|recycled into viable plastic resins]] for reuse in the plastics manufacturing industry.

== Uses ==
[[File:Irrigation dripper.jpg|thumb|Irrigation dripper]]

Drip irrigation is used in [[farm]]s, commercial [[greenhouse]]s, and residential [[gardener]]s. Drip irrigation is adopted extensively in areas of acute [[water scarcity]] and especially for crops and trees such as [[coconut]]s, containerized landscape trees, [[grape]]s, [[banana]]s, [[ber]], [[eggplant]], [[citrus]], [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[maize]], and [[tomato]]es.

Drip irrigation for garden available in drip kits are increasingly popular for the homeowner and consist of a [[timer]], [[hose (tubing)|hose]] and emitter. Hoses that are 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter are used to irrigate flower pots.

Also known as the "''Serrania Mutún''", it has an area of about 75 square kilometers. Its estimated reserves are about 40.205 billion (40.205&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) tons of iron ore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/press863.htm |title=Will Evo stick? |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=Mines and Communities Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815012256/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/Action/press863.htm |archivedate=2007-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 50% iron, mainly in [[hematite]] and [[magnetite]] form, and in lesser quantities in [[siderite]] and [[manganese]] minerals.

==Iron ore mining==
A series of attempts have been made to commercially extract the iron ore on the site, including by the Brazilian firm EBX and the Indian company [[Jindal Steel]]. Following the Jindal's 2012 exit from the country, the Mutún Steel Company ({{lang-es|Empresa Siderúrgica del Mutún}})—the state-owned partner in the previous ventures—continues to plan for operations.

===EBX foundry===
In early 2000s, Brazilian company [[EBX Group|EBX]] devised a project to create a [[foundry]] in El Mutún. However, the project was blocked by Bolivian president [[Evo Morales]] because of [[natural environment|environmental concerns]]; instead of using [[natural gas]] available from a pipeline 20&amp;nbsp;km away, vegetable carbon was to be used for the foundry, demanding 45 [[hectare]]s a day of [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]]ian wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bolpress.com/articulo.php?Cod=2006010103 Bolivia: El bocado de "El Mutún" - Bolpress]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, EBX started working anyway before obtaining its licence, under the name of MXX. The Bolivian Ministry of Defence declared that "various irregularities and constitutional violations" had been observed. On April 19, 2006, the Bolivian army freed three government ministers who had been taken hostage by villagers demanding the immediate opening of all EBX's installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Libération de trois ministres boliviens pris en otage par des villageois | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | date=2006-04-19 | accessdate=2006-04-19 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-763116@51-763324,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, the Bolivian government had expelled EBX from the Mutun region.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/28/business/fi-iron28 Bolivia holds hill of ore]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jindal Steel===

In 2007, [[India]]'s third largest [[steel]] manufacturer, [[Jindal Steel and Power Limited]], signed a contract with the Bolivian government to exploit the El Mutún iron ore deposit. According to the contract, Jindal would invest US$ 1.5 billion initially and an additional US$ 2.5 billion over the next eight years. This is the single largest investment by an Indian firm in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22858026-5005200,00.html | work=The Australian | title=India's Bolivian ore | date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2011, Jindal had obtained clearance for the project from the EIA and had hired an engineering consultant for [[Front-end loading|FEED work]].&lt;ref name=Jin/&gt; The project is expected to create 6,000 jobs directly and another 15,000 indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gVpRQ9-JLWmbpxT08MJw-E5yxQBw AFP: Bolivia OKs Indian firm to mine vast iron deposit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

With progress on the project stalled, the Bolivian government and Jindal steel traded both accusations and demands. The government had opened criminal investigations against Jindal's executives and demanded that the full promised investment be deposited in Bolivian banks, while the company demanded these charges be dropped in exchange for a $18 million investment. Jindal announced its decision to withdraw on July 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Chipana | first = Willy |author2=Iván Condori | title = Jindal deja el país tras no aceptar cuatro condiciones del Gobierno | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2013-04-01 | date = 2012-07-17 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/economia/Jindal-pais-aceptar-condiciones-Gobierno_0_1652234783.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 Jindal finally exited the El Mutún project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornadanet.com/Hemeroteca/Opinion/n.php?a=1647&amp;f=20100316]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles Palsky''' (born 1962), is a French geographer and Professor at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] in Paris, France from 2007 to 2015. He is a member of the editorial board of ''Cybergéo'' and ''Imago Mundi,'' and known for his work on the history of [[statistical graphics]] and [[thematic map]]ping in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schweber, Libby. ''Disciplining statistics: Demography and vital statistics in France and England, 1830–1885.'' Duke University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friendly, Michael, and Daniel J. Denis.

== Biography == 
Palsky was a student at the [[École normale supérieure de lettres et sciences humaines|Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Saint-Cloud]] from 1978 to 1983. He graduated in 1981 in the field of history of geography. In 1990 he obtained his PhD from the University of Paris 1 with a thesis on the history of quantitative mapping before 1914, which was subsequently published in 1996. In 2003 he obtained his habilitation at the [[Paris 12 Val de Marne University]] with a thesis, entitled "L'esprit des cartes. Approches historiques, sémiologiques et sociologiques en cartographie" (The spirit of maps. Historical approaches, semiology and sociology in cartography).

Palsky was lecturer at the Paris 12 Val de Marne University from 1991 to 2006, and Professor at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University from 2007 to 2014. He was member of the Management Board the Faculty of Humanities and Science at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, and director of specific research "Territories, Representation, Actors" in the urbanism master program from 2005 to 2007. From 2009 to 2014, he chaired the Scientific Advisory Committee of the 23rd section at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University. Since 2010, he heads the special research "Geoprism" in master programme of geography.

Palsky is a founding member of the OUCARPO (OUvroir de CArtographie POtentielle), an initiative around mapping potential. It was created May 3, 2013 at the initiative of the philosopher William Monsaingeon.

In 1996 Palsky was awarded the George Erhard award by the French geographical society [[Société de géographie]].

== Work == 
Palsky's research focuses on [[cartography]], [[geovisualization]], [[urbanism]], [[epistemology]] and the [[history of geography]]. He specialized in the history of statistical mapping in the 19th century, and in the foundations of the  graphic semiology. He traced back the history of quantitative mapping methods, and looked into the reasons for their late adoption in geography. His current research focuses on the role of boards in the construction of geographical knowledge on the various forms of participatory mapping, and the mapping theory.

The '''Green Development Initiative''' (GDI) aims to establish a new marketplace for sustainable landscape management. As a key first step it has established a Platform for Verified Conservation Areas (VCAs) which includes an online Registry, a Standard and a Toolkit The Standard is based on the objectives and approaches of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD).

== Organisation structure ==

=== Steering Committee===
The GDI Steering Committee is international and includes representatives from the Governments of the Netherlands and Switzerland, the private sector and NGOs. Its role is to set the overall direction of the Initiative and the review its work programmes.

=== GDI Office ===
Earthmind maintains an office for the GDI at the IUCN Conservation Centre in Switzerland. Work is undertaken by a team of professional consultants and interns. Core funding comes from the Government of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]..

== Phase I: GDM 2010 Initiative ==
The GDM 2010 Initiative began in 2009 with aim of bringing forward a discussion on a new financial mechanism for biodiversity at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the (COP 10).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference took place in October 2010 in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]]. The aim of the Initiative was to explore the possibility of establishing an international  mechanism which would be voluntary, transparent and accountable so as to secure additional financial resources from the private sector for biodiversity. During Phase 1, extensive consultations were undertaken.

== Phase II: Green Development Initiative ==
Following the consultations leading up to CBD COP10 in October 2010, a new phase was launched to develop and text a promising modalities for a green development mechanism. The focus of the Green Development Initiative (GDI) was to establish a biodiversity standard and certification scheme for land management which will facilitate financial support for conservation and development action on the ground.

In many ways the GDI shares the same ethos as UNEP’s Green Economy Initiative (GEI), which is “a project designed to communicate that the greening of economies is not a burden on growth but rather a new engine for growth, employment, and the reduction of persistent global poverty.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ser2011.org/en/ser2011-scientific-program/keynote-speakers/&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the GDI is aiming to certify positive biodiversity outcomes in terms of conservation and development for geographically-defined areas.

==Phase III: VCA Platform==
The third phase is the implementation of the GDI.  Phase III established the GDI Office at the IUCN Conservation Centre and launched the online Platform for Verified Conservation Areas (VCAs).

== GDI Expert Meetings ==
Since 2009, there have been 5 GDI Expert Meetings to explore and review the development of a new approach to financing biodiversity conservation. These took place in the Netherlands (2009), Indonesia (2010), Kenya (2011), Brazil (2012), and Switzerland (2013).

The '''High Falls''' are one of three voluminous [[waterfall]]s on the [[Genesee River]], that flow through the city of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. The High Falls are located about {{convert|2|mile}} upstream from the lower falls and act as their source. The High Falls area was the site of much of Rochester's early industrial development, where industry was powered by falling water. [[Brown's Race Historic District|Brown's Race]] diverts water from above the falls and was used to feed various flour mills and industries, today the water is used to produce hydroelectric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936495|title=City of Rochester {{!}} Walking Tour of High Falls Brown's-Race Historic District|website=www.cityofrochester.gov|access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Falls may be viewed from the [[Pont De Rennes bridge]], a pedestrian bridge that spans the Genesee River a few hundred feet from the base of the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gowaterfalling.com/waterfalls/rochesterhigh.shtml|title=High Falls of the Genesee in Rochester|website=gowaterfalling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Falls was the site of the final jump of "The Yankee Leaper" [[Sam Patch#Rochester|Sam Patch]] who died after jumping off of the High Falls in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who2.com/sampatch.html|title=Sam Patch biography|work=who2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22437">The '''intermediate disturbance hypothesis''' ('''IDH''') suggests that local [[biodiversity|species diversity]] is maximized when [[ecological disturbance]] is neither too rare nor too frequent. At high levels of disturbance, due to frequent [[forest fires]] or human impacts like [[deforestation]], all species are at risk of going extinct. According to IDH theory, at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is thus maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist. IDH is a nonequilibrium model used to describe the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. IDH is based on the following premises: First, ecological disturbances have major effects on species richness within the area of disturbance.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkinson |first1=David M. |year=1999 |title=The Disturbing History of Intermediate Disturbance |journal=Oikos |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=145–7 |jstor=3546874 |doi=10.2307/3546874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kricher |first1=John C. |year=2011 |title=Tropical Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New Jersey, Princeton}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catford et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ppees.2011.12.002 |title=The intermediate disturbance hypothesis and plant invasions: Implications for species richness and management |year=2012 |last1=Catford |first1=Jane A. |last2=Daehler |first2=Curtis C. |last3=Murphy |first3=Helen T. |last4=Sheppard |first4=Andy W. |last5=Hardesty |first5=Britta D. |last6=Westcott |first6=David A. |last7=Rejmánek |first7=Marcel |last8=Bellingham |first8=Peter J. |last9=Pergl |first9=Jan |last10=Horvitz |first10=Carol C. |last11=Hulme |first11=Philip E. |journal=Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=231–41|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, interspecific competition results from one species driving a competitor to extinction and becoming dominant in the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catford et al 2012"/&gt; Third, moderate ecological scale disturbances prevent interspecific competition.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catford et al 2012"/&gt;

[[File:Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis Graph.svg|thumb|Graph shows principles of intermediate disturbance hypothesis: I. at low levels of ecological disturbance species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases, II. at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist, III. at high levels of disturbance species richness is decreased due an increase in species movement.]]

Disturbances act to disrupt stable ecosystems and clear species' habitat. As a result, disturbances lead to species movement into the newly cleared area.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt; Once an area is cleared there is a progressive increase in species richness and competition takes place again. Once disturbance is removed, species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases.&lt;ref name="Vandermeer et al 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandermeer |first1=John |last2=Boucher |first2=Douglas |last3=Perfecto |first3=Ivette |last4=de la Cerda |first4=Inigo Granzow |year=1996 |title=A Theory of Disturbance and Species Diversity: Evidence from Nicaragua After Hurricane Joan |journal=Biotropica |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=600–13 |jstor=2389100 |doi=10.2307/2389100}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive exclusion principle|"Gause's Law", also known as competitive exclusion]], explains how species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist in the same niche.&lt;ref name="Kricher 2011"/&gt; Each species handles change from a disturbance differently; therefore, IDH can be described as both "broad in description and rich in detail".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt; The broad IDH model can be broken down into smaller divisions which include spatial within-patch scales, spatial between-patch scales, and purely temporal models.&lt;ref name="Vandermeer et al 1996"/&gt; Each subdivision within this theory generates similar explanations for the coexistence of species with habitat disturbance. [[Joseph H. Connell]]&lt;ref name="Connell 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.199.4335.1302 |title=Diversity in Tropical Rain Forests and Coral Reefs |year=1978 |last1=Connell |first1=J.

These proposed relationships lead to the hypothesis that intermediate disturbance levels would be the optimal amount of disorder within an ecosystem. Once K-selected and r-selected species can live in the same region, species richness can reach its maximum. The main difference between both types of species is their growth and reproduction rate. These characteristics attribute to the species that thrive in habitats with higher and lower amounts of disturbance. K-selected species generally demonstrate more competitive traits. Their primary investment of resources is directed towards growth, causing them to dominate stable ecosystems over a long period of time; an example of K-selected species the African elephant, which is prone to extinction because of their long generation times and low reproductive rates. In contrast, r-selected species colonize open areas quickly and can dominate landscapes that have been recently cleared by disturbance.&lt;ref name="Catford et al 2012"/&gt; An ideal examples of r-selected groups are algae. Based on the contradictory characteristics of both of these examples, areas of occasional disturbance allow both r and K species to benefit by residing in the same area. The ecological effect on species relationships is therefore supported by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

==History==
David Wilkinson gives a thorough history of the hypothesis in his paper titled, "The disturbing history of the intermediate disturbance".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt; In this paper, he explains that the idea of disturbance relating to species richness can be traced back to the 1940s in [[William Julius Eggeling|Eggeling]] 1947,&lt;ref name="Eggeling 1947"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eggeling |first1=W. J. |year=1947 |title=Observations on the Ecology of the Budongo Rain Forest, Uganda |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=20–87 |jstor=2256760 |doi=10.2307/2256760}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Watt|Watt]] 1947,&lt;ref name="Watt 1947"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watt |first1=Alex S. |year=1947 |title=Pattern and Process in the Plant Community |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=35 |issue=1/2 |pages=1–22 |jstor=2256497 |doi=10.2307/2256497}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]] 1949.&lt;ref name="Tansley 1949"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tansley |first1=A. G. |year=1949 |title=Britain's Green Mantle |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |location=London}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though studies supporting the hypothesis began in the 1960s, the first concrete statements of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis didn't occur until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt; The hypothesis was initially illustrated using what has been referred to as a "hump-backed model", which graphed the proposed relationship between diversity and disturbance.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt; This graph appeared first in [[J. Philip Grime|Grime]]'s 'Competitive exclusion in herbaceous vegetation'&lt;ref name="Grime 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/242344a0 |title=Competitive Exclusion in Herbaceous Vegetation |year=1973 |last1=Grime |first1=J. P. |journal=Nature |volume=242 |issue=5396 |pages=344–7 |bibcode=1973Natur.242..344G}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was used to show the relationship between species density and both environmental stress and intensity of management. The graph appears again in Horn's 'Markovian properties of forest succession'&lt;ref name="Horn 1975"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=H. S. |year=1975 |chapter=Markovian Properties of Forest Succession |editor1-last=Cody |editor1-first=M. L. |editor2-last=Diamond |editor2-first=J. M. |title=Ecology and evolution of communities |publisher=Belknap Press |location=Massachusetts |pages=196–211 |isbn=0-674-22444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Connell's 'The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle'.&lt;ref name="Connell 1978"/&gt; Though Grime was the first to provide a model for the relationship and Horn was the first to explicitly state the hypothesis, Connell is generally cited in text books and journals as the founder of the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999"/&gt;

The hypothesis caused concern among the marine science community because of the discrepancy with the 1976 Competition/Predation/Disturbance model proposed by Menge and Sutherland&lt;ref name="Menge et al 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/284741 |title=Community regulation: variation in disturbance, competition, and predation in relation to environmental stress and recruitment. |year=1987 |last1=Menge |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Sutherland |first2=John P. |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=730–57 |jstor=2461716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, low disturbance influences high predation and high disturbance creates low predation, causing competitive exclusion to take place. Menge &amp; Sutherland formulated a new model, one that incorporated Connell's ideas in a two part graph published in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Menge et al 1987"/&gt; This model proposes that predation, competition, and disturbance are all responsible for shaping the diversity of a community under certain circumstances.

==Support and critiques==
Debates over the validity of the IDH are ongoing within the discipline of tropical ecology as the theory is tested in various ecological communities. Other evidence exists for&lt;ref name="tewntyfour"/&gt;&lt;ref name=seventeen&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01075.x |title=Reciprocal relationships and potential feedbacks between biodiversity and disturbance |year=2007 |last1=Randall Hughes |first1=A. |last2=Byrnes |first2=Jarrett E. |last3=Kimbro |first3=David L. |last4=Stachowicz |first4=John J. |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=849–64 |pmid=17663718}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against&lt;ref name="Collins et al 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Scott L. |last2=Glenn |first2=Susan M. |last3=Gibson |first3=David J. |year=1995 |title=Experimental Analysis of Intermediate Disturbance and Initial Floristic Composition: Decoupling Cause and Effect |journal=Ecology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=486–92 |jstor=1941207 |doi=10.2307/1941207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warren |first1=Philip H. |year=1996 |title=Dispersal and Destruction in a Multiple Habitat System: An Experimental Approach Using Protist Communities |journal=Oikos |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=317–25 |jstor=3546071 |doi=10.2307/3546071}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been supported by several studies involving marine habitats such as coral reefs and macroalgal communities. In shallow coastal waters off of south-west Western Australia, a study was conducted to determine whether or not the extremely high diversity observed in macroalgal communities was due to disturbance from waves.&lt;ref name="England et al 2008"/&gt; Using a numerical wave model to estimate the forces caused by waves, researchers were able to determine that there was a significant relationship between species diversity and disturbance index; this is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.&lt;ref name="England et al 2008"/&gt; Furthermore, diversity was lower at exposed offshore sites where disturbance from waves was highest, and at extremely sheltered site where disturbance from waves was minimized.&lt;ref name="England et al 2008"/&gt; The study provided evidence that biodiversity in microalgal reef communities possess some relationship with their proximity to the outer edge of lagoon systems typical of the Western Australian coast.&lt;ref name="England et al 2008"/&gt; While this study may have been localized to the Western Australian coast, it still provides some evidence to support the validity of the IDH.

Additionally, a study done in the Virgin Islands National Park found that species diversity, in some locations, of shallow coral reefs increased after infrequent hurricane disturbance.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1993"/&gt; In 1982, reefs in Kona, Hawaii were reported to have an increase in diversity after a moderate storm, although the effects of the storm varied with the reef zones.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1993"/&gt; In 1980, Hurricane Allen increased species diversity in shallow zones of the Discovery Bay Reef in Jamaica because the more dominant corals were reduced; giving the other types a chance to propagate following the disturbance.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1993"/&gt; Similar findings have been reported in shallow reefs in which dominant species of coral have suffered more damage than the less common species.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1993"/&gt; While more long-term studies are required to completely support the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, the studies that have been conducted thus far have proven that IDH does have some validity while attempting to describe the relationship between diversity and the rate of occurrences of disturbance in an area.

Even though the IDH was designed for species-rich environments, like tropical rainforests, "most studies that evaluate the IDH are based on limited data with: few species, a limited range of disturbance and/or only a small geographic area, compared with the scale of interest".&lt;ref name="Bongers et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01329.x |title=The intermediate disturbance hypothesis applies to tropical forests, but disturbance contributes little to tree diversity |year=2009 |last1=Bongers |first1=Frans |last2=Poorter |first2=Lourens |last3=Hawthorne |first3=William D. |last4=Sheil |first4=Douglas |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=798–805 |pmid=19473218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, Rogers, Poorter, Hawthorne, and Sheil evaluate the IDH on a larger scale and compare different tropical forest types in Ghana. Their dataset consisted of 2504 one-hectare plots with a total of 331,567 trees. These plots were divided classified into three forest types: wet (446 plots), moist (1322 plots), and dry forest (736 plots).&lt;ref name="Bongers et al 2009"/&gt; They found that diversity does peak at intermediate level of disturbance but little variation is explained outside dry forests. Therefore, disturbance is less important for species diversity patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought. The number of species was about the same for each forest type, and wet forests had only slightly fewer pioneer species, slightly more shade-tolerant and an equal number of pioneer light-demanders compared with the moist and dry forests.&lt;ref name="Bongers et al 2009"/&gt; Their results generally supported the IDH as an explanation of why diversity varies across sites, but concluded that disturbance is less important for species richness patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought.&lt;ref name="Bongers et al 2009"/&gt;

IDH has been subject to criticism since its inception but not to the degree that other species density hypotheses have been. Recently there has been a call for a critical reassessment of IDH.&lt;ref name="Fox 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.08.014 |title=The intermediate disturbance hypothesis should be abandoned |year=2013 |last1=Fox |first1=Jeremy W. |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |pmid=22981468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms have focused on the increasing amount of empirical data that disagrees with IDH. This can be found within approximately 80% of over 100 reviewed studies that are examining the predicted peak of diversity in intermediate disturbance levels.&lt;ref name="tewntyfour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholes et al 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00777.x |title=The combined effects of energy and disturbance on species richness in protist microcosms |year=2005 |last1=Scholes |first1=Lianna |last2=Warren |first2=Philip H. |last3=Beckerman |first3=Andrew P. |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=730–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lubchenco 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lubchenco |first1=Jane |year=1978 |title=Plant Species Diversity in a Marine Intertidal Community: Importance of Herbivore Food Preference and Algal Competitive Abilities |journal=American Naturalist |volume=112 |issue=983 |pages=23–39 |jstor=2460135 |doi=10.1086/283250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationales behind these discrepancies have been leveled at the simplicity of IDH and its inability to grasp the complexity found within the spatial and intensity aspects of disturbance relationships.&lt;ref name="Chesson et al 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chesson |first1=Peter |last2=Huntly |first2=Nancy |year=1997 |title=The Roles of Harsh and Fluctuating Conditions in the Dynamics of Ecological Communities |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=150 |issue=5 |pages=519–53 |jstor=286080 |doi=10.1086/286080 |pmid=18811299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many IDH proven circumstances have been suggested to be a reflection of skewed research methods based on researchers looking for humped diversity-disturbance relations only in systems where they believed it has occurred.&lt;ref name="Fox 2013"/&gt; Other criticisms are suggesting several subtle theoretical issues with IDH. First, while disturbances weaken competition by reducing species densities and per-capita growth rates, it also reduces the strength of competition needed to push per capita growth into a negative territory and reduce density to zero.&lt;ref name="Fox 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesson et al 1997"/&gt; Second, intermediate disturbances slow competitive exclusion by increasing the long-term average mortality rate, and thereby reducing the differences in the average growth rates of competing species. The difference in the growth rates between competitively superior and inferior species determines the rates of competitive exclusion; therefore intermediate disturbances are affecting species' abundance but not coexistence.&lt;ref name="Fox 2013"/&gt; Third, intermediate disturbances temporarily affect relative species fitness. However, no matter what the rate of disturbance is, the species with favored fitness will out-compete the rest of the species.&lt;ref name="Violle et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2010PNAS..10712925V |jstor=25708640 |title=Experimental demonstration of the importance of competition under disturbance |last1=Violle |first1=Cyrille Violle, Zhichao Pu, Lin Jiang |last2=Pu |first2=Zhichao |last3=Jiang |first3=Lin |last4=Schoener |first4=Thomas W. |volume=107 |year=2010 |pages=12925–9 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.1000699107 |issue=29 |pmid=20616069 |pmc=2919955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. One example is by Denslow,&lt;ref name="Hall et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0282 |title=Diversity-disturbance relationships: Frequency and intensity interact |year=2012 |last1=Hall |first1=A. R. |last2=Miller |first2=A. D. |last3=Leggett |first3=H. C. |last4=Roxburgh |first4=S. H. |last5=Buckling |first5=A. |last6=Shea |first6=K. |journal=Biology Letters |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=768–71 |pmid=22628097 |pmc=3440969}}&lt;/ref&gt; who states that the species diversity in a disturbance-mediated coexistence between species is maximized by the presence of a disturbance regime resembling the historic processes. This is because species generally adapt to the level of disturbance in their ecosystem through evolution (whether disturbance is of high, intermediate or low level). Many species (e.g. [[Ruderal species|ruderal plants]] and fire-adapted species) even depend on disturbance in ecosystems where it often occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">In 1997 a core set of six principles was established by ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] for the sustainability governance of the oceans. These six principles became known as the "'''Lisbon Principles'''": together they provide basic guidelines for administering the use of common natural and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. 2007. ''Lisbon principles of sustainable governance''. In: Encyclopaedia of Earth. Ed. C. J. Cleveland. Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington D.C. Published in Encyclopaedia of the Earth August 9, 2007; retrieved February 6, 2009.[http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129134940/http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance |date=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R.  et al. 1998. Principles for sustainable governance of the oceans. ''Science'' '''281''': 198-199. (also ''Nature'' '''387''':  253-260 (1997) see above.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Principle 1: '''Responsibility'''. ''Access to environmental resources carries attendant responsibilities to use them in an ecologically sustainable, economically efficient, and socially fair manner. Individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned with each other and with broad social and ecological goals.''
*Principle 2: '''Scale-matching'''. ''Ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale. Decision-making on environmental resources should (i) be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input, (ii) ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels, (iii) take ownership and actors into account, and (iv) internalize costs and benefits. Appropriate scales of governance will be those that have the most relevant information, can respond quickly and efficiently, and are able to integrate across scale boundaries.''
*Principle 3: '''Precaution'''. ''In the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts, decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution. The burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment.''
*Principle 4: '''[[Adaptive management]]'''. ''Given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management, decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological, social, and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement.''
*Principle 5: '''[[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full cost]] allocation'''. ''All of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated. When appropriate, markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs.''
*Principle 6: '''Participation'''. ''All stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources. Full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible, accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately.''

This is a list of "'''twin towns'''" or "'''sister cities'''" in the geographical region of [[Oceania]] — that is, pairs of towns or cities in different countries which have [[town twinning]] arrangements. Where known, the date of formation of the twinning agreement is included in parentheses.

Note that the list is likely to always remain incomplete, since no canonical list of such arrangements exists; even those towns that are listed may well have arrangements which are not listed here.
However, a searchable, interactive list is maintained by [[Sister Cities International]]. Note also that any twinning arrangement ''should'' be listed at two locations in the series of lists: once for each of the towns involved in the arrangement.

The data comes from [[Demographia]] and the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].&lt;ref name=Eurostat&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Statistics_on_European_cities Eurostat: Statistics on European cities].

Retrieved 6 September 2015. Note: List based on estimates for 2015, from 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Demographia provides figures for [[urban area]]s (including [[conurbation]]s),&lt;ref name=Demographia/&gt; while the UN DESA figures are for [[Urban agglomeration|agglomerations]] only.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt; For comparison, [[Larger urban zone|Function Urban Area]] (FUA) population figures by [[Eurostat]] are also provided, however, these measure the wider [[metropolitan area]]s.

==Important notes==
* This is a list of urban areas, ''not'' a list of [[metropolitan area]]s. Urban areas are contiguous built-up areas where houses are typically not more than 200 m apart, not including [[river]]s, [[park]]s, [[road]]s, industrial fields, etc. A metropolitan area is an urban area plus any [[commuter town|satellite]] cities around it and any agricultural land in between. For instance [[London]] is sometimes listed with 14 million inhabitants, [[Stuttgart]] is frequently listed with 2.2 million inhabitants, [[Munich]] with 2 million or more, etc., indicating the wider metropolitan area of those places. Metropolitan areas, which imply much more complicated definitions (such as the proportion of people in satellite cities working in the core of the metropolitan area), can be accurately computed only by statistical offices, after they have chosen a definition for metropolitan areas, whereas urban areas can be computed by any institution or person with the study of maps, satellite imagery and other geographical data in order to determine the outer limits of a continuous built-up area with one or more neighbouring cities. Furthermore, the list does not make a difference between cities that have multiple satellites and cities that do not. Therefore, two cities with the same demographics for their urban area will have an equal ranking on this list, even if one of the two cities may be much larger as it is the core of a number of satellites.
* This is a list of urban areas, ''not'' a list of administrative cities. For example, the list of conurbations contains the urban area of Lille-Kortrijk. Lille and Kortrijk remain two very distinct cities, each belonging to a different country, culture and language area. For a list of the largest cities of the European Union by population, please see [[List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits]].
* The study of urban areas is useful to analyse how cities develop, which in turn can be used to define transportation, planning and environmental policies, to adjust administrative boundaries etc.  At the same time its limitations have to be acknowledged.  It is a purely geographic study and disregards all other factors that contribute to the analysis of the functional city.  For instance, several cities in the European Union such as Brussels and London have reserved [[green belt]]s in the outskirts which impacts the size of urban areas but not the "perceived city" as these green belts have now become integrated in what people consider to be the functional city.

It consists of two major [[volcanic cone]]s: Greater Ararat and [[Little Ararat]]. Greater Ararat is the [[List of mountains in Turkey#Mountains of Turkey|highest peak in Turkey]] and the [[Armenian Highland|Armenian plateau]] with an [[summit (topography)|elevation]] of {{convert|5137|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; while, Little Ararat's elevation is {{convert|3896|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yilmaz|first1=Y.|last2=Güner|first2=Y.|last3=Saroğlu|first3=F.|title=Geology of the quaternary volcanic centres of the east Anatolia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027398000559|journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]]|date=1998|volume=85|pages=173–210|doi=10.1016/s0377-0273(98)00055-9|bibcode=1998JVGR...85..173Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ararat [[massif]] is about {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide at ground base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Short|editor1-first=Nicholas M.|editor2-last=Blair|editor2-first=Robert W.|title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms|date=1986|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|page=226|chapter=Mt. Ararat, Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first efforts to reach Ararat's summit were made in the Middle Ages. However, it was not until 1829 when [[Friedrich Parrot]] and [[Khachatur Abovian]], accompanied by four others, made the first recorded ascent.

Despite the scholarly consensus that the "[[mountains of Ararat]]" of the [[Book of Genesis]] do not refer specifically to Mt. Ararat, it has been widely accepted in Christianity as the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]]. It is the principal [[national symbol]] of Armenia and has been considered a sacred mountain by [[Armenians]]. It is featured prominently in [[Armenian literature]] and [[Armenian art|art]] and is an icon for [[United Armenia|Armenian irredentism]]. Along with Noah's Ark, it is depicted on the [[coat of arms of Armenia]].

==Political borders==
Mount Ararat forms a near-[[quadripoint]] between [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Iran]]. Its summit is located some {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of both the [[Iran]]ian border and the border of the  [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave of Azerbaijan, and  {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of the Armenian border. The Turkish–Armenian–Azerbaijani and Turkish–Iranian–Azerbaijani [[tripoint]]s are some 8&amp;nbsp;km apart, separated by a narrow strip of Turkish territory containing the [[European route E99|E99]] road which enters Nakhchivan at {{coord|39.6553|N|44.8034|E}}.

From the 16th century until 1828 the range was part of the Ottoman-Persian border; Great Ararat's summit and the northern slopes, along with the eastern slopes of Little Ararat were controlled by Persia. Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|1826–28 Russo-Persian War]] and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], the Persian controlled territory was ceded to the Russian Empire. Little Ararat became the point where the Turkish, Persian, and Russian imperial frontiers converged.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline"/&gt; The current international boundaries were formed throughout the 20th century. The mountain came under Turkish control during the 1920 [[Turkish–Armenian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hovannisian|first1=Richard G.|authorlink1=Richard G.

==Geography==
Mount Ararat is located in the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] of Turkey between the provinces of [[Ağrı Province|Ağrı]] and [[Iğdır Province|Iğdır]], near the border with [[Iran]], [[Armenia]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] [[exclave]] of [[Azerbaijan]], between the [[Aras (river)|Aras]] and [[Murat River|Murat]] rivers.&lt;ref name=MinistryOfTourism&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611075707/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-17324/eski2yeni.html "Ağrı – Mount Ararat"].

The [[Ararat plain]] runs along its northwest to western side.

===Elevation===
An elevation of {{convert|5165|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} for Mount Ararat is given by some encyclopedias and reference works such as ''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]'' and ''Encyclopedia of World Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|date=2001|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=9780877795469|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA63 63]|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haggett|editor1-first=Peter|editor1-link=Peter Haggett|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography: The Middle East|chapter=Turkey|date=2002|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|isbn=978-0-7614-7289-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BqVsXdHWAIC&amp;pg=PA2026 2026]|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartemann|first1=Frederic|last2=Hauptman|first2=Robert|title=The Mountain Encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Taylor Trade]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=0-8108-5056-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifs2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galichian|first1=Rouben|authorlink1=Rouben Galichian|title=Historic Maps of Armenia: The Cartographic Heritage|date=2004|publisher=[[I.B.

This clearly shows that the 5165 meter elevation that many sources use is wrong. The summit is a snow ridge with no visible rock anywhere. Thus, the precise elevation will change with the seasons and could definitely be influenced by climate change (global warming). Later GPS measurements in Iran suggested that the GPS data may be about 10 meter too high also in this part of the world. This would in fact point in the direction of a true Ararat elevation around 5125 meter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summit ice cap===
The [[ice cap]] on the summit of Mount Ararat has been shrinking since at least 1957. In the late 1950s, Blumenthal observed that there existed 11 outlet [[glacier]]s emerging from a summit snow mass that covered about {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal1958a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=M. M.|year=1958|title=Vom Agrl Dag (Ararat) zum Kagkar Dag. Bergfahrten in nordostanatolischen Grenzlande|journal=Die Alpen|volume=34|pp=125–137|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was found that the present glaciers on the summit of Ararat extend as low as an elevation of {{convert|3900|m|ft|sp=us}} on the north-facing slope, and an elevation of 
{{convert|4200|m|ft|sp=us}} on its south-facing slope.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal1958a/&gt; Using pre-existing [[aerial imagery]] and [[remote sensing]] data, Sarıkaya and others studied the extent of the ice cap on Mount Ararat between 1976 and 2011.&lt;ref name=Sar2012a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarıkaya|first=Mehmet Akif|title=Recession of the ice cap on Mount Ağrı (Ararat), Turkey, from 1976 to 2011 and its climatic significance|journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences|date=2012|volume=46|pages=190–194|doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2011.12.009|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257553234_Recession_of_the_ice_cap_on_Mount_Ar_(Ararat)_Turkey_from_1976_to_2011_and_its_climatic_significance|bibcode=2012JAESc..46..190S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SarOthers2014a&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarıkaya|first1=Mehmet Akif|first2=A.

Kargel et al.|pp=465–480|title=Global Land Ice Measurements from Space|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=978-3540798170}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that this ice cap had shrunk to {{convert|8.0|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 1976 and to {{convert|5.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 2011. They calculated that between 1976 and 2011, the ice cap on top of Mount Ararat had lost 29% of its total area at an average rate of ice loss of {{convert|0.07|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} per year over 35 years. This rate is consistent with the general rates of retreat of other Turkish summit glaciers and ice caps that have been documented by other studies.&lt;ref name=SarOthers2014a/&gt;

Blumenthal estimated that the [[snow line]] had been as low as {{convert|3000|m|ft|sp=us}} in elevation during the Late [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=Blumenthal1958a/&gt; Such a snow line would have created an ice cap of {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in extent. However, he observed a lack of any clear evidence of prehistoric [[moraine]]s other than those which were close to the 1958 glacier tongues. Blumenthal explained the absence of such moraines by the lack of confining ridges to control glaciers, insufficient debris load in the ice to form moraines, and their burial by later eruptions. Years later, Birman observed on the south-facing slopes a possible moraine that extends at least {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us}} in altitude below the base of the 1958 ice cap at an elevation of {{convert|4200|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Birman1968a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birman|first=J.

The higher moraine lies at an altitude of about {{convert|2200|m|ft|sp=us}} and the lower moraine lies at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|ft|sp=us}}. The lower moraine occurs about {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} downstream from Lake Balık. Both moraines are about {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}} high. It is suspected that Lake Balık occupies a glacial basin.&lt;ref name=Birman1968a/&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:Armenian-highlands-false-color-height-map.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Ararat represented by the dark brown spots in the buff colored lowlands of the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins]]
Mount Ararat is a polygenic, compound [[stratovolcano]]. Covering an area of {{convert|1100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the largest volcanic edifice within the region. Along its northwest–southeast trending long axis, Mount Ararat is about {{convert|45|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} long along its short axis. It consists of about {{convert|1150|km3|abbr=on}} of [[dacite|dacitic]] and [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] debris and dacitic, rhyolitic, and [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;

Mount Ararat consists of two distinct volcanic cones, Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat ([[Little Ararat]]). The western volcanic cone, Greater Ararat, is a steep-sided volcanic cone that is larger and higher than the eastern volcanic cone. Greater Ararat is about {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} wide at the base and rises about {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} above the adjacent floors of the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. The eastern volcanic cone, Lesser Ararat, is {{convert|3896|m|ft|sp=us}} high and {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} across. These volcanic cones, which lie {{convert|13|km|mi|sp=us}} apart, are separated by a wide north–south-trending crack. This crack is the surface expression of an extensional [[Fault (geology)|fault]]. Numerous [[parasitic cone]]s and [[lava dome]]s have been built by flank eruptions along this fault and on the flanks of both of the main volcanic cones.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;

Mount Ararat lies within a complex, sinistral [[pull-apart basin]] that originally was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. This pull-apart basin is the result of [[Strike slip fault|strike-slip]] movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the [[Doğubeyazıt–Gürbulak Fault|Doğubeyazıt–Gürbulak]] and [[Iğdir Fault]]s, of a sinistral strike–slip fault system. Tension between these faults not only formed the original pull-apart basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat is located is the result of north–south convergence and [[Tectonism|tectonic]] compression between the Arabian Platform and [[Laurasia]] that continued after the [[Tethys Ocean]] closed during the [[Eocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] along the Bitlis–Zagros [[Suture (geology)|suture]].&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeweyOther1986a&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=J.

=== Geological history ===
[[File:Mediterranean Rupelian.jpg|thumb|right|Paleogeography of the early [[Oligocene]]]]
[[File:Tectonic map Mediterranean EN.svg|thumb|right|Tectonic map of the Mediterranean and surrounding mountain ranges]]
During the early [[Eocene]] and early [[Miocene]], the collision of the Arabian platform with Laurasia closed and eliminated the Tethys Ocean from the area of what is now Anatolia. The closure of these masses of [[continental crust]], collapsed this [[ocean basin]] by middle Eocene and resulted in a progressive shallowing of the remnant seas, until the end of the early Miocene. Post-collisional tectonic convergence within the collision zone resulted in the total elimination of the remaining seas from East Anatolia, at the end of early Miocene, crustal shortening and thickening across the collision zone, and uplift of the East Anatolian–Iranian plateau. Accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding, which resulted in the creation of numerous local basins. The north–south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting, volcanism, and seismicity.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeweyOther1986a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/&gt;

Within Anatolia, regional volcanism started middle-late Miocene. During the late Miocene–[[Pliocene]] period, widespread volcanism blanketed the entire East Anatolian–Iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks. This volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times. Apparently, it reached a climax during the latest Miocene–Pliocene, 6 to 3 Ma. During the [[Quaternary]], the volcanism became restricted to a few local volcanoes such as Mount Ararat. These volcanoes are typically associated with north–south tensional fractures formed by the continuing the north–south shortening deformation of Anatolia.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;

In their detailed study and summary of the Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases to the construction of Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into its flanks.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt; First, they recognized a ''fissure eruption phase'' of [[Plinian eruption|Plinian-subPlinian]] [[Fissure vent|fissure eruptions]] that deposited more than {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic [[lava flow]]s. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest–south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a ''cone-building phase'' began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} thick and [[pyroclastic flow]]s of [[andesite]] and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a ''climatic phase'', copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a ''flank eruption phase'', during which a major north–south-trending fault offset the two cones that developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Doğubeyazıt plain and along the southerly flowing Sarısu River. These lava flows formed black [[ʻaʻā]] and [[pāhoehoe]] lava flows that contain well preserved [[lava tube]]s.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt; The [[radiometric dating]] of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma.&lt;ref name=AllenOther2011a&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mark B.|last2=Mark|first2=Darren F.|last3=Kheirkhah|first3=Monireh|last4=Barfod|first4=Dan|last5=Emami|first5=Mohammad H.|last6=Saville|first6=Christopher|title=40Ar/39Ar dating of Quaternary lavas in northwest Iran: constraints on the landscape evolution and incision rates of the Turkish–Iranian plateau|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|date=2011|volume=185|issue=3|pages=1175–1188|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05022.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246x.2011.05022.x|bibcode=2011GeoJI.185.1175A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.&lt;ref name=YilmazOther1998a/&gt;

===Recent volcanic and seismic activity===
The chronology of [[Holocene]] volcanic activity associated with Mount Ararat is documented by either archaeological excavations, oral history, historical records, or a combination of these data, which provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of Mount Ararat occurred in 2500–2400 BC, 550 BC, possibly in 1450 AD and 1783 AD, and definitely in 1840 AD. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows from the northwest flank of Mount Ararat destroyed and buried at least one [[Kura–Araxes culture]] settlement and caused numerous fatalities in 2500–2400 BC. Oral histories indicated that a significant eruption of uncertain magnitude occurred in 550 BC and minor eruptions of uncertain nature might have occurred in 1450 AD and 1783 AD.&lt;ref name=SiebertOther2010a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/&gt;&lt;ref name="АрутюнянOthers2005a"/&gt; According to the interpretation of historical and archaeological data, strong earthquakes not associated with volcanic eruptions also occurred the area of Mount Ararat in 139, 368, 851–893, and 1319 AD. During the 139 AD earthquake, a large [[landslide]] that caused many casualties and was similar to the 1840 AD landslide originated from the summit of Mount Ararat.&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/&gt;&lt;ref name= TaymazOther1991a/&gt;

====1840 eruption====
A [[phreatic eruption]] occurred on Mount Ararat on July 2, 1840 and pyroclastic flow from radial fissures on the upper north flank of the mountain and a possibly associated earthquake of magnitude 7.4 that caused severe damage and numerous casualties. Up to 10,000 people in the region died in the earthquake, including 1,900 villagers in the village of Akhuri (Armenian: Akori, modern [[Yenidoğan, Aralık|Yenidoğan]]) who were killed by a gigantic landslide and subsequent [[debris flow]]. In addition, this combination of landslide and debris flow destroyed the [[Saint Hakob of Akori monastery|Armenian monastery of St. Jacob]] near Akori, the town of [[Aralık|Aralik]], several villages, and Russian military barracks. It also temporarily dammed the Sevjur (Metsamor) River.&lt;ref name=SiebertOther2010a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=KarakhanianOther2004a/&gt;&lt;ref name="АрутюнянOthers2005a"/&gt;

==Ascents==
The 13th century missionary [[William of Rubruck]] wrote that "Many have tried to climb it, but none has been able."&lt;ref name="William of Rubruck"/&gt; 

===Armenian attitudes===
The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] was historically opposed to ascents of Ararat on religious grounds. [[Thomas Stackhouse]], an 18th century English theologian, noted that "All the Armenians are firmly persuaded that Noah's ark exists to the present day on the summit of Mount Ararat, and that in order to preserve it, no person is permitted to approach it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stackhouse|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas Stackhouse|title=A History of the Holy Bible|date=1836|publisher=[[Blackie and Son]]|location=Glasgow|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=j78CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 93]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to its first ascent by Parrot and Abovian, one high-ranking [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] clergyman commented that to climb the [[sacred mountain]] was "to tie the womb of the mother of all mankind in a dragonish mode." By contrast, in the 21st century to climb Ararat is "the most highly valued goal of some of the patriotic pilgrimages that are organized in growing number from Armenia and the Armenian diaspora."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siekierski|first1=Konrad|editor1-last=Agadjanian|editor1-first=Alexander|title=Armenian Christianity Today: Identity Politics and Popular Practice|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4724-1273-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dDbjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 14]|chapter="One Nation, One Faith, One Church": The Armenian Apostolic Church and the Ethno-Religion in Post-Soviet Armenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the tradition===
According to the fourth verse of the eighth chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]] (Genesis 8:4), following a [[Genesis flood narrative|flood]], [[Noah's Ark]] landed on the "[[mountains of Ararat]]" ([[Biblical Hebrew|Biblical]] {{lang-he-n|הָרֵי אֲרָרָט}}, ''hare ararat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgenstern|first1=Julian|title=Psalm 48|journal=[[Hebrew Union College Annual]]|date=1941|volume=16|page=68|publisher=[[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]]|quote=Note the plural, ''hare 'Ararat''; not "Mt. Ararat," as traditionally translated and interpreted, but rather "(one of) the mountains of Ararat," i. e. of Urartu or Armenia.|jstor=23502992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians and Bible scholars agree that "Ararat" is the Hebrew name of [[Urartu]], the geographic predecessor of Armenia and referred to the wider region at the time and not the mountain today known as Ararat.{{efn|
*Richard James Fischer: "The Genesis text, using the plural "mountains" (or hills), identifies no particular mountain, but points generally toward Armenia ("Ararat" being identical with the Assyrian "Urartu") which is broadly embraces that region."&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;

*Bill T. Arnold: "Since the ancient kingdom of Ararat/Urartu was much more extensive geographically than this isolated location in Armenia, modern attempts to find remaints of Noah's ark here are misguided."{{sfn|Arnold|2008|p=105}}
*[[Vahan Kurkjian]]: "It has long been the notion among many Christians that Noah's Ark came to rest as the Flood subsided upon the great peak known as Mount Ararat; this assumption is based upon an erroneous reading of the 4th verse of the VIIIth chapter of Genesis. That verse does not say that the Ark landed upon Mount Ararat, but upon "the mountains of Ararat." Now, Ararat was the Hebrew version of the name, not of the mountain but of the country around it, the old Armenian homeland, whose name at other times and in other tongues appears variously as Erirath, Urartu, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurkjian|first=Vahan|authorlink=Vahan Kurkjian|title=A History of Armenia|date=1964|orig-year=1958|publisher=Armenian General Benevolent Union of America|location=New York|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/1*.html|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Indeed, the phrase is translated as "mountains of Armenia" (''montes Armeniae'') in the [[Vulgate]], the fourth century [[Latin]] translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Room|first1=Adrian|authorlink1=Adrian Room|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings|date=1997|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|isbn=9780786401727|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Mount Ararat is considered the traditional site of the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; It is therefore called a biblical mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tremblais|first1=Jean-Louis|title=Ararat, montagne biblique|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2011/07/16/01006-20110716ARTFIG00456-ararat-montagne-biblique.php|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=16 July 2011|language=fr}}

Most Christians identify Mount Ararat with the biblical "mountains of Ararat," despite the fact that six other landing places have been proposed, "largely because it would have been the first peak to emerge from the receding flood waters."&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; Ararat is where the European tradition and most of [[Western Christianity]] place the landing of Noah's Ark. According to Spencer and Lienard the tradition "seems to be well entrenched in the Christian world."&lt;ref name="swau"/&gt; A 1722 biblical dictionary by [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Austin Calmet]] and the 1871 [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary]] both point to Mount Ararat as the place where tradition says the ark rested.&lt;ref name="Calmet"&gt;original title: ''Dictionnaire historique, critique, chronologique, geographique et literal de la Bible''.

During his visit to Armenia in 2001 [[Pope John Paul II]] declared in his homily in Yerevan's [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan|St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral]]: "We are close to Mount Ararat, where tradition says that the Ark of Noah came to rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homily of John Paul II|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20010926_yerevan-st-gregory.html|website=vatican.va|publisher=[[Holy See]]|date=26 September 2001|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219191426/https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20010926_yerevan-st-gregory.html|archivedate=19 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, also mentioned Mount Ararat as the resting place of Noah's Ark in his speech at the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] during his visit to Armenia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Приветственная речь Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла в кафедральном соборе Эчмиадзина [Welcome speech by His Holiness Patriarch Kirill at the Cathedral of Etchmiadzin]|url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1114986.html|website=patriarchia.ru|publisher=[[Russian Orthodox Church]]|language=ru|date=16 March 2010|quote=Каждый, кто приезжает в Армению, получает неизгладимое впечатление, лицезрея ее главный символ — священную гору Арарат, на которой остановился после потопа ковчег праотца Ноя.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219191256/http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1114986.html|archivedate=19 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those critical of this view point out that Ararat was the name of the country, not the mountain, at the time when Genesis was written. Arnold wrote in his 2008 Genesis commentary, "The location 'on the mountains' of Ararat indicates not a specific mountain by that name, but rather the mountainous region of the land of Ararat."{{sfn|Arnold|2008|p=104}}

===Searches===
Ararat has traditionally been the main focus of the [[searches for Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="vos"/&gt; [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Augustin Calmet]] wrote in his 1722 biblical dictionary, "It is affirmed, but without proof, that there are still remains of Noah's ark on the top of this mountain; but [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|M. de Tournefort]], who visited this spot, has assured us there was nothing like it; that the top of mount Ararat is inaccessible, both by reason of its great height, and of the snow which perpetually covers it."&lt;ref name="Calmet"/&gt; Archaeological expeditions, sometimes supported by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] churches, have been conducted since the 19th century in search of the ark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patai|first1=Raphael|last2=Oettinger|first2=Ayelet|editor1-last=Patai|editor1-first=Raphael|editor2-last=Bar-Itzhak|editor2-first=Haya|editor1-link=Raphael Patai|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Folklore and Traditions|chapter=Ararat|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780765620255|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3qsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 50–51]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1974 book around 200 people from more than 20 countries claimed to have seen the Ark on Ararat since 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balsiger|first1=David|last2=Sellier Jr.|first2=Charles E.|title=[[In Search of Noah's Ark]]|date=1974|publisher=[[Sunn Classic Pictures|Sunn Classic Books]]|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fragment from the ark supposedly found on Ararat is on display at the museum of [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], the center of the Armenian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zenian|first1=David|title=The Holy Etchmiadzin Museum: History of a Long Journey|journal=AGBU Magazine|date=1 July 1996|url=https://agbu.org/news-item/the-holy-etchmiadzin-museum-history-of-a-long-jouney/|publisher=[[Armenian General Benevolent Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous reports of ark sightings (e.g. [[Ararat anomaly]]) and rumors, "no scientific evidence of the ark has emerged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mayell|first1=Hillary|title=Noah's Ark Found?

===Myth of origin===
The [[Genesis flood narrative]] was linked to the Armenian [[Origin myth|myth of origin]] by the early medieval historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]]. In his ''[[History of Armenia (book)|History of Armenia]]'', he wrote that Noah and his family first settled in Armenia and later moved to [[Babylon]]. [[Hayk]], a descendant of [[Japheth]], a son of Noah, revolted against [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] (the biblical [[Nimrod]]) and returned to the area around Mount Ararat, where he established the roots of the Armenian nation. He is thus considered the legendary [[founding father]] and the name giver of the Armenian people.{{sfn|Khorenatsi|1978|p=85}}{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=51}} According to [[Razmik Panossian]], this legend "makes Armenia the cradle of all civilisation since Noah's Ark landed on the 'Armenian' mountain of Ararat. […] it connects Armenians to the biblical narrative of human development. […] it makes Mount Ararat the national symbol of all Armenians, and the territory around it the Armenian homeland from [[time immemorial]]."{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=51–52}}

===Coat of arms of Armenia===
Mount Ararat has been depicted on the [[coat of arms of Armenia]] consistently since 1918. The [[First Republic of Armenia|First Republic]]'s coat of arms was designed by architect [[Alexander Tamanian]] and painter [[Hakob Kojoyan]]. This coat of arms was readopted by the legislature of the Republic of Armenia on April 19, 1992, after Armenia regained independence. Ararat is depicted along with the ark on its peak on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] on an orange background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State symbols of the Republic of Armenia|url=http://www.president.am/en/state-symbols/|website=president.am|publisher=Office to the President of the Republic of Armenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbol of genocide and territorial claims===
In the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, Ararat came to represent the destruction of the native Armenian population of eastern Turkey ([[Western Armenia]]) in the national consciousness of Armenians.{{efn|"The lands of Western Armenia which Mt.

Russian poet [[Osip Mandelstam]] wrote fondly of Ararat during his 1933 travels in Armenia.

During his travels to Armenia, Soviet Russian writer [[Vasily Grossman]] observed Mount Ararat from Yerevan standing "high in the blue sky."  He wrote that "with its gentle, tender contours, it seems to grow not out of the earth but out of the sky, as if it has condensed from its white clouds and its deep blue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11876">'''Nature writing''' is [[nonfiction]] or [[fiction]] [[prose]] or [[poetry]] about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes [[natural history]] essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lyon|first=Thomas Jefferson|publisher=Milkweed Editions|date=2001|title=This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing|ISBN=978-1571312563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.

Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of [[natural history]] that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the "[[parson-naturalist]]" [[Gilbert White]] (1720 – 1793),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1903|title=English Literature: From Milton to Johnson|chapter="Gilbert White"|location=London|publisher=William Heinemann|pages=375–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA375}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789).

[[William Bartram]] (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.

==Pioneers==
Gilbert White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. pp. 97-112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]: "Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt; White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'', as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]].

The tradition of [[Parson-naturalist|clerical naturalists]] predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).

William Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'', published in 1791. [[Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] (1785 – 1851), [[Charles Darwin]]( (1809 – 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1906|title=English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson|chapter=CHARLES DARWIN|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co|pages=298–302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Jefferies]] (1848 – 1887), [[Susan Fenimore Cooper]] (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803 – 1882) [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[M. Krishnan]], and [[Edward Abbey]] (although he rejected the term for himself).

Another important early work is ''[[A History of British Birds]]''  by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804.  The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield/|title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield - British Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Europe==
Some important contemporary figures in Britain include [[Richard Mabey]], [[Roger Deakin]], [[Mark Cocker]], and [[Oliver Rackham]]. Rackham's books included ''Ancient Woodland'' (1980) and ''The History of the Countryside'' (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include [[Birds Britannica]] (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and ''Crow Country'' (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book ''Waterlog'' was published.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/08/archive-environmentalist-roger-deakin-university?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Archives of environmentalist Roger Deakin given to university|date= 8 May 2010|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the short story ''[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]'' by [[John Cheever]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently made into [[The Swimmer (1968 film)|a film]] starring [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;/ref&gt; it describes his experiences of '[[Open water swimming|wild swimming]]' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates [[Freedom to roam|open access]] to the countryside and waterways.  Deakin's book ''Wildwood'' appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.

In 2017 the German book publishing company [[Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin]] started to grant the [[Deutscher Preis für Nature Writing|German Award for Nature Writing]], an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an [[artist in residency]] grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island [[Vilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-preis_fuer_nature_writing_2018.1492164.html |title= Preis für Nature Writing 2018: Sabine Scho und Christian Lehnert ausgezeichnet |date=2018-07-13 |website=boersenblatt.net |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Council]] in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishcouncil.de/uk-germany-2018/writers-nature-stipendium |title=Writers by Nature: Stipendium |date=2018 |website=britishcouncil.de |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Geography greatly affected the events and outcomes of [[World War I]]''. As [[World War I]] was one of the first true global conflicts, it was shaped by the influence of multiple nations and each country's unique problems. Other factors helped shape the war and changed the course of fighting. With the rise of [[imperialism]] and a desire for resources, the war involved almost all European nations, and was therefore fought on several fronts. Geographic barriers created diversions and weather patterns helped in leading the Allies to victory. Also, the new spread of technology along with trench warfare and disease eventually led to the defeat of [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Peter N., Michael Adas, and Stuart B. Schwartz. World Civilizations, The Global Experience. 5th. Longman, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Imperialism]] before World War I had been on the rise since the mid-nineteenth century because [[industrialization]] had caused a growing need for natural resources. Regions like Africa and India had been settled by European countries in order to make profit and extend power.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ethel. AP World History, An Essential Coursebook. Reading, Pennsylvania: Woodyard, 2008. 466-495. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions began to rise as nations formed alliances with one another to improve their strength. Due to geographical closeness, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy came together as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and later became the [[Central powers]] due to their central positioning in Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} France and Britain became allies along with Russia in order to defend their borders and support each other in case of war. Conflicts in the Balkans grew steadily, and after the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], alliances drew almost all European nations and colonies into what would become known as World War I.

==The Fronts== 
Due to the geographical positioning of the [[Triple Entente]], the Central Powers were faced on all sides by their enemies. Once Italy had joined in on the side of the Allies, the war became a three front war. The big Western front was in France, and Italian Front in the mountains of Italy, and the Eastern Front was on the border of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"McMURRY,FRANK M. ." THE Geography of The Great War. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 Jan 2012.&lt;http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/TheGeographyOfTheGreatWar/&lt;/ref&gt; Because Germany and Austria-Hungary had to split their armies, they were severely weakened.  While the Schlieffen Plan intended for Germany to send ninety percent of their army to France and quickly overtake it then move to Russia, they were held up by fierce fighting at the [[First Battle of the Marne]].&lt;ref&gt;Spartacus Educational, . "Schlieffen Plan." n. page. Web. 2 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWschlieffenP.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battles== 
Throughout major battles in the war, geography influenced the method of fighting and often the victor. At Ypres, many men died by drowning in thick, liquid mud and fighting conditions were awful&lt;ref&gt;"Major Battles of World War I." Ypres. Web. 2 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://home.zonnet.nl/rene.brouwer/majorbattles.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gallipoli Campaign]] involved the death of many Australian Allied soldiers because of the positioning of the peninsula. The Ottoman soldiers were able to position themselves at the top of a hill while all of the Allied soldiers remained at the bottom. In order to defeat the Central Powers, they had to get to the top of the hill without getting shot. Very few men ever made it up the hill, and if they did, they were shot shortly after. The Gallipoli Campaign was a defeating loss of the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Garry. Under the Cover of Darkness Interview. Print. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com/src/detail?vid=6&amp;hid=15&amp;sid=6aa38f11-af19-452f-81b2-effd72396253@sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLGN1c3R1aWQmY3VzdGlkPXM4NDU1ODYxJnNpdGU9c3JjLWxpdmU=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic Barriers== 
Fighting on the Italian Front involved the Swiss Alps and other mountains. Rivers, such as the [[Isonzo]] were fought over, to gain access to supplies and resources. The domination of seas was important because naval fighting was also a true sign of power. The vastness of Russia made it difficult for the Germans to reach, and once they dropped out of the war their front was simply used to catch the Central Powers on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Peter N., Michael Adas, and Stuart B. Schwartz. World Civilizations, The Global Experience. 5th. Long man, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weather== 
Brutal winters diminished supplies and left both sides cold, starving, and wet. Lack of shoes and good clothes caused vulnerability and the spread of disease. Rain, snow, heat, and cold all played their role in World War One because of the giant amount of areas the war was fought in.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ethel. AP World History, An Essential Coursebook. Reading, Pennsylvania: Woodyard, 2008. 466-495. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfer of Knowledge== 
The Atlantic Ocean was home to submarines, naval ships, and also the transfer of goods. Domination on the seas was necessary for getting supplies, people, and weapons from place to place. With new technology, ideas were able to spread quickly and new warfare was created by both sides such as poison gas. Communication also played a role in getting the United States to join the war. The interception of the [[Zimmermann Telegraph]] as well as the sinking of the [[Lusitania]] both helped persuade the U.S.A. in joining the war.&lt;ref&gt;"Tunnelling." Spartacus Educational. n.d. n. page. Web. 2 Jan. 2012.&lt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWtunnelling.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Trenches==
Trench Warfare was common during WWI, although it was not exactly the healthiest or morale-boosting experience for soldiers living in the trenches. They were constantly wet and water would often build up to several inches. Urine, body odor, poison gas, bad food, rats, little clothing, and misery all defined the trench lifestyle. Diseases such as [[Trench Foot]] emerged and close quarters caused infection to be passed from one person to another and from rats and bugs to humans as well. Loud bombs could often cause deafness and long periods in the trench often led to mental illness as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Stories from the Trenches" https://www.loc.gov/vets/stories/wwi-trenches.html#stories&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome and Effects== 
The geography of World War One helped it to play out the way it did. The brutal conditions, geographic landmarks, and outbreaks of disease as well as location helped in bringing the defeat of the Central Powers. After the war at the Treaty of Versailles, Austria-Hungary was broken up into two separate countries, and much of the German landspace was given away to France, Poland, and others. This angered Germany and set up tensions for another war of the worlds.&lt;ref&gt;"The Great War- Effects." Silva Pages. n.d. n. page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11456">The '''Roman-Delmatae Wars''' were a series of conflicts between the Dalmatae federation and the Romans. After the fall of the Ardiaei kingdom in southern Illyria, the Delmatae were to pose the greatest force against the Romans in their conquest of Illyria.

The first confrontation in 156 BC – 155 BC finished with the destruction of the Delmatae capital [[Delminium]] by the consul Scipio Nasica. The second war was fought in 118 BC, after the fall of the kingdom of [[Gentius]] in the south, apparently ending in a Roman victory as the consul L. Caecilius Metellus celebrated a triumph in 117 BC and assumed his surname Delmaticus. The third conflict occurred between 78 BC - 76 BC and finished with the capture of the Dalmatae stronghold, Salona (port Solin near modern city [[Split, Croatia|Split]]) by the proconsul C. Cosconius.

During the Roman Civil war of 49 BC - 44 BC, the Delmatae sided with Pompey and continuously fought against and gained victories over the Caesarian generals Gabinius, Balbius and Vatinius. The fourth and final conflict occurred during Octavian's expedition to Illyricum in 34 BC because of their iterative revolts. The two Delmatae commanders, Verzo and Testimus, surrendered and Octavian's campaign finished with the capture of the new Delmatae capital- Setovia (now Klis). The last revolts of the Delmatae, under their federal leader Baton, against the Romans were in AD 6-9 during the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]], which failed and resulted in the final pacification of bellicose Delmatae.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Stipqevic , Illyrians&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==

===Delmatae federation===
The Delmatae had once been subject to [[Pleuratus III]] but had broken away on the accession of [[Gentius]] in 181 BC, when they proceeded to attack neighboring peoples, forcing them to pay tribute in cattle and corn. In 158 BC, the Greek city of [[Issa (polis)|Issa]] complained to her Roman ally that the Delmatae were molesting their mainland settlements of Tragurium and Epetium; similar complaints were received from the Illyrian Daorsi, neighbors of the Delmatae on the south.

===Roman response===
A Roman ex-consul, C. Fannius Strabo, was sent to investigate and report on affairs in [[Illyria]] and in particular on the activities of the Delmatae. The embassy reported that the latter had not only refused them a hearing but made no provision for their accommodation and even stole the horses they had borrowed for the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius (32.13)&lt;/ref&gt; In fear of their safety, they had departed as discreetly as possible. The Senate was indignant, but [[Polybius]] reports that the decision to send an expedition across the [[Adriatic]] was a matter of considered policy. Illyria had been neglected since the defeat of [[Demetrius of Pharos]] in 219 BC and it was high time the Illyrians were reminded of Roman authority. Moreover, the Senate felt that as 12 years of peace had elapsed since the war against [[Perseus]] of Macedon, it was time to rekindle the military ardor of the Romans. These were the true causes of the war, but for public consumption it was the insult to the Roman ambassadors. This was not to be the only occasion a Roman army was sent across the Adriatic for battle practices,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes- Illyrians pg.189&lt;/ref&gt; although other versions suggest that this may not be the whole story.

==Expeditions==

===Siege of Delminium (156/5 BC)===
The expedition of 156 BC, which was led by the consul C. Marcius Figulus, landed in [[Narona]]. Figulus was caught off guard while pitching camp and driven back to the river Narenta, having perhaps advanced from the territory of the [[Daorsi]]. Next, the Romans marched via the Trebizat valley to [[Delminium]], where the main Delmatae army was stationed. The capital was well fortified and protected and thus the Romans failed to catch the Illyrians unawares and could only set up a blockade before winter set in, though some lesser strongholds were taken. In 155 BC, the consul P. Cornelius Scipio forced a surrender after fierce confrontations. The fortifications were destroyed, the place was turned into a sheep-pasture and the consul returned home to celebrate his triumph over the Delmatae.&lt;ref&gt;Appian Illyrike 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 7.5,5 (Delminium)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaninovic 1961-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triumph of L. Caecilius Metellus (118 BC)===
Nearly forty years passed before the next Roman attack on the Dematae, but the motives according to [[Appian]], were no less dubious. In 118 BC, the consul of the previous year, L. Caecilius Metellus, led an expedition against the Delmatae for which he was awarded the title 'Delmaticus'. War was declared not because the Delmatae had done anything wrong but merely in order to procure another triumph for the Metelli family. In the event, the Illyrians received him as a friend and he wintered among them in the town of [[Salona]], following which he returned to [[Rome]] and was awarded a triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Appian Illyrike 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of Salona (78-76 BC)===
The next campaign was altogether a more serious business, although little is known of it except that the proconsul C. Cosconius overcame most of the Delmatae in a two year campaign between 78 and 76 BC, which concluded with the capture of Salona.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delmatae offensive (50-42 BC)===
From 58 to 50 BC, the Delmatae were in the charge of [[Julius Caesar]], proconsul of [[Gaul]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], though the commander was able to give little attention to his Adriatic responsibilities. During the subsequent civil war between Caesar and [[Pompey]], the Delmatae supported the latter, in opposition to the communities of Roman settlers at Salona, Narona and elsewhere, who remained loyal to the party of Caesar. In 50 BC, the Delmatae army attacked the [[Liburnians]] for the possession of the city of Promona. The Liburnians, who were unable to resist the force of the Delmatae, called on Caesar for help. The Romans immediately sent an army, which was crushed by the Delmatae. Late in 48 BC, the Delmatae ambushed a Caesarian army of 15 infantry cohorts and 3,000 cavalry under the ex-consul A. Gabinius at Synodion, probably somewhere in the Cikola valley. Five cohorts were overwhelmed and their standards captured. The Roman army was nearly annihilated but Gabinius reached Salona. However, he was so short of supplies that he had to plunder them from the Delmatae, leading to further losses. Gabinius soon died in Salona. Roman proconsuls continued to engage the Delmatae after Caesar's victory over Pompey. In 45-44 BC, P. Vatinius wrote from Narona more than once to [[Cicero]] pleading for help to secure his triumphs. He complained that there were not merely 20 'oppida' (Delmatae settlements) as was generally believed but nearer 60. On 31 July 42 BC, Vatinius finally obtained his triumph over some fortifications but not over the whole federation. In 44 BC, the senator Balbius attacked the federation with five cohorts. The Delmatae were victorious and Balbius himself was killed in action. The Delmatae went on the offensive and retook Salona&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1971 (Metellus)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrender of Testimus (33 BC)===
[[File:S0484.4.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|[[Octavian]]'s campaigns led to the surrender of Verzo and Testimus]]
After eliminating the destructive power of Sex. Pompeius in [[Sicily]] in 36 BC, [[Octavian]] devoted the following years to operations in Illyria, first in 35 BC against the Japodes and [[Pannonians]], then, in 34-33 BC, against the Delmatae. Not only had they remained in arms after the departure of Vatinius ten years before, but the Illyrians still held the five Roman standards seized from Gabinius' army in 48 BC. Octavian's army first moved against Promona, where the Delmatae leader Verzo had stationed most of his army of 12,000 men in order to ambush the Roman army on the march. Reaching Promona, Octavian first took the surrounding hills and then proceeded to attack the city. Testimus, the other Delmatae commander, was cut off by the Romans on his route to aid Verzo. After some fighting, Promona was taken, Verzo killed and the Delmatae ordered to disperse by his successor Testimus, while the Romans attacked his strongholds. Tetsimus's guerrilla warfare tactics did not deter Octavian from capturing Synodium and Andetrium. Afterwards, the army advanced up the Cikola valley. Testimus poured all his troops in the city of Setovia.&lt;ref&gt;Mirkovic 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In the Battle of Setovia (probably the Sutina gorge), Octavian was wounded and left the scene, handing over command to Statilius Taurus, who organised a winter blockade that brought some of the Delmatae to capitulate. Early in 33 BC, Octavian returned to receive the surrender, along with the standards of Gabinius, some booty, 700 young males and a promise to pay the arrears of tribute unpaid since Caesar's time. Though other Illyrian peoples were involved in the surrender, it was the victory over the Delmatae that justified one of the three triumphs celebrated by Octavian, on 13 August 29 BC. In 12 BC, the Delmatae revolted, capturing Salona; but this was soon retaken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitthenner 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Illyrian Revolt (AD 6-9)===
{{Main|Great Illyrian Revolt}}
The Delmatae joined the Illyrian alliance in AD 6 in one last revolt against the Romans. The rising began among the Daesitiates of central Bosnia under their leader [[Bato I]] but were soon joined by the Breuci and numerous other Illyrians. The four year war, which lasted from AD 6 to 9, saw huge concentrations of Roman forces in the area, (on one occasion 10 legions and their auxiliaries in a single camp), with whole armies operating across the western [[Balkans]] and fighting on more than one front.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians'', 1992, p. 183, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}. ''...Pannonian Illyrians between Italy and the East. That could only be done at a great cost and not before a rebellion of Illyricum brought the regime of Augustus to the brink of disaster.''&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August AD 8, the Breuci of the [[Sava]] valley surrendered, but it took another winter blockade and a season of fighting before the surrender of the Daesiates came in AD 9. It took the Romans three years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]] as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the [[Punic Wars]] two centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] LV.29-34; [[Suetonius]] ''Tiberius'' 16, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By AD 9, the name of the Delmatae had begun to be applied to area between the Adriatic and the Sava valley, as the Roman province Dalmatia was established.

'''Ruakuri Cave''' is the longest cave in the [[Waitomo]] area of New Zealand. It was first discovered by local Māori between 400 and 500 years ago. The name Ruakuri, or "den of dogs" was created when wild dogs were discovered making their home in the cave entrance some 300 years later. &lt;ref name="Ruakuri Cave Tours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/attractions/adventure/caving-and-canyoning/waikato/ruakuri-cave|title=Ruakuri Cave Tours |publisher=New Zealand Tourism Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave entrance was used by the [[Māori people|Maori]] as an ''urupa'' or [[burial site]]. It is this sacred area that has now been protected with the construction of the impressive spiral drum entrance some distance away.

Ruakuri is the only wheelchair-accessible cave in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It is well known for its spiritual links to Māori and its unusual [[limestone]] formations and caverns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.waitomo-caves.com/about-waitomo-caves/Waitomo-caves-history/|title=Waitomo Caves History|publisher=ICG (NZ) Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major features of the Ruakuri Cave include Holdens Cavern (named after James Holden who first opened the cave to the public), The Drum Passage, The Pretties and The Ghost Passage.

The cave was open to the public from 1904 until 1988, when it was closed due to a legal and financial dispute. It was reopened in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0507/S00330.htm|title=Prime Minister to re-open spectacular Ruakuri Cave|date=26 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside there is a dynamic natural environment, with [[glowworm]]s, limestone formations, underground rivers, and hidden waterfalls.

== Guided tours ==
The [[guided tour]] through the Ruakuri Cave starts down a long spiral ramp to the bottom of the cave. This leads to a room full of [[stalactites]], and rare limestone formations that have been created over millions of years. Some of which are covered with a kind of coral (known locally as "popcorn"). There are also underground rivers and waterfalls. The waterfall is only around one and a half metres deep, but it sounds much louder underground.

Also in the cave are fossils, a remnant from the time when the area was beneath the sea. There are still living creatures in the cave such as: the glowworms for which the [[Waitomo Caves]] are famous. The walls of the glowworm caves were covered with pinpricks of light, giving the effect of a starry night.

The glowworms are the larvae of fungus gnats, but they spend most of their lives in the larval state. Amazingly they manage to find food – insects that fly into the cave, or occasionally they just eat one another! Surrounded by life and light, in a place that should be dark and dead, is the reason the Maori thought that there was something special about this place.&lt;ref name="Ruakuri Cave Tours" /&gt;

{{Three worlds}}
The '''Second World''' is a term that was used during the [[Cold War]] to refer to the [[Developed country|industrial]] [[socialist state]]s that were under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the first two decades following [[World War II]], 19 [[communist state]]s emerged; all of these were at least originally within the Soviet orbit, though some (notably, [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Peoples Republic of China]]) broke with [[Moscow]] and developed their own foreign policy, while retaining Communist governments.  But most communist states remained part of this bloc until the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991; afterwards, only five [[Communist state]]s remained: [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]]. Along with "[[First World]]" and "[[Third World]]", the term was used to divide the [[State (polity)|states]] of [[Earth]] into three broad categories.

The concept of "Second World" was a construct of the [[Cold War]] and the term is still largely  used to describe former communist countries that are between poverty and prosperity, many of which are now [[capitalist state]]s. Subsequently the actual meaning of the terms "First World", "Second World" and "Third World" changed from being based on political ideology to an economic definition.&lt;ref name="AndersenTaylor2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L. Andersen|author2=Howard Francis Taylor|title=Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA250|year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|isbn=978-0-534-61716-5|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-world theory has been criticized as crude and relatively outdated for its nominal ordering (1; 2; 3) and sociologists have instead used the words "developed", "developing", and "underdeveloped" as replacement terms for global stratification (which in turn have been criticized as displaying a colonialist mindset) &lt;ref&gt;Silver, Marc.

The '''Seventeen Provinces''' were the [[Imperial state]]s of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in the 16th century. They roughly covered the [[Low Countries]], i.e. what is now the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and most of the [[France|French]] [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] ([[French Flanders]] and [[French Hainaut]]) and [[Pas-de-Calais]] ([[Artois]]). Also within this area were semi-independent fiefdoms, mainly ecclesiastical ones, such as [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Liège]], [[Cambrai]] and [[Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy|Stavelot-Malmedy]].

The Seventeen Provinces arose from the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], a number of fiefs held by the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and inherited by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]] in 1482, from 1556 held by [[Habsburg Spain]]. Starting in 1512 the Provinces formed the major part of the [[Burgundian Circle]]. In 1581 the Seven United Provinces seceded to form the [[Dutch Republic]].

== Composition ==
After the Habsburg emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] had re-acquired the Duchy of [[Guelders]] from Duke [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] by the 1543 [[Italian War of 1542–1546|Treaty of Venlo]], the Seventeen Provinces comprised:
[[File:Map Burgundian Netherlands 1477-en.png|thumb|280px|Map of the Low Countries in 1477]]
#the [[County of Artois]]
#the [[County of Flanders]], including the [[Burgrave|burgraviates]] of [[Lille]], [[Douai]], [[Orchies]], the [[Tournai and the Tournaisis|Lordship of Tournai and the Tournaisis]]
#the [[Lordship of Mechelen]]
#the [[County of Namur]]
#the [[County of Hainaut]]
#the [[County of Zeeland]]
#the [[County of Holland]]
#the [[Duchy of Brabant]], including the [[Breda|Lordship of Breda]], the [[Margraviate of Antwerp]], the counties of [[Leuven]] and of [[Brussels]], and the advocacy of the Abbey of [[Nivelles]] and of [[Gembloux]]
#the [[Duchy of Limburg]] and the "Overmaas" lands of Brabant ([[Dalhem]], [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]] and [[Herzogenrath]])
#the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]
#the [[Lordship of Utrecht|Prince-Bishopric, later Lordship of Utrecht]]
#the [[Lordship of Frisia]]
#the [[Duchy of Guelders]]
#the [[Lordship of Groningen]] (including the [[Ommelanden]])
#the [[Lordship of Drenthe]], [[Lingen]], [[Wedde]], and [[Westerwolde (region)|Westerwolde]]
#the [[Lordship of Overijssel]]
#the [[County of Zutphen]]
It was not always the same seventeen provinces represented at the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands]]. Sometimes one delegation was included in another.

In later years the County of Zutphen became a part of the [[Duchy of Guelders]], and the Duchy of Limburg was dependent on the Duchy of Brabant. The Lordship of Drenthe is sometimes considered as part of the [[Lordship of Overijssel]].  On the other hand, the French-speaking cities of Flanders were sometimes recognised as a separate province.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, in some lists Zutphen and Drenthe are replaced by 
*[[Burgrave|burgraviates]] of [[Lille]], [[Douai]], [[Orchies]] (also called [[Walloon Flanders]])
*[[Tournai and the Tournaisis]]

There were a number of [[fiefdom]]s in the Low Countries that were not part of the Seventeen Provinces, mainly because they did not belong to the [[Burgundian Circle]] but to the [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]. The largest of these was the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], the green area on the map, including the [[County of Horne]]. The ethnically and culturally Netherlandish duchies of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] and [[Duchy of Jülich|Julich]] did not join either. In the north, there were also a few smaller entities like the island of [[Ameland]] that would retain their own lords until the [[French Revolution]].

Historians came up with different variations of the list, but always with 17 members. This number could have been chosen because of its Christian connotation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leidenuniv.nl/en/researcharchive/index.php3-c=297.htm ''The Invention of the Dutchman: the Dynamics of Identity in the Low Countries, 1400-1600; international colloquium, 2007'' Leiden University&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{History of the Low Countries}}
The Seventeen Provinces originated from the [[Burgundian Netherlands]].  The [[Duke of Burgundy|dukes of Burgundy]] systematically became the lord of different provinces. [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary I of Valois, Duchess of Burgundy]] was the last of the [[House of Burgundy]].

Mary married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1477, and the provinces were acquired by the [[House of Habsburg]] on her death in 1482, with the exception of the Duchy of Burgundy itself, which, with an appeal to [[Salic law]], had been reabsorbed into France upon the death of Mary's father, [[Charles the Bold]].  Maximilian and Mary's grandson, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain]], eventually united all 17 provinces under his rule, the last one being the [[Duchy of Guelders]], in 1543.

Most of these provinces were fiefs of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Two provinces, the County of Flanders and County of Artois, were originally French fiefs, but sovereignty was ceded to the Empire in the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] in 1529.

The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] determined that the Provinces should remain united in the future and inherited by the same monarch.  Therefore, Charles V introduced the title of ''Heer der Nederlanden'' ("Lord of the Netherlands").  Only he and his son could ever use this title.

After Charles V's abdication in 1555, his realms were divided between his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II of Habsburg, King of Spain]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].  The Seventeen Provinces went to his son, the King of Spain.

Conflicts between Philip II and his Dutch subjects led to the [[Eighty Years' War]], which started in 1568.  The seven northern provinces gained their independence as a republic called the [[Dutch Republic|Seven United Provinces]]. They were:

*the Lordship of Groningen and of the Ommelanden
*the Lordship of Friesland
*the Lordship of Overijssel
*the Duchy of Guelders (except its [[Upper Guelders|upper quarter]]) and the County of Zutphen
*the Prince-Bishopric, later Lordship of Utrecht
*the County of Holland
*the County of Zeeland

The southern provinces, Flanders, Brabant, Namur, Hainaut, Luxembourg and the others, were restored to Spanish rule due to the military and political talent of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]], especially at the [[Siege of Antwerp (1584–1585)|Siege of Antwerp (1584&amp;ndash;1585)]]. Hence, these provinces became known as the ''Spanish Netherlands'' or [[Southern Netherlands]].

The northern Seven United Provinces kept parts of Limburg, Brabant, and Flanders during the [[Eighty Years' War]] (see [[Generality Lands]]), which ended with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648.

Artois and parts of Flanders and Hainaut ([[French Flanders]] and [[French Hainaut]]) were ceded to France in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries.

==Economy==
By the mid-16th century, the Margraviate of Antwerp (Duchy of Brabant) had become the economic, political, and cultural center of the Netherlands after its capital had shifted from the nearby Lordship of Mechelen to the city of [[Brussels]].

[[Bruges]] (County of Flanders) had already lost its prominent position as economic powerhouse of northern Europe.  And Holland was gradually gaining importance in the 15th and 16th centuries.

However, after the [[Dutch revolt|revolt]] of the seven [[Dutch Republic|northern provinces]] (1568), the [[Sack of Antwerp]] (1576), the [[Fall of Antwerp]] (1584-1585), and the resulting closure of the [[Scheldt]] river to navigation, a large number of people from the southern provinces emigrated north to the new republic. The center of prosperity moved from cities in the south such as [[Bruges]], [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], and [[Brussels]] to cities in the north, mostly Holland, including [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], and [[Rotterdam]].

==Netherlands==
{{main|Netherlands (terminology)}}
[[Image:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]] map]]
To distinguish between the older and larger Low Countries of the Netherlands from the current country of the Netherlands, Dutch speakers usually drop the plural for the latter.  They speak of ''Nederland'' in singular for the current country and of ''de Nederlanden'' in plural for the integral domains of Charles V.

In other languages, this has not been adopted, though the larger area is sometimes known as the [[Low Countries]] in English.

The fact that the term ''Netherlands'' has such different historical meanings can sometimes lead to difficulties in expressing oneself correctly. For example, [[composer]]s from the 16th century are often said to belong to the ''[[Franco-Flemish School|Dutch School]]'' (''Nederlandse School''). Although they themselves would not have objected to that term at that time, today it may wrongly create the impression that they were from the current Netherlands. In fact, they were almost exclusively from current Belgium.

== Flanders ==
The same confusion exists around the word ''Flanders''. Historically, it applied to the County of Flanders, corresponding roughly with the present day provinces of [[West Flanders]] and [[East Flanders]]. But when the Dutch-speaking population of Belgium sought more rights in the 19th century, the word ''Flanders'' was reused, but now to indicate the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, which is larger, and contains only part of the old county of Flanders (see [[Flemish Movement]]).&lt;br&gt;So the territory of the County of Flanders and present-day Flanders do not fully match:
*[[French Flanders]] belonged to the County of Flanders, but is today part of France.
*[[Zeelandic Flanders]] belonged to the County of Flanders, but is today part of the Netherlands.
*[[Tournai and the Tournaisis]] was some period considered as part of the County of Flanders, but is today part of Wallonia.
* The [[Flemish Brabant|present-day Belgian province of Flemish Brabant]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]].
* The [[Antwerp (province)|present-day Belgian province of Antwerp]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]].
* The [[Limburg (Belgium)|present-day Belgian province of Limburg]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].

This explains for instance why the province of [[East Flanders]] is not situated in the east of present-day Flanders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9023">[[Ivory Coast]] (Côte d'Ivoire) is a relatively decentralised state. The country divided into 14 [[Districts of Ivory Coast|districts]], of which two are cities organised as autonomous districts. The 12 non-autonomous districts are subdivided into 31 second-level [[Regions of Ivory Coast|regions]]. The autonomous districts and the regions are divided into 108 third-level [[Departments of Ivory Coast|departments]]. The departments are divided into 510 fourth-level [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]]. Sub-prefectures contain villages and, in some instances, several villages are combined into fifth-level [[Communes of Ivory Coast|communes]]. There are 197 communes.

==History==
Independent Ivory Coast was first divided into administrative subdivisions in 1961, when four [[departments of Ivory Coast|departments]] were created.&lt;ref&gt;At independence in 1960, Ivory Coast was informally divided into 19 traditional ''cercles'', but the cercles were not official administrative subdivisions.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, two additional departments were created, and in 1969, the six departments were reorganised into 24. Over the years, the departments continued to divide as the population grew until there were 50 by 1995.

In 1997, a comprehensive system of multiple administrative levels was created for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1980s, ten regions were set up as regional groupings for census purposes, but these "regions" were not administrative subdivisions of the country and existed only for statistical purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]] were created as new first-level subdivisions; each region contained two or more departments, which became the second-level administrative subdivisions.  In 2000, three more regions were created.

By 2011, there were 90 second-level departments within the 19 first-level regions of Ivory Coast.

In 1978, 28 [[communes of Ivory Coast|communes]] had been created, and many more were created in the years following. However, the communes were not organised as a systematic administrative level covering all portions of the country until 1997, when they became the national third-level subdivisions. By 2011, the departments were divided into over 1300 communes.

===2011 decentralisation reorganisation===
In 2011, Ivory Coast instituted a reorganisation of its subdivisions with the goal of further decentralising the state.&lt;ref name = abidjannet&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/412022.html "Décentralisation : Le gouvernement créé 12 districts et 30 régions"], abidjan.net, 29 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately prior to the reorganisation, the country was divided into 19 first-level regions, 90 second-level departments, and more than 1300 third-level communes.

The reorganisation was implemented in September 2011.&lt;ref name = abidjannet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pndap-ci.org/pdf/decret_districts.pdf Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions].&lt;/ref&gt; First, 14 districts were created, which replaced regions as the first-level subdivision of the country. Some of the new districts had the same boundaries and names as some of the old regions, but overall the number of first-level subdivisions was decreased from 19 to 14. Second, the number of regions was increased to 30, and they were converted into second-level subdivisions. Third, the departments were reorganised, with the number being increased from 90 to 95; they were converted into third-level subdivisions. Fourth, 498 sub-prefectures were created as new fourth-level subdivisions. The more than 1300 communes were retained, but they were converted from third-level subdivisions into fifth-level subdivisions. In March 2012, the number of communes was drastically reduced to 197 on the grounds that in many cases, they were now an economically unfeasible level of government. As was the case prior to 1997, today not all areas of the country are divided into communes.

Since the 2011 reorganisation, one additional region has been created, bringing the total to 31.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/436675.html "Council of Ministers on Wednesday, July 4, 2012: New administrative entities created"], abidjan.net, 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depse.ci/telecharger-fichier-joint/15 Décret n° 2012-612 du 04 juillet 2012 portant création de la Région du Moronou].&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen more departments have been created, bringing the total to 108. Twelve new sub-prefectures have been created, bringing the total to 510. The number of communes remains 197.

The two autonomous districts are not subdivided into regions, but they do contain departments, sub-prefectures, and communes.

[[Image:Map North America 1566.jpg|thumb|Map of North America from 1566 showing [[Italian language|Italian]] inscriptions, both ''Terra In Cognita'' and ''Mare In Cognito'']]

'''''Terra incognita''''' or '''''terra ignota''''' ([[Latin]] "unknown land"; ''incognita'' is stressed on its second [[syllable]] in Latin, but with variation in pronunciation in English) is a term used in [[cartography]] for regions that have not been mapped or documented. The expression is believed to be first seen in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' c. 150.  The term was reintroduced in the 15th century from the rediscovery of Ptolemy's work during the [[Age of Discovery]].  The equivalent on [[French language|French]] [[map]]s would be '''''terres inconnues''''' (plural form), and some [[English language|English]] maps may show ''Parts Unknown''.

Similarly, uncharted or unknown seas would be labeled '''''mare incognitum''''', Latin for "unknown sea".

== Details ==

An [[urban legend]] claims that [[cartographer]]s labelled such regions with "[[Here be dragons]]". Although cartographers did claim that fantastic beasts (including large serpents) existed in remote corners of the world and depicted such as decoration on their maps, only one known surviving map, the ''[[Lenox Globe]]'', in the collection of the [[New York Public Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/williams/williams/@Generic__BookTextView/24166;td=2;nn=1;pt=24166
|title=Guide to the Research Collections, Resources Elsewhere in the Collections
|pages=207–208
|publisher=New York Public Library
|accessdate=2006-08-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
actually says "Here are dragons" (using the [[Latin]] form "HIC SVNT DRACONES").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html
|title=Here Be Dragons on Old Maps
|publisher=MapHist
|accessdate=2006-08-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers did use the phrase ''[[Hic sunt leones|HIC SVNT LEONES]]'' (''Here are lions'') when denoting unknown territories on maps.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Alternatively, 'terra incognita' may also refer to the hypothesized continent [[Terra Australis Incognita]] ("The unknown land of the South"), as seen in the [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]] map by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1570).

During the 19th century ''terra incognita'' disappeared from maps of the earth, since both the coastlines and the inner parts of the continents had been fully explored.
But the bottoms of the seas remain mostly un-mapped, as do many other land surfaces in the solar system.

The phrase is now also used [[metaphor]]ically by various researchers to describe any unexplored subject or field of research.

==Etymology==
* ''Terra'': Latin for 'earth' or 'land'. Related English words include ''[[terrestrial (disambiguation)|terrestrial]]'', ''[[territory (disambiguation)|territory]]'' and ''[[terrain]]''.
* ''Incognita'': from Latin ''cognoscere'' 'to know, be acquainted with' (negated by the prefix 'in-'), which is related to English ''know'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] γνῶσις ''[[gnosis]]'' 'knowledge'. Related English words include ''[[agnostic]]'', ''[[cognition]]'', ''[[gnosticism]]''.

'''Vincent Hayes Gaddis''' (December 28, 1913 – February 26, 1997) was an American author who invented the phrase "[[Bermuda Triangle]]", which he used first in the cover article for the 1964 February issue of the magazine [[Argosy (magazine)|''Argosy'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent H. Gaddis|title=The Deadly Bermuda Triangle|url=http://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/vincentgaddis.txt|publisher=Argosy|date= February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Mystery" of the Bermuda Triangle|url=http://www.unmuseum.org/triangle.htm|publisher=The Museum of Unnatural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized many stories about anomalous and [[paranormal]] phenomena in a style similar to that of [[Charles Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Routledge. p. 125. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Gaddis was born in [[Ohio]] to Tilden H. and Alice M. (Smith) Gaddis.  He married Margaret Paine Rea on July 14, 1947.  Gaddis worked as a newspaper reporter and writer-editor for a [[Warsaw, Indiana]], radio station from 1947 to 1952.  He was a feature writer for the ''Elkhart Truth'', a daily newspaper in [[Elkhart, Indiana]], from 1952 to 1959.  He then worked as a public relations writer for [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] and Mercedes Benz Sales in [[South Bend, Indiana]].  In 1962 he became a [[Freelancer|freelance]] writer.  He died in [[Eureka, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Nancy|title=My Life with Paranormal Icon Vincent Gaddis|url=http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/ghosts/NANCYBRADLEY.php|publisher=Haunted America Tours|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Gaddis' statements on the [[Bermuda Triangle]] and [[spontaneous human combustion]] have been criticized by skeptics for being inaccurate and misleading. Gaddis has also drawn strong criticism for ignoring possible natural explanations and inventing mysteries where none exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1996). ''Not-So-Spontaneous Human Combustion''. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. 20.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy P. Harrison|Harrison, Guy P]]. (2012).

''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. Retrieved 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian William K. Powers from [[Livingston College]], [[Rutgers University]] has described Gaddis' ''American Indian Myths and Mysteries'' as an "outrageous and intolerable book" filled with [[crackpot theory|crackpot]] claims and "[[Erich von Däniken|Danikenesque]] delusions".&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William K.

The '''Wild (Heerbrugg)''' company was founded in 1921 in [[Switzerland]]. The company manufactured optical instruments, such as [[surveying]] instruments, [[microscope]]s and instruments for [[photogrammetry]] among others. The company changed its name several times, first being known as "Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik", then "Verkaufs-Aktiengesellschaft Heinrich Wild's Geodätische Instrumente", later "Wild Heerbrugg AG", later "Wild-Leitz". The company was linked with Leica in 1989, then it became part of Leica Holding B.V. Its subsidiary [[Leica Geosystems]] AG became part of the Swedish [[Hexagon AB]] Group of companies in 2005.

==History==
On 26 April 1921 the company '''Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik''' was founded in Heerbrugg by three Swiss personalities: 
* the surveyor and inventor Heinrich Wild from Glarus
* the investor Jacob Schmidheiny from Balgach
* and the geologist Dr. Robert Helbling from Flums.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Braunecker: "Werdegang der industriellen Optikentwicklung in Heerbrugg." Swiss Physical Society, September 2011 [http://www.sps.ch/artikel/physik-anekdoten/werdegang-der-industriellen-optikentwicklung-in-heerbrugg-vom-strahlen-berechnenden-damenkollektiv-zur-auswertung-kollektiver-strahldaten-12/ (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Wild]] (1877–1951), a leading designer of geodetic and astronomical instruments, was born in [[Switzerland]] and began his career as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] to manufacture it, Wild moved to Jena and became head of GEO, the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments. Wild returned to Switzerland after the First World War. In 1921, with the help of Swiss financiers, he established a Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik in Heerbrugg, in the Rhine Valley. As the first major product, Wild developed the [[Theodolite]] Wild T2. Later models were launched when Wild already had left the company, still bearing his name, such as the theodolite WILD Heerbrugg T4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveyequipment.com/wild-heerbrugg-t4-universal-theodolite-used/ "WILD Heerbrugg T4 Universal Theodolite", product description by opti-cal]&lt;/ref&gt; Another important new product engineered by Wild was an [[Aerial photography|aerial camera]], later called "Aviophot" for [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Hildebrand and R. Schlienger: "Scharfer Blick von oben." [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], April 24, 1984, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to Zurich, severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for Kern &amp; Co in [[Aarau]]. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937. It merged with the optical firm of [[Ernst Leitz GmbH]] of Wetzlar in 1987. It also acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed Wild-Leitz AG in 1989. The combined company had about 8000 employees and revenues of approx. one billion Swiss Francs (CHF).&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Heerbrugg und Leitz Wetzlar mit gemeinsamem Namen." New name Wild-Leitz AG from 1989. Neue Zürcher Zeitung, December 28, 1988, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Then, it became part of the Leica holding company in 1990.

Starting from 1996 the company was divided gradually again into smaller units. 
Thus 1996 the [[Leica Camera]] AG developed, in October 1997 the [[Leica Geosystems]] AG and on 1 April 1998 the [[Leica Microsystems]] AG. Leica Geosystems produced—in continuation of Wild Heerbrugg—the geodetic instruments and is the global market leader in this sector as part of the new parent company Hexagon AB.

The brand name "Wild Heerbrugg" is still in use for stereo microscopes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artnov14/rjk-StereomicroscopeWildHeerbrugg.pdf R. Jordan Kreindler: "WILD Stereomicroscopes." Micscape Magazin (UK), November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and precision level measuring such as the WILD Heerbrugg N3 Level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Detectors/Detector_Pool/Equipment_Information/Wild_N3/ "WILD Heerbrugg N3 Level." Argonne National Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Petitot was born in [[Grancey-le-Château-Neuvelle]], France. His father, Jean-Baptiste Petitot, was a [[clockmaker]]; his mother was Thérèse-Julie-Fortunée Gagneur. Petitot attended the minor seminary and the Collège du Sacré-Cœur in Grancey. In 1859, he took minor orders of the priesthood before joining the Oblates in September 1860. His training occurred at [[Notre-Dame-de-l'Osier]], and on March 15, 1862, he was ordained in [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref name="University" /&gt;

Fourteen days after his [[ordination]], he left for Canada's [[Mackenzie River]]. The young missionary Petitot traveled with Bishop [[Alexandre-Antonin Taché]] from Marseilles via Liverpool (where they were joined by another two Oblates, [[Constantine Scollen]] and John Duffy) and Montreal to St Boniface (Winnipeg) arriving there on 26 May 1862. He left St. Boniface with the [[Portage La Loche Brigade]] June 8 arriving at the [[Methye Portage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Petitot| first = Emile  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Enroute pour la mer Glaciale| publisher = Letouzey et Ane | year = 1887 | location = Paris | pages = 203 | url =http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24242593M/En_route_pour_la_mer_Glaciale}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on July 20. By August 1862, he had traveled to [[Great Slave Lake]] in Canada's [[Northwest Territories]] with the [[Hudson's Bay Brigade Trail]].&lt;ref name="University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.radio-canada.ca/radio/profondeur/RemarquablesOublies/petitot.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Emile%2BPetitot%2522%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DRJo%26pwst%3D1|title=The son of the sun |publisher=Radio Premiere Chaine|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Petitot was based at Northwest Territories' missions for 12 years, including [[Tulita, Northwest Territories|Fort Norman]],&lt;ref name="placenamesofalberta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.placenamesofalberta.ca/300_names_definitions/petitot.htm |title=Petitot River |publisher=placenamesofalberta.ca |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215825/http://www.placenamesofalberta.ca/300_names_definitions/petitot.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fort Providence, Northwest Territories|Fort Providence]], [[Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories|Fort Resolution]], and [[Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories|Fort Good Hope]]. Here he collected material for his dictionary of several [[Athabascan languages]].&lt;ref name="Savoie" /&gt; He also collected extensive [[legend]]s of the [[Blackfoot]], [[Chipewyan]], [[Cree]], [[Dogrib]], [[Sahtu people|Hare]], and [[Loucheux]] cultures.

From 1864 through 1878, he worked on the design, decoration, and construction of the [[Church of Our Lady of Good Hope]], designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]].

The late 1860s were troublesome years. In 1866, he was temporarily excommunicated, and in 1868, he developed short bouts of insanity.&lt;ref name="University" /&gt; But in the midst of this, in 1867–68, Petitot became the first European to reach the [[Tuktut Nogait National Park]] area.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nt/tuktutnogait/natcul/natcul2_e.asp|title=Tuktut Nogait National Park of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitot returned to France in 1874 and published his dictionaries and other works. The following year, in 1875, he spoke at the inaugural [[International Congress of Americanists]] in [[Nancy, France]] making a strong case for the Asiatic origin of [[Inuit]] and [[North American Indian]]s. He was awarded a silver medal by the [[Société de Géographie]] for his [[Arctic]] maps, including the partially traveled [[Hornaday River]], though he referred to it as Rivière La Roncière-le Noury,&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=J.K. |date=December 1952|title=Identification of Petitot's Riviere La Ronciere-le Noury|journal=Arctic|publisher=ucalgary.ca|volume=5|issue=4|pages=227|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic5-4-224.pdf|doi=10.14430/arctic3914}}&lt;/ref&gt; named in honor of the president of the Société de Géographie.

After two years in France, Petitot returned to the North, mostly helping and studying the people of the [[Great Slave Lake]] area. In late 1881, at Fort Pitt (Sask) he "married" Margarite (Margarita) Valette, a mature Metis woman. In January 1882 he was forcibly taken east by Fr [[Constantine Scollen]], an Oblate who had traveled with him and Bishop Tache, to Canada, in 1862. He entered an asylum near Montreal.&lt;ref name=Aidanfletcher&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=John S. Moir|title=PETITOT, ÉMILE|work= Dictionary of Canadian Biography|volume= 14|publisher= University of Toronto/Université Laval|date= 1998|accessdate= November 21, 2013|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/petitot_emile_14E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1883, however, his ill health forced him to end his missionary work and return to France. Honoring his scientific contributions, he was awarded the 1883 Back Prize by the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings|publisher=Royal Geographical Society|year=1883|pages=361|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KTEMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=%22back+prize%22+%22royal+geographical+society%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[parish priest]] October 1, 1886 at Mareuil-lès-Meaux, France. Here, he ministered to the sick, and published books and articles on [[Northern Canada]]. He died in 1916.

==Legacy==
* The [[Petitot River]] is named in his honor.
